{"date": "August 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump signs autographs during a campaign rally at the BB&T Center. \n NEW YORK >> When Donald Trump vowed this week to make child care more accessible and affordable, it was just the second time during his White House campaign that he's talked about an issue that affects millions of working Americans with young children. \n The first came months ago in Iowa, when the eventual Republican nominee touted his own record as a business owner during a candidate Q&A, telling voters he provided on-site child-care service for his employees. \n There is no evidence, however, that any such programs exist. \n The billionaire real estate mogul, who previously voiced his opposition to government-funded universal pre-K programs, said in Newton, Iowa, in November 2015 that he had visited many companies that offered workers on-site child-care centers \u2014 and added that he offered such programs himself. \n \"You know, it's not expensive for a company to do it. You need one person or two people, and you need some blocks, and you need some swings and some toys,\" Trump said. \"It's not an expensive thing, and I do it all over. And I get great people because of it. Because it's a problem with a lot of other companies.\" \n Trump pointed specifically to two programs: \"They call 'em Trump Kids. Another one calls it Trumpeteers, if you can believe it. I have 'em. I actually have 'em, because I have a lot of different businesses.\" \n Trump went on to describe \"a room that's a quarter of the size of this. And they have all sorts of \u2014 you know, it's beautiful \u2014 they have a lot of children there, and we take care of them. And the parent when they leave the job \u2014 usually in my case it's clubs or hotels \u2014 when they leave the job, they pick up their child and their child is totally safe.\" \n \"They even come in during the day during lunch to see their child. It really works out well,\" he said. \n But the two programs Trump cited \u2014 \"Trump Kids\" and \"Trumpeteers\" \u2014 are programs catering to patrons of Trump's hotels and golf club. They are not for Trump's employees, according to staff at Trump's hotels and clubs across the country. \n \"Trump Kids\" is described on the Trump Hotel Collection website as \"a special travel program designed to help make your next family vacation a big hit.\" Its offerings include \"kid-friendly amenities like kiddie cocktails, coloring books and no-tear bath amenities.\" \n \"The Trumpeteer Program\" is described on the website of Trump National Golf Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, as \"a program created specifically for our youngest members, ages three to twelve, which offers daily and evening child care, monthly newsletters and weekly events!\" \n When asked about on-site child care, employees at Trump's hotels and clubs across the country expressed confusion and explained the two programs are for guests and members only. \n \"No, there's no child care,\" said Maria Jaramillo, 36, a housekeeper at Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, where workers have been pushing Trump to sign a union contract. \n Jaramillo is a mother of four children who has worked at the hotel for nearly eight years. \n \"It would make it much more easy to take our kids to day care at work,\" she said and laughed when told of Trump's comments from Iowa about child care. \"If they have child care, at least they should tell us.\" \n A collection of Trump employee handbooks makes no mention of child care. The online Trump Hotels \"employee benefits\" section lists health care, tuition reimbursement, paid time off, complimentary golf and an internet caf\u00e9, but no on-site child care services. \n In New York, where the Trump Organization is based, the city's health department database of child care centers has no record of any licensed facilities at any of Trump's properties, aside from a private school that leases space at 40 Wall Street. \n Asked directly whether Trump's businesses offered child care to employees, his presidential campaign responded with a statement from Jill Martin, vice president and assistant general counsel at the Trump Organization. \n \"The Trump Organization is very proud of the family-friendly environment it fosters throughout its portfolio,\" she said. \"The policies and practices allowing employees to enjoy a healthy work-life balance vary from property to property. We take an individualized approach to helping employees manage family and work responsibilities.\" \n The campaign did not respond to follow up questions, or agree to make Martin available for an interview. \n Trump on Monday proposed new tax exemptions for child care as part of what his aides say will be a larger push to make child care more accessible and affordable to working-class families. Child care is a top expense for many families, surpassing the cost of college and even housing in many states. \n \"They're suffering, they're suffering,\" Trump said. \"We're going to get them this much-needed relief.\" \n Trump has credited his embrace of the issue to his daughter Ivanka, who vouched for her father's treatment of his employees at the Republican National Convention last month. \"When a woman becomes a mother, she is supported, not shut out,\" she said. \n The new policy is a departure from Trump's comments on the issue during the GOP primaries. In an interview with Fox News Business in October 2015, Trump expressed skepticism about paid family leave and said he opposed the idea of free pre-K. \n \"Well, I don't like it, because eventually you're going to have to raise everybody's taxes,\" he said. \"There is no such thing as free.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Jill Colvin and Catherine Lucey on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/colvinj and http://twitter.com/catherine\u2014lucey \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "No evidence Trump provided child care services for employees"}

{"date": "August 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave a speech on the economy after touring Futuramic Tool & Engineering, in Warren, Mich. on Thursday. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Hillary and Bill Clinton earned $10.6 million last year, according to a tax filing released by her campaign today that sought to pressure presidential rival Donald Trump to disclose his tax returns. \n The filing shows that the Clintons paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent in 2015. The bulk of their income \u2014 more than $6 million \u2014 came from speaking fees for appearances made largely before Hillary Clinton launched her campaign in April 2015. They gave more than $1 million to charity. \n The Clintons' income puts them well within the ranks of the top 0.1 percent of Americans, though they pay a higher tax rate than many of their elite peers, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation based on 2013 data. \n The release is part of an effort to undercut Trump's character by questioning the celebrity businessman's record. Trump has refused to make his filings public, saying they're under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and that he'll release them only once that review is complete. All major U.S. presidential candidates in modern history have released their returns. \n The Clintons have disclosed returns for every year dating back to 1977, in part due to laws requiring public officials release returns. She put out her most recent eight years of tax filings last summer and several years during her first presidential bid. \n Seeking common ground with blue-collar workers who have been attracted to Trump's message, Clinton frequently mentions Trump's returns as a way of underscoring how his economic plans would benefit his personal interests and questioning whether he's as wealthy as he claims. \n Democrats believe Trump's returns could be treasure trove of politically damaging information. They want to see his tax rate, charitable giving, and business dealings with foreign governments. \n \"Here's a pretty incredible fact: There is a non-zero chance that Donald Trump isn't paying (asterisk)any(asterisk) taxes,\" Clinton tweeted, just minutes after releasing her own returns. \n Protesters at Trump afternoon rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, held up signs reading \"Tax Forms\" before being escorted out by security. \n Clinton's strategy is borrowed from President Barack Obama's winning playbook against Mitt Romney in 2012. Obama repeatedly used Romney's business dealings against him and seized upon the former Massachusetts governor's reluctance to release certain tax records. \n Clinton's campaign also released 10 years of returns from running mate Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton. Over the last decade, the couple has donated 7.5 percent of their income to charity, the campaign said, and paid an effective tax rate of 25.6 percent last year. \n Kaine, the Virginia senator who's spent much of his life in public service, reported a far lower income than the Clintons. Over the past decade, he and his wife earned the most in 2014, more than $314,000 in adjusted gross income. The Clintons made about 90 times more, reporting nearly $28 million for the same year. \n Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, has yet to say if he will release his taxes, which he has not done as governor of Indiana. A spokesman for the governor's office referred all tax-related questions to his vice presidential campaign. The campaign did not respond to messages about whether Pence will release his returns. \n Clinton has tried to paint Trump has an out-of-touch business mogul but her substantial wealth has caused headaches. Republicans have seized upon the millions in speaking fees and a tone-deaf comment by Clinton in a 2014 interview that she was \"dead broke\" after leaving the White House in 2001. The couple owed millions in legal fees, but quickly generated far more from book deals, paid appearances and consulting fees. \n In total, the Clintons earned than $139 million between 2007 and 2014, according to eight years of federal income tax returns released by her campaign last July. \n The bulk of their income came from speeches delivered to corporate and interest groups, which paid Bill Clinton and later Hillary Clinton after she resigned as secretary of state in early 2013. \n Clinton delivered six paid speeches in 2015, including one to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. She commanded her highest rate from EBay, which paid her $315,000 for a March 2015 address in San Jose. \n Bill Clinton's consulting work for GEMS Education, a global network of for-profit schools based in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, earned him more than $5.6 million in fees between 2010 and 2015, according to the Clinton tax returns. \n Bill Clinton also earned more than $17 million over the same period for consulting work for Laureate Education, Inc., another worldwide for-profit education system based in Baltimore that makes most of its profits from overseas operations. Several former students have sued a school operated by the company, alleging fraud. \n Bill Clinton's office last year said he had ended his consulting relationship with Laureate, but no similar statement has been made regarding to GEMS, which stands for Global Education Management Systems. His office did not immediately respond to a question about whether he still has a relationship with GEMS. \n Associated Press writers Eileen Sullivan and Jeff Horwitz contributed to this report from Washington.

{"date": "August 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton waves as she finishes a speech on the economy after touring Futuramic Tool & Engineering, in Warren, Mich. \n WASHINGTON >> Hillary Clinton is seizing opportunities presented by a volatile presidential race to expand her base of support heading into the fall, seeking to position the Democratic Party for a sweeping victory in November. \n As Donald Trump struggles through a second week of self-inflicted stumbles, the Democratic nominee's campaign has started to push into Republican territory by courting some of the party's core supporters and expanding her campaign's operations into traditionally red states. \n \"The map favors us and, in a way, the dynamics right now favor us,\" said Joel Benenson, Clinton's senior strategist. \"The more places you can make them play defense, the better off we are.\" \n Throughout his presidential bid, the Republican nominee has used controversy to draw attention back to his campaign. It's a strategy that initially worried some Clinton aides, who feared he would drown out their candidate's general-election message. \n But with three months to Election Day, Clinton aides say they see more advantages than liabilities as Trump continues to say the politically unimaginable. Critics slammed Trump this week for appearing to suggest that gun-rights supporters could shoot Clinton to prevent her from appointing federal judges as president, and he drew criticism for standing by a false claim that President Barack Obama founded the Islamic State. \n On Thursday, Trump said he would respond to his admitted problems in his campaign by doing \"the same thing I'm doing right now.\" In an interview with CNBC, he said, \"At the end, it's either going to work, or I'm going to, you know, I'm going to have a very, very nice, long vacation.\" \n Democratic strategists have long argued the party could win the White House with Obama's political coalition, the group of minority, young and female voters who twice boosted him to victory. They see the additional support Clinton is finding among independent and Republican voters as frosting on their electoral cake, potentially allowing Democrats to win back control of the Senate and enter the White House with the political momentum that comes from a sweeping victory. \n \"You care very deeply about the 270th electoral vote, but there are also important reasons to care about winning big,\" said Geoff Garin, a pollster for Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign who now advises the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action. \"This is not just about rolling up the score.\" \n Clinton aides say she's taking nothing for granted, noting the U.S. remains a deeply politically divided country. They say they remain singularly focused on the most efficient path to capturing the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the White House. \n Yet Clinton is undoubtedly beginning to cast her gaze beyond the Democratic base. \n \"I am humbled and moved by the Republicans who are willing to stand up and say that Donald Trump doesn't represent their values,\" she said at a rally in Iowa this week. \"We may not agree on everything, but this is not a normal election and I will work hard over the next three months to earn the support of anyone willing to put our country first.\" \n On Wednesday, following two weeks of high-profile Republican defections, her campaign launched an official effort to target GOP voters. They also took baby steps into some traditionally deep red states, telling party officials in Arizona and Georgia they plan to make a six-figure investment in field operations in the two states. \n The next day, Clinton published a column in Salt Lake City's Deseret News titled \"What I have in common with Utah leaders \u2014 religious freedom and the Constitution.\" While the state has not backed a Democrat for president since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, Trump himself acknowledged Thursday he is \"having a tremendous problem in Utah.\" \n Jeremy Bird, who ran field operations for Obama's 2012 campaign and is now consulting for Clinton's operation, said Trump has no one to blame but himself. The unorthodox candidate hasn't aired a single television ad since the end of the primaries and is building a bare-bones effort to get out the vote. \n \"His inability to put anything real on the ground in battleground states is campaign malpractice,\" Bird said. \"There are just so many paths to 270 and so many ways to put their presidential campaign and the Republican Party in a defensive posture, even in states that are not considered battlegrounds.\" \n Some recent polls suggest Clinton could also benefit from Republican-leaning voters deciding to stay home rather than come out to support Trump. Surveys in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio found that 90 percent of Democrats said they intended to support Clinton, while closer to 80 percent of Republicans intended to support Trump. \n Republicans caution the race remains far from settled, especially since voters don't particularly like either candidate. A small group of middle-class mothers interviewed by pollsters Tuesday in Columbus, Ohio, and Phoenix used words such as \"painful,\" \"nauseated\" and \"screwed\" to describe their choice. \n \"They don't trust Hillary Clinton,\" said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, part of the bipartisan team that conducted the focus groups. \"At the same time, they can't turn to Donald Trump because he scares them.\" \n Of the 20 women in the group, five said they were leaning Trump, seven to Clinton and eight undecided or backing a third party. \n Only one believed Trump would actually win. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "As Trump struggles, Clinton goes on offense to win over GOP"}

{"date": "August 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Sha Xinog, climbs the bank to get more bait while fishing along the California Aquaduct near Firebaugh, Calif. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> Critics and a state lawmaker say they want more explanations on who's paying for a proposed $16 billion water project backed by Gov. Jerry Brown, after a leading California water district said Brown's administration was offering government funding to finish the planning for the two giant water tunnels. \n Critics said the government funding described by the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District on Thursday could run counter to longstanding state assurances that various local water districts, not California itself, would pay for Brown's vision of digging twin 35-mile-long tunnels to carry water from the Sacramento River south, mainly for Central and Southern California. The $248 million in preliminary spending for the tunnels, which have yet to win regulatory approval, already is the topic of an ongoing federal audit. On Wednesday, state lawmakers ordered a state audit of the tunnels-spending as well. \n On Thursday, state spokeswoman Nancy Vogel said that despite the account of the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District, no money from the state's general fund would be used finishing the current planning phase of the twin tunnels. However, opponents of the tunnels and a taxpayer group were critical Thursday, and Assemblywoman Susan Eggman, one of the state lawmakers behind this week's audit order, asked the state Thursday for clarification. \n \"It's a shell game,\" said David Wolfe, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association's legislative director. \"I think it comes back to the audit (request) yesterday: There are way more questions here than there are answers.\" \n The tunnels project is endorsed by Brown and by some politically influential water districts and water customers in Central and Southern California. Supporters say the tunnels would benefit the environment and offer Californians a more secure water supply. Opponents say they fear the state will use the tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay, harming Northern California and further endangering native species there. \n Metropolitan and other water districts slated to get water from the tunnels have yet to commit to paying for them, out of uncertainty whether the massive spending would really bring them enough water to make the cost worthwhile. The same water districts also announced this year they would not pay to complete the current preliminary work on the tunnels unless the project first won regulatory approval. \n On Thursday, a monthly report published by the LA-based water district on the tunnels project said, \"the state has indicated that any additional funding needs to complete the planning phase will be provided by state or federal sources.\" \n After all that local water districts had spent on the project, including $63 million from his water district, \"This is to be expected\" that the state would use government money to close out planning, said Bob Muir, spokesman for the LA-based water district. He referred further questions to Vogel, the state spokeswoman. \n Vogel said the state intended to pull money to finish the tunnels planning from user fees for an existing, half-century-old water network, the State Water Project. \n Tunnel opponents, however, point to a measure state lawmakers passed in 2009 that they say bars the state from spending money on the tunnels until the water agencies that would benefit commit to paying for them. \n \"Project contractors pledged to pay for this project and they've used financial gimmicks to get around this obligation,\" said Patricia Schifferle, an environmental consultant and longtime opponent of the proposed tunnels. \"It raises questions as to where this money was suddenly found.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New questions over California water project"}

A coal-fired generation unit that produces electricity inside the facility caught fire, the utility said in a statement. \n \"Employees were evacuated immediately and safely,\" Detroit-based DTE Energy said. \"At this time, there are no known injuries at the facility.

{"date": "August 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Associated Press reporter Anne D'Innocenzio arranges frozen, deep-fried Twinkies on a tray before baking in New York. \n NEW YORK >> The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to the home freezer. \n Hostess Brands, the maker of lunchbox treats like Ho Hos, is launching packaged \"Deep Fried Twinkies\" starting Friday that mark its first foray into frozen foods. The cream-filled snack in vanilla or chocolate is the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Wal-Mart, as both companies look to spark food sales with innovative products. \n Battered and partially fried before being frozen, the Twinkies need to be finished for a short time in the oven, toaster oven or frying pan. They'll cost $4.76 for a box of seven and for the first three months are available only at Wal-Mart. \n It has a \"retro cool factor,\" says Ellen Copaken, Hostess' vice president of marketing. \"It plays into the comfort food trend. And it's fun.\" \n The Twinkie, long one of Hostess' largest sellers, is a bigger business now than even right before the company filed for bankruptcy in 2012, Copaken said. Executives had considered developing a deep-fried version, like those seen at local fairs, but put the plans on hold until Wal-Mart approached them last summer. \n For Wal-Mart, which gets more than half of its sales from food and other groceries, the partnership is part of a strategy of working closely with suppliers to come up with new twists on existing foods or developing new ones, and getting them to the shelves faster. The company opened a food lab in June for that teamwork, a process that can cut costs and shave several months off a product launch, says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food at Wal-Mart. \n The food lab at the company's Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters has 10 test kitchens and space to accommodate 12 individual taste tests at a time. Specific feedback from customers gathered there gets shared with suppliers to determine if an item needs more work. Being tested now: new flavors for its store brand sparkling water, frozen stuffed doughnut bites, and vacuum-packed Paleo meals. \n \"Most of our customers have a desire to eat healthier,\" Redfield said. \"But at the end of the day, it has to taste good. Great healthy things that don't taste good don't do well.\" \n Hostess has given a nod to the healthier options, reformulating its Mini Muffins with fruit, no artificial flavors and more whole grains. But the Deep Fried Twinkies and candy-topped brownies are among several new treats it hopes will excite shoppers. \n At nine grams of fat and 220 calories, the vanilla flavor of the Deep Fried Twinkies compares to 4 grams of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie. One expert says Americans still like a sugar fix, typically at the end of the day. \n \"We are trying to cut down on foods that are higher in sugar content,\" said Darren Seifer, a food industry analyst at market research firm NPD Group Inc. \"But there is still room for indulgence.\" \n Twinkies have been around since 1930, but the company's financial woes had put their future in doubt. Hostess products came back after the company was bought in 2013 for $410 million. \n U.K. expat Christopher Sell added a deep-fried Twinkie to the menu at his Chip Shop restaurant in Brooklyn about 15 years ago, and the idea took off at state fairs. Hot-dog chain Papaya King in New York sells them for $3 each, excluding tax, and they're faring better than the deep-fried Oreos. \n \"We wanted to do a sweet and savory combo,\" Papaya chain president Wayne Rosenbaum said. \"The Twinkies seem to be the most popular.\" \n Hostess hoped to recreate the state fair staple, but it wasn't easy. The company tested prototypes at its Kansas City, Missouri, headquarters, and considered making it a restaurant product. Then Wal-Mart approached them. Executives at Hostess, which also has an office near Wal-Mart's headquarters in Arkansas, came to Wal-Mart, and cooked in the kitchen with them. \n \"The original samples were pretty good,\" said John Pearson, Wal-Mart's senior buyer for frozen foods. \"But the batter was a little lumpy.\" \n Hostess wanted a baking time of less than 10 minutes \u2014 with the right amount of oozing filling and a crispy texture. \n Then there was the name. Hostess considered Carnival Twinkie, Boardwalk Twinkie and the Light and Crispy Twinkie. But Pearson and other Wal-Mart executives encouraged Hostess to call them what they are: Deep Fried Twinkies. \n When baked, the Deep Fried Twinkies do come out a bit crispy, but aren't an exact match for the ones at fairs or restaurants. \n \"It's really good. It's delicious,\" said construction worker Nick Severino of Yonkers, New York, who tasted a vanilla cream version. \n Page Bondor, a Manhattan resident, wasn't excited after trying it. \"I like the original Twinkie,\" she said. \"This is a step too far.\" \n What sets the Hostess version apart, Copaken says, is the ease. \"We eliminated the hard work and prep,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hostess launches 'Deep Fried Twinkies' as first frozen treat"}

{"date": "August 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this screen grab taken from video, emergency services at the scene of a bomb attack, in Hua Hin, Thailand on Thursday. Two small bombs exploded Thursday night in Thailand's popular seaside resort town of Hua Hin, leaving at least one person dead and 20 others injured, according to Thai media. \n HUA HIN, Thailand \u00bb A wave of coordinated explosions rattled multiple cities across southern Thailand, killing at least four people and wounding dozens more, police said Friday. Among the injured were 10 foreigners in the seaside resort town of Hua Hin. \n It was not clear who was behind the attacks, but police said the violence was not linked to Islamic terrorism. The timing and scope suggested the bombs were set off by opponents of the Southeast Asian nation's ruling junta, which last weekend organized a successful referendum on a constitution that critics say will bolster the military's power for years to come. \n The explosions all occurred south of Bangkok and several of the blasts \u2014 including one on Patong beach in the tourist resort of Phuket \u2014 appeared designed to hit the tourism industry. \n Thailand's economy has sagged since the military seized power in a 2014 coup, but tourism has remained one of the few bright spots, with more than 14 million people visiting in 2016 so far \u2014 up from 12.5 million the year before. \n The first two explosions occurred overnight on a busy street in the tourist city of Hua Hin, which was hit again by another blast on Friday morning. The city is home to a swath of beachfront resorts as well as a royal palace. \n Police and Thai media reported other blasts the southern cities of Phuket, Trang and Surat Thani. \n Royal Thai Police official Col. Krisana Patanacharoen said it was too soon say who was behind the attacks, but \"we are sure that it is not linked to terrorism.\" \n Friday's blast took place on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Sirikit. The junta has repeatedly said that defending the monarchy is a top priority, and the army and its allies are keen to ensure a smooth succession for ailing 88-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is the world's longest reigning monarch. \n Tourist Shane Brett told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. from his hotel room in Hua Hin that there was panic after the first explosion, which police said killed one Thai woman and wounded about 20 others, half of them foreigners. \n \"I was at a bar in the main bar district in Hua Hin right outside the Hilton Hotel and at first I heard kind of a bang \u2026 and everyone kind of panicked,\" Brett said. \n He looked outside the bar and said saw people running. Half an hour later, he made it back to his hotel. On the way, he said he saw \"a good few people injured and the whole area just panicking \u2026 the whole area was just shut down with police cars, ambulances.\" \n The bombs Thursday were set off by remote control, half an hour apart, according to Pol. Gen. Sithichai Srisopacharoenrath, the superintendent of police in Hua Hin, and his deputy, Lt. Gen. Samer Yousamran. \n Sithichai said both devices were hidden inside plants on a street filled with restaurants, bars and food vendors that is popular with tourists and local residents. He said a Samsung cell phone had been recovered that they believe was used to detonate at least one the bombs. \n The fatality Thursday was described in Thai media as a female street food vendor. Several of the injured were in serious condition, the reports said. Pol. Lt Chaiyot Tisawong, an officer in Hua Hin, said 10 of the injured were foreigners. Their nationalities were not immediately known. \n On Friday morning, two more bombs exploded in Hua Hin, killing one person and wounding four, according to police. \n Another pair of bombs exploded in front of two police stations half an hour apart in Surat Thani in southern Thailand. \n Earlier Thursday, another bomb blew up in the southern province of Trang, killing one person and injuring six, according to Thai press reports. \n Trang is on the fringes of Thailand's deep south, where a low-level Muslim separatist insurgency had killed more than 5,000 people since 2004. Almost all the violence has been in the three southernmost provinces. \n Thailand has been plagued by political violence, including several bombings, since the populist billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted as prime minister in a 2006 military coup after demonstrations accused him of corruption, abuse of power and insulting King Bhumibol. \n Thaksin's ouster set off sometimes bloody battles for power between his supporters and opponents, who include the military. The government of his sister Yingluck Shinawatra, who became prime minister in 2011, was ousted in the country's last coup in 2014. \n On Sunday, Thai voters approved a referendum on a new constitution that is supposed to lead to an election next year. Critics say it is undemocratic and is fashioned to keep the military in control for at least five more years even if a free election is held. \n In a speech Wednesday night, junta chief and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha took credit for bringing stability back to Thailand after an extended period of unrest. \n Col.

Heroin, peyote and marijuana, among others, are considered Schedule I drugs because they have no medical application; cocaine and opiates, for example, have medical uses and, while still illegal for recreational use, are designated Schedule II drugs. \n The Drug Enforcement Administration said the agency's decision came after a lengthy review and consultation with the Health and Human Services Department, which said marijuana \"has a high potential for abuse\" and \"no accepted medical use.\" The decision means that pot will remain illegal for any purpose under federal law, despite laws in 25 states and District of Columbia that have legalized pot for either medicinal or recreational use. \n Advocates have long pushed for the federal government to follow suit. \n \"If the scientific understanding about marijuana changes \u2014 and it could change \u2014 then the decision could change,\" DEA acting administrator Chuck Rosenberg wrote in a letter to the governors of Rhode Island and Washington, who sought the review of marijuana's classification in 2011. \"But we will remain tethered to science, as we must, and as the statute demands. It certainly would be odd to rely on science when it suits us and ignore it otherwise.\" \n Rosenberg said designating marijuana a Schedule I drug does not necessarily mean it is as dangerous as other drugs. \n \"It is best not to think of drug scheduling as an escalating 'danger' scale \u2014 rather, specific statutory criteria (based on medical and scientific evidence) determine into which schedule a substance is placed,\" Rosenberg wrote. \n The Food and Drug Administration said agency officials reviewed more than 500 studies on the use of medical marijuana, identifying only 11 that met the agency standards for \"legitimate testing.\" For various reasons, none of the trials demonstrated \"an accepted medical use,\" the agency concluded. \n The FDA last evaluated marijuana for medical use in 2006 and said in its latest review that the available research \"has progressed,\" but does not meet federal standards of safety or effectiveness. \n While the DEA won't reclassify marijuana, the agency did announce plans to make it easier for researchers to study pot's possible medical benefits by expanding the number of entities that can legally grow marijuana for research purposes. \n Currently only researchers at the University of Mississippi are allowed to grow marijuana, as part of a contract with the National Institute on Drug Abuse. \n Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the DEA's decision \"is keeping federal laws behind the times.\" \n \"The DEA's decision flies in the face of choices made freely by voters in Oregon and many other states about the legality of marijuana,\" he said. Oregon legalized pot last year. \n Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said he was disappointed with the DEA's ruling but his state would continue \"to maintain a well-regulated adult-use marijuana system and continue to allow patients to have access for necessary medicinal purposes.\" \n Jaclyn Stafford, an assistant manager at The Station dispensary in Boulder, Colorado, called the DEA's decision \"an inaccurate judgment of the plant.\" She said rescheduling marijuana would allow for more regulation to an already growing market and allow more people to take advantage of what she described as the \"holistic benefits\" of pot. \n The Obama administration's position on marijuana started to ease in earnest in 2013 when the Justice Department notified Colorado and Washington, the first two states to legalize pot for recreational use and sales, that it would not interfere with state laws so long as the drug was kept out of the hands of children, off the black market and away from federal property. \n Advocates saw that policy statement as the first step to an end of the federal prohibition of marijuana. But that hope was quickly diminished as administration officials, including the head of the White House-run Office of National Drug Control Policy, repeatedly said publicly that they still considered marijuana a dangerous drug that had no place in the legal market. \n Thursday's announcement was another blow to those hoping the federal government would change pot laws. \n \"In reality, marijuana should be descheduled and states should be allowed to set their own policies,\" said Michael Collins, deputy director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, which supports marijuana policy reform. Collins said he considered the DEA's decision to be one that puts \"politics above science.\" \n Thursday's ruling has no impact on banking rules for legal marijuana businesses. In 2014 the Treasury Department gave banks permission to do business with legal marijuana operations with conditions, including that they try to make sure that customers complied with state regulations. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. government won't reclassify marijuana, allows research"}

Itemid Al-Matar is suing Chicago police who falsely singled her out as a potential terrorist on July 4, 2015, as she left a subway station wearing a headscarf, face veil and carrying a backpack. \n CHICAGO \u00bb A young Muslim woman today sued Chicago police who mistakenly identified her briefly as a potential \"lone wolf\" terrorist as she was leaving a city subway station last year on the Fourth of July wearing a headscarf, face veil and carrying a backpack. \n Itemid Al-Matar says officers violated her civil rights by pulling off her religious garb as they arrested her on subway station stairs, then strip-searched her later at a police station, according to the federal lawsuit filed in Chicago on her behalf. \n \"Several (officers) ran up the stairs and grabbed the Plaintiff and threw her down upon the stair landing, then pulling at her and ripping off her hijab,\" it says. \n Security-camera video made public shows several minutes of the arrest in the subway. Several officers can be seen pushing through a crowd on a stairway to reach Al-Matar, but soon move out of view of the camera. \n The fact that Al-Matar was wearing a headscarf, known as a hijab, and the face veil, called a niqab, \"was the impetus behind the actions\" of the officers, the court filing alleges. In a statement Thursday, Phil Robertson, a lawyer for the Chicago chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, and a co-counsel in the civil case, argued that \"blatant xenophobia, Islamophobia, and racial profiling\" underpinned the officers' actions. \n A police report filed the night of the incident says officers had been \"on high alert of terrorist activity\" on the Fourth of July holiday when they spotted Al-Matar exhibiting what they believed was \"suspicious behavior,\" including walking at \"a brisk pace, in a determined manner.\" It also says officers saw what they thought could be \"incendiary devices\" around her ankles and were also suspicious of her backpack, which was clutched to her chest. \n \"(Officers) believed that subject might be a lone wolf suicide bomber and decided to attempt to take subject into custody,\" it says. \n A K-9 unit searched for explosive materials, the report says, \"with negative results,\" while \"the objects strapped around arrestee's ankles\" turned out to be \"ankle weights.\" But Al-Matar was still charged, including with obstructing justice after police accused her of resisting and refusing to comply with orders. She was acquitted on all charges at a state trial earlier this year. \n Today's lawsuit names six officers and the city of Chicago as defendants, accusing them of excessive force, false arrest, violation of freedom of religious expression and malicious prosecution. \n A police spokesman declined to comment specifically on the suit, saying the department doesn't comment on pending litigation. But police issued a brief written statement that says \"officers work hard each day to investigate suspicious activity and fight crime and we strive to treat all individuals with the highest levels of dignity of respect.\" The city's law department, which represents officers in civil litigation, declined comment. \n The case comes amid heightened scrutiny of city police. The release last year of a video showing a white officer fatally shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times sparked weeks of protests and led to an ongoing Department of Justice investigation of Chicago Police Department practices. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Muslim woman mistaken for terrorist sues Chicago officers"}

He emphasized that he remains committed to filling the chancellor post. \n Robert Bley-Vroman \u2014 previously dean of Manoa's College of Languages, Linguistics and Literature \u2014 was approved as interim chancellor in August 2014, following the dismissal by Lassner of Tom Apple. Bley-Vroman's interim term ends this month and he has said he will return to a faculty position. He declined to be considered for an extension. \n \"Almost everyone expressed concern that this approach might signal back-pedaling on the commitment to hire a new chancellor for Manoa,\" Lassner wrote in his email. \"I can only assure you that I still firmly believe the president of the (UH) system and chancellor of Manoa are two different and necessary leadership positions. I remain absolutely committed to the search that is actively underway.\" \n That search officially began in April, when a 20-member search advisory committee was announced to find candidates. Lassner said he expects to submit a recommendation to the regents for a permanent candidate during the fall semester, which begins later this month. The new chancellor, he said, would \"hopefully begin in time for the spring 2017 semester.\" \n Although a temporary proposal, Lassner holding both titles is likely to rankle some at Manoa, who have been critical of a recent call by regents to revisit the need for both a system president and Manoa chancellor. The roles previously were separate until the 1980s, when they were combined, before being separated again in 2001. \n The board did vote earlier this year to \"affirm\" the positions should remain separate, but it charged Lassner with implementing a plan to consolidate redundant services and improve deficiencies at Manoa and at the system level. \n Lassner acknowledged some of the controversy, saying \"I realize this approach does not represent the preferred choice for some,\" but added that \"nearly everyone told me that this is no time for a placeholder interim chancellor.\" \n \"This transitional leadership period is the time to begin working hard together to create a bold, relevant and strategic future for UH Manoa,\" Lassner wrote. \"It will require hard decisions that may challenge some past conventions and practices to launch Manoa on a path to even greater excellence as Hawaii's sole research university.\" \n Asked for further comment, UH spokesman Dan Meisenzahl said \"it would be inappropriate to say anything more until the board takes a look and decides on the recommendation.\" \n ", "author": "By Nanea Kalani nkalani@staradvertiser.com", "title": "UH president plans to also serve as interim Manoa chancellor"}

But earlier research by the government was limited to a small number of states and cities. The new survey includes students in rural areas and other parts of the U.S. \n \"This is the first time we can say that nationwide these are consistent challenges faced by lesbian, gay and bi- youth,\" said David W. Bond of The Trevor Project, a national suicide-prevention organization focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender youth. \n Shontay Richardson says the survey reflects her experience in high school. \"There's of course the physical bullying, but also the emotional bullying that takes place,\" she said. \n Now 24 and a graduate student at Purchase College in suburban New York, she says she was lesbian but tried to hide it from her classmates. Still, she was seen as different. She was ostracized by her classmates and sexually assaulted by a boy she knew, she said. \n The research results are based on responses from about 15,600 students to an anonymous survey conducted last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC released the report today. \n Of the survey participants, about 2 percent said they were gay or lesbian, 6 percent said they were bisexual and 3 percent said they weren't sure of their sexual identity. \n That suggests that of the 16 million students who attended public and private high schools last year, roughly 321,000 were gay or lesbian and 964,000 were bisexual, CDC officials said. \n Among the findings: \n \u2014Nearly 1 in 5 of the gay, lesbian and bisexual students said they'd been raped at some point in their lives, compared to 1 in 20 heterosexual students. \n \u2014Nearly 1 in 5 who had gone out with someone in the past year said their date had hit them, slammed them against a wall, or committed some other form of physical violence.

This is the body's most mysterious organ, and inside lie clues about how it gives life \u2014 and how it can go awry, leading to stillbirth, preterm birth, even infections like the Zika virus that somehow sneak past its protective barrier. \n In labs around the country, major research is underway to finally understand and monitor this floppy, bloody tissue that's often dismissed as the \"afterbirth,\" the organ that lives about nine months and then gets thrown away. \n The stakes are high. The placenta is the ultimate multitasker: It nourishes a fetus, acts as its lungs, kidneys and liver, provides immune defense, and even produces key hormones. \n \"We take it for granted,\" said Dr. Catherine Spong of the National Institutes of Health, which has spurred a research boom with its $50 million Human Placenta Project. \"Yet there are lifelong implications for both the mother and the baby.\" \n Zika's shocking birth defects have brought into focus the desperate need to learn how a healthy placenta does its many jobs, and find treatments for when it is undermined. \n \"Tomorrow there may be a new virus,\" warned Dr. Yoel Sadovsky of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a leading placenta researcher. \"If I was a virus and wanted to attack humans, probably the best time to do it was during pregnancy, where you're attacking the next generation.\" \n Doctors have few tools today to examine a placenta during pregnancy. And precious as that donated placenta is for research, studying one that already ushered in a birth reveals only so much, like counting the rings in a downed tree to visualize the sapling. \n What scientists, and obstetricians, really need is a way to peek at how the placenta forms and changes in the different stages of pregnancy. That could help spot problems early \u2014 such as preeclampsia, a blood pressure complication that can be life-threatening to mother and baby. It affects up to 8 percent of pregnancies but typically isn't detected until the second trimester even though it's thought to stem from abnormal placenta formation. \n How? In a Washington lab, engineer Avinash Eranki turns over the donated placenta, examining the side that attached to Mom. That outer layer is made up of cells called trophoblasts that had to invade the uterine wall and then burrow into maternal arteries, enlarging them to provide blood flow for the fetus. \n The theory: If those cells get off course and the blood vessels don't widen enough, the downstream effects of a placenta struggling to support the fetus eventually stress the mother's own organs. \n The research team at Children's National Health System is using a 3-D bioprinter to create a unique living model of how a human placenta forms, to mimic how trophoblasts create that blood supply. The printer deposits layer after layer of human cells and other substances they need to thrive. \n \"It can actually grow. It's a dynamic piece of tissue,\" said researcher Che-Ying Kuo of the University of Maryland and Children's National, which is funding the work. \n Once it's complete, the model could help researchers test ways to detect brewing preeclampsia earlier, and intervene. Today, the only cure for severe cases is premature delivery of the baby. \n At the NIH, researchers are targeting another critical gap: It's hard to tell how much oxygen is reaching the fetus. Doctors rely on indirect measurements, such as during labor when fetal heart rate can signal problems even if the baby's fine. \n Biomedical engineer Afrouz Anderson of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is developing a wireless device, called an oximeter, that uses near-infrared light to measure placental oxygen when held over mom's abdomen. \n Anderson, who is testing the device in a model that mimics blood flowing through a placenta, sees its potential use during preeclampsia or when the fetus isn't growing properly. In a study planned for early next year, she'll team with military doctors to measure what's normal in healthy pregnant women. \n \"My biggest hope is if the oxygenation status would give a more accurate picture,\" so that \"we don't have to go do a C-section because the baby's actually happy,\" said Dr. Shad Deering, obstetrics chairman at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. \n \"It's very exciting to see people focusing on the real-time changes that happen during a pregnancy and how those shape later outcomes,\" said Dr. Anna Penn, a neonatologist at Children's National. She studies hormones the placenta produces that affect brain development, in search of protective therapies for premature infants. \"The whole idea is early detection of problems so that if things are going off in the wrong direction, hopefully we can get back on track.\" \n But the Zika virus, which can destroy a developing brain when an infected mother passes infection to her unborn child, is proving a tough challenge. Only certain viruses can reach a fetus through the placenta and it's not clear how Zika does. So far, researchers have found that it seems able to infect some types of placenta cells and not others. \n The last epidemic of a birth defect-causing virus was rubella, or German measles, in the 1960s. Dr. Carolyn Coyne, a University of Pittsburgh virologist, calls it shocking that scientists still don't know how rubella sneaked through \u2014 because those studies ended once life-saving rubella vaccination began. \n Even if Zika starts to fade, it's critical to get those answers, say Coyne and Sadovksy, who are studying new pathways the virus may be using. \n \"Really, societal health depends on the function of this organ,\" Sadovsky said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Studies shine light on mysterious placenta, how it goes awry"}

There were cocktails, pizza from her favorite local joint, and a screening in her room of one of her favorite movies, \"The Dance of Reality,\" based on the life of a Chilean film director. \n As the weekend drew to a close, her friends kissed her goodbye, gathered for a photo and left, and Davis was wheeled out to a canopy bed on a hillside, where she took a combination of morphine, pentobarbital and chloral hydrate prescribed by her doctor. \n Kelly Davis said she loved her sister's idea for the gathering. \n \"Obviously it was hard for me. It's still hard for me,\" said Davis, who wrote about it for the online news outlet Voice of San Diego. \"The worst was needing to leave the room every now and then, because I would get choked up. But people got it. They understood how much she was suffering and that she was fine with her decision. They respected that. They knew she wanted it to be a joyous occasion.\" \n Davis took her life a little over a month after a California law giving the option to the terminally ill went into effect. Four other states allow doctor-assisted suicide, with Oregon the first in 1997. \n Opponents of the law warn it could become a way out for people who are uninsured or fearful of high medical bills. \n Marilyn Golden of the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, said her heart goes out to anyone dealing with a terminal illness, but \"there are still millions of people in California threatened by the danger of this law.\" \n Davis spent months planning her exit, feeling empowered after spending the last three years losing control of her body bit by bit. The painter and performance artist could no longer stand, brush her teeth or scratch an itch. Her caretakers had to translate her slurred speech for others. \n \"Dear rebirth participants you're all very brave for sending me off on my journey,\" she wrote in her invitation. \"There are no rules. Wear what you want, speak your mind, dance, hop, chant, sing, pray, but do not cry in front of me. Oh, OK one rule.\" \n During the party, old friends reconnected and Davis rolled in and out of the rooms in her electric wheelchair and onto the porch, talking with her guests. \n At one point, she invited friends to her room to try on the clothes she had picked out for them. They modeled the outfits to laughter. Guests were also invited to take a \"Betsy souvenir\" \u2014 a painting, beauty product or other memento. Her sister had placed sticky notes on the items, explaining each one's significance. \n Wearing a Japanese kimono she bought on a bucket-list trip she took after being diagnosed in 2013, she looked out at her last sunset and took the drugs at 6:45 p.m. with her caretaker, her doctor, her massage therapist and her sister by her side. Four hours later, she died. \n Friends said it was the final performance for the artist, who once drew pictures on a stage with whipped cream. \n \"What Betsy did gave her the most beautiful death that any person could ever wish for,\" Alpert said. \"By taking charge, she turned her departure into a work of art.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Terminally ill woman holds party before ending her life"}

{"date": "August 11, 2016", "text": "The former principal of Saint Louis School has been tapped to serve as executive director of the state Public Charter School Commission. \n The commission this morning voted unanimously to hire Sione Thompson, who holds a master's degree in education and an undergraduate sociology degree from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. \n Thompson spent 10 years with Saint Louis, his alma mater, including as a social science teacher and dean of students before being named vice principal and later principal of the all-boys Catholic school. He most recently worked as an early college coordinator for the University of Hawaii-West Oahu. \n \"Hawaii public charter schools are integral to the overall success of our state's educational objectives,\" Thompson said in a statement. \"I look forward to the work ahead in developing relationships with our charter schools, communities, and stakeholders as we work together in providing high quality education to our keiki.\" \n Catherine Payne, chairwoman of the commission, said Thompson's start date is still being worked out. \n Thompson will replace former executive director Tom Hutton, who announced in February that he would step down after three years on the job. Hutton had been the first director of the commission, which was established in 2012 as part of an overhaul of state's charter law to tighten oversight and accountability of charter schools. \n The commission last month announced that it would be restarting the search process after a finalist who was offered the job declined it. A screening committee was reconvened and tasked with considering both new candidates as well as previously vetted applicants. The screening committee said today that two candidates were recommended for final interviews. \n \"We are eager to share Mr. Thompson's enthusiasm and commitment to high quality education with our charter schools,\" Payne said in a statement. \n The state's 34 charter schools enroll more than 10,400 children, or about 6 percent of public school students. Charter schools, which report to their own governing boards, are largely funded with taxpayer dollars through per-pupil funding but are independently run under contracts with the commission. \n ", "author": "By Nanea Kalani nkalani@staradvertiser.com", "title": "New executive director named for Hawaii charter schools"}

{"date": "August 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gives a speech on the economy after touring Futuramic Tool & Engineering, in Warren, Mich. today. \n WARREN, Mich. \u00bb Her political fortunes flourishing, Hillary Clinton attempted to undercut Donald Trump's claim to working-class voters today, portraying her Republican rival as untrustworthy on economic issues and pushing policies that would only benefit the super-wealthy \u2014 himself included. \n The Democratic presidential nominee sought to seize momentum as Republicans \u2014 including Trump \u2014 struck an almost defeatist note about their Election Day chances. As Republican leaders sounded alarms about Trump's unconventional approach, Clinton attacked what she dubbed \"outlandish Trumpian ideas\" that have been rejected by both parties. \n \"Based on what we know from the Trump campaign, he wants America to work for him and his friends, at the expense of everyone else,\" she said after touring a Michigan manufacturing facility. \n Appearing in a county known for so-called Reagan Democrats \u2014 working-class Democrats who voted Republican in the 1980s \u2014 Clinton tried to win back some of the blue-collar voters who have formed the base of her rival's support, making the case that she offers a steadier roadmap for economic growth and prosperity. \n \"I can provide serious, steady leadership that can find common ground and build on it based on hard but respectful bargaining,\" she said. \"I just don't think insults and bullying is how we're going to get things done.\" \n Clinton, who frequently boasts about her numerous policy plans, didn't offer any new, major ideas to improve the country's economy in her afternoon address. She reiterated her strong opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, leaving herself little room for backtracking should she win the White House. \n \"I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the election, and I'll oppose it as President,\" she said, while also noting that the U.S. should not cut itself off from the rest of the world. \n Clinton once called the TPP the \"gold standard\" of trade deals when she served as Obama's secretary of state, but she announced her opposition to the deal last year, saying it did not meet her standard for creating jobs, raising wages and protecting national security. \n Hoping to keep the pressure on Trump, Clinton is also planning to release her 2015 tax returns in the coming days. Trump has said he won't release his until an IRS audit is complete, breaking tradition with every presidential candidate in recent history. \n A source close to Clinton said she would soon release her return, supplementing the decades of filings she and her husband have already made public. Her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, and his wife will also release the last 10 years of their taxes. The source spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans in advance. \n Clinton's appearance followed Trump's own speech on the economy, which he delivered in Michigan on Monday. But his scripted remarks were quickly eclipsed by the latest in a series of blunders and controversial statements that appear to have handed Clinton's campaign a boost in the polls, particularly with Republican women and college-educated voters who make up a key piece of the GOP base. \n Just hours before her address, Trump unleashed another round of attacks on Democrats, calling Obama the \"founder\" of the Islamic State militant group \u2014 and Clinton its co-founder. \n The Republican presidential nominee brushed off conservative radio commentator Hugh Hewitt's attempt to reframe Trump's observation as one that said Obama's foreign policy created the conditions in Iraq and Syria that allowed IS to thrive. \n \"No, I meant he's the founder of ISIS. I do,\" Trump said, using another acronym for the extremist group that has wreaked havoc from the Middle East to European cities. \n The latest bit of controversy shook Republicans, already rattled by polling showing Trump losing support among women and other segments of their party's base. \n Dozens of frustrated Republicans gathered signatures Thursday for a letter to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus that urges the party chief to stop helping Trump and instead focus GOP resources on protecting vulnerable Senate and House candidates. Speaking to reporters in Kentucky on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell described Republicans' chances of keeping control of the Senate after the November elections as \"very dicey.\" \n A draft of the letter, which operatives say has at least 70 signatories, warns that Trump's \"divisiveness, recklessness, incompetence, and record-breaking unpopularity risk turning this election into a Democratic landslide.\" \n Trump said he had no intention of changing his inflammatory approach to presidential politics, pledging in a CNBC interview to \"just keep doing the same thing I'm doing right now.\" \n But he seemed to acknowledge the risk his campaign \u2014 and party \u2014 was taking. \"At the end, it's either going to work or I'm going to, you know, I'm going to have a very, very nice long vacation,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton knocks 'outlandish Trumpian ideas' in policy speech"}

You'll have a whole lot more than good luck. \n Two rare American one-cent coins dating back to 1792 are anticipated to sell for nearly a million dollars at a public auction in Southern California on Wednesday. \n The copper coins, known as the \"Silver Center Cent\" and the \"Birch Cent,\" are expected to sell for about a half-million dollars each and were made during the early days of the U.S. Mint. \n At about the halfway point on Wednesday afternoon, bids had reached $220,000 for the first coin and $425,000 for the second. \n \"They're classic American rarities,\" said Eric Bradley, spokesman for Heritage Auction, the auction house holding the five-day sale in Anaheim, California. \n And they have historical significance that goes beyond their collectible value, representing \"the transition in American history from the colonies to a new republic,\" Bradley said. \n \"These are coins that were developed and thought up by the Founding Fathers who were trying to differentiate themselves from British coinage and British rule,\" he said. \n The words \"Liberty Parent of Science & Industry,\" which are engraved on both coins, also show how the United States was trying to distance itself from the religious persecution and monarchy it associated with Britain, Bradley said. \n The origin of the Silver Center Cent was also referenced in a letter from Thomas Jefferson to George Washington, and it is among the very first coins ever struck by the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia, Bradley added. \n According to the auction house, the coin went missing before eventually being discovered in an English pub in the 1960s. The man who discovered it, Nigel Willmott, kept hold of it until 1997, when he eventually auctioned it off for 28,750 British pounds, Bradley said. \n The penny's name derives from the fact that it was produced with a small insertion of silver at its center, a feature which made its intrinsic value equal to its face value. It is one of about a dozen surviving coins known to exist with this insertion, Bradley said. \n Wednesday's sale is part of a five-day public auction of ancient world coins, U.S. coins and paper currency expected to bring $30 million, Bradley said. It is also part of The World's Fair of Money, a numismatic convention in Anaheim that runs from Aug. 9-13. The event is expected to draw the interest of collectors globally. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Someone will pay a pretty penny for these 2 rare coins"}
