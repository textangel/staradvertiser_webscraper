{"date": "August 12, 2016", "text": "HELOTES, Texas >> A 7-month-old boy died Friday after being left all day in a hot sport utility vehicle in a San Antonio-area Wal-Mart parking lot. \n The child's father is employed at the store in Helotes, a San Antonio suburb, and told officers that he forgot to drop the child off at day care before going to work about 6:15 a.m., said Helotes police Capt. Anthony Burges. When the father finished work and returned to the SUV about 3 p.m., he found his child dead. The father was taken to a hospital after reporting chest pains, Burges said. \n No charges have been filed, and the identities of the father and boy have not been released. \n Temperatures in the area hovered around 100 degrees much of the afternoon. \n The death brings the toll of children dying in hot cars this year to at least 27, six in Texas, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of KidsAndCars.org, a national child safety nonprofit based in Philadelphia. On Aug. 4, twin 15-month-old girls died after being found in the back seat of a hot SUV parked in front of a duplex car Carrollton in northwestern Georgia. When police arrived, they found people holding the girls in the water of a baby pool behind the duplex, some with ice packs, trying to cool the girls off. \n Last year, there were 15 heatstroke deaths of children in vehicles, Fennell said. \n The toll began rising sharply in the 1990s with the passing of laws requiring that young children be placed in the back seat to avoid air-bag injuries. With the children strapped into the back seat, drivers can tend to forget them, Fennell said. \n Fennell said the numbers of heatstroke deaths of kids in cars fluctuated in the following decades, averaging 37 such deaths a year since 1998. The worst year was 2010, with 49, according to both a count by Fennell and Jan Null, a research meteorologist at San Jose State University, who also tracks numbers. \n The temperature inside a parked car on a 90-degree day will reach 119 degrees in 20 minutes and 133 degrees after an hour, Null said. \n Parents should get into the habit of always opening their back doors when they leave the vehicle, according to Fennell. Leaving a purse or cellphone in the back seat can help. Other strategies include keeping a stuffed animal in the car seat and placing it in the front seat when the child is strapped in as a reminder that the child is there. Parents also need to make sure their day care calls them if the child doesn't show up, she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "7-month-old Texas boy dies in hot car; 27th in US this year"}

{"date": "August 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Maj. Shanelle Porter, commanding officer at the Recruiting Station Chicago poses in her office in Des Plaines, Ill. The U.S. Marine Corps is looking for a few more good women. \n MARINE CORPS BASE QUANTICO, Va. >> The U.S. Marine Corps is looking for a few more good women. \n And this time the campaign is a bit different. Marine recruiters are turning to girls high school sports teams to find candidates who may be able to meet the Corps' rigorous physical standards, including for the front-line combat jobs now open to women. \n Marine Commandant Gen. Robert Neller says he wants to increase the number of women in the Corps to 1 in 10. \n \"I've told them that 10 percent is where we want to go and they're working on it,\" Neller told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Go recruit more women. Find them. They're out there.\" \n For years, only about 7 percent to 8 percent of the Corps, which numbers 184,200, has been women. It's the smallest percentage of women among all the military services. But on the heels of the Pentagon decision to allow women who qualify to serve in combat jobs, thousands of new infantry, armor and other front-line posts are now open. \n Neller said he wants to see women in some of those posts. That order now rests with Maj. Gen. Paul Kennedy, head of the Marine Corps' recruiting command. \n Kennedy is aggressively recruiting women for the service. He's sending targeted mailings, changing advertising to better represent female Marines, and traveling the country to meet with coaches and female athletes who may be well-suited for the rigors of Marine service. \n In particular, Neller believes female wrestlers are good candidates. \n \"We looked at that and said, 'Wow, that's kinda what we're looking for,'\" he said. \"They're disciplined, they're fit, they're focused on their mission.\" \n According to Kennedy, the Marines, for the first time, are mailing recruiting literature to thousands of high school girls. Also, updated advertising will show active-duty female Marines doing their jobs on the battlefield. \n \"The biggest complaint that we've heard and we're reacting to is that we were showing women in some of our material \u2014 whether it's commercial or print or whatever \u2014 and they were always training,\" Kennedy said. \"And that was a mistake.\" \n Already he's gone to the Women's Basketball Coaches Association conference and has targeted wrestling and other sports gatherings this year. \n In those sessions, he said, he is working to debunk misconceptions about women in the Marine Corps, including worries about sexual harassment and sexual assault, limits on career options, lack of stability and difficulties having a family life. \n \"We got to talk to them, got to show them there are plenty of female married officers and enlisted, that it's not a good ol' boys club anymore when you talk about the career issues,\" Kennedy said in an interview in his office at Marine Corps Base Quantico. \n The other military services attract far more women, and may be viewed as more receptive than the Corps, whose slogan used to say it was looking for \"a few good men.\" The current slogan is more inclusive: \"The Few. The Proud. The Marines.\" \n The Air Force has the highest percentage of women serving on active duty, with more than 19 percent, followed by the Navy at 18.6 percent, the Army at 14.4 percent and the Marines at 7.9 percent, according to Defense Department data from May. \n The key, Kennedy said, is to get to influencers \u2014 parents, coaches \u2014 and convince them that their daughters, their athletes, will be treated fairly. And he said he allays fears that women would be forced into combat jobs they don't want. \n The recruiters, however, know it won't be easy. Data suggests they have to contact twice as many potential applicants to find a female candidate as they do to find a man. So far, very few are interested in the combat jobs. \n In suburban Chicago, Marine Maj. Shanelle A. Porter, commanding officer for Recruiting Station Chicago, said most women coming in the door just want to be Marines, but so far two women have said they were looking for front-line roles. \n The women, she said, want to be pioneers. \n \"They're looking for that challenge,\" said Porter. \"They're trying to show we can do it, too.\" \n A Marine for 13 years, Porter participated in college and professional sports \u2014 running the 400 meters \u2014 for seven years. So her goal is to make sure that any female recruit she sends to training is ready. \n Some can't do a pull-up or hang from a bar for long enough. And sometimes they need to get faster so they can finish the 1.5-mile run in 13.5 minutes. \n All female recruits, she said, go on a \"high-risk action plan\" for at least five months that include vitamin supplements, weight management and an exercise regimen that includes weights, cross-fit training and a pull-up program. \n For Kennedy, having a female Marine like Porter available to talk to female recruits and their families is helpful. Women make up 165 of the Corps' 3,565 recruiters, and five of the 48 recruiting station commanders. For now, he says, that's sufficient. \n \"They don't actually need a female recruiter,\" Kennedy said, adding that the first person a potential recruit meets in high school or a shopping mall doesn't have to be the same gender. \n But, \"there has to be a female in the process,\" he said. \"At some point, you've got to have a woman that can answer the specific questions and maybe even answer the parents' questions.\" \n Already, he is having some success and is on track to send enough women to boot camp this year to hit 8.7 percent of the annual recruits, or about 3,100 women. The 10 percent goal would require him to bring in about 3,400 women recruits a year; he believes that is well within reach. \n \"We're going to exceed the goal that was set for us. I feel confident,\" said Kennedy. \"I think we can blow through 10 percent like it's an elevator stop.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Marines looks for a few more good women in recruiting drive"}

{"date": "August 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally, Friday. \n ERIE, Pa. >> It's the media's fault. That's out of context. Never said it in the first place. \n Donald Trump's claim Friday that he was merely being \"sarcastic\" in accusing President Barack Obama of establishing a terrorist group was his latest attempt to blame others for the uproar over what he says. It's an instinct that Trump's opponents say a president can't possess. Some Republicans seem to have the same concern. \n This time, it followed two days of critical headlines and Democratic outrage over Trump's claim that Obama was the \"founder\" of the Islamic State group. As Trump repeated the claim more than a dozen times, interviewers sought to ensure Trump wasn't being misconstrued. Surely, they offered, he meant Obama's policies had enabled the extremist group's rise. \n \"No, I meant he's the founder of ISIS. I do,\" Trump said, using one acronym for the group. \n Then an about-face Friday. \"THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?\" he tweeted. \n Or was he being sarcastic about the sarcasm? Hours later, he told a rally in Pennsylvania he was \"obviously being sarcastic \u2014 but not that sarcastic, to be honest with you.\" \n That it took Trump two days to walk back his widely debunked remark \u2014 and then walk back the walk-back \u2014 was worrying for Republicans who see such missteps as playing to Democrat Hillary Clinton's advantage. Equally worrying for some was the fact that he again would not take responsibility for his words. \n Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist who advised Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, said there's a common-sense playbook for dealing with political slip-ups: \"Stop the bleeding and put it behind you by apologizing. \n \"That's what normal candidates do,\" he went on. \"However, normal candidates don't careen from one self-inflicted wound to another on an hourly basis.\" \n It was only two days earlier that Trump blamed the media for making much ado about nothing after he suggested during a rally that gun rights enthusiasts might find a way to stop Clinton if elected. \n Clinton, whose lead over Trump has widened in recent polls of the most competitive states, has seized on those and other eyebrow-raising comments to portray the reality TV star as lacking the temperament to run the nation \u2014 Trump has his own argument for why she's unfit to do so. She's hammered him for avoiding accountability for his actions. \n To that end, Clinton's campaign on Friday intensified pressure on Trump to release his tax returns, while disclosing her 2015 filings and a decade of returns from her running mate. The filing shows that the Clintons earned $10.6 million and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent last year. \n Trump has refused to make his filings public, saying they're under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and he'll release them only once that review is complete. All major U.S. presidential candidates in modern history have released their returns. \n Minutes after releasing her returns, Clinton tweeted that it's possible Trump paid no tax at all. \n Trump worked to profit on the fuss over his Islamic State remark. In an email to supporters asking them to donate, Trump accused the \"liberal media\" of telling \"outrageous lies about me.\" \n It's no surprise that the media are Trump's go-to scapegoat. Just 6 percent of Americans said they have a great deal of confidence in the media in a Media Insight Project poll earlier this year. \n Almost never does Trump admit error. One exception came this month when he acknowledged a video he said showed a plane carrying U.S. cash to Iran was actually a plane carrying U.S. hostages who were being released. \n Most of the time, Trump casts blame elsewhere: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "After verbal missteps, Trump blames others"}

{"date": "August 12, 2016", "text": "DUKE UNIVERSITY / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n Eight paralyzed patients regained some sensation and muscle control in their legs after a year of training on brain-controlled robotics, according to a study published Thursday by a Duke University neuroscientist and his colleagues around the world. \n RALEIGH, N.C. \u00bb Eight paralyzed patients regained some sensation and muscle control in their legs after a year of training on brain-controlled robotics, according to a study published this week by a Duke University neuroscientist and his colleagues around the world.  \n The finding is the first of its kind that shows that brain-machine interfaces, including virtual reality, are not just assistive devices but can actually stimulate partial recovery in paraplegics. Published in the online journal Scientific Reports, the research offers a measure of hope to people who have suffered devastating paralysis from spinal cord injuries and strokes. \n Patients in the study had been paralyzed at least five years \u2014 and some more than a decade \u2014 so researchers do not think the results were part of any natural recovery. \n The study was conducted in Brazil as part of the Walk Again Project, a consortium of 100 researchers from 25 countries. The team first made headlines in 2014 during a demonstration at the soccer World Cup in Brazil, where a patient wearing a special brain-controlled exoskeleton suit was able to kick a soccer ball to open the competition. \n Work began with the patients in late 2013 in a neurological rehabilitation lab using the sophisticated equipment, and within months scientists began to notice something remarkable, Duke's Dr. Miguel Nicolelis said in a phone interview from Brazil. \n Working at least two hours a week with the machines, paraplegics began to feel sensations and show movement in lower extremities, \"something that nobody expected, and that was a tremendous shock,\" said Nicolelis, who is director of Duke's Center for Neuroengineering. \n Some patients began to feel movement in their bowels and experience bladder control, which could help reduce their dependence on catheters and laxatives in daily living. That can prevent dangerous infections paraplegics tend to get. \n By the end of a year with the training, half of the patients had been reclassified from complete paralysis to partial paralysis. One patient left the study because of a move. Now, more than two years after the work started, the seven remaining patients in the study have been reclassified in their level of paralysis. \n That doesn't mean the patients can hold themselves up or walk without help. But some can move their legs in walking motion unassisted if their weight is otherwise supported. The level of progress varied among patients. \n One of them, dubbed \"Patient 1,\" was a 32-year-old woman who was able to stand in braces or walk using a walker. By the end of 13 months, she could move her legs voluntarily if her body weight was supported in a harness. She had been paralyzed for 13 years. \n The brain-machine equipment promotes direct communication between the brain and computers or prosthetics, such as robotic limbs. The systems record signals in the brain and translate motor commands from those signals into movement. The machines use sensors and are noninvasive. \n The patients wear a skull cap that looks like a swim cap with electrodes. In the beginning, Nicolelis said, patients were instructed to imagine their legs moving. Nothing happened \u2014 it was almost like their brains did not recognize that they had legs. \n But using virtual reality goggles, the patients were told to move avatars \u2014 figures on a soccer field. They started by moving the figures' hands and arms. The virtual reality systems then showed the patients' the soccer players walking on the field, and with every step, the patients would be given tactile stimulation through a special touch-technology sleeve they wore on their arms, which were not affected by paralysis. Eventually, although they were standing still, when the soccer player moved, they felt they were walking, too. \n \"We fooled their brains,\" he said. \"Their brains received the sensation that their own legs were moving. It's called a phantom limb sensation.\" \n Recording the activity, the scientists saw that slowly, the brain was acquiring ability to modulate when the patients thought about moving. In the second stage, patients used a robotic device to move legs in the air. Ultimately the patients used an exoskeleton suit with robotic systems and gyroscopes to stand and walk for 20 to 50 steps. All along, the patients received stimulation on their arms. \n Nicolelis said in many traumatic spinal cord injuries, a small percentage of nerves can remain, but after years without brain signals, the nerves go dormant. \n \"I think what we did was to turn these guys on again,\" he said, speaking of the brain and nerve interplay. \"We just got them transmitting information again.\" \n As the researchers continued to work with patients, even small movements seemed like major victories. \n \"It was very emotional, for all of us, not only for the patients,\" Nicolelis said. \"It was very unique and nobody will forget the first day we saw these people moving again.\" \n For nearly 20 years, Nicolelis has been working on brain-machine interfaces, improving the technology and conducting experiments with rats and monkeys that learned how to control robotics with their brains. In a 2014 TED talk, the scientist joked that early on, people suggested he and his fellow researchers needed a psychologist.  \n In Brazil, the work started out with a focus on testing the exoskeleton technology and seeing how patients could move with it. The scientists didn't expect that the machines would provide effective treatment, leading to progress that left rehabilitation experts amazed. \n \"It's like what John Lennon said, 'Life is what happens when you're making plans,'\" Nicolelis. \n There is still a lot of work to do, and the study will continue. The scientists want to work with patients with more recent spinal cord injuries to see whether the treatment works better with them. It will be a challenge to spread the sophisticated therapy more widely, so the team hopes to develop simpler technology that could be used in a patient's home. \n Twenty scientists collaborated on the paper published Thursday. It was funded by grants from the Brazilian Financing Agency for Studies and Projects, the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, and the Itau Bank.  \n Though scientists urge caution about spinal cord injury recovery, Nicolelis believes the findings open the door for paraplegics to realize at least some partial function. \n \"That changes the game,\" he said. \"Instead of just accepting that you will be in a wheelchair, it may mean that with this kind of therapy we will be able to set you up for some kind of partial neurological recovery, which would be phenomenal. Anything that be gained changes these people's lives.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 The News & Observer (Raleigh, N.C.)  \n ", "author": "By Jane Stancill The News & Observer", "title": "Robotics help paraplegics regain movement, scientist says"}

Deputy District Attorney Kurt Mechals said investigators believe the crime occurred in Whittier, near Los Angeles, where Johnny Lewis Hartley, 39, and Mercy Mary Becerra, 43, live. \n Outside the courtroom, Mechals said that he did not know whether the child had drowned in a bathtub or swimming pool, but said it appeared to be a \"residential-type drowning.\" \n Malnutrition and dehydration were contributing causes of death, he said. \n According to Mechals, investigators still were trying to determine what relationship the defendants had to the child, since they are not the parents or related by blood. \n He said he believed they know the child's parents. \n Hartley and Becerra were arrested Tuesday as they tried to cross the border from San Diego into Tijuana. They each pleaded not guilty today in San Diego Superior Court to a single count of murder. \n Judge Frederick Maguire ordered the defendants to remain held in lieu of $2 million bail. \n Few details about the case were discussed in the courtroom, but San Diego police said previously that Mexican authorities found the body of a young girl while screening the duffel bag at a pedestrian crossing in San Ysidro. \n Hartley had been carrying the bag, police said, before he was sent to a secondary inspection area and the bag was put through an X-ray machine. He was turned over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection authorities, then to San Diego police homicide investigators. \n A San Diego homicide lieutenant said Becerra ran off when Hartley was detained, but she was caught a short time later and handed over to U.S. authorities as well. \n Mechals said today that the joint investigation by San Diego and Whittier law enforcement was in its early stages. \n Hartley and Becerra stood side by side during their arraignment, mostly looking toward the floor. \n Mechals said the child appeared to have died sometime this week, shortly before her body was found at the border. He said there were no reports of a missing child in connection with this case. \n Authorities will not release the child's identity or age \"until we've confirmed who it is,\" the prosecutor said. \"We believe we know who it is, but until we've confirmed it, we're going with Jane Doe as the identifying information.\" \n According to Orange County court records, Hartley pleaded guilty in 1999 to involuntary manslaughter and possessing, manufacturing or selling a deadly weapon. A gang enhancement was applied, and he was sentenced to two years and eight months in prison. He received the same sentence in 2005 after being convicted of possessing drugs with the intent to sell. \n After pleading guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in 2010, Hartley was sentenced to three years in state prison. \n Becerra's criminal history appeared to be less substantial. She pleaded guilty in 1992 to a felony of selling or transporting a controlled substance, according to Orange County court records. She was sentenced to 180 days in jail and three years' probation. \n If convicted in the child's death, Hartley and Becerra each face a potential sentence of 25 years to life in prison. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 The San Diego Union-Tribune  \n ", "author": "By Dana Littlefield The San Diego Union-Tribune", "title": "Toddler whose body was found inside duffel bag drowned, prosecutor says"}

The Sheriff's department is seeking her 17-year-old ex-boyfriend, Rory Murga, in the killing. \n PICO RIVERA, Calif. \u00bb A 16-year-old girl used her last words after being stabbed in her Los Angeles-area home to scream the name of the ex-boyfriend she broke up with two weeks ago, helping make him a suspect in her death today, according to the lieutenant in charge of the investigation. \n The girl's screams woke her mother up and roused neighbors from sleep just after 3 a.m. in the quiet neighborhood in Pico Rivera, about 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, Lt. Eddie Hernandez said. \n Elena Moore had been stabbed at least once in the chest, and she collapsed and died in front of her mother a short time after yelling the name \"Rory.\" \n \"She was yelling and screaming his name. It's horrible,\" Hernandez said. \"Can you imagine waking up to the screams of your daughter at 3:15 in the morning and this happens? It's unthinkable.\" \n Investigators were searching for Elena's 17-year-old former boyfriend, Rory Murga. \n Evidence found at the crime scene also tied Rory to the home, Hernandez said. \n Two photographs of Murga were released after investigators searched for him for 12 hours. One showed him with short green hair, and the other one pictured him with longer black hair with a section of bangs dyed light brown. \n A kitchen knife believed to be the weapon used in the attack was recovered inside the home, Hernandez said. \n It was unclear whether Elena let her killer into the home or whether the attacker broke in, he said, adding that damage found to the back door could have happened in the past. \n The stabbing happened downstairs, and Elena was able to run upstairs to her mother before collapsing, Hernandez said. \n Elena, also was known as Lily, and Rory dated for a year until she ended the relationship two weeks ago, he said. \n Elena's Facebook page showed that she began a relationship with Rory last September, but there are few other signs of their connection. \n Kara Wilson, a 15-year-old Palm Bay, Florida, girl who said she was online friends with Elena, said Elena never mentioned a boyfriend and that she's in shock over her death. \n \"At first I didn't believe it happened to her so I tried to call her,\" Kara said. \"She didn't answer.\" \n She said Elena stood out among all her friends because she never posted anything negative on Facebook and even defended those who were being subjected to bullying. \n \"She was always sticking up for people,\" Kara said. \"She was the sweetest.\" \n Elena's home was encircled Friday afternoon with crime-scene tape, and sheriff's investigators were seen taking bloodhounds inside to help them search for the killer.

A federal court in Wisconsin today overturned the conviction of Dassey, now 26, a man found guilty of helping his uncle kill Teresa Halbach in a case profiled in the Netflix documentary \"Making a Murderer.\" \n MADISON, Wis. \u00bb A judge today overturned the conviction of a Wisconsin man found guilty of helping his uncle kill a woman in a case profiled in the Netflix documentary series \"Making a Murderer,\" ruling that investigators coerced a confession using deceptive tactics.  \n U.S. Magistrate William Duffin in Milwaukee ordered Brendan Dassey freed within 90 days unless prosecutors decide to retry him. The state Department of Justice, which handled the case, declined to comment today. The state could also appeal Duffin's ruling. \n Dassey's case burst into the public's consciousness with the popularity of the \"Making a Murderer\" series that debuted in December. The filmmakers cast doubt on the legal process used to convict Dassey and his uncle Steven Avery in the death of Teresa Halbach, and their work sparked national interest and conjecture. Authorities involved in the case have called the 10-hour series biased, while the filmmakers have stood by their work. \n Dassey confessed to helping Avery carry out the rape and killing of Halbach, but his attorneys argued that his constitutional rights were violated throughout the investigation. Dassey didn't testify at his uncle's trial and his confession wasn't presented as evidence there. Both men are serving life sentences. \n Duffin said in his ruling that investigators made false promises to Dassey by assuring him \"he had nothing to worry about.\" \n \"These repeated false promises, when considered in conjunction with all relevant factors, most especially Dassey's age, intellectual deficits, and the absence of a supportive adult, rendered Dassey's confession involuntary under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments (of the U.S. Constitution),\" Duffin wrote. \n Dassey, who is now 26, was 16 when Halbach, a photographer, was killed in 2005 after she went to the Avery family auto salvage yard to take pictures of some vehicles. Court papers describe Dassey as a slow learner with poor grades, with difficulty understanding some aspects of language and expressing himself verbally. He was also described as extremely introverted and poor at picking up on communications such as body language and tone. \n Dassey was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault, and mutilation of a corpse in Halbach's killing. Avery was tried and convicted separately in the homicide. \n Avery made headlines in 2003 when he was released from prison after spending 18 years behind bars for a rape he didn't commit. After being freed, he had a $36 million lawsuit pending against public officials when Halbach disappeared on Halloween 2005. \n Friday's ruling came after Dassey's appeal was rejected by state courts. The judge said that Dassey's confession to police in 2006 was \"so clearly involuntary\" that a state appeals court ruling to the contrary was an unreasonable application of established federal law. \n \"The court does not reach this conclusion lightly,\" Duffin wrote. \n The investigators did not have any ill motive, the judge wrote, but rather \"an intentional and concerted effort to trick Dassey into confessing.\" \n The error was not harmless because Dassey's confession was the entirety of the case against him, the judge said. \n Laura Nirider, one of Dassey's attorneys, said he thought that if he told investigators what they wanted to hear, he'd get to go back to school. \n \"This is justice for that 16-year-old kid \u2026 who we all saw being bullied into giving a statement that was completely untrue,\" she said. \n Dassey, who has been incarcerated for 10 years, is in shock and wants to go home, she said. If prosecutors decide to bring a new trial, the confession would not be usable, she said. \n A brother who has acted as a Halbach family spokesman did not immediately respond to phone messages and an email. \n Kathleen Zellner, an attorney for Avery, said in a statement that Avery was thrilled for his nephew. Avery is pursuing his own appeal. \n \"We know when an unbiased court reviews all of the new evidence we have, Steven will have his conviction overturned as well,\" Zellner said. \n Joe Friedberg, a defense attorney in Minnesota who was not involved in the case but is familiar with it and participated in a forum on it with Avery's first defense attorney, said he doesn't believe the decision will have any bearing on Avery's case. \n \"The kid's confession was not entered into evidence against Avery, and I don't think it impacted Avery's trial at all,\" Friedberg said. \n Netflix last month announced new episodes were in production to follow appeals by both Avery and Dassey. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Judge overturns conviction of nephew in 'Making a Murderer'"}

David Ige and a union representing more than 500 Maui County hospital workers have reached a settlement in negotiations involving the transfer of the state-run Maui Memorial Medical Center, Kula Hospital and Clinic and Lanai Community Hospital, to Kaiser Permanente. \n The state and the United Public Workers will jointly ask the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to lift its injunction halting the privatization and dimiss the union lawsuit, Ige announced at a news conference today. \n Key points of the signed agreement include: \n >> The Maui hospitals will be transferred from Hawaii Health System Corporation management to Kaiser no earlier than Nov. 6. \n >> The Maui hospitals will be operated and managed exclusively by Kaiser. \n >> UPW bargaining unit employees will work under Kaiser supervision, while still being covered by the UPW collective bargaining agreements until their contracts expire on June 30, 2017. \n >> Kaiser will offer all UPW employees jobs for at least six months after their contracts expire. \n In June 2015, Ige signed Act 103 into law, initiating the transfer of the three Maui County hospitals to Kaiser. \n UPW sued the governor in an attempt to stop the transfer, arguing that the privatization violated the U.S. Constitution's contract clause because the administration was seeking to complete the transfer before a union contract expired on June 30, 2017. \n The contracts, which covers blue-collar workers, regulate a range of employment conditions, such as wages, work hours, holidays, sick leave and fringe benefits. \n In May, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily suspended the transfer until September 30 to give the parties a chance to come to an agreement as to how to address any harm that workers might face as a result of the privatization. \n The settlement announced today is expected to end the UPW lawsuit, however, additional legal challenges remain. \n Earlier this week, the Employees' Retirement System filed a lawsuit in Oahu Circuit Court to block a law passed this year that provides severance benefits to union workers who lose their state jobs, even if they are hired by Kaiser. The measure was backed strongly by the Hawaii Government Employees Association, a union that represents another 900 Maui County hospital workers. \n Ige had vetoed the measure, arguing, in part, that it put at risk the tax-exempt status of the ERS, a defined public pension plan. However, the Legislature overrode Ige's veto last month. \n The ERS lawsuit seeks a court injunction, halting the implementation of the law until the ERS can get a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to whether the measure would indeed result in the pension plan losing its tax-exempt status. \n If this were to happen, the lawsuit claims that it could be \"catastrophic\" to the ERS and its 120,000 members, which include current and retired state and county workers. \n ", "author": "By Sophie Cocke scocke@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Governor, UPW reach settlement over Maui hospitals"}

Sweden beat the United Sates on penalty shootout. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n United States' Crystal Dunn dribbled past Sweden's Caroline Seger during a quarter-final match of the women's Olympic football tournament between the United States and Sweden in Brasilia today. \n BRASILIA, Brazil \u00bb The three-time defending champion U.S. women's national soccer team won't win an Olympic medal for the first time after being ousted by Sweden on penalties following a 1-1 draw in the quarterfinals today. \n Tied after three rounds in the shootout, Sweden captain Caroline Seger beat Hope Solo and Christen Press' attempt against Hedvig Lindhal went over the net. With the next kick, Lisa Dahlkvist beat an outstretched Solo for the 4-3 win. \n As Sweden celebrated, U.S. captain Carli Lloyd crouched on the field at Mane Garrincha Stadium. It was the first time that an Olympic women's match had gone to penalties. \n It was the earliest the United States had ever been eliminated from the Olympics since women's soccer became a sport in 1996. \n Sweden is coached by Pia Sundhage, who coached the U.S. team for five years and led the squad to gold medals in both Beijing and London. \n After a scoreless first half, Stina Blackstenius scored in the 61st minute to give Sweden a 1-0 lead. Alex Morgan scored the equalizer in the 78th and the match went to extra time. \n Lloyd had a header called back for offside in the 115th minute, and Lotta Schelin was offside on her attempt against Solo a minute later \u2014 although replays appeared to show otherwise. \n The reigning World Cup champions, who are also four-time Olympic champions, had not dropped a match this year. But it is Sweden that will play either Australia or host Brazil in the semifinals. \n Blackstenius, who came in as a substitute in the first half, broke away and shook off defender Julie Johnston to beat Solo and give Sweden the lead. It was just her second international goal, and Sundhage reacted by high-fiving her assistants on the bench. \n The United States got the equalizer with a shot from Morgan that bounced off a Sweden defender. It was Morgan's team-leading 13th goal of the year. \n Lloyd nearly put the United States ahead in the 85th but her kick to the far corner went just wide. \n The Americans won their first two matches in Brazil before a surprising 2-2 draw in Manaus against Colombia, which had already been eliminated. \n Johnston returned to the starting lineup after missing the last two games with a groin injury and coach Jill Ellis played all her regular starters after rotating and resting many against Colombia in the heat and humidity of the Amazon. Megan Rapinoe, who started against Colombia after missing more than eight months following right knee surgery, was on the bench but came on as a substitute in the second half. \n Press replaced Rapinoe in the extra period. \n Sweden had won only five matches against the United States. At last year's World Cup, the two teams played to a scoreless draw. The last time the two teams met in the Olympics was at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Sundhage was a player on the Sweden team that fell 2-1 to the Americans. \n Ranked sixth in the world, Sweden had struggled in its Olympic group with a 5-1 loss to host Brazil and finished 1-1-1. \n Lloyd buried her head in her hands early in the second half after her free kick was off the mark. Just moments later, she had another that was off-target, too, as the United States struggled to finish throughout the match. \n The crowd at Mane Garrincha Stadium was sparse at the start of the match and never extended much past the lower bowl of the massive 72,000-seat venue that was reconstructed and expanded for the men's 2014 World Cup. \n The fans that were there continued to jeer Solo with shouts of \"Zika!\" every time she touched the ball.

{"date": "August 12, 2016", "text": "PINELLAS COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE VIA AP \n This photo provided by the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office shows Kathleen Marie Steele, 62. Steele was arrested Thursday on a charge of aggravated manslaughter of a child for the death of her 13-day-old baby girl. \n FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u00bb A 6-year-old boy beat his newborn sister to death after their 62-year-old mother left her young children alone in a car for more than a half hour while she went to get her cellphone fixed, authorities on Florida's Gulf Coast said. \n Now the mother, Kathleen Marie Steele, is charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child. \n Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gulatieri said she went to a cellphone repair business in St. Petersburg on Monday and left her children in the car \u2014 the infant, a 3-year-old and a 6-year-old. \n While Steele was gone, the baby began crying and the 6-year-old began beating her to make her stop, the sheriff said. \n \"He was tossing that baby around like a rag doll,\" the sheriff said during a press conference Thursday, shortly after Steele was arrested. \n Nevertheless, \"The mistake is with the adult, Kathleen Steele, not a 6-year-old boy,\" the sheriff said. \n Gulatieri said the boy won't face criminal charges. His mother, who lives in the St. Petersburg area, made her first court appearance Friday, saying only that she understood the charges. Her two sons have been placed in therapeutic foster care. Her attorney Robert Love said he wouldn't contest the state's order for Steele to have no contact with children 18 or younger. \n Love spoke to The Associated Press by phone but declined to comment on the record. \n Gulatieri painted a picture of a single mother who seemed overwhelmed and ill equipped to care for her three young children in the months leading up to the baby's death. He said Kathleen Steele's husband died of cancer in 2011 and she paid a significant sum to be artificially inseminated with his frozen sperm to conceive her 3-year-old son and newborn daughter, who was also named Kathleen. \n She told authorities she even hoped to have more children, Gulatieri said, even though friends and family said she was struggling to raise the children on her own. The two boys were \"running amok and were unsupervised\" to the point that an anonymous caller contacted the state's child protective hotline about them on Aug. 2. \n Steele \u2014 who once lived in a half-million-dollar home \u2014 filed for bankruptcy last year, and an accidental fire forced the family to stay in a hotel last month. While there, the fire alarm went off and Steele told deputies she put little Kathleen in the car carrier but tripped going down the stairs and the baby tumbled out, striking her head. The baby, diagnosed with a minor brain bleed, stayed for two nights in the hospital, Gulatieri said. It was reported to the child abuse hotline, but the sheriff's office said they did a thorough investigation and it appeared to be an accident. \n Days later, a seemingly frazzled Steele took the three children to a pediatrician amid concerns the 13-day-old baby wasn't eating. The doctor found nothing wrong and the family then headed to get Steele's cellphone fixed after the 6-year-old dropped it. The sheriff said video shows Steele left the children alone for 38 minutes while she was in the repair store. \n The 6-year-old told investigators the baby started fussing and he tried to calm her. But deputies said the boy later used a doll to show how he repeatedly slammed the infant's head into the minivan's ceiling, dropping her on the floor, flipping her over and pummeling her. \n The van's ceiling was covered in blood and investigators said the baby was likely dead when her mother returned to the car. Her elder son tried to tell her something was wrong with the baby, but authorities said she disregarded him and stopped at a rental car company before heading home. That's when she noticed the baby's injuries. \n \"The baby was beaten and traumatized,\" the sheriff added. \"There was gross swelling in her face. Her skull was cracked in numerous places.\" \n Even so, Gulatieri said Steele didn't call 911. Instead, she called a neighbor who is a nurse. The nurse recognized the baby was dead, but performed CPR until paramedics arrived. \n Gulatieri called the 6-year-old bright and mature for his age, and said he even reminded his mother that they needed to renew their rental car lease. \n \"The things that he said and his awareness level and how astute that he is, it's amazing really. By hearing him talk you'd never think the kid was six,\" Gulatieri said. \n But the boy also had aggression issues, he said. One neighbor told authorities she wouldn't let her son play with him. Another adult said the boy sucker punched him. \n \"By numerous witness accounts, Kathleen Steele was an inattentive parent and (the boys) were largely unsupervised and had very serious behavior issues,\" the sheriff said. \n Elementary school officials said the boy will not return to the school. \n When asked whether the boy was aware he'd killed his sister, the sheriff said he made a vague reference to his actions. \n \"At one point he said, sometimes people make really bad mistakes.\" \n Steele's relatives were apparently upset with her decision to continue getting pregnant and raising young children by herself. \n \"It caused some dissension within her family that she was doing this because they realized this was something that she should not be doing and it was wrong,\" said Gulatieri, who said she was inseminated by a doctor in New York. \n Steele and her husband had appeared on an episode of the reality TV episode titled \"I'm Pregnant and 55 Years Old.\" \n The sheriff's child protective investigators had been scheduled to evaluate Steele on Aug. 1 about the fall that landed the baby in the hospital. However, she canceled and had rescheduled for Aug 10 \u2014 two days after little Kathleen died. \n When asked about the anonymous call to the child abuse hotline last week, the sheriff said investigators went to the home and met with the family, even though the concerns were vague. \n \"I'm very confident in this case that our child protection division did everything right \u2026 there was no way that anybody in hindsight would look at this and say we should have done something differently.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Newborn baby killed by 6-year-old brother; mother charged"}

Tazzioli was fetching his own birthday cake, when he was injured in a bomb blast overnight. \n HUA HIN, Thailand >> An hour before midnight, Andrea Tazzioli was fetching his own birthday cake, looking forward to celebrating with friends in this balmy beach resort town, a world away from his stressful military work in Afghanistan. \n Then the bomb went off. \n \"I saw light, white light, big explosion and immediately it hurts here in my shoulder, like big fire. And I go down on the floor in blood. Everyone was screaming, the glass broken, table broken, confusion,\" the Italian said Friday from a Hua Hin hospital bed, a place he never expected to turn 51. \n While Tazzioli recovered from blast wounds, other tourists huddled in their hotel rooms, locked down after bombs exploded in at least five areas of Thailand, including popular beach cities, killing at least four people and wounding dozens more. \n British vacationer Darren Hilling was lounging by his hotel pool in Hua Hin when a pair of blasts shook the Friday morning calm, \"quite loud, sounded very close to here.\" \n Those attacks killed one person and wounded three. The Thursday night blast in which Tazzioli was hurt also killed a street vendor and wounded 20 other people in this beach city about 200 kilometers (120 miles) southwest of Bangkok. The 24 injured included Thais, three Germans and other visitors from Italy, Austria and the Netherlands. \n Overnight and into Friday, bombs also went off on Phuket's Loma Beach in southern Thailand and the southern provinces of Trang, Surat Thani and Phang Nga. One person was killed in the Trang blast, which occurred Thursday, and another was killed in the Surat Thani attack on Friday morning. \n Police said it was too soon to say who was behind the attacks, but added that they have ruled out international terrorism or a long-running insurgency in the country's Islamic south. \n Phuket in particular is frequented by millions of European, Chinese and Thai tourists each year who come to swim in the warm, azure sea, party at the open air night clubs and explore tropical rainforests. The other towns hit are less prominent international destinations but still popular among Thais and many foreigners. \n Even as police searched for suspects and fears of more bombs continued, locals said the explosions will be a blow to tourism, a critical source of income. Governments including the U.S., Germany, Australia and Britain advised their citizens traveling in Thailand to take precautions. \n Henrik Buuz, 62, of Denmark sipped beer in a Hua Hin hotel lobby Friday. He said that while he might not have taken security seriously in the past, he no longer felt safe. Streets were eerily quiet for the beginning of a three-day holiday. \n \"No, no, no, no. Now we don't think it's funny anymore,\" said Buuz, as bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled nearby beaches. \n Tourism already suffered a setback nearly a year ago after a bomb blast ripped through a Bangkok, killing 20 people, mostly visitors from other Asian countries. \n Friday's attacks were a new blow. \n \"This ruins business. Hotels, restaurants, tours, we were already suffering, but this, it's going to ruin our lives,\" said Hua Hin Adventure Tours guide Natsupa Dechapanya. \n Natsupa raced Friday from hotel to hotel, visiting clients and warning them not to go outside, especially where people gather. She was also fielding cancellation calls, although she was staying away from her office, opposite a clock tower where Friday's bombs went off. \n \"I'm scared. It's bad,\" she said. \"We think of this as a safe town, but now everyone is fearful. We feel like we're not safe.\" \n Thailand's economy has struggled since a 2014 military coup; investors grew wary and have stayed away, but tourists came back, even after last year's shrine bombing. More than 14 million people visited between January and May 2016 \u2014 up from 12.5 million the year before, according to the Tourism Authority of Thailand. \n Earlier attacks have been tied to political turmoil. The latest explosions came less than a week after voters approved a new, junta-backed constitution. Friday was a national holiday in Thailand marking the Queen's birthday, also Mother's Day. \n Sirasit Teimtontanin, a manager at City Beach Resort in Hua Hin, said one of Friday's explosions went off about 300 meters from the front door. Stores, shopping malls and movie theaters were closed. More than 15 rooms had been canceled within hours. \n \"We've never had anything like this in our city,\" he said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n AP writer Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia, and video journalist Jerry Harmer in Hua Hin, Thailand, contributed to this report.
