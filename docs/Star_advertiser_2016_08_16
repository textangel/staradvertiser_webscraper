{"date": "August 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican Donald Trump is overhauling his campaign again, bringing in Breitbart News' Stephen Bannon as campaign CEO and promoting pollster Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager. \n TETERBORO, N.J. >> Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has slipped in the polls in recent weeks, has shaken up his campaign again. \n The billionaire real estate mogul is bringing in Stephen Bannon of Breitbart News as chief executive officer and promoting pollster Kellyanne Conway to campaign manager. \n \"I've known both of them for a long time. They're terrific people, they're winners, they're champs, and we need to win it,\" Trump told The Associated Press in a phone interview early Wednesday. \n The move comes just 82 days before the November election and represents yet another overhaul of Trump's tumultuous quest for the White House. \n In confirming the campaign overhaul, Trump called Bannon and Conway \"big people\" who can help him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in November. \n Campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who formally took over the reins following the departure of Corey Lewandowski in June, will maintain his current title, Trump said. \n Manafort deputy Rick Gates, who has been traveling often with Trump, is expected to maintain a senior role with the campaign. \n The news, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, comes as opinion surveys show Trump trailing Clinton nationally and in a host of key battleground states. \n Trump long has resisted pleas from fellow Republicans to overhaul the flame-throwing approach on the campaign trail that powered his surge to the top of the GOP field in the primary season. Instead of working to broaden his appeal, Trump has largely hewed to the large rallies and attention-grabbing comments that appealed to the Republican Party base. \n \"You know, I am who I am,\" he told a local Wisconsin television station Tuesday. \"It's me. I don't want to change. Everyone talks about, 'Oh, well you're going to pivot, you're going to.' I don't want to pivot. I mean, you have to be you. If you start pivoting, you're not being honest with people.\" \n Conway called the moves \"an expansion at a critical time in the homestretch.\" \n Details of the new pecking order were hashed out at a lengthy senior staff meeting at Trump Tower Tuesday while Trump was on the road. Additional senior hires are expected in the next few days. \n Trump, whose campaign is built on his persona as a winner, said several time that the campaign is \"doing well,\" and said his speech hours earlier in Wisconsin Tuesday was well-received. \n \"We're going to be doing something very dramatic,\" Trump added. \n Trump's campaign announced earlier that it would finally begin airing its first ads of the general election next week in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. \n While polls have shown Clinton building a lead following the Philadelphia convention, Democrats are fearful that a depressed voter turnout might diminish support among the minority, young and female voters who powered Obama to two victories. \n Clinton said at a voter registration event at a Philadelphia high school that she's \"not taking anybody anywhere for granted\" in the race for the White House, saying the stakes \"could not be higher.\" \n In the Wisconsin outing Tuesday, Trump accused Clinton of \"bigotry\" and being \"against the police,\" claiming that she and other Democrats have \"betrayed the African American community\" and pandered for votes. \n \"We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes \u2014 that's all they care about,\" the GOP nominee said in remarks delivered not far from Milwaukee \u2014 the latest city to be rocked by violence in the wake of a police shooting. \n Trump has been lagging in the polls since he was crowned the GOP standard-bearer in Cleveland last month. He charged that Clinton has been on the side of the rioters in Milwaukee, declaring: \"Our opponent Hillary would rather protect the offender than the victim.\" \n \"The riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and to live in peace,\" he said. \n Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri responded with a statement early Wednesday accusing Trump of being the bigot instead. \n \"With each passing Trump attack, it becomes clearer that his strategy is just to say about Hillary Clinton what's true of himself. When people started saying he was temperamentally unfit, he called Hillary the same. When his ties to the Kremlin came under scrutiny, he absurdly claimed that Hillary was the one who was too close to Putin. Now he's accusing her of bigoted remarks \u2014 We think the American people will know which candidate is guilty of the charge,\" she said. \n \u2014\u2014 \n Pace reported from Washington. \n \u2014\u2014 \n Jill Colvin and Julie Pace on Twitter at http://twitter.com/colvinj and https://twitter.com/jpaceDC \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Republican Donald Trump shaking up campaign"}

It sends the wrong message to friend and foe alike.\" \n Turning to the U.S. Olympic team, she said, \"Team USA is showing the world what this country stands for.\" \n Trump said in a speech Monday that the country's national security requirements demanded \"extreme\" vetting of immigrants seeking admission to the United States, pointing to the threat of the Islamic State group and terrorist elements. \n Clinton had said Monday that the Milwaukee protests showed that the nation had \"urgent work to do to rebuild trust between police and communities\" and said \"everyone should have respect for the law and be respected by the law.\" \n In an interview on Fox News Channel, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker accused Clinton of \"inflaming the situation\" with her comments. \n \"I think people understand in that neighborhood and Sherman Park and in Milwaukee, they want law enforcement to step up and protect them,\" he said, adding that \"statements like that\" from Clinton and a \"lack of leadership\" from President Barack Obama \"only inflame the situation.\" \n Milwaukee's Sherman Park neighborhood erupted in chaos Saturday night after a black suspect was fatally shot by a black Milwaukee police officer. Businesses burned, gunshots rang out and police in riot gear were pelted with rocks and other objects. The violence continued, to a lesser degree, on Sunday night. \n On Tuesday, Trump seized on the riots, accusing Clinton of sympathizing with protesters, who have complained of systemic racism and inequality at the hands of police. \n Trump, who has so far proven deeply unpopular with black voters, made a direct appeal to them Tuesday: \"I'm asking for the vote of every African American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different and much better future.\" \n Democrats, he claimed, have pushed policies that exacerbate poverty and crime. \n \"The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African American community,\" he said. \n Trump has stoked tensions during his campaign.

Wyoming's lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives is up for grabs as voters head to the polls in primary election. \n CHEYENNE, Wyo. >> Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, swept to victory Tuesday in a crowded race for the Republican nomination for Wyoming's lone seat in the U.S. House \u2014 a post once held by her father.  \n Liz Cheney's victory in the Republican primary likely signals that she will win the seat in the general election this fall. Party registration favors the GOP over Democrats better than three-to-one in Wyoming and no Democrat has held the seat since Dick Cheney's predecessor in the 1970s. \n In an interview with The Associated Press, Liz Cheney said Tuesday that she couldn't be prouder of being Dick Cheney's daughter. \n \"Certainly we've been served well by many people in Washington, and it is very special to have been nominated to serve in the seat that my dad held,\" she said. \n Her victory also marks a comeback from her first shot at Wyoming politics in 2014, when she brashly challenged Sen. Mike Enzi, the state's senior Republican. \n Many prominent Wyoming Republicans accused Liz Cheney two years ago of being a \"carpetbagger\" and criticized her for challenging GOP incumbent Enzi when she had only recently moved to Wyoming from Virginia. She quickly dropped out of the race. \n This time around, however, she and seven other Republicans were vying for an open House seat. Rep. Cynthia Lummis' is not seeking re-election. \n A former Fox News commentator and State Department official, Liz Cheney drew on her national contacts in funding her primary victory. She brought in more than $1.5 million through July, banking almost 10 times more money than her next three opponents combined. \n While her opponents tried to hammer on her relatively short residency in the state, Liz Cheney herself focused her campaign largely on attacking President Barack Obama and his administration's energy policies \u2014 which she considers federal overreach \u2014 and national security policies. \n She has emphasized that it's critical to Wyoming, the nation's leading coal producing state, that the EPA roll back regulations sharply limiting emissions from coal-fired power plants. Major coal companies have declared bankruptcy in recent months and Wyoming has seen sharp layoffs among coal industry workers. \n \"We've got to be sure that we save the coal industry, it's a hugely important issue for Wyoming,\" Liz Cheney said. \"Wyoming's representative has got to be somebody who's prepared to lead that fight on a national basis, and I will do so absolutely, no matter who's in the White House.\" \n Dick Cheney was elected five times to the U.S. House seat for Wyoming that his daughter is now seeking. But his legacy cuts both ways. Many Democrats have criticized Cheney's orchestration as vice president of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, calling it a disastrous foreign policy decision. \n Asked if her candidacy serves as a way to try to address criticism of her father's role in the Iraq invasion, Liz Cheney said her campaign has been doing what's necessary to keep the U.S. safe. \n \"We're facing a huge number of challenges now, both in terms of the threats we face from Washington, as well as the threats to our security from radical Islamic terrorism, and those are the things I'm going to be focused on,\" she said. \n Ryan Greene won the Democratic nomination for Wyoming's U.S. House seat and will face Cheney in the general election. Greene is a manager in his family's oilfield services company in Rock Springs. \n Greene said Tuesday night he is \"very excited about the way the results came in.\" \n \"This just became Wyoming versus Washington. The Cheneys are Washington,\" Greene said. \"We've got a lot of work to do, but we're going to continue to work hard, and we're going to show the nation that our state's not for sale.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Liz Cheney wins primary for U.S. House seat her father held"}

Both were treated at the scene and refused further care, he said. \n Firefighters took a little over an hour to extinguish the blaze on the three-level boat, which has an open deck on top and is operated by a motorized paddle wheel. \n Flames could be seen from U.S. Highway 50 along the forested shoreline and smoke was visible miles away from the lake that straddles the Nevada-California line. \n \"The whole cabin, every window, there were flames shooting out,\" said Zach Hastie, a trail guide at nearby Zephyr Cove Stables. \n \"The fire was so hot it was sending the smoke cloud straight up in the air,\" he told The Associated Press. \n Guevin said an unspecified number of other workers on the boat at the time escaped injury. He said the worker who strained his back was on the roof of the pilot house atop the boat when the fire started. \n \"He saw his exit was blocked by smoke and flames, so they went over the railing,\" he said. \n U.S. Coast Guard inspectors from San Francisco arrived Tuesday afternoon to begin investigating the cause of the fire, Guevin said. He said the vessel was still afloat, but suffered severe damage. It wasn't immediately clear if it could be salvaged. \n The Tahoe Queen holds up to 300 passengers when it's running, but tours have been suspended since winter due to the lake's low water level and the boat was undergoing retrofitting. Nearly 300 passengers and a dozen crew members had to be rescued in August 2014 when it hit a sand bar and became stuck about 600 yards off the shore of South Lake Tahoe, California. \n On Tuesday, a Coast Guard crew, fire district boat and locals at the Zephyr Cove resort circled the paddle wheeler soon after the fire began with floating booms to capture any debris, said Kate Warner, the fire district's office manager. \n Guevin said a call to a hazardous materials team was canceled, and there was no indication of any fuel or other leakage into the mountain lake. \n The lake's water quality is strictly regulated by a congressionally-mandated bistate compact, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. \n The first lakefront development approved by the agency in 30 years broke ground Monday next to Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course in Stateline, where the Tahoe Beach Club plans 143 condominiums priced from $1 million to $4.5 million. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "2 injured, fire contained on docked Tahoe paddle wheeler"}

{"date": "August 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The House oversight committee says it has received FBI documents related to the investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. A spokeswoman for the committee says the committee is reviewing documents that are labeled classified. \n WASHINGTON >> Congress received FBI documents related to the agency's recently closed investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state, lawmakers said on Tuesday. \n A spokeswoman for the Republican-led House oversight panel said staff is reviewing documents that are classified as secret. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, said in a statement that the panel received \"FBI witness interview reports, including that of Secretary Clinton's interview, along with other materials from the FBI's now closed investigative file.\" \n The FBI last month closed its yearlong probe into whether Clinton and her aides mishandled sensitive information that flowed through a private email server located in the basement of her New York home. Though he described Clinton's actions as \"extremely careless,\" FBI Director James Comey said his agents found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the Democratic presidential nominee. \n In a statement, the FBI said the materials were provided to Congress consistent with the agency's \"commitment to transparency\" in the Clinton case. The material contains classified information and was provided \"with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed\" without the FBI's agreement, the agency said on Tuesday. \n Furious the FBI didn't press charges against their political rival, House Republicans pressed the agency to release notes from its agents' July interview with Clinton. They claim the FBI notes, which are typically kept confidential after an investigation is closed, may show Clinton provided inconsistent answers to questions about her handling of emails containing classified information during testimony last year before the House Benghazi panel. \n Republicans are also demanding that the Justice Department open a new investigation into whether Clinton lied to Congress. Justice Department spokeswoman Melanie Newman declined to comment Tuesday on the GOP request for a perjury investigation. \n Though the Republicans failed to find evidence to support their claims that Clinton was negligent in preventing or stopping the deadly 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, they are now focusing on questions surrounding the Democratic nominee's haphazard handling of emails containing government secrets. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump routinely criticizes Clinton over her email use when she was secretary of state. \n Clinton said last year that she turned over all 55,000 pages of work-related emails from her server, but said she deleted thousands more she and her lawyers deemed as personal. Clinton also says she never sent any information by email that was marked \"classified.\" \n More than 100 emails exchanged by Clinton were subsequently reviewed and determined to contain information considered classified. Republicans have pointed to three email chains forwarded to Clinton that contained paragraphs marked \"(C),\" signifying they contained classified information, as evidence she lied. \n Democrats, meanwhile, expressed concern that the Republicans would leak snippets of the classified materials carefully selected to make the presidential candidate look bad without providing a fair account of what happened. \n Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said Tuesday the campaign would like the FBI notes to be publicly released in full. \n \"This is an extraordinarily rare step that was sought solely by Republicans for the purposes of further second-guessing the career professionals at the FBI,\" Fallon said. \"We believe that if these materials are going to be shared outside the Justice Department, they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves, rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks.\" \n Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, the ranking Democrat on the House oversight committee, said Clinton did not originate the three email chains in question, which were forwarded to her private account by aides. He said only one of those emails was later determined by the State Department to contain classified information. \n \"The FBI already determined unanimously that there is insufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing,\" said Cummings, D-Md. \"Republicans are now investigating the investigator in a desperate attempt to resuscitate this issue, keep it in the headlines and distract from Donald Trump's sagging poll numbers.\" \n State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that the FBI allowed the department to review emails the agency is providing Congress. \n \"I think we're satisfied after having reviewed these emails that the FBI has made arrangements that the documents will be transmitted subject to appropriate handling controls,\" he said, adding that the department respects the FBI's desire to accommodate the requests of its congressional oversight committees. \n Toner said, however, that the department is still discussing with the FBI the release of additional notes from the interviews investigators did with Clinton and her aides. \n \"My understanding is that we continue to work with FBI on those interview summaries,\" Toner said. \"We haven't quite reached an agreement on those. My understanding is that we have not received them.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press reporter Deb Riechmann in Washington and Ken Thomas in Philadelphia contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n On Twitter follow Michael Biesecker at http://Twitter.com/mbieseck and Mary Clare Jalonick at https://twitter.com/MCJalonick \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Congress receives FBI notes from Clinton interview"}

The woman said she was unconscious at the time and didn't consent to the sex. Parker, who testified that he and the woman had previously had sex, and Celestin maintained that it was consensual. \n Parker was acquitted in 2001. Celestin was convicted of sexual assault, but that was later overturned when the woman opted not to testify again for a 2005 retrial. She sued Penn State and was awarded a settlement out of court. \n Her suffering reportedly continued, however. \n The Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday spoke to S. Daniel Carter, a sexual assault advocate, who said the accuser was \"tormented\" by \"the constant contact and fear of seeing her assailants on campus.\" \n The accuser's brother, identified only as Johnny, also spoke about his sister. \n \"If I were to look back at her very short life and point to one moment where I think she changed as a person, it was obviously that point,\" Johnny told Variety. \"The trial was pretty tough for her.\" \n After the trial, Johnny said, his sister moved around frequently and became a mother to a son with her boyfriend. \n \"I think the ghosts continued to haunt her,\" he said. \n The case largely escaped notice at Sundance, but in a pair of trade interviews published Friday, Parker confronted it straightforwardly. \n \"I was sure it would come up,\" Parker told Deadline. \"I stand here, a 36-year-old man, 17 years removed from one of the painful moments in my life. And I can imagine it was painful for everyone. I was cleared of everything, of all charges. I've done a lot of living, and raised a lot of children. I've got five daughters and a lovely wife.\" \n In the bright spotlight of Hollywood's awards season, far less has hurt a film's chances with Oscar voters. On the other hand, Parker wasn't found guilty and he has faced the case more directly than some Hollywood stars have in the past. \n A lot is on the line for Fox Searchlight, which paid more for \"The Birth of a Nation\" than any previous Sundance film. The movie's striking poster features Parker as Turner with a noose made out of an American flag. The film will play in September at the Toronto International Film Festival. \n In an earlier statement, Fox Searchlight said: \"Fox Searchlight is aware of the incident that occurred while Nate Parker was at Penn State. We also know that he was found innocent and cleared of all charges.

The state Supreme Court invalidated the project's permit last year and ordered a new contested case hearing. Warfield's group, whose acronym PUEO means Hawaiian owl, is allowed to participate in the upcoming hearing. \n The nonprofit organization's board consists of Native Hawaiian elders, Warfield said. \n \"Many people have come forward to thank us for exposing a view that they were afraid to voice,\" said a bullet point in a presentation Warfield showed the Rotary Club. Many don't feel safe expressing support for the telescope, he said. \n Intense protests on the Big Island mountain prompted a halt in construction. \n Telescope officials have said they want a permit in place by the end of the year or early next year in order to resume construction in 2018. Meanwhile, telescope officials are looking for possible alternate sites in case it can't be built in Hawaii. \n A young girl told Warfield she no longer wants to grow up to be a scientist because of the debate, which has pitted family members against each other, Warfield said. \n The group \"is not about choosing sides,\" he said. Rather, it's about showing that culture and science can co-exist and guiding children from \"preschool to Ph.D,\" he said.

{"date": "August 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Firefighters battle the Bluecut Fire along Swarthout Canyon Road in the Cajon Pass, north of San Bernardino, Calif., \n LOS ANGELES >> A new wildfire spread today at a staggering pace in every direction through drought parched canyons east of Los Angeles, growing to 14 square miles in a matter of hours and forcing the evacuation of more than 82,000 of people from mountain communities. \n The blaze in Cajon Pass caused serious problems for a swath of mountain communities. About 82,500 people from some 34,500 homes were under mandatory evacuation orders, San Bernardino County fire spokesman Eric Sherwin said. Some structures had already burned but it wasn't yet clear whether they were homes. \n Evacuated areas included the ski-resort town of Wrightwood, where some 4,500 people live. \n The flames also forced the shutdown of a section of Interstate 15, the main highway between Southern California and Las Vegas. \n As that fire surged, a major blaze north of San Francisco was fading and some 4,000 people in the town of Clearlake were allowed to return home. \n Their relief, however, was tempered with anger at a man who authorities believe set the blaze that wiped out several blocks of a small town over the weekend along with 16 smaller fires dating back to last summer. \n The wildfires were the latest in a weekslong stretch of heat- and drought-driven fires across California that raged well before the official start of wildfire season in early autumn. \n Blue Mountain Farms, a horse ranch in Phelan, was in the path of the fire about 60 miles east of Los Angeles \u2014 just as it was for another fire in the area a year ago. \n \"Breathing smoke again, just like last year,\" Shannon Anderson, a partner in the ranch, said as she panted into the telephone. \"It's raining ash.\" \n Ranch hands used hoses to wet down fences and anything else that could burn. \n Six firefighters protecting homes were briefly trapped by flames and in serious danger before they took shelter in a safe structure, the San Bernardino County Fire Department said in a statement. Two sustained minor injuries and were quickly treated and released from a hospital. \n Investigators in Northern California said today they had been building a case against the suspected arsonist, 40-year-old construction worker Damin Anthony Pashilk, for more than a year but did not have enough evidence to make an arrest until the weekend blaze ripped through Lower Lake. \n Nearly a decade ago, Pashilk was an inmate firefighter while serving time on drug possession and firearms charges, according to California corrections department spokeswoman Vicky Waters. He was completing a five-year sentence when he was assigned to fight wildfires for four months in 2007. \n The fire destroyed 175 homes, Main Street businesses and other structures in the working-class town of Lower Lake. \n \"What I'd do to him, you don't want to know,\" said Butch Cancilla, who saw his neighbor's home catch fire as he fled on Sunday. Cancilla still doesn't know the fate of his own home and spoke at a center for evacuees set up at a high school. \n \"A lot of people want to hang him high,\" his wife, Jennie, added. \n Pashilk has not been implicated in any of the three huge blazes that destroyed more than 1,000 homes in Lake County last summer. Little was known about him, other than his history of drug and driving offenses dating back a decade. \n \"I'm hoping, I'm praying that the man has mental illness \u2014 because if it's not mental illness, then it's evil,\" said Diana Bundesen, who was at the evacuation center after fleeing Clearlake. \n The town was near the site where the fire began. \n Neither the California Department of Forestry, which led the investigation that resulted in Pashilk's arrest Monday, nor the Lake County sheriff or district attorney would discuss what led authorities to him. \n \"Arson investigations are complex and difficult. The evidence standards are stringent,\" forestry department spokeswoman Janet Upton said. \"They have to build a case that is going to be successful, it's complex.\" \n An attorney listed as representing Pashilk did not return a call requesting comment. Pashilk is scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday. \n Roughly 1,600 firefighters were making progress on the blaze as it burned through wilderness. It was 20 percent contained. \n In central California, a wildfire near Lake Nacimiento destroyed 12 structures, damaged others and threatened 200 homes. It was 10 percent contained after growing to 10 square miles and forcing authorities to evacuate some residents by boat. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "S.

{"date": "August 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The surface of a street in Omaha, Neb., was ground down on Aug. 5 before a planned resurfacing. On some streets where the asphalt surface was deemed too far-gone to repair, city policy used to be to grind out the asphalt and replace it with gravel. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Lowell Frederes posed for a photo along 113th Street in Omaha, Neb. on Aug. 10. The city had ground-up the asphalt surface of the street saying it was beyond repair and replaced it with a gravel road. \n OMAHA, Neb. \u00bb For miles and miles Omaha stretches on, one tidy, suburban-style neighborhood after another filled with modern low-slung houses set on spacious lawns with towering oaks and elms. \n It's a model of comfortable mid-American living, with one unusual exception: thanks to a quirk in how Omaha developed, about 300 miles of streets in these nice neighborhoods are pitted with potholes almost big enough to swallow an SUV. \n The bad roads have been both an anomaly and a source of complaints for years. But recently, they've become the center of a mini-crisis after local officials began dispatching crews to tear up the asphalt in the neighborhoods and turn the streets back into dirt roads, much like what existed in the city's frontier days. \n The sudden appearance of miles of dirt road in the midst of urban Omaha has prompted angry protests by residents and showcased a conflict over the public services homeowners should expect when a modern city outgrows some of its old real estate agreements. \n \"No letter, no notice. We just came home on a Tuesday, and our street was ground up,\" said Joe Skradski, a dentist who lives on 113th Street, where a dozen $400,000-and-up houses now line a dirt path. \"Since then, it's been nothing short of a nightmare.\" \n Nearly every U.S. city faces a backlog of needed roadwork as streets built decades ago wear out, but the situation is especially vexing in Omaha, a sprawling city of 435,000 people with 4,800 miles of road and not enough tax revenue to maintain them. \n Decades ago, a number of developers sought permission to lay down asphalt roads rather than longer-lasting concrete in several sections in the middle of town, and to skip installing curbs and gutters preferred by the city. The city agreed, with the understanding that homeowners be responsible for occasional repaving. Some substandard roads also were in areas once outside the city but that were later annexed. \n For years, the arrangement held up. But as the roads began to age and crumble, and as new residents replaced the original homeowners, resentment intensified about a city government that maintained some neighborhoods while ignoring others. \n Said neighbor Bill Manhart, \"It's like living in the country, but in the middle of the city\u2026There's so much dust and mud on the street, what's the point?\" \n A series of meeting between city officials and residents of the affected neighborhoods, which include about 10,000 houses, hasn't resolved the problem. \n \"This is insanity,\" declared City Council member Chris Jerram at one heated council session earlier this year. \n Austin Rowser, Omaha streets superintendent, said the city's position is \"a matter of fairness. Some property owners paid for better streets and a minority didn't.\" \n He added that the city simply can't afford the roughly $300 million bill to fix all the substandard streets. \n That doesn't fly with residents who say that dirt roads or crumbling pavement are unworthy of a well-off community with a growing population, a tiny unemployment rate and four Fortune 500 companies. \n \"Well, gee whiz, if I'm going to be on a gravel street, I don't think they should increase my taxes,\" said resident Terry Hexum, referring to a recent tax assessment hike that would generate revenue for the entire city. He helped organize a protest meeting attended by 200 people about the street dispute. \n Officials have suggested that neighbors create a district to finance repaving, or the more expensive option of rebuilding the streets to city standards, which the city would then maintain. \n But when no agreement was reached, city officials dispatched its bulldozers, saying dirt roads were better than deteriorating asphalt. \n It was not the solution residents were hoping for. \n Signs went up denouncing Mayor Jean Stothert and other city officials, and one businessman filed a lawsuit that sought to force the city to repave the road in front of his $1.8 million home. \n \"So, they say it's not their road,\" said Manhart. \"My question is: When did it become theirs to take, and when did it become ours to fix?\" \n Last month, Stothert announced the city would stop the dirt road conversions, would try to set aside more money for repairs and offered to pay half the cost of repaving three stretches of roads that had prompted some of the heated complaints. It was enough to get businessman Bruce Simon to drop his lawsuit, but no one has come up with a funding plan that would fix all the rough road. \n According to urban planners, the dispute is a case study in how short-term deals that cities make about seemingly minor issues can backfire when the cities and circumstances change. \n Dan Piatkowski, an assistant professor of regional planning at the University of Nebraska, said the dispute is also forcing residents to think about what they get from government. This is especially useful, he said, in a conservative state like Nebraska that is skeptical of government spending. \n Many conservatives believe \"smaller government is better, but we still want our roads to function,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "One city's answer to pothole complaints: new dirt roads"}

{"date": "August 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n John McLaughlin, the conservative political commentator and host of the namesake long-running television show that pioneered hollering-heads discussions of Washington politics, died on Tuesday according to the Facebook page for The McLaughlin Group. He was 89. \n NEW YORK >> John McLaughlin, the conservative political commentator and host of the namesake long-running television show that pioneered hollering-heads discussions of Washington politics, has died. He was 89. \n McLaughlin died Tuesday morning, according to an announcement on the Facebook page of \"The McLaughlin Group\" series. No cause of death was mentioned, but an ailing McLaughlin had missed the taping for this past weekend's show for the first time in the series' 34 years. \n Since its debut in April 1982, \"The McLaughlin Group\" upended the soft-spoken and non-confrontational style of shows such as \"Firing Line,\" \"Washington Week in Review\" and \"Agronsky & Co.\" with a raucous format that largely dispensed with politicians. It instead featured journalists quizzing, talking over and sometimes insulting each other. In recent years, the show billed itself as \"The American Original\" \u2014 a nod to shows that copied the format. \n \"My feeling is talk shows have not kept pace with the breakthroughs and changes in format in television generally,\" McLaughlin told The Associated Press in 1986. \"I began the group as a talk show of the '90s.\" \n He said informing an audience could be entertaining: \"The acquisition of knowledge need not be like listening to the Gregorian chant.\" \n Critics said the show was more about show business and entertainment than journalism and politics. They said it celebrated nasty posturing, abhorred complexity and featured a group of mostly aging conservative white men spouting off on topics they knew little about. \n \"Whether it was the guerrilla strategy of Afghan mujahedeen or the next open-market operation by the Federal Reserve Board, the members of the group always seemed to have just gotten off the phone with the guy in charge,\" Eric Alterman charged in his 2000 book, \"Sound and Fury: The Making of the Punditocracy.\" \n But the format was hugely successful. As McLaughlin himself might have said, on a probability scale from zero to 10 \u2014 zero meaning zero probability, 10 meaning metaphysical certitude \u2014 in the show's heyday, the chances that the Washington establishment were faithfully tuning in each week was definitely a 10. \n The show began with McLaughlin declaring, \"Issue One!\" and often featured the journalists pontificating on four or five issues of the day. It would end with the journalists predicting the future \u2014 usually with a high degree of certainty, if not accuracy \u2014 and McLaughlin declaring, \"Buh-Bye!\" \n The show made stars of its panelists, who could go on to command high-priced speaking engagements and even played themselves in movies such as \"Independence Day,\" \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Watchmen.\" McLaughlin also played himself on episodes of \"ALF\" and \"Murphy Brown\" and was ridiculed as a speed-talking egomaniac by Dana Carvey on \"Saturday Night Live.\" \n The current group of panelists included Pat Buchanan, Eleanor Clift, Clarence Page and Tom Rogan. \n McLaughlin said his aggressive, rapid-fire questions on the show served a purpose. \n \"The intensity of the environment is such so that if people are hesitant to say something, they find themselves saying it anyway,\" he told Howard Kurtz for Kurtz's 1996 book \"Hot Air: All Talk, All the Time.\" \n \"My theory is people say under pressure for the most part what they really mean,\" McLaughlin said. \"In a confrontational situation, you'll get their gut. And I want their gut! And that's why people watch this show!\" \n The 1982 pilot featured syndicated columnists Jack Germond and Robert Novak as well as Chuck Stone of the Philadelphia Daily News and Judith Miller of The New York Times. Stone and Miller were quickly replaced by Pat Buchanan and Morton Kondracke. \n Fred Barnes and Eleanor Clift were added in 1985, after Buchanan left to become Reagan's communications director, giving the show its first woman. \n In July 1984 McLaughlin began hosting \"John McLaughlin's One on One,\" an in-depth interview program. He also hosted a CNBC show, \"McLaughlin,\" from April 1989 to January 1994. \n McLaughlin could be a hard boss to work for. A 1990 article in The Washington Post Magazine by Alterman quoted former McLaughlin staffers Anne Rumsey, Kara Swisher and Tom Miller recalling instances of petty tyranny and McLaughlin leering at female employees. \n His former office manager, Linda Dean, filed a $4 million lawsuit against McLaughlin in 1988, claiming she was fired after protesting his unwanted sexual advances. McLaughlin denied the allegations; the suit was settled out of court in December 1989. \n McLaughlin and his wife of 16 years, former Labor Secretary Ann Dore McLaughlin, divorced three years later. \n In 1997, McLaughlin, then 70, married 36-year-old Cristina Vidal, the vice president of his production company. They divorced in 2010. \n Born March 29, 1927, McLaughlin grew up in a middle class neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island, where his father was a furniture salesman. He trained for the priesthood at Shadowbrook, a small Jesuit seminary in western Massachusetts, and earned master's degrees in philosophy and English at Boston College and a doctorate in communications at Columbia University. \n He worked as an editor at a Jesuit weekly and gave lectures on sex before shocking his friends in 1970 by switching parties to run unsuccessfully as a dovish, anti-war Republican against Rhode Island's hawkish incumbent Democratic U.S. senator. \n He opened a consulting firm and gave up his Roman collar in 1975 to marry longtime friend Dore, who served as secretary of labor from December 1987 to January 1989. McLaughlin became a talk radio show host on a Washington station in 1980, but only lasted a year. \n In 1982, he persuaded wealthy friend Robert Moore, a former aide in the Nixon White House, to underwrite a new form of public affairs television \u2014 and a juggernaut was born. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "John McLaughlin, host of confrontational TV show, dead at 89"}

{"date": "August 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n G. Umi Kai uses a traditional Hawaiian hook to catch a fish at the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in Hawaii. Kai supports a plan to expand the monument. Supporters and opponents of proposed expansion of one of the world's largest marine conservation areas have something in common: They're invoking Hawaiian culture to further their agendas. \n As a Native Hawaiian living in modern Hawaii, one of the times Shad Kane truly felt connected to his ancestors was when he traveled to a remote, 140,000-square-mile area of the Pacific where islands, atolls, islets and coral reefs make up a federally protected marine monument. \n There, at Midway Atoll, he plucked feathers from dead birds to make kahili \u2014 feathers mounted on a long wooden pole that was used to announce the presence of ancient Hawaiian chiefs and became a royal symbol during the Hawaiian monarchy. \n \"Going to Midway and being a part of gathering traditional birds in the manner they did is extremely spiritual,\" the suburban Honolulu man said this month. \"It becomes much more personal for me.\" \n He said seeing Midway strewn with remnants of fishing nets, buoys and hooks helped him realize the surrounding area needs protection, too. \n This year, a group of Native Hawaiian leaders urged President Barack Obama to expand Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, while keeping the main Hawaiian islands outside the boundaries. The move would make the monument about 582,000 square miles, more than twice the size of Texas. \n The White House isn't indicating when a decision will be made. Obama also has been asked to designate new national monuments in Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Maine and elsewhere. \n The effort to expand the Pacific monument has supporters and opponents invoking Hawaiian culture to further their agendas. Some believe expansion of one of the world's largest marine conservation areas will protect a sacred place, while others say making more waters off-limits will harm fishermen for a cause pushed by environmentalists with deep pockets. \n A presidential proclamation established the monument in 2006. Only scientific research and cultural activities are allowed, with commercial fishing and recreational activities such as diving banned. \n Getting there requires taking a flight to Midway Atoll or a sailboat. Under ideal ocean conditions, it takes about two days to sail from Kauai to Nihoa, the closest island to the main Hawaiian islands. \n Some who say the area needs to be open for commercial fishing rely on an argument that's \"completely contrary to the generation that preceded them that actually did go fish and understood the harmful effects\" of overharvesting, said William Aila, deputy director of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. \n Peter Apo opposes adding the massive area to the monument and said doing so contradicts the way ancient Hawaiians managed natural resources. \n Apo is a trustee of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, which supports expansion as long as the agency gets an official say in management of the area, including advocating for Native Hawaiian access. \n It's difficult to be a Native Hawaiian and an expansion opponent, Apo said. \n \"We look like we're bad guys. We're opposing what seems to be addressing a global problem,\" he said of issues like climate change and overfishing that supporters point to. \n He cited how Hawaiians utilized periods of kapu, or temporary restrictions in response to overharvesting. \n \"Food security was critical to Hawaiians,\" Apo said. \n It's difficult to estimate the financial effect that expansion would have on the $100 million per year longline industry, which supplies a large portion of the fresh tuna and other fish consumed in Hawaii, said Sean Martin, president of the Hawaii Longline Association. \n He estimated about 2 million pounds of fish annually come from the proposed expansion area, where vessels string lines ranging from a mile to 50 miles long in the ocean to catch fish. \n G. Umi Kai, who uses his spare time to craft traditional implements such as wooden weapons and fish hooks made of bone, experienced the tranquility, isolation and fragility of the area when he visited last year. \n He fished off rocky shores of two islands in the monument to see if his traditional bone hooks really worked. It was an ideal place for the test, he said, \"because the environment was closer to the way Hawaii was 100 years ago.\" \n Aila, of the home lands department, said he hopes the issue will draw Obama to an international environmental conservation gathering scheduled for next month in Honolulu. \n By expanding the monument, Aila said the president could build a legacy as well as commit the U.S. to fighting environmental problems such as climate change and coral bleaching, which occurs when warm waters lead coral to expel the algae they rely on for food. \n Opponents hope the president sees how divisive the issue is. \n \"I'm not sure that Obama, who was born, raised here, wants to leave a legacy of a divided Hawaii,\" Apo said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Both sides in marine monument fight invoke Hawaiian culture"}

Tom Wolf had urged Kane to resign since she was charged a year ago, and leaders of the state Senate's Republican majority threatened a vote to order her removal from office if she didn't step aside immediately. \n Wolf today called Kane's situation \"unfortunate.\" \n \"Her decision to resign is the right one, and will allow the people of Pennsylvania to finally move on from this situation,\" Wolf said in a statement. \n Wolf gave no details about any plan to appoint a replacement for the remainder of Kane's term, which was due to end in January. The Senate would have to approve his pick. Voters will select a new attorney general in the November election. \n The two years of turmoil in her office left Kane isolated in Pennsylvania's political, legal and law enforcement communities. She saw an exodus of top aides and fumbled corruption cases, and she made a string of eyebrow-raising accusations that later turned out to be unfounded. \n After she was charged, the state Supreme Court suspended her law license, and she drained campaign funds to pay legal bills. She became the second attorney general to resign in disgrace since voters first elected an officeholder in 1980; Ernie Preate in 1995 was the first. \n Kane, 50, ran as an outsider in 2012, financed by campaign cash from her then-husband's family trucking fortune. On the campaign trail, she promised to investigate why it took her Republican predecessors three years to charge former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky with child sex abuse and whether politics played a role. \n She won in a landslide, becoming the first Democrat and woman ever elected to the office, and earned early praise from Democrats for refusing to defend a legal challenge to the state's law banning recognition of same-sex marriage. The law was struck down in 2014. \n Kane's honeymoon as attorney general ended in March 2014, when The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that she had shut down an undercover sting that had caught a Philadelphia judge and five state lawmakers taking cash payments or gifts. \n Kane's criticism of the Sandusky case had triggered a bitter feud with the investigators who handled the case, and Montgomery County prosecutors say she suspected they had leaked the unflattering story to the Inquirer. \n Seeking payback, she ordered aides to leak secret investigative information to the Philadelphia Daily News in an effort to show that her perceived enemies had bungled a 2009 probe into a Philadelphia NAACP official, prosecutors said. \n \"This is war,\" she wrote in a 2014 email to a political strategist. \n A special appointee concluded that the Sandusky case had not been dragged out for political reasons. But the inquiry unearthed a trove of interoffice emails containing sexually explicit images and crude jokes about women and minorities. \n As authorities began building the leak case against her, Kane ordered the release of email chains, saying the misconduct allegations against her were concocted by a corrupt network inside law enforcement to stop her from exposing their raunchy exchanges. The email scandal ultimately precipitated the resignations of several high-profile state officials, including two state Supreme Court justices. \n But the judge would not allow Kane's lawyers to raise the email scandal in court as the motive to prosecute her. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pennsylvania attorney general resigns a day after conviction"}

{"date": "August 16, 2016", "text": "TEQUESTA, Fla. \u00bb A 19-year-old Florida State University student with no criminal record fatally stabbed a couple at random in their garage, wounded their neighbor and was biting the dead man's face when deputies finally subdued him, authorities said today. \n Martin County Sheriff William Snyder told reporters that Austin Harrouff may have been on hallucinogenic drugs when he attacked Michelle Mishcon, 53, and John Stevens, 59, at their Tequesta home late Monday. \n The sheriff said Harrouff joined his family for dinner at a restaurant a short distance away when he stormed off, apparently agitated about slow service. His parents were so worried by his behavior that they called police and some of his fraternity brothers in a futile attempt to find him before the attack. \n About 45 minutes later, he apparently targeted the couple at random, the sheriff said. \n \"It's inexplicable,\" Snyder said. \"One of the first things we try to do at a crime scene is try to understand the motive of the offender, because it is the motive of the offender that gets us going in the right direction. In this case, we can't establish a motive. It's 'I don't know.'\" \n Snyder said Harrouff stormed out of the nearby Duffy's, a popular sports bar and restaurant, at about 8:30 p.m. He said the would-be rescuer, identified by family as 47-year-old Jeff Fisher, called 911 at 9:20 p.m. to report the attack, which apparently began in the garage where the couple liked to sit at night. \n The son of a dentist, Harrouff is muscular \u2014 he wrestled and played football at Suncoast Community High School in nearby Riviera Beach, where rosters listed him at 6-feet-tall and 200 pounds. He's been a sophomore at FSU, majoring in exercise science. \n When the first deputy arrived minutes later, she used her Taser on Harrouff, but it didn't faze him, he said. She tried pulling him off Stevens' body, but couldn't. Other deputies arrived shortly along with a dog and it took all of them to subdue Harrouff. Snyder said they didn't shoot, fearing their bullets would strike the victim. \n \"The suspect in this case was abnormally strong,\" Snyder said, making him think Harrouff was on drugs. He said hospital blood tests showed no signs of methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin or other common drugs; it will take longer to test for less common hallucinogenic drugs such as flakka or bath salts. \n Stevens died in the driveway. Mishcon was found dead in the garage. \n Stevens owned a lawn service and the couple enjoyed boating, neighbors said. \n \"John and Michelle were the nicest people,\" neighbor Amy Lourie said. She said they would sit in the garage with the door open while watching television and wave and talk to passersby while their Labrador retriever played in the yard. She said they would drive around the neighborhood in their golf cart with the dog sitting with them. \n \"It was the cutest thing,\" Lourie said. \n She said it isn't surprising Fisher would try to rescue them, saying he and the couple were close friends. Fisher's father, Steve Fisher, told WPTV his son was stabbed five times \u2014 once in the neck, three times in the back and once in the side. He is expected to survive. \n Dr. Wade Harrouff declined to comment about his son's arrest. It is unknown if Austin Harrouff has an attorney. \n Tequesta is a small, affluent community on the Atlantic coast about 20 miles north of Palm Beach. \n Flakka had a brief burst in popularity in late 2014 and 2015, primarily in South Florida, but its usage quickly waned after stories circulated about users' deaths and mental breakdowns, and a crackdown was carried out in China, where it has been manufactured. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Sheriff: Florida man kills couple, tries to bite face off man"}

He was flanked by his attorneys Todd Eddins, left, and Richard Sing. \n Big Island Mayor Billy Kenoi has asked a Circuit Court judge to dismiss all the charges filed against him, according to the Hawaii Tribune Herald. \n Kenoi's trial is scheduled for Oct. 10 in Hilo before Honolulu Circuit Judge Dexter Del Rosario after all current Big Island judges recused themselves. \n A hearing on the motions will be held Sept. 16 in Hilo. \n Defense attorney Todd Eddins filed three motions Aug. 8 to dismiss the indictment as well as a motion seeking dismissal of the two felony theft charges. \n Kenoi is also facing three counts of tampering with a government record and a single count of making a false statement under oath \u2014 all misdemeanors. \n One of the motions to dismiss the indictment is based on \"violation of the defendant's right to a fair and impartial grand jury proceedings,\" while another is \"based on violation of (Kenoi's) due process rights,\" according to court records. \n The motion to dismiss the two second-degree theft charges, both Class C felonies that carry a possible five-year prison term upon conviction, are \"based on failure to provide adequate notice as to the terms of the charges,\" court records indicate. \n The charges stem from a yearlong investigation by the state attorney general's office into the mayor's misuse of his county credit card, also known as a pCard. The investigation started after Big Island newspapers reported Kenoi used his pCard to pay an $892 tab at Club Evergreen, a Honolulu hostess bar. \n The mayor charged nearly $130,000 in charges on the government credit card between January 2009 and March 2015. \n Kenoi reimbursed the county for $22,292 in personal charges between those dates. He later paid back approximately $9,500 more after the newspapers published stories examining his pCard use. \n By law, Kenoi cannot run for re-election this year since he has reached the two four-year terms as mayor. \n He will be succeeded in December by former Mayor Harry Kim, who won Saturday's primary election. \n ", "author": "By Star-Advertiser staff", "title": "Kenoi asks for dismissal of felony theft, other charges"}

{"date": "August 16, 2016", "text": "GREG BARNETTE/THE RECORD SEARCHLIGHT VIA AP, FILE \n In this July 29, 2016, file photo, Edwin Lara, a security guard at Central Oregon Community College in Bend, Ore., waits in court in Yreka, Calif., for his arraignment. The murder of Kaylee Sawyer, from Bend, Ore., followed by a string of other crimes leading from Oregon through California allegedly committed by Lara has the scenic mountain town or Bend, Ore., deeply shaken. \n BEND, Oregon \u00bb He had everything going for him: a job and good career path in law enforcement in a scenic Oregon mountain town, the trust of his colleagues, a wife and a house. Then one recent night, police say, he killed a young woman. \n Edwin Lara then traveled to the state capital, kidnapped another woman and took her to California, where he shot a man and carjacked a vehicle with three people inside, police allege. After a chase over 100 mph on the main freeway along the West Coast, the California Highway Patrol arrested Lara. \n Many people in Bend, where Lara worked, are reeling. A former lumber town at the foot of the Cascade Range, Bend has seen its population more than quadruple over the past 25 years to 87,000. People are drawn by its sunny climate, its hiking, skiing, fishing and cycling opportunities and by its microbreweries. \n It is a friendly town, but crime, even homicide, is nothing new. Bend averaged one murder or manslaughter per year since 1985, according to FBI statistics. Police say many were related to domestic violence. \n There is no indication Lara knew the young woman he is charged with killing. Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel announced Monday that a grand jury charged Lara with four counts of aggravated murder, alleging that \"Lara kidnapped Kaylee Sawyer, then he attempted to sexual assault her, and then he killed her to conceal the commission of the crimes.\" \n What many here find particularly disturbing are the accounts of an average resident going off the rails so completely. Lara was a public safety officer at Central Oregon Community College in Bend. His wife is a police officer. \n \"This is such a hit on so many levels,\" said Aimee Metcalf, assistant director of college relations. \"We always felt safe here, but when something like this happens, it hits everyone in their core. Even more distressing is that a campus safety officer was involved.\" \n A local newspaper, The Source Weekly, asked in a full-page article: \"What prompted his alleged crime spree?\" So far, there are no answers. \n On July 24, soon after midnight, Sawyer went for a walk after arguing with her boyfriend. They lived on the edge of the community college campus, which is shaded by tall ponderosas and boasts mountain views. Lara, uniformed and equipped with pepper spray, handcuffs and a ballistics vest, was working that night on a shift to end at 2 a.m., James Bennett, interim director of campus public safety, said in an interview. \n The next day, Lara's wife, Isabel Ponce-Lara, noticed that Lara was \"acting out of the ordinary,\" according to a statement she made to police in their hometown of Redmond, just north of Bend. \n Ponce-Lara, who recently became a Bend police officer, told Redmond investigators she confronted her husband and that he broke down and told her he struck Sawyer with his patrol vehicle, killing her, and then panicked and hid the body. \n Ponce-Lara said after Lara broke down, he grabbed his 9 mm Glock pistol and fled. Sawyer's body was later found in a canyon about 8 miles west of Redmond. \n Hummel rejects Lara's account. Hummel indicated to The Associated Press he has evidence to support the charges but cannot discuss it. The Deschutes County Circuit Court on Thursday sharply limited what lawyers can say about the case. \n Lara's lead attorney, Benjamin Kim, told the AP on Monday that \"under the confines of the court order, we really cannot comment.\" \n In Salem, 130 miles from Bend, Lara is accused of taking 19-year-old Aundreah Maes at gunpoint after she got off work at a clothing store and drove with her to Yreka, California. \n On July 26, police say Lara shot a man at a motel in that former gold-mining town, critically wounding him, and then carjacked a vehicle at a gas station with a woman and her two sons inside. He released them along Interstate 5 before being pulled over by the highway patrol. \n In addition to the aggravated murder charges in Oregon, Lara is charged in California with attempted murder, kidnapping, carjacking and other offenses. \n Many of the tenants at Awbrey Pines apartments, where Sawyer lived, are students and have been shaken by the killing, said Kim Ritchie, a manager for the firm that owns the complex. Parents have expressed concern. \n \"There's definitely a change in the vibe,\" Ritchie said. \"This is a reminder for people to be aware of their surroundings and follow safe practices.\" \n Lara, 31, first served as a cadet with campus security while earning his associate degree in criminal justice at Central Oregon Community College, said Bennett, the head of campus public safety. He was later hired at an hourly wage and was on track to becoming a full employee. \n \"I can't look into his mind and see what might have made him snap,\" Bennett said. \"All I can do is look into his history.\" \n But no answers are there. Lara passed a background investigation before being hired. \n \"He was a quality candidate,\" Bennett said. \n Bennett feels Lara betrayed his colleagues and profession, and it weighs heavily on him. \n \"This is one of the most difficult moments of my life,\" Bennett said. \"Our hearts go out to Kaylee's family.\" \n Hummel said he'll meet with the family before deciding whether to seek the death penalty. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Two-state crime rampage leaves many in Oregon town reeling"}
