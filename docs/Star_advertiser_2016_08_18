{"date": "August 18, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort talks to reporters on the floor of the Republican National Convention at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland as Rick Gates listens at back left. \n WASHINGTON >> Donald Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort resigned today in the wake of campaign shake-up and revelations about his work in Ukraine. \n In a statement issued as he arrived in Louisiana to tour the flood-ravaged state, Trump said Manafort offered his resignation this morning. The billionaire called Manafort \"a true professional.\" \n \"I am very appreciative for his great work in helping to get us where we are today, and in particular his work guiding us through the delegate and convention process,\" Trump said. \n Manafort's resignation comes a day after The Associated Press reported that confidential emails from Manafort's firm contradicted his claims that he had never lobbied on behalf of Ukrainian political figures in the U.S. \n Trump's son, Eric Trump, told Fox News in an interview that will air Sunday that his father worried questions about Manafort's past were taking attention away from the billionaire's presidential bid. \n \"I think my father didn't want to be, you know, distracted by whatever things Paul was dealing with,\" Eric Trump said. \n Emails between Manafort's deputy, Rick Gates, also a top Trump adviser, and the lobbying firm Mercury LLC showed that Manafort's firm, DMP International LLC, directly orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine's then-ruling political party. \n The effort included not just legislative outreach but also attempts to sway American public opinion and gather political intelligence on competing lobbying efforts in the U.S. \n The emails obtained by the AP do not describe details about the role of Manafort, Gates' boss at the firm. But current and former employees at Mercury and a second lobbying firm, the Podesta Group, some of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they are subject to non-disclosure agreements, told the AP that Manafort oversaw the lobbying efforts and spoke by phone about them. \n Manafort and Gates never registered as foreign agents for their work as required under federal law. \n Under the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act, people who lobby on behalf of foreign political figures or political parties must provide detailed reports about their actions to the Justice Department's counterespionage unit. A violation is a felony and can result in up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. \n Also Friday, Ukrainian anti-corruption investigators released copies of handwritten ledgers detailing possible cash payments from Ukrainian political figures to Manafort totaling more than $12 million. Details of the payments described in the ledger were first reported by The New York Times. Manafort denies receiving those payments. \n Earlier this week, Trump brought in a new campaign chief executive and campaign manager following a disastrous stretch in which the New Yorker committed a series of errors and fell behind Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in both national and battleground state preference polls. \n The new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, had described Manafort and Gates as part of a new \"core four\" atop the Trump operation with her and CEO Stephen Bannon. But Manafort's role in the campaign had been significantly marginalized under the new leadership structure announced Wednesday. \n Neither Manafort nor Gates were taking a paycheck from the Trump campaign as of June 30, according to campaign finance reports filed with federal regulators. Manafort had said on several occasions he didn't plan to be paid for his work for Trump. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort resigns"}

Mississippi officials say heavy rains last week and through the weekend damaged roads in six counties in the southern part of the state. \n BATON ROUGE, La. >> It's been a long, hot summer of pain and grief in Louisiana, its capital city engulfed by a string of tragedies that began with the killing of a black man at the hands of police. Then there followed the retaliatory slayings of three officers and now days of deadly floods. \n Baton Rouge, the unassuming neighbor to hard-partying New Orleans of Mardi Gras fame, is enduring its latest turmoil with the catastrophic flooding. But stricken residents of the Baton Rouge area say they've seen people pull together \u2014 white and black, officers and civilians \u2014 in ways that give optimism as the high water begins to recede. \n Anger. Sorrow. Vengeful glee. Guilt. Terrence Carter has experienced it all during Baton Rouge's summer of tribulation. On Thursday, as he walked through the murky water on the floor of his home, Carter said he was experiencing, of all things, hope. \n The tragedies began July 7 with the shooting death of a black man at the hands of two white police officers, followed by the July 17 ambush killings of three officers by a black man, and now, the rains that inundated thousands of homes and businesses. There've been more than a dozen deaths. \n \"A couple of weeks ago, it seems like everybody was pulling apart. Now it's no black and white thing. Everybody's just got to help everybody to come out of this,\" Carter said. \n Carter, who is black, knew Alton Sterling, the black man killed outside a Baton Rouge convenience store after a struggle on the pavement. Angered by Sterling's death, the soft-spoken Carter protested at police headquarters. He confesses he was initially happy when he first heard about the deadly assault on the officers by an attacker who was then fatally shot. \n Then he felt guilty about the officer deaths: \"Their families lost them. They had kids who'll be growing up without a father.\" \n Then came the rains, which sent 4 feet of water into his home. The stench is overpowering and the task ahead daunting. \n One sure sign of how the city has unified has been the \"Cajun Navy,\" a corps of regular citizens who have gone out on boats to rescue people stranded in their houses. One of those rescuers was Sterling's aunt, Sandra. \n When floodwaters began rising near her Baton Rouge home last Saturday, she stayed to help her neighbors get out, first by school bus, then by boat. Sterling estimates she and others helped more than 200 people reach dry ground last weekend. \n While pushing for justice for the nephew she helped raise, Sterling also has helped lead the calls for peace in the grief-stricken city. \"I couldn't save his life, but I can probably save a lot more now. That's what really motivated me to go out,\" Sterling said Thursday. \n Flood waters are largely receding across southern Louisiana. \n But at least 13 people have died, and authorities are going door to door looking for more. Over 85,000 people have registered for federal disaster assistance, more than 30,000 have been rescued, and an estimated 40,000 homes have been damaged. \n The anti-police rhetoric seems to have quieted somewhat, as officers once viewed with suspicion are now often the ones risking their lives to rescue people. They are also struggling with flooding of their own. Roughly 20 percent of East Baton Rouge's sheriff's deputies have been driven from their homes. \n Capt. Darryl Armentor, whose team of deputies has rescued countless people in recent days, said he hasn't had time to fully process this summer's events or express the toll they have taken on police and other emergency workers. \n \"There's no time for stress now. We just work,\" he said. \"It hasn't stopped.\" \n For Armentor, the pain has been personal. He knows the parents of one of the officers involved in Sterling's shooting. He knew the sheriff's deputy killed in the ambush and the one who was critically wounded. And then the flooding left half a foot of water in his house. \n There is, of course, fear that as the floodwaters recede, so will this sense of unity. That will be the test. \n \"This is a critical juncture where communities can decide to go one direction or another,\" said Albert Samuels, a professor at the city's predominantly black Southern University. \"The issues that existed before the storm will exist after the storm. It will be interesting to see how the city handles this.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press reporter Melinda Deslatte contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Baton Rouge's summer of grief: Shootings, unrest, now floods"}

{"date": "August 18, 2016", "text": "NASA / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n An illustration of explosions from a white dwarf star. \n It's not every day you get to see a star go nova. Scientists at Warsaw University Observatory in Poland have managed to catch a binary star system both before and after its explosive flash.  \n The findings, described in the journal Nature, confirm a long-held theory about novae known as the hibernation hypothesis \u2014 and could potentially help scientists better understand when such stellar outbursts occur. \n Novae are typically caused by a gravitationally locked pair of stars, called a binary system, consisting of one white dwarf and a companion star. A white dwarf is an aging star that has already shed much of its mass, leaving behind a small but massive core. Like a gravitational vampire, the white dwarf siphons off material from its stellar companion into its own accretion disk \u2014 and every so often, the system becomes so unstable that the white dwarf erupts, producing a cataclysmic explosion that causes it to flare brightly in the night sky. \n \"The most spectacular eruptions, with a ten-thousandfold increase in brightness, occur in classical novae and are caused by a thermonuclear runaway on the surface of the white dwarf,\" the study authors wrote. \"Such eruptions are thought to recur on time scales of ten thousand to a million years.\" \n Such explosions might actually have seeded the universe with some elements and radioactive isotopes, such as lithium (which is used in battery manufacturing), said lead author Przemek Mroz, an astronomer at the observatory. \n Around 50 novae go off every year in the Milky Way, but only five to 10 are actually observed because most of them are shrouded by interstellar gas and dust, Mroz said in an email. The closest and brightest, however, can potentially be picked out with the naked eye. \n But while novae can be seen once they go off, scientists don't often get the chance to study them in depth before they explode. \n Researchers have long had a theory about the cycle that causes these novae: When the mass transfer is low (less than a billionth of the sun's mass per year), the accretion grows unstable; every so often, stuff gets dumped onto the white dwarf in what the authors called \"dwarf nova outbursts.\" \n But those are just the lead-up to the classical nova, that enormous flare-up in the sky. When the classical nova explosion finally occurs, it actually boosts the mass-transfer rate for centuries, keeping the system more stable until it dwindles and begins to approach the \"hibernation\" period, thus repeating the process. \n But scientists couldn't say what was really happening until the nova V1213 Cen flashed in 2009 and was caught by the university's Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. \n \"This discovery would be impossible without long-term observations by the OGLE survey,\" Mroz wrote in an email. \"The survey started almost 25 years ago and for 20 years we have had a dedicated 1.3-meter telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. This is another case when OGLE data are crucial for studying unique, extremely rare phenomena.\" \n The scientists had been observing V1213 Cen since 2003, giving them six years' worth of data to analyze in the run-up to the big flash, and they continued to study it for years afterward. \n \"Thanks to long-term pre- and post-eruption observations, we can trace the nova evolution very precisely and (compare) it with theoretical models,\" Mroz said. \"Our observations are consistent with the hibernation hypothesis predictions (but of course are NOT a definitive proof of this scenario).\" \n Ultimately, these findings may better help researchers to understand the evolution of binary stars (and, because they produce at least some of the elements that populate the universe, into the makeup of the universe). \n For now, scientists continue to monitor the binary star. Mroz said he wants to make spectral observations of V1213 Cen in order to better understand the system's properties as well as conditions in the accretion disk around the white dwarf. \n \"V1213 Cen is now slowly fading,\" the study authors wrote. \"What will be its fate? We can expect that the system will remain bright for a few decades and then it will again transform into a dwarf nova, following the hibernation theory predictions.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times  \n ", "author": "By Amina Khan Los Angeles Times", "title": "Scientists catch white dwarf star in the act of exploding into a nova"}

Harrouff played nose tackle for the varsity football team and was a member of the wrestling team. \n FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u00bb John Stevens IV says he doesn't need to know exactly what led a teen to allegedly kill his father and stepmother.  \n Or why the teen allegedly gnawed on his dead father's face. \n What Stevens does want is for prosecutors to seek the death penalty against Austin Harrouff, the 19-year-old Florida State University student accused of slaying John Stevens, 59, and Michelle Mishcon Stevens, 53. \n \"It is not super important to me what his mindset was,\" Stevens said of Harrouff today. \"I just want to see the prosecutor ask for the death penalty. I want him to go through that process and to pay for what he did.\" \n Ivy Stevens, John Stevens' daughter, echoed her brother's sentiments about what she wanted to happen next. \"I hope he makes a full recovery so he can be put through the justice system,\" she said. \n Harrouff, who was visiting family and friends on summer break, stormed out of a family dinner at Duffy's Sports Grill in Jupiter on Monday evening, walked about three miles and then killed John Stevens and Michelle Mishcon Stevens as they sat in the garage of their Tequesta home, Martin County Sheriff William Snyder said. \n The couple suffered stab wounds and blunt-force trauma during the attack, officials said. A motive hasn't been established, and it doesn't appear Harrouff knew the couple, Snyder said. \n A neighbor, Jeff Fisher, 47, was stabbed several times when he tried to intervene before deputies arrived. Fisher has since been released from the hospital and is home with family, the Sheriff's Office said. \n John Stevens IV, 28, said today he's grateful Fisher confronted the attacker. \n \"Jeff from across the street is a hero,\" he said. \"Without Jeff he could have easily gone from that house to the next one.\" \n It took several deputies and a canine to subdue Harrouff, who was grunting, making animal-like noises and chewing John Stevens' face. A stun gun seemed to have no effect, and it appeared Harrouff had \"abnormal strength,\" Snyder said. \n On Thursday, Harrouff was in stable condition at the hospital, heavily sedated and using a breathing tube, officials said. Detectives have not been able to question him. \n He tested negative for common street drugs, including methamphetamine, cocaine and heroin, according to the Sheriff's Office. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is conducting further testing that would detect the presence of flakka or bath salts. The blood tests were sent to the FBI for in-depth testing, the Sheriff's Office said. \n The Martin County Sheriff's Office is working with prosecutors on the charges against Harrouff, a sheriff's spokeswoman said today. \n On the night of the slayings, Harrouff's mother called police and reported her son missing. Mina Harrouff told officers her son suddenly started acting strangely about a week ago and was claiming to be immortal and have superpowers. \n Her son had no history of mental illness or heavy drug use, Mina Harrouff told police. \n To his college fraternity brothers and former teammates on the high school football team, Harrouff was a \"gentle giant,\" as one friend called him. At Riviera Beach's Suncoast High, coaches told him he needed to show more aggression, some recalled.  \n In a series of videos Harrouff posted on YouTube in the days before the attack, he suggests that although he had used steroids in his bodybuilding pursuits, he no longer needed them. On his college recruiting profile, he listed himself as 6 feet tall and weighing 200 pounds. \n \"I don't need drugs,\" he says in one of his most recent videos. \" I know that they can change me. But the thing is that's not being healthy, you know.\" \n In watching the videos, and considering the brutal murders in which Harrouff is suspected, South Florida drug expert Jim Hall questioned if muscle-building steroids may have contributed to the unbridled rage.  \n \"Rage episodes usually occur when they are off the drug,\" said Hall, an epidemiologist at Nova Southeastern University. \"Before I even saw the videos, having heard of his background as an active athlete, I thought this may not be excited delirium, but steroid rage.\" \n Hall, an expert in flakka, says he has doubts that the synthetic drug \u2014 not as available as it once was \u2014 played a role in Harrouff's behavior. \"There could be other human growth hormone issues with similar effects,\" Hall said. \n John Stevens IV said today he would be surprised if drugs emerged as an explanation for Harrouff's actions.

Paleontologists with Seattle's Burke Museum have unearthed the bones of a Tyrannosaurus rex that lived more than 66 million years ago, including a rare nearly complete 4-foot long skull, which was unloaded at the Burke Museum today. The skull excavated in Montana in 2016 is not the same as the one pictured. \n SEATTLE \u00bb Paleontologists with Seattle's Burke Museum have unearthed the bones of a Tyrannosaurus rex that lived more than 66 million years ago, including a rare nearly complete 4-foot long skull. \n The remarkable discovery includes the dinosaur's vertebrae, ribs, hips and lower jaw bones, and represents about 20 percent of the meat-eating predator. \n Several dozen scientists, volunteers, students and others worked over the summer to excavate the bones in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, a site well known for fossil finds. \n The team later encased the massive skull in a protective plaster cast, lifted the 2,500-pound load onto a flatbed truck with the help of local Montana ranchers and drove it to Seattle. The skull was unloaded at the Burke Museum today. \n The plaster-covered skull will be on display to the public for several weeks starting Saturday. Over the next year, paleontologists will painstakingly work on removing the rock around the skull. \n Scientists estimate the dinosaur is 85 percent the size of the largest T. rex discovered and, based on the size of its skull, lived about 15 years. They believe this T. rex roamed the earth in the late Cretaceous period. \n There are only 14 other nearly complete T. rex skulls that have been found, the museum said. \n \"We think the Tufts-Love Rex is going to be an iconic specimen for the Burke Museum and the state of Washington and will be a must-see for dinosaur researchers as well,\" Gregory Wilson, a University of Washington biology professor and adjunct curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Burke Museum, said in a statement. He led the expedition team. \n The T. rex is named after two museum paleontology volunteers, Jason Love and Luke Tufts, who were combing for fossils when they came across large fossilized vertebrae sticking out of a rocky hillside last summer. \n The two were with a team collecting fossils as part of the Hell Creek Project, currently led by Wilson and started by Jack Horner, who discovered the world's first dinosaur embryos, and Nathan Myhrvold, former Microsoft chief technology officer who is a Burke Museum research associate. \n The team knew the fossils belonged to a meat-eating dinosaur because of the large size and appearance of the bones, but they weren't sure whether it was a T. rex. They didn't have the chance to excavate further until this summer when they returned to the site. \n Over the course of a month, Burke paleontologists and others used tools such as jackhammers, axes and shovels to dig up the bones. They first removed about 20 tons of rock and then dug further to uncover pelvic bones and other parts. \n More digging led to the most amazing find: the right side of the T. rex skull, including snout and teeth. \n Scientists think the other half of the skull is there as well. They plan to return to the site next year to search for that and other dinosaur parts. \n Horner, a Burke Museum research associate who built a vast collection of dinosaur specimens while at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana, said in the statement that the discovery was \"one of the most significant specimens yet found.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Rare Tyrannosaurus rex skull arrives at Seattle museum"}

While Democrat Hillary Clinton has spent more than $75 million on advertising in 10 states since locking up her party's nomination, Trump's new investment marks his first of the general election season. \n The step into swing-state advertising, which came after Trump's second staffing shake-up in as many months, did little to alleviate the concerns of Republican officials frustrated with Trump's refusal to adopt the tools of modern-day political campaigns. \n \"We may have reached the point of no return for Donald Trump,\" said Republican strategist Alex Conant, a senior aide to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's presidential campaign. \n In addition to Bannon, Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway filled the campaign manager position left vacant since Trump fired his former campaign chief almost two months ago. \n But Trump struck a new, inclusive tone today, as he worked to improve his dismal poll numbers among non-white voters. \n \"I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream,\" he said. \n Conway insisted that the new team would help re-focus the nominee, without sacrificing the authenticity that fueled his successful primary campaign. \n \"We're going to sharpen the message,\" Conway told CNN. \"We're going to make sure Donald Trump is comfortable about being in his own skin \u2014 that he doesn't lose that authenticity that you simply can't buy and a pollster can't give you. Voters know if you're comfortable in your own skin.\" \n Rarely do presidential campaigns wait to advertise, or undergo such leadership tumult, at such a late stage of the general election. \n Yet Trump has struggled badly in recent weeks to offer voters a consistent message, overshadowing formal policy speeches with a steady stream of self-created controversies, including a public feud with an American Muslim family whose son was killed while serving in the U.S. military in Iraq. \n He now trails Clinton in preference polls of most key battleground states. And his party leaders, even at the Republican National Committee, have already conceded they may divert resources away from the presidential contest in favor of vulnerable Senate and House candidates if things don't improve. \n Trump's advertising plans highlight his shrinking path to the presidency. \n Although Trump claims his popularity with white, working-class voters could translate to victories in states such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Maine or Connecticut, there's little evidence to back that up. His first major ad buys shows him focused on more conventional battlegrounds. \n Trump is spending at least $1.4 million in Florida, $1 million in Pennsylvania, about $831,000 in North Carolina and $746,000 in Ohio, according to Kantar Media. His biggest single-market investment comes in the Philadelphia area. \n \"That is the most direct route to 270,\" said Chris Young, RNC field director. \"Those states are critical on that pathway.\" \n Trump has struggled so far with women, minorities and young voters. \n \"His performance with those voters is so dismal that it puts other states potentially in play in an offensive way for Democrats,\" said Jeremy Bird, who ran field operations for President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign and is now advising Clinton's operation. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "In a first, Trump says he regrets painful comments"}

{"date": "August 18, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, joined by New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton, left, and others, meets with law enforcement leaders at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York today. \n NEW YORK >> Hillary Clinton's family foundation will no longer accept foreign and corporate donations if she is elected president, and will bring an end to its annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting regardless of the outcome of the November election. \n Former President Bill Clinton made the announcement at an afternoon meeting with foundation staff members, according to participants who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity ahead of the formal announcement. \n Bill Clinton said the foundation plans to continue its work, but intends to refocus its efforts in a process that will take up to a year to complete. The former president, who turns 70 on Friday, said he will resign from the board, and the foundation will only accept contributions from U.S. citizens and independent charities. \n It will no longer take money from any foreign entity, government, foreign or domestic corporations, or corporate charities. A Clinton spokesman said the former president will also refrain from delivering paid speeches until the November election and will no longer give paid speeches if Hillary Clinton is elected president. \n At the staff meeting, Clinton said he and his daughter, Chelsea Clinton, did not face any external pressure to make the changes, but wanted to avoid any potential issues or second guessing for Hillary Clinton should she move into the White House. \n The future of the Clinton Foundation has been one of the overarching questions shadowing Clinton's campaign. \n The sprawling charitable network, founded after Bill Clinton left office in 2001, has raised more than $2 billion for initiatives focused on global health, climate change, economic development and increasing opportunities for women and girls. \n While Hillary Clinton stepped down from its board after launching her 2016 campaign, her husband and daughter have remained in leadership roles, prompting questions about the ability of the organization to continue its work should Clinton win the White House. \n Some of the group's funding has come from foreign donations and political donors to the Clinton family. Money accepted from countries such as Saudi Arabia drew scrutiny from both Republicans and Democrats early in Clinton's presidential bid. \n Republicans said the changes fell short and urged the Clinton Foundation to immediately stop receiving foreign donations. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said the announcement was \"too little, too late,\" adding, \"if everything was above board while Hillary Clinton ran the State Department as the Clintons have said, then why change a thing?\" \n Priebus said the foundation \"should immediately cease accepting foreign donations and return every penny ever taken from other countries, several of which have atrocious human rights records and ties to terrorism.\" He said the foundation's continued acceptance of foreign donations during Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was a \"massive, ongoing conflict of interest that gets bigger by the day.\" \n When Clinton served as secretary of state, the foundation reached an agreement with the Obama administration to prohibit, and in some cases curtail, foreign donations to its programs. \n But questions persist about the level of influence foundation donors had at the State Department. That criticism intensified after emails from Clinton's time at the department were made public as part of a lawsuit. \n After she left the State Department, the foundation resumed accepting donations from overseas. Bowing to pressure in April 2015, the group announced that it would restrict donations to only six Western nations and disclose its donors more frequently. \n Former Sen. Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, questioned Hillary Clinton at length about the foundation and potential conflicts of interest in early 2009 during her nomination hearing. He was pushing for more transparency than what was ultimately agreed upon between the foundation and the Obama transition team. \n Lugar said moving forward, if she wins the White House, he hopes she and Bill Clinton make a completely clean break from the foundation to avoid anyone thinking that favor is being given to people who helped out the foundation. \n \"The Clintons, as they approach the presidency, if they are successful, will have to work with their attorneys to make certain that rules of the road are drawn up to give confidence to them and the American public that there will not be favoritism,\" Lugar said earlier this week. \n Members of the Clinton Foundation board met earlier in the day to ratify the changes. \n In September, the former president will convene his 12th and final Clinton Global Initiative, an annual meeting that has included Obama, foreign heads of state, corporate leaders and celebrities to discuss commitments aimed at addressing poverty, health care, education, climate change and other topics. The foundation has estimated that commitments by its members have improved the lives of more than 430 million people in more than 180 countries. \n Bill Clinton said that similar meetings like the Clinton Global Initiative America and CGI International will end with next month's meeting. He said he was hopeful that his organization could continue CGI University, an annual meeting of students held on a college campus in the spring. \n \u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Lisa Lerer and Eileen Sullivan contributed from Washington. \n \u2014\u2014 \n Follow Ken Thomas on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/kthomasdc \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton's foundation to alter donations policy if elected"}

{"date": "August 18, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Secretary of State John Kerry, spoke to senior adviser John Kirby before a Oct. 2015 news conference in Vienna. The State Department says a $400 million cash payment to Iran was contingent on the release of American prisoners. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb The Obama administration said today that a $400 million cash payment to Iran seven months ago was contingent on the release of a group of American prisoners.  \n It is the first time the U.S. has so clearly linked the two events, which critics have painted as a hostage-ransom arrangement. \n State Department spokesman John Kirby repeated the administration's line that the negotiations to return the Iranian money \u2014 from a military-equipment deal with the U.S.-backed shah in the 1970s \u2014 were conducted separately from the talks to free four U.S. citizens in Iran. But he said the U.S. withheld the delivery of the cash as leverage until Iran permitted the Americans to leave the country. \n \"We had concerns that Iran may renege on the prisoner release,\" Kirby said, citing delays and mutual mistrust between countries that severed diplomatic relations 36 years ago. As a result, he explained, the U.S. \"of course sought to retain maximum leverage until after the American citizens were released. That was our top priority.\" \n Both events occurred Jan. 17, fueling suspicions from Republican lawmakers and accusations from GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump of a quid pro quo that undermined America's longstanding opposition to ransom payments. \n Trump spokesman Jason Miller sought to blame Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for the payment, even though it happened almost three years after she departed as secretary of state. He said the money was \"likely used to fund terrorism,\" without providing any such evidence, and said Clinton had proven herself unfit to be president. \n Kirby spoke a day after The Wall Street Journal reported new details of the crisscrossing planes on that day. U.S. officials wouldn't let Iran bring the cash home from a Geneva airport until a Swiss Air Force plane carrying three of the freed Americans departed from Tehran, the paper reported. The fourth American left on a commercial flight. \n Earlier this month, after the revelation the U.S. delivered the money in pallets of cash, the administration flatly denied any connection between the payment and the prisoners. \n \"Reports of link between prisoner release & payment to Iran are completely false,\" Kirby tweeted at the time. \n The money comes from an account used by the Iranian government to buy American military equipment in the days of the shah. The equipment was never delivered after the shah's government was overthrown in 1979 and revolutionaries took American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The two sides have wrangled over that account and numerous other financial claims ever since. \n President Barack Obama has said his negotiators secured the U.S. a good deal on a busy diplomatic weekend that also included finalizing the seven-nation nuclear accord. But he and other officials have consistently denied any linkages. \n \"We actually had diplomatic negotiations and conversations with Iran for the first time in several decades,\" Obama said Aug. 5, meaning \"our ability to clear accounts on a number of different issues at the same time converged.\" \n \"This wasn't some nefarious deal,\" he said. \n The agreement was the return of the $400 million, plus an additional $1.3 billion in interest, terms that Obama described as favorable compared to what might have been expected from a tribunal set up in The Hague to rule on pending deals between the two countries. U.S. officials have said they expected an imminent ruling on the claim and settled with Tehran instead. \n Some Iranian officials immediately linked the payment to the release of four Americans, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, who had been held in Iranian prisons. \n Another of the prisoners, pastor Saeed Abedini, also had linked the two events. He said that as the prisoners waited for hours at an airport to leave Iran, a senior Iranian intelligence official informed them their departure depended on the plane with the cash. U.S. officials had pinned the delays on difficulties finding Rezaian's wife and mother, and ensuring they could depart Iran with him. \n House and Senate Republicans have peppered the administration for more details about the transaction. \n \"If it quacks like a duck, it's a duck. If a cash payment is contingent on a hostage release, it's a ransom. The truth matters and the president owes the American people an explanation,\" Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said today. \n Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., the chairman of the Senate Banking national security subcommittee, said he sees congressional hearings as necessary for answering questions. \n The House Financial Services Committee hasn't yet decided whether to hold hearings. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., who chairs the Financial Services oversight and investigations subcommittee, asked the Treasury and Justice departments and the Federal Reserve last week to provide all records related to the $400 million payment as well as the names of government officials who authorized the payment and those who objected to the cash transfer. Duffy wants responses by Aug. 24. \n Congress returns from a lengthy recess after Labor Day. \n Associated Press writer Richard Lardner contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "$400M to Iran was 'leverage' for hostage release, State Department says"}

{"date": "August 18, 2016", "text": "STAR-ADVERTISER \n Dan Grabauskas resigned as executive director and CEO of the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation today. \n Honolulu rail's embattled CEO and executive director Dan Grabauskas resigned today, the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation's board chairwoman announced this morning. \n Colleen Hanabusa announced the resignation after the board emerged from a private executive session at its regularly scheduled meeting downtown. Before today, the board had already spent more than 16 hours discussing the matter in private as part of Grabauskas' annual review and given itself two 60-day extensions since April to keep those talks going. \n Hanabusa said Grabauskas will get severance of $282,250 and that the board has executed a \"separation agreement.\" She said his last day on job is today but that the official separation date is in October. \n Grabauskas, who had attended the meeting before the executive session, was not present when the resignation was announced. \n Hanabusa also said that she will talk with Mayor Kirk Caldwell today about appointing Michael Formby, the director of the city's Department of Transportation Services and a board member, as acting rail director while the board seeks a permanent replacement. Formby would step down from the HART board to take the interim appointment. \n Hanabusa appointed board member Colbert Matsumoto as chairman of the search committee. \n \"We are very thankful to Dan for all of his years of dedicated service to the rail project,\" Hanabusa said in a statement released by HART. \"The project got off to a strong start because of his energy and enthusiasm. We wish him well.\" \n Grabauskas said in the HART news release, \"It has been an honor and a pleasure to have worked on this transformational project for nearly 4-1/2 years. I believe in the project and its importance to the residents of Oahu, and by stepping aside today I hope to allow HART to move forward to ultimate success with fresh leadership.\" \n Grabauskas was in the second year of a three-year contract and earned $299,250 a year. \n The estimated price tag for the rail project has skyrocketed in recent months as the recently reshuffled HART board spent hours at a time discussing Grabauskas' job. The HART executive has attributed much of the escalating costs to the island's red-hot construction market, which he's pointed out has hit other building projects on Oahu as well. \"It's bad luck,\" he said in June. \n Nonetheless, some members on the board, led by Chairwoman Colleen Hanabusa, and other island leaders have sharply criticized Grabauskas' guidance in the past couple of years, as well as HART's seeming inability to anticipate or warn the public of the skyrocketing costs. \n In 2015, Grabauskas and rail officials told state lawmakers that a five-year rail tax extension would likely be more than enough to complete the project. It now faces a renewed deficit of at least $8.3 billion, according to the latest official estimates. \n \"Every step along the way, we've missed the numbers,\" Formby said in June. In recent months Grabauskas has kept a lower profile at HART board meetings, often deferring to agency staff to answer all of the board's questions. He's also deferred to Hanabusa and Formby to handle most media queries, even though he traditionally handled that task before Hanabusa became chairwoman. \n In April, City Council Chairman Ernie Martin, who at the time was considering a run against Mayor Kirk Caldwell, called on Grabauskas to resign. The rail agency director has affirmed that he wants to stay on, however. Caldwell has criticized Grabauskas, but he hasn't called for Grabauskas' resignation, saying it's up to the board to decide. \n Caldwell, who appointed Hanabusa to the board, did encourage the HART body last spring to look \"long and hard\" at what he felt were recent communication snafus. Hanabusa, a Democrat, is running to replace the late U.S. Rep. K. Mark Takai in Congress. \n Former congressman and City Councilman Charles Djou, who looks to unseat Caldwell in this fall's mayoral race, held a press conference Wednesday ahead of the HART meeting to call for Grabauskas' dismissal. \"The leadership of rail has been a complete disaster \u2026 and I think the dismissal \u2026 will be an important initial step to rebuilding trust in City Hall with this disastrous rail project,\" Djou said. \n ", "author": "By Marcel Honor\u00e9 mhonore@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Grabauskas resigns as HART's chief executive"}

Superintendent Johnson says he will recommend the firing of seven officers involved in the Oct. 2014 shooting death of black teenager Laquan McDonald. \n CHICAGO \u00bb Seven Chicago police officers should be fired for filing false reports in the fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald in 2014, the police superintendent said today, in a move aimed at repairing the reputation of a department dogged by decades of cover-ups and scandal. \n The release last year of official police reports that directly contradicted video evidence of McDonald's shooting by a white police officer turned a spotlight on longstanding concerns about a \"code of silence\" in Chicago's police force, in which officers stay quiet about or conceal possible misconduct by colleagues. \n Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a statement today that after reviewing documents, video and other evidence, he was accepting the recommendation of the city's inspector general to fire seven officers because of their accounts of the incident. \n The officers violated Rule 14, which prohibits \"making a false report, written or oral,\" said Johnson. He did not name the seven officers. \n Johnson will take his recommendation to the city's police board, which will make the final decision on whether the officers should be fired. The process typically takes about seven months, so any decision to fire the officers is not likely until next year. \n Johnson became the superintendent after Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired Superintendent Garry McCarthy because of the McDonald shooting video and his recommendation marks the single biggest decision he has made for a department long dogged by suspicions that it condones or covers up the brutality and misconduct of its officers. \n Community activists praised Johnson's announcement, saying the rare move shows he is serious about overhauling the department's practices. \n \"I think Eddie Johnson gets it. He gets the crisis that we are in and how to solve it,\" said Jedidiah Brown, a leader of a group called Chicago Life, which has participated in protests against the police. \n \"I've never heard of this before,\" said Thomas Gradel, a co-author of Crime, Corruption and Cover-ups in the Chicago Police Department, a 2013 report published by the University of Illinois at Chicago. Gradel said this is a step toward real reform. \n \"I don't see how they can change back to the way things were before,\" he said. \n Johnson's decision stems from a scene that unfolded on dashcam video taken in October 2014 in which Officer Jason Van Dyke can be seen firing 16 times at McDonald, including when McDonald was on the ground. The release of the video the next year \u2014 on the orders of a judge \u2014 sparked days of protests, an investigation of Chicago police practices by the U.S. Justice Department and promises of reforms by Emanuel who found himself scrambling to restore public confidence in his office and the police force. \n Prosecutors filed first-degree murder charges against Van Dyke, who has pleaded not guilty. \n The subsequent release of police reports raised serious questions about the accounts of other officers at the scene, which contradicted what was on the video and portrayed McDonald as more of a threat than he appeared to be in that footage. As investigations into the incident continued, a judge took the rare step of appointing a special prosecutor to examine the actions of the officers who were at the scene. \n Included among hundreds of documents that the city has released are officers' accounts describing McDonald menacingly advancing on police and waving a knife threateningly at them right before Van Dyke fired. \n Van Dyke's partner, Joseph Walsh, told an investigator that he repeatedly yelled \"Drop the knife!\" at McDonald and backed up as the teenager advanced at the officers. Further, he supported Van Dyke's claim saying McDonald \"swung the knife toward the officers in an aggressive manner\" and that he believed McDonald was \"attempting to kill them.\" \n Another wrote that, Van Dyke \"in defense of his life \u2026 backpedaled and fired his handgun at McDonald.\" \n Multiple officers wrote that even after McDonald had been shot he still posed a threat. \n \"McDonald fell to the ground but continued to move and continued to grasp the knife, refusing to let go of it,\" one report reads. \n But the video belies those accounts. \n In it, Van Dyke is seen stepping from a squad car and shooting almost immediately. After one or two shots, McDonald collapses, barely moving except for slight twitches as bullets pummel his body. Court filings by prosecutors say all but a few of the 16 shots hitting McDonald were fired over 13 seconds as he lay in the street. Prosecutors say the 3-inch blade was found folded into the handle. \n The inspector general's report centered on the actions of 10 officers, including the seven whom Johnson says should be dismissed. Two of the officers cited in the report have since retired.

The mountain rescue team chief in the French town of Chamonix said today that two women, a Slovakian and a Polish-British, and their German guide were climbing Mont Blanc's Mont Maudit at 13,450 feet when a tower of ice swept over them early Tuesday. \n PARIS \u00bb Rescue workers have found the bodies of three alpinists buried in an avalanche of ice and snow near a summit of Mont Blanc and dug them out with chain saws and a backhoe, a mountain rescue chief said today. \n French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve announced an investigation into the circumstances of the accident early Tuesday. Rescuers were only alerted to the missing climbers 36 hours after the accident. \n The bodies of two women, a 32-year-old Slovakian and a 33-year-old dual Polish-Briton, were discovered Wednesday night. The body of the 50-year-old German guide was recovered early today, said Lieut. Col. Stephane Bozon, who heads the mountain rescue team in the French town of Chamonix. \n The three were climbing Mont Maudit, a summit of Mont Blanc, 13,450 feet high before dawn Tuesday when a tower of ice swept over them and they fell 500 feet to their deaths. \n Rescue workers had to use chain saws and a backhoe to free them from the ice, Bozon said by telephone. He said blocks of ice had fractured as the team climbed, creating an avalanche of ice and snow. \n A statement by the interior minister said 16 gendarmes, two dogs and a helicopter were mobilized to find the victims and recover their bodies. \n Bozon said his team was alerted only Wednesday evening to the missing climbers. Two other groups of climbers in the zone had said that no one was buried by the avalanche. \n A New Zealand guide was killed in the same sector by an avalanche of snow on June 20. \n Cazenueve said there have been eight fatal mountain accidents in France since last Saturday. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "3 die in icy Mont Blanc avalanche; bodies dug out with saws"}
