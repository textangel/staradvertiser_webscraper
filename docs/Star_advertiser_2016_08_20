{"date": "August 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRSS \n People carry dead bodies into ambulances after an explosion in Gaziantep, southeastern Turkey. A bomb attack targeting an outdoor wedding party in southeastern Turkey killed several people and wounded dozens. \n ISTANBUL >> A child suicide bomber killed at least 51 people and wounded nearly 70 others at a Kurdish wedding party near Turkey's border with Syria, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday, decrying the attack as an attempt by Islamic State extremists to destabilize the nation by exploiting ethnic and religious tensions. \n The bombing late Saturday in Gaziantep was the deadliest attack in Turkey this year. \n It comes amid ongoing struggles between the government and Kurdish militants linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, and as the country is still reeling from the aftermath of last month's failed coup attempt, which the government has blamed on U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen and his followers. \n Erdogan said immediately after the Gaziantep attack, which he blamed on IS, that any strategy \"meant to incite the citizens against each other along ethnic and religious lines will not work.\" \n Later, addressing the nation before Istanbul's city hall, Erdogan said the attacker in Gaziantep was aged between 12 and 14. He said 69 people were wounded, with 17 of them in critical condition. \n He again blamed the attack on the Islamic State, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility. \n The pro-Kurdish political party HDP condemned the attack on the wedding, which it said was attended by many of its party members. \n It said in a statement that it was \"quite significant\" that the attack, which it also blamed on IS, came only hours after the Kurdistan Communities Union, a militant liberation organization that includes the PKK, announced plans to try to negotiate to end a three-decade conflict between Kurdish militants and the Turkish government. \n \"This attack targets those determined and persistent in peace, resolution, and those struggling for democracy, equality, freedom and justice,\" the HDP said. \"The attack was planned to disable the spread of peace and success of possible negotiations.\" \n A bus driver who shuttled some of the guests from Siirt to Gaziantep said that he couldn't believe the party was targeted. \n \"This was a wedding party. Just a regular wedding party,\" Hamdullah Ceyhan told the state-run Anadolu Agency. \"This attack was deplorable. How did they do such a thing?\" \n The bride and groom weren't in life-threatening condition and were undergoing treatment, but the groom's sister and uncle were among the dead, Anadolu reported. \n Multiple opposition parties denounced the attack, as did many foreign governments including the U.S., Germany, Russia, Egypt, Sweden, Greece, France, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan. \n \"We stand by our ally Turkey and pledge to continue to work closely together to defeat the common threat of terrorism,\" said U.S. Ambassador to Turkey John Bass. \n In the Vatican, Pope Francis led hundreds of people in silent prayer for the victims of the attack, concluding by asking \"for the gift of peace for everyone.\" \n Security expert Metin Gurcan, a former Turkish military officer and columnist for the online newspaper Al-Monitor, said that IS who view the attack as \"hitting two birds with one stone\" \u2014 as retaliation for Syrian Kurdish advances on their forces in Syria, and for Turkey's attacks on IS targets. \n Gurcan said in an email to The Associated Press that IS has been trying to agitate or exploit ethnic and religious tensions in Turkey, and \"we know very well to what extent wedding attacks can sow disorder in nation's social fabric from the Afghanistan experience.\" \n The suicide bombing follows a June attack on Istanbul's main airport where IS suspects killed 44 people. A dual suicide bombing blamed on IS at a peace rally in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in October killed 103 people. \n Meantime, there have also been ongoing attacks claimed by the PKK or linked to the militant group, as well as the coup attempt blamed on Gulen's movement. Gulen has denied any involvement. \n Earlier this week, a string of bombings blamed on the PKK that targeted police and soldiers killed at least a dozen people. A fragile, 2\u00bd year peace process between the PKK and the government collapsed last year, leading to a resumption of the three-decade-long conflict. \n In the immediate aftermath of the Gaziantep bombing, Erdogan said there was \"absolutely no difference\" between IS, Kurdish rebels and Gulen's movement, calling them terrorist groups. \n Gurcan said, however, that it was a \"grave mistake\" to lump the three together. \n \"Putting these three organizations with different political objectives, tactics and techniques into the same basket \u2026 causes the failure of tailoring specific counter strategies,\" he said. \n Following the attack, police sealed off the site of the explosion and forensic teams moved in. Outside the perimeter, hundreds of residents gathered chanting \"Allah is great\" as well as slogans denouncing attacks. \n Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek and the country's health minister traveled to the scene, visiting the wounded and inspecting the site. \n \"This is a massacre of unprecedented cruelty and barbarism,\" Simsek told reporters. \"We \u2026 are united against all terror organizations. They will not yield.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Young suicide bomber attacks Turkey wedding party; 51 dead"}

{"date": "August 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Hillary Clinton speaks at a fundraiser for Democratic congressional candidates hosted by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, in San Francisco. \n WASHINGTON >> Democratic mega-donors, including George Soros and Tom Steyer, are putting millions of dollars into efforts to put Hillary Clinton in the White House and win control of the Senate. Their investment comes as Republicans worry about not only the chances of their nominee Donald Trump, but also his effect on down-ballot races. \n Yet few of the GOP's biggest donors have put major money into Trump efforts, a striking change from four years ago when Mitt Romney had more million-dollar donors on his side than did President Barack Obama. They're also not rushing to help save the Senate, based on the July reports from GOP super PACs. \n The presidential candidates and many outside groups detailed their July fundraising and spending to the Federal Election Commission on Saturday. Here are some highlights: \n SOROS RETURNS \n Billionaire after billionaire appeared on the latest fundraising reports from Democratic super PACs. \n Super political action committees face no restrictions on how much money they can take from individual, corporate and union donors. Liberals have decried these groups as bad for democracy \u2014 yet they've leaned on them to help win races, saying they don't want to disarm against Republicans. \n In July alone, New York hedge fund billionaire George Soros gave $1.5 million to Planned Parenthood's super PAC and $35,000 to Priorities USA, both working to elect Clinton, as well as $500,000 to the Senate Majority PAC. Other million-dollar donors to Priorities USA include the creator of diet product Slim-Fast, Daniel Abraham, and Donald Sussman, a financier who is divorcing Maine Rep. Chellie Pingree. \n Soros's latest contributions bring his 2015-2016 super PAC total to more than $14 million \u2014 a fivefold increase from his super PAC investments during the previous presidential election. \n BILLIONAIRE EFFORTS \n Across the country, California hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer is feeling similarly generous. \n Last month, he pumped another $7 million into his super PAC, called NextGen Climate Action Committee. In the past two years, he has put into $38 million into the group, which works to defeat politicians who don't believe in human-caused climate change. \n NextGen also is spending heavily to help Clinton, including by giving millions of dollars to labor union super PACs that back her. \n Another billionaire with his own super PAC, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, gave $5 million in July. The group, called Independence USA, backs candidates who want stricter gun control measures. \n Although that often means championing Democrats, the super PAC recently began spending to help Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey retain his seat in a tough contest. Bloomberg praised Toomey's support of expanding background checks as his chief motivation for doing so. \n Bloomberg has also endorsed Clinton. \n DAD BOOSTS SENATE BID \n The Senate Majority PAC, a group with ties to Minority Leader Harry Reid, netted $7.3 million in July \u2014 its best fundraising yet this year. One of its top donors was Thomas Murphy, a Florida construction executive whose son Patrick Murphy is likely to face off with Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. The younger Murphy is a Democratic representative who had worked with his family's company before being elected to office. \n Other $1 million donors to Senate Majority PAC were the Greater New York Hospital Association Management Corporation, a network of heath care facilities in the northeast, and the Laborers' International Union of North America. \n On the Republican side, the Freedom Partners Action Fund is typically among the biggest groups spending in Senate races. In July, it counted a single donor, hedge fund billionaire Paul Singer. He gave $1 million. \n Freedom Partners is one of many political and policy groups steered by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, who are uncomfortable with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and have decided to concentrate on down-ballot races. Likewise, Singer is not a Trump backer. \n Singer also gave $1 million in July to the Republican-backing Senate Leadership Fund. He was joined by Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus. The contributions of those two men accounted for about 80 percent of the super PAC's July fundraising \u2014 a sign that the numerous GOP donors on the sidelines in the presidential campaign aren't all moving their money down ballot, as some had predicted. \n TRUMP HELPERS \n A pro-Trump group called Great America PAC landed its biggest contribution yet in July, $100,000 from billionaire Charles Johnson, a backer of vanquished GOP Trump opponent Jeb Bush and owner of the San Francisco Giants. Great America PAC has spent about $2 million on Trump-themed ads, most of which are aimed at getting viewers to call in to pledge money to the group. \n Another Trump group, Make America Number 1, is funded exclusively by hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, new filings show. He gave the group $2 million in July, making him Trump's most generous supporter yet. Mercer was a major funder of Ted Cruz, Trump's toughest opponent in the long primary race. \n Mercer's impact on Trump is evident: Not only is he a super PAC donor, but he also funds Breitbart News, whose leader Stephen Bannon became the campaign's chief executive officer this week, and Cambridge Analytica, a data company now doing business with the campaign. \n PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES INCREASE SPENDING \n Trump and Clinton accelerated their campaign spending last month, though the Republican did so far more dramatically. \n New campaign documents show Trump's campaign spent $18.5 million in July, more than double its expenditures a month earlier. Still, that's far short of the $38 million Clinton's campaign spent last month. In June, her campaign had spent about $34 million. \n Clinton can afford to spend more: Her campaign brought in more than $52 million in July, compared to the roughly $37 million the Trump campaign netted. That amount includes a $2 million donation from Trump himself. \n Clinton's report shows her campaign's work to bring small donors into the fold is paying off. Her Democratic primary rival, Bernie Sanders, had strong appeal online and had routinely trounced her on the small-money front. In July, contributors giving $200 or less accounted for $11.4 million of Clinton's fundraising \u2014 roughly double the amount they gave her in June. \n But even having raised less than Clinton overall, Trump outpaced her when it comes to small donors. Contributors giving $200 accounted for $12.7 million of his campaign fundraising. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Democratic donors step up efforts on Senate, Clinton bids"}

{"date": "August 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Fredericksburg, Va. \n WASHINGTON >> Donald Trump's campaign expenses more than doubled last month, even as the Republican presidential nominee held his payroll to about 70 employees, aired zero television advertisements and undertook no significant operational buildout across the country. \n Instead, about half of the campaign's $18.5 million in spending was vacuumed up by Giles-Parscale, a web design and marketing firm new to national politics, Federal Election Commission filings show. It's a crossover vendor from Trump's real estate organization. \n The campaign paid Giles-Parscale $8.4 million in July, about twice what the San Antonio firm had collected from it over the course of the preceding year. Brad Parscale, the president, is the campaign's director of digital marketing. \n The big expense came as Trump put a new emphasis on online fundraising, after paying for his primary run mostly out of his own pocket. \n Millions more went to air travel. The campaign paid about $2 million for private jets other than Trump's own TAG Air, which also collected $500,000. \n Some of Trump's consultants are also mysteriously well-paid. \n Chess Bedsole, the campaign's Alabama state director, was paid $64,000 last month for field consulting. His last campaign payment was for $15,000 in December. \n Yet the campaign's payroll remained thin, and there did not appear to be much new in the way of office leases across the country, including in critical battleground states such as Ohio. \n Trump has relied heavily on the Republican National Committee for conventional campaign infrastructure. And he's boasted of holding the line on his campaign spending. But he's running critically low on time to build an operation that can compete with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \n In addition to being ahead of Trump in polls in key states, Clinton has maintained a staff of about 700 for months, opened up offices across the country and already spent $67 million on general election ads. Trump put out his first ads days ago, spending $5 million to air them in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. \n Her campaign spent $38 million in July, about double his spending. \n Clinton can afford to spend more than Trump, the July campaign finance reports show. Her campaign raised $52 million while his brought in $37 million for the month, including a $2 million contribution from Trump himself. \n The candidates also raise money for their parties, enabling them to ask for contributions far higher than the $2,700-per-donor limit to the campaigns. Overall in July, Clinton raised $90 million for her campaign and Democratic partners, while Trump raised $80 million for the campaign and Republican groups. \n Trump did bring aboard some new campaign consultants in July. \n He paid $100,000 to Cambridge Analytica, a deep-dive data firm that did business with GOP opponent Ted Cruz. Hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who contributed $2 million to a pro-Trump super political action committee in July, is an investor in Cambridge. \n The Trump filings also show some old ties. \n Two weeks after the ouster of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Trump's campaign cut his firm, Green Monster Consulting, another $20,000 check. That's about the same amount it had paid him each month while he was running the campaign. \n At the time of the latest payment, Lewandowski was already on the payroll of CNN, where he is a political contributor. \n The campaign also paid Trump Organization employee Meredith McIver, who has worked as a Trump ghostwriter over the years. She took credit \u2014 and then blame\u2014 for writing Melania Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention that included similar lines from Michelle Obama's speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. \n The campaign valued McIver's time, accounted for as payroll from the Trump Organization, at $356.01. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Julie Bykowicz and Chad Day on Twitter: https://twitter.com/bykowicz and https://twitter.com/ChadSDay \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump campaign doubles spending, not ground game"}

The Tragically Hip mixed fan favourites, newer songs and some politics on Saturday night during the final show of their \"Man Machine Poem\" tour. \n KINGSTON, Ontario >> A delirious sold-out crowd and countless Canadians on live TV watched the final concert by rock band The Tragically Hip, whose lead singer and songwriter Gord Downie has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. \n The band, an indelible part of Canada's national identity with songs about hockey, small towns and Canadian literature, ended its 15-show \"Man Machine Poem\" tour Saturday night in its hometown of Kingston, Ontario. \n Thousands of fans \u2014 including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \u2014 watched The Hip's final show at the Rogers K-Rock Centre, the city where the band began in the early 1980s. The concert was also broadcast live on national TV. \n Trudeau's official photographer tweeted a photo of the prime minister and Downie embracing before the concert. \n \"Well, you know, prime minister Trudeau's got me, his work with First Nations. He's got everybody. He's going to take us where we need to go,\" Downie said from the stage. \n \"He's going to be looking good for about at least 12 more years, I don't know if they let you go beyond that. But he'll do it,\" Downie told concertgoers between songs. \n Trudeau could be seen in the audience nodding and mouthing \"thank you.\" \n In a brief interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., Trudeau reminisced about how he used to enjoy the band's music during his high school and university years. He said the band remains anchored in Canada in so many ways through their lyrics and music. \n While The Hip became one of Canada's most beloved rock bands, lasting success in the U.S. was elusive \u2014 outside of border cities like Buffalo, N.Y., where viewing parties of the concert's Canadian broadcast were held. \n Despite being diagnosed with glioblastoma, the most aggressive cancerous brain tumor, in December, an energetic Downie was in fine form as he and his bandmates played an epic 30-song set loaded with hits and punctuated by three encores. \n Downie, who started the show wearing a metallic silver suit and hat with a \"Jaws\" T-shirt underneath, hugged and kissed his bandmates before they stepped on stage to open with \"50 Mission Cap,\" followed by \"Courage (for Hugh MacLennan),\" \"Wheat Kings\" and \"At the Hundredth Meridian,\" all off the 1992 breakthrough album \"Fully Completely.\" \n The Hip then segued into songs from their latest album, \"Man Machine Poem,\" before running through tracks from \"Music Work,\" \"Road Apples,\" \"Phantom Power,\" \"Up To Here,\" \"Day For Night\" and \"Trouble at the Henhouse.\" \n The show was closed out by fan favorite \"Ahead By A Century.\" \n Downie gestured as if he was sketching a portrait of the teary audience as the band \u2014 rounded out by guitarists Rob Baker and Paul Langlois, bassist Gord Sinclair and drummer Johnny Fay \u2014 played the final notes of the song. \n They then embraced, stood arm-in-arm as the crowd roared, and then walked off stage for good. \n Before performing one song, Downie seemed to reference the outpouring of support from fans in the wake of his diagnosis. \n \"Thank you, people, for keeping me pushing and keeping me pushing,\" he said, which prompted a \"Gordie!\" chant from the audience. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip holds final show"}
