The suspect in the killing of multiple people at a home in Alabama attacked them while they slept and then abducted his estranged girlfriend and an infant, both of whom were found alive, authorities said today. \n AL.COM VIA AP \n Crime scene tape marks the home on Jim Platt Road near Citronelle, Ala., today, where authorities said five people were killed on Saturday. Police said that Derrick Dearman, 27, of Leakesville, Miss., has been taken into custody in connection with the murders. \n ATLANTA \u00bb The suspect in the killing of five people at a home in Alabama attacked them while they slept and then abducted his estranged girlfriend and an infant \u2014 both of whom were found alive, authorities said today. \n It could take investigators days to sort out the grisly murder scene in Citronelle, a small town 30 miles northwest of Mobile. Authorities said the dead included a pregnant woman and were found Saturday afternoon inside the home. \n The crime was of a magnitude rarely if ever seen in this corner of rural, southern Alabama, Mobile County sheriff's Capt. Paul Burch said. \n \"It's unprecedented here,\" Burch told The Associated Press. \n Earlier, Burch told reporters at the scene that investigators expect to be at the scene for a couple days. \"It's obviously a horrific scene,\" he said. \n Mobile County District Attorney Ashley Rich told reporters near the scene that in her 20-year career as a prosecutor, she's never encountered a crime \"where there were five people who were brutally and viciously murdered, and that's what we have here.\" \n She said \"multiple weapons\" were used. \n Derrick Dearman, 27, of Leakesville, Mississippi, was taken into custody after he walked into the sheriff's office in Greene County, Mississippi, about 20 miles west of Citronelle, Burch said. Dearman was accompanied by his father when he showed up at the sheriff's department and surrendered Saturday afternoon, the Alabama sheriff's office said in a statement. \n Dearman has confessed to the crimes, Burch told the news site Al.com. \n \"He's been cooperative,\" Burch told the AP on Sunday. \n Dearman will be charged with six counts of capital murder, Mobile County sheriff's spokeswoman Lori Myles said Sunday. Five counts stem from the killing of the adults, and the additional count is because one of the slaying victims, 22-year-old Chelsea Marie Reed, was 5 months pregnant, Myles said. \n The other four killed were identified by sheriff's officials as Shannon Melissa Randall, 35; Justin Kaleb Reed, 23; Joseph Adam Turner, 26; and Robert Lee Brown, also 26. \n Prosecutors have already begun the process of trying to extradite Dearman from Mississippi to Alabama, Burch said on Sunday. The sheriff of Greene County, Stanley McLeod, could not be reached for comment Sunday. \n Though connections between Dearman and the five people killed were not immediately clear, investigators have determined that his ex-girlfriend, Laneta Lester, had gone to the home on Aug. 19 to get away from an abusive relationship with Dearman, the sheriff's office said in a statement. Lester was staying with a relative there. \n Around 1 a.m. Saturday, someone inside the residence called 911 and reported that Dearman was on the property, the statement said. Citronelle police came to the house, but Dearman had left before the officers arrived, sheriff's officials said. \n Later, sometime between 1:15 a.m. and daylight Saturday, Dearman returned to the home and attacked the victims while they were sleeping, the statement said. After the killings, Dearman forced Lester and the 3-month-old infant \u2014 the child of the one of the murder victims \u2014 into a vehicle at the residence. The three drove to the Mississippi home of Dearman's father. \n After they arrived there, Dearman released Lester and the infant and then turned himself in at the Mississippi sheriff's department, Burch said. \n Dearman has some criminal history, including an active warrant for a burglary charge, Burch said. \n The killings happened about 150 miles southwest of Rutledge, Alabama, another town in the southern part of the state where six family members were found shot to death at their rural home on Aug. 26, 2002. \n In that case, Westley Devon Harris was given a death sentence after being convicted of slaughtering his girlfriend's relatives. Prosecutors said he was angry because he thought they were trying to keep him away from her. \n After the killings, he fled with his girlfriend and child. The girlfriend, who was 16 at the time, ended up testifying against Harris. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Suspect's ex-girlfriend lived at Alabama home where 5 slain"}

Harambe, the Ohio zoo gorilla shot and killed after a 3-year-old boy got into his enclosure, has taken on life after death. \n CINCINNATI \u00bb With online declarations such as \"Harambe Lives!\" the Ohio zoo gorilla shot and killed after a 3-year-old boy got into his enclosure has taken on life after death.  \n The late 17-year-old great ape has shown up in tongue-in-cheek petitions to rename the hometown Cincinnati Bengals, to add his face to Mount Rushmore or the Lincoln Memorial, and to put him on the dollar bill. He has grown the angel wings and halo of a deity in social media memorials. \n He's even been mock-nominated for president. \n The Harambe phenomenon is fed by genuine sadness over his death, continued controversy over the circumstances that led to it, and the penchant of many social media users for satire \u2014 which sometimes turns offensive. \n \"There is a word we like to use in our discipline, in pop culture studies, and that is 'polysemic': has many meanings,\" said Jeremy Wallach, a professor of popular culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. \"Harambe definitely is that, a sign that possesses many different interpretations.\" \n Harambe remembrances began soberly, with a legitimate \"Justice for Harambe\" petition seeking to hold the boy's mother responsible in his May 28 death. The county prosecutor ruled there was no cause for charges. The zoo reopened its gorilla exhibit with a higher, reinforced barrier and urged support for gorilla conservation efforts. \n But the zoo's hopes of moving on have been countered by all the continued reminders. \n \"We are not amused by the memes, petitions and signs about Harambe,\" Thane Maynard, Cincinnati Zoo director, said by email. \"Our zoo family is still healing, and the constant mention of Harambe makes moving forward more difficult for us. We are honoring Harambe by redoubling our gorilla conservation efforts and encouraging others to join us .\" \n Esther Clinton, who also specializes in popular culture at Bowling Green, said the Kong-like proportions of the craze reflect lingering questions. \n \"There are a lot of people who really do feel bad about what happened to him,\" she said. \"There's a sense of here's this poor guy, just in his cage imprisoned by humans, minding his own business; a kid climbs into his cage and he gets shot. It brings up all sorts of questions: about the zoo model, about the rights of non-human primates, about parenting.\" \n The Harambe phenomenon turned ugly in June, when images were posted on a Facebook page likening Adam Goodes, a retired Australian football player of indigenous ancestry, to the ape. They were pulled down and the page apologized. Twitter got caught in a similar controversy after racial posts about \"Ghostbusters\" star Leslie Jones, who is black, included a Harambe comparison. The social media site recently announced two new settings aimed at curbing harassment. \n Social media users like to satirize controversies. \"Never Forget #Harambe,\" read posts accompanying Harambe's photo superimposed on sculptures, above cityscapes, among famous dead people such as Muhammad Ali or John F. Kennedy. Some Twitter users routinely add the hashtag #RIPHarambe even to posts that have nothing to do with him. \n He has surfaced in rewritten song lyrics, comedians' acts, at sports events and in rap songs. \n On Change.org, a recent search turned up 253 references to Harambe. They include the early Justice for Harambe petition and the recent petition to rename the Cincinnati Bengals the Harambes, which has received more than 21,000 signatures. Other petitions want a Harambe emoji, a Harambe character in Pokemon Go, to clone Harambe, even to canonize him. \n WCPO-TV web editor James Leggate recently declared that enough was enough, by starting an online petition to end the Harambe online petitions. \n \"At first, the petitioners had good intentions,\" he wrote. \"But then the goofuses of the Internet hopped on the Harambe train for their jollies, and it has gotten out of control.\" \n Animal rights activist Anthony Seta, who organized a Cincinnati vigil in tribute to Harambe soon after his death, thinks much of the attention in terms of memorials has been a positive. \n \"For the most part, I'm very happy with it. It shows people are remembering what a wonderful being he was,\" he said. \"The ones that are mocking and making light of the death of this being, I find incredibly offensive.\" \n Ashley Byrne, an associate director at PETA, said trolls poking fun at animal-rights activists seem to be in a \"distinct minority\" when it comes to Harambe. \n \"This tragic incident really did start a new conversation,\" she said. \"Most people who saw the video came away with a great degree of empathy for animals forced to live in captivity.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Harambe lives: Killed zoo gorilla gets a second life online"}

His family was his No. 1.\" \n Glen Escobido saw the driver run a red light at an intersection on Kunia Road near Schofield Barracks. \n He said the driver stopped behind other cars at the light, but then went around them in the left turn lane and drove through the intersection. He initially thought the driver was fleeing from police. \n After continuing to drive, Escobido came upon the crash and realized it was the same vehicle that ran the red light. \n He stopped to help and witnesses told him the driver had passed three cars in the oncoming lane, then swerved back into the lane to avoid an oncoming car and lost control. The car was sliding sideways, flipped and slid on its roof. Good Samaritans tried to right the vehicle to get the driver and a woman out. \n Police said excessive speed was a factor in the crash at about 5:30 p.m. Saturday near Hawaii Country Club. Traffic investigators said the driver of a 2005 Nissan sedan was traveling south and moving into the oncoming lane of traffic to try to overtake other vehicles. \n The driver swerved back to avoid an oncoming car, lost control, hit a guardrail and flipped the car an unknown number of times, police said. \n The driver and a female passenger died at the scene, police said.

A bomb attack targeting an outdoor wedding party in southeastern Turkey killed dozens of people and wounded dozens more. \n IHA VIA AP \n The shoe of a young victim and a piece of metal lay near the scene just hours after Saturday's bomb attack in Gaziantep, southeastern Turkey, early Sunday, targeting an outdoor wedding party in southeastern Turkey killing dozens of people and wounding dozens more. \n ISTANBUL \u00bb A child suicide bomber killed at least 51 people and wounded nearly 70 others at a Kurdish wedding party near Turkey's border with Syria, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday, decrying the attack as an apparent attempt by Islamic State extremists to destabilize the nation by exploiting ethnic and religious tensions. \n \"As of now, the preliminary conclusions by our governor's office and the police establishment point to an attack by Daesh,\" Erdogan said, using another common term for IS. \n \"It was clear that Daesh had such an organization in Gaziantep or was attempting to make room for itself in recent times,\" he said. \n The bombing late Saturday in Gaziantep was the deadliest attack in Turkey this year. \n It comes amid ongoing struggles between the government and Kurdish militants linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, and as the country is still reeling from the aftermath of last month's failed coup attempt, which the government has blamed on U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen and his followers. \n Erdogan said immediately after the Gaziantep attack, which he blamed on IS, that any strategy \"meant to incite the citizens against each other along ethnic and religious lines will not work.\" \n Later, addressing the nation before Istanbul's city hall, Erdogan said the attacker in Gaziantep was aged between 12 and 14. He said 69 people were wounded, with 17 of them in critical condition. \n He again blamed the attack on the Islamic State, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility. \n The pro-Kurdish political party HDP condemned the attack on the wedding, which it said was attended by many of its party members. \n It said in a statement that it was \"quite significant\" that the attack, which it also blamed on IS, came hours after the Kurdistan Communities Union, a militant organization that includes the PKK, announced plans to try to negotiate to end a three-decade conflict between Kurdish militants and the Turkish government. \n \"This attack targets those determined and persistent in peace, resolution, and those struggling for democracy, equality, freedom and justice,\" the HDP said. \"The attack was planned to disable the spread of peace and success of possible negotiations.\" \n A bus driver who shuttled some of the guests from Siirt to Gaziantep said that he couldn't believe the party was targeted. \n \"This was a wedding party. Just a regular wedding party,\" Hamdullah Ceyhan told the state-run Anadolu Agency. \"This attack was deplorable. How did they do such a thing?\" \n The bride and groom weren't in life-threatening condition and were undergoing treatment, but the groom's sister and uncle were among the dead, Anadolu reported. \n Multiple opposition parties denounced the attack, as did many foreign governments including the U.S., Germany, Austria, Russia, Egypt, Sweden, Greece, France, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan and global institutions including the United Nations, the European Union and NATO. \n \"We stand by our ally Turkey and pledge to continue to work closely together to defeat the common threat of terrorism,\" said U.S. Ambassador to Turkey John Bass. \n In the Vatican, Pope Francis led hundreds of people in silent prayer for the victims of the attack, concluding by asking \"for the gift of peace for everyone.\" \n Security expert Metin Gurcan, a former Turkish military officer and columnist for the online newspaper Al-Monitor, said that IS view the attack as \"hitting two birds with one stone\" \u2014 as retaliation for Syrian Kurdish advances on their forces in Syria, and for Turkey's attacks on IS targets. \n Gurcan said in an email to The Associated Press that IS has been trying to agitate or exploit ethnic and religious tensions in Turkey, and \"we know very well to what extent wedding attacks can sow disorder in nation's social fabric from the Afghanistan experience.\" \n The suicide bombing follows a June attack on Istanbul's main airport where IS suspects killed 44 people. A dual suicide bombing blamed on IS at a peace rally in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in October killed 103 people. \n Meantime, there have also been ongoing attacks claimed by the PKK or linked to the militant group, as well as the coup attempt blamed on Gulen's movement. Gulen has denied any involvement. \n Earlier this week, a string of bombings blamed on the PKK that targeted police and soldiers killed at least a dozen people. A fragile, 2\u00bd year peace process between the PKK and the government collapsed last year, leading to a resumption of the three-decade-long conflict. \n In the immediate aftermath of the Gaziantep bombing, Erdogan said there was \"absolutely no difference\" between IS, Kurdish rebels and Gulen's movement, calling them terrorist groups. \n Gurcan said, however, that it was a \"grave mistake\" to lump the three together. \n \"Putting these three organizations with different political objectives, tactics and techniques into the same basket \u2026 causes the failure of tailoring specific counter strategies,\" he said. \n Following the attack, police sealed off the site of the explosion and forensic teams moved in. Outside the perimeter, hundreds of residents gathered chanting \"Allah is great\" as well as slogans denouncing attacks. \n Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek and the country's health minister traveled to the scene, visiting the wounded and inspecting the site. \n \"This is a massacre of unprecedented cruelty and barbarism,\" Simsek told reporters. \"We \u2026 are united against all terror organizations. They will not yield.\" \n In Istanbul, HDP supporters organized a rally attended by hundreds Sunday evening to protest the bombing. One participant, shop owner Ercan Yilmaz, 36, told the AP it was \"always those kinds of people being targeted \u2014 a Kurdish wedding party, opposition groups or people calling for peace in Ankara,\" referring to the peace rally attacked in October. \n \"On the other hand, the AKP (Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party) has gatherings and rallies everywhere but they're never bombed,\" he added. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Young suicide bomber attacks Turkish wedding party leaving 51 dead"}

But the latest warning comes at a time of more tension following the defection of a senior North Korean diplomat and a U.S. plan to place a high-tech defense missile system in South Korea. \n The North's military said in a statement Monday that it will turn Seoul and Washington into \"a heap of ashes through a Korean-style pre-emptive nuclear strike\" if they show any signs of aggression toward the North's territory. \n The North's \"first-strike\" units are ready to mount retaliatory attacks on South Korean and U.S. forces involved in the drills, according to the statement, carried by Pyongyang's state media. \n South Korea's Unification Ministry expressed \"strong\" regret over the North's warning, saying the drills with the U.S. are defensive in nature. Seoul and Washington have repeatedly said they have no intentions of invading Pyongyang. \n The Ulchi Freedom Guardian drills that began Monday for a 12-day run are largely computer-simulated war games. The training involves 25,000 American troops and 50,000 South Korean soldiers, according to the U.S. and South Korean militaries. \n The drills come just days after Seoul announced that Thae Yong Ho, No. 2 at the North's embassy in London, had recently defected to South Korea because he was disillusioned with the North's leadership. Pyongyang's state media called him \"human scum\" and a criminal who had been ordered home for a series of alleged criminal acts, including sexually assaulting a minor. \n South Korea's President Park Geun-hye said Monday that there were signs of \"serious cracks\" in the North's ruling elite class after defections of key figures she didn't identity. Park told a security meeting that Pyongyang could carry out cyberattacks or other provocations on South Korea to divert public attention away from such domestic problems. \n Many analysts said Thae's defection was an embarrassment to the North Korean government of leader Kim Jong Un, but would not weaken the unity of the country's elite class. \n North Korea has already boosted its war rhetoric because of the planned deployment of the U.S. Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system in South Korea, which Washington and Seoul says is needed because of the increasing North Korean threats. \n About 28,500 U.S. troops are in South Korea to help deter potential aggression from North Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended with armistice, not a peace treaty. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "S.

That makes it one of the season's more pricy flops, albeit one that never had anything like the ambition of 1959's Charlton Heston epic. \n Instead, Warner Bros.'s much-maligned DC Comics supervillain team-up film \"Suicide Squad\" held the top spot for the third straight week with an estimated $20.7 million over its third weekend. It has now made $262.3 million domestically (fourth best for the summer) despite steep declines and poor reaction from critics and fans alike. \n Seth Rogen's foul-mouthed food animated comedy \"Sausage Party\" continued to do well for Sony Pictures. In its second weekend, it took in $15.3 million, good enough for second place, and bringing its two-week total to $65.3 million. \n Two offbeat debuts slid in behind \"Suicide Squad\" and \"Sausage Party\": the Iraq War comedy \"War Dogs,\" with Miles Teller and Jonah Hill; and the stop-motion animated \"Kubo and the Two Strings\" from Focus Features and Laika Entertainment. \n \"War Dogs,\" the first movie after \"The Hangover\" trilogy for director Todd Phillips, was lambasted by critics, but it sold a decent $14.3 million in ticket sales. \n \"Kubo and the Two Strings,\" an acclaimed fantasy about a boy in ancient Japan, debuted with $12.6 million, the weakest opening of any film from Laika, the Oregon-based animation studio behind \"Coraline,\" ParaNorman\" and \"The Boxtrolls.\" \"Kubo and the Two Strings\" was fashioned as Laika's most ambitious film yet, with the company's chief executive, Travis Knight, making his directorial debut. \n But after the fifth place opening of \"Ben-Hur,\" the second coming of the sword-and-sandal movie appears to be attracting dwindling flocks of moviegoers. \n A coproduction between MGM and Paramount, \"Ben-Hur\" is the third adaption of Lee Wallace's novel, \"Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ.\" With producers Mark Burnett and Roma Downey (\"The Bible\" miniseries), the film courted Christian moviegoers. But it was unable to turn them out as successfully as Paramount did for \"Noah\" (which debuted with $43.7 million in 2014) or even Fox's less popular \"Exodus: Gods and Kings\" (a $24.1 million opening in 2014). \n Still, fueled by \"Suicide Squad\" and \"Sausage Party,\" the box office was up more than 22 percent over the same weekend last year, according to comScore.

{"date": "August 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Donald Trump greeted the crowd as he arrived to speak at a campaign rally in Fredericksburg, Va., on Saturday. \n Aides to Donald Trump suggested today that the Republican presidential nominee may be reconsidering his campaign promise to round up and deport 11 million people who are in the United States illegally. \n His new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, was asked on CNN's \"State of the Union\" if Trump still wants a \"deportation force\" to remove everyone in the country illegally. \n \"To be determined,\" she said. \n Trump is \"wrestling\" with how to remove those in the country illegally, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., an adviser to Trump on immigration matters, said on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \n The aides' comments appeared to be the latest sign that Trump's newly installed management team may be trying to broaden his appeal to stem his steady fall in the polls with less than three months until Election Day. \n Trump has never explained how he intended to find, detain and deport millions of people, many of whom have built businesses and started families in the U.S., or how he would pay for it even if it passed judicial scrutiny. \n He has compared his proposal to \"Operation Wetback,\" a controversial program carried out in 1954 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. More than 1 million people were apprehended, mostly from border areas in Texas and California, and sent back to Mexico. \n Any easing of Trump's hard-line stance on immigration \u2014 which also includes building a wall along the border with Mexico and temporarily banning Muslim immigrants \u2014 could alienate some of his most ardent supporters. \n After a year of using harsh rhetoric against Latinos, such as calling Mexican migrants rapists and repeatedly attacking a federal judge as unfair because his family was from Mexico, polls show he faces intense opposition among Latinos. \n His campaign thus has moved in recent days to soften his edges and to try to shift attention past the turmoil caused by the shake-up of his top management team last week. \n In Charlotte, N.C., Trump announced \"regret\" that some of his heated comments \u2014 he didn't say which \u2014 may have caused personal pain. In Fredericksburg, Va., he said the Republican Party must \"do better\" to reach out to African American voters. \n And in New York City Saturday, Trump told his campaign's newly named Latino advisory council that he wants to find a \"humane and efficient\" solution to deal with illegal immigration. \n He \"did not make a firm commitment\" to the group on how deportations would work, Sessions said. \n Trump is expected to speak about immigration policy Thursday in Colorado. Conway said he will be more specific on his immigration plan \"as the weeks unfold.\" \n \"What he supports is to make sure that we enforce the law, that we are respectful of those Americans who are looking for well-paying jobs and that we are fair and humane for those who live among us in this country,\" Conway said. \n Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has called for providing a path to legal status for some of the people in the country illegally. \n A bipartisan immigration reform bill that would have boosted border security while providing a path for citizenship passed the Senate in 2013 but died in the Republican-led House. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Tribune Co. \n ", "author": "By Brian Bennett Tribune Washington Bureau", "title": "Trump 'wrestling' with how \u2014 and whether \u2014 to deport 11 million people"}

Kevin Durant scored 30 points and helped the Americans jump out to a huge lead by halftime. \n It was the final game with the national team for Mike Krzyzewski, who took the Americans back to the top and leaves with them there after becoming the first coach to win three Olympic gold medals. \n Carmelo Anthony also picked up his third gold to go with a bronze, becoming the most decorated male in Olympic basketball history. \n The U.S. beat Serbia by just 94-91 in pool play, holding on when Bogdan Bogdanovic missed a 3-pointer at buzzer. This rematch looked nothing like that meeting, but it did resemble the final of the 2014 Basketball World Cup, which the Americans won 129-92. \n Anthony checked back into the rout in the final minutes so he could grab a seventh rebound, passing David Robinson for U.S. record with the 125th in his Olympic career. He had already become the leading scorer earlier in the tournament, capping an Olympic career that began with disappointment as a member of the U.S. team that finished third in 2004. \n The Americans haven't lost since, winning 25 straight in the Olympics. \n A few of the victories were more difficult than usual in this tournament, where half the Americans' eight games were decided by 10 points or fewer. \n Krzyzewski said it didn't matter how the Americans won, that there would be no questions as long as they did. \n And there was no doubt they would Sunday once Durant heated up. \n He had also scored 30 in the 2012 gold-medal game, after he poured in a U.S.-record 38 in one game en route to the MVP of the 2010 world basketball championship. He is already the Americans' No. 2 career scorer in the Olympics in just two appearances. \n When the final horn sounded, the U.S. players shared long hugs with each other and then Krzyzewski. \n DeAndre Jordan went to the stands at Carioca Arena and collected an American flag, which he initially wrapped himself in like a blanket before holding it high over his head for all to see. After a slow start in Rio, there was no doubt about who was on top, and the Americans beamed as they walked off the floor before the medal ceremony where they will again be center court. \n That wasn't a sure thing earlier in the tournament, when the U.S. had consecutive three-point victories. The 10 Olympic newcomers seemed to be jelling slowly and the U.S. came in winning by just 21.4 points per game, more than 10 per game fewer than four years ago and about half the 43.8 the Dream Team won by in 1992 \n Krzyzewski, an assistant on that team at the Barcelona Games, has long insisted that international basketball has gotten too strong for anyone to win that easily again. \n Yet on Sunday, the Americans did. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. romps to men's basketball gold, beats Serbia 96-66"}

That he even suited up was an achievement. And it wasn't lost on those who played alongside him, watching as he recovered from a career-threatening knee injury \u2014 especially important to the younger players, who relished the chance to learn from him. \n \"I won before this game started,\" Priddy said. \n He leapt high for kill after kill, blocked his heart out, dived to the floor all day to keep points alive. Priddy played the most he has in these Olympics on the final day at Maracanazinho arena, pulling his teammates into quick huddles between points, patting them on the back and high-fiving at every chance. \n With chants of \"U-S-A!,\" the Americans rallied from two sets down to deny the 2012 London champs, 23-25, 21-25, 25-19, 25-19, 15-13. Brazil won gold in a straight-set win over Italy later in the day. \n \"It was hard especially at the end there to just focus, a lot of emotions,\" Priddy said. \"It was special. Even before this game, I came to terms with the fact the relationships, the experiences, were worth it the last two years. All the growth, all the hardship.\" \n Priddy bent his knees and pumped his arms when Matt Anderson pounded one ball home. And when Anderson ended it on another kill, Priddy found himself in the middle of a huge hug. \n Now, change may be coming for a man who has left such a legacy for the program. He will try to make it in beach volleyball. And, if his body cooperates, he will try to compete in Tokyo for one more Olympics. \n \"Reid Priddy was on fire,\" captain David Lee said. \"I dedicate this match to him. He's one of the reasons we got this medal. He should be incredibly proud of the way he finished his career indoors.\" \n Two months ago, Priddy became the improbable pick for coach John Speraw's 12-man roster. And Sunday marked a moment to celebrate for the outside hitter following the injury to his right knee two years ago in Bulgaria. He landed awkwardly after a high-flying hit, then lay face to the floor grimacing, his taped hand gripping his right knee. Doctors used a tendon from his left knee to repair the torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right. \n Priddy's shoes for the bronze match read \"Far\" on one and \"Greater\" on the other. As he waited for knee surgery, his career in jeopardy, he went to church one day. \n \"I don't do this a lot, but I had a burst of faith,\" he said. \"It was one of those times, of maybe two times in my life, where an inaudible-audible voice said what I'm going to do is far greater.\" \n Earlier this year, the father of two traveled to Italy to play professionally and find his rhythm leading to Rio. His wife and kids were there to greet him Sunday. \n Priddy was just the second four-time Olympian for U.S. men's volleyball, and three-timer Lee has already said he is done with the national team after Rio. Together they captured gold in the 2008 Beijing Games. Now, Priddy and Lee are ready to go, knowing the program is in the hands of talented youngsters. \n Speraw's players made the most of team meetings to get back on track in Rio, and the first-time Olympic coach is ready to use this learning experience and push on. \n At some point, he will take time to thank Priddy again. \n \"More than anything,\" Speraw said, \"I'm just so happy for him.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. men's volleyball takes bronze in Rio"}

A preliminary damage assessment found 105 homes and 216 outbuildings destroyed. \n \"This fire did not go through a dense community, like some fires do,\" fire spokesman Costa Dillon said Sunday. \"Almost all of this area is sparsely populated.\" \n Residents in the Lytle Creek area were being allowed back to their homes with proof of residence, though a mandatory evacuation order remained for those near El Cajon Valley. \n \"That's still the most active fire spot,\" Dillon said. \n The once-fast moving blaze that burned nearly 58 square miles was 83 percent contained Sunday morning, up from 73 percent the evening before. Firefighters were going property-to-property in the areas most heavily hit. \n \"You don't want somebody to come back to a neighborhood where a fire could suddenly flare up on the property next door from something still smoldering,\" Dillon said. \n Authorities said some structures were burned in the Lytle Creek area that residents will be returning to, though the exact number of destroyed buildings was not immediately available. \n Fire officials briefed residents at an evacuation center Sunday morning at the San Bernardino County Fairgrounds where about 15 residents remained. Dillon said the residents were \"very pleased\" to know the Lytle Creek area was open and that those still under evacuation orders were being patient. \n He said they understand that \"the evacuation is still for their safety.\" \n A prolonged drought has transformed swaths of California into tinderboxes, ready to ignite. Six other wildfires were burning in the state, including one in San Luis Obispo County that forced the closure of the historic Hearst Castle on Saturday. It remained closed Sunday. \n That fire grew to nearly 38 square miles overnight into Sunday morning and remained 35 percent contained. Fire spokeswoman Jaime Garrett said the fire was growing in the opposite direction of the Hearst Castle. The castle is a popular tourist attraction and houses a large art collection that belonged to media magnate William Randolph Hearst. \n In rural Santa Barbara County, a 15-square-mile wildfire forced the evacuation of two campgrounds. \n In the southern Sierra Nevada, another blaze feeding on dense timber in Sequoia National Forest forced the evacuation of several tiny hamlets. \n In Northern California, fire crews were gaining control Sunday on an arson fire that destroyed 189 homes.

{"date": "August 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Several pills taken from Prince's estate in Paisley Park after his death were counterfeit drugs that actually contained fentanyl \u2014 a synthetic opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin, an official close to the investigation said Sunday. \n MINNEAPOLIS >> Some of the pills taken from Prince's estate in Paisley Park after his death were counterfeit drugs that actually contained fentanyl \u2014 a synthetic opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin, an official close to the investigation said Sunday. \n The official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, said nearly two dozen pills found in one Aleve bottle were falsely labeled as \"Watson 385.\" According to Drugs.com, that stamp is used to identify pills containing a mix of acetaminophen and hydrocodone, but the official said at least one of the pills tested positive for fentanyl. \n Autopsy results released in June show Prince died April 21 of an accidental fentanyl overdose. The official who spoke to the AP said records show the 57-year-old Prince had no prescription for any controlled substances in the state of Minnesota in the 12 months before he died. \n Authorities are still investigating how Prince obtained the drugs. \n Fentanyl has been responsible for a surge in overdose deaths in some parts of the country. When made into counterfeit pills, users don't always know they're taking fentanyl, increasing the risk of fatal overdose. \n The Star Tribune first reported about the mislabeled pills in a story published on its website late Saturday. \n Some of the dozens of pills seized from Paisley Park were found to have other drugs in them, some were oxycodone or codeine, and some were not controlled substances. \n About a dozen tablets were found in a dressing room at Paisley Park, but the vast majority was in bottles of aspirin and Vitamin C that had been tucked inside a suitcase and bags \u2014 including one Prince often carried with him. Some pills were also found loose in the bag, the official said. \n One pill with the \"Watson 385\" stamp tested positive for fentanyl, lidocaine and another drug. Officials found nearly two dozen pills similar to the one that was tested, the official said. \n Another aspirin bottle had more than 60 counterfeit tablets in it. \n Some pills that were analyzed contained fentanyl, lidocaine and U-4770 \u2014 a synthetic drug that is eight times more powerful than morphine. \n Authorities also found a prescription bottle in someone else's name that contained 10 oxycodone pills, the official said, without revealing who was listed on the prescription. \n The official said Prince had many of these pills with him on April 15 when the airplane he was on made an emergency stop in Moline, Illinois, after he fell ill from a suspected drug overdose as he was heading home from a performance in Atlanta. Prince was given two doses of Narcan, an antidote used to reverse suspected opioid overdoses, the official said. \n U-4770 can be tested for in toxicology screens, but is not done routinely because it is a relatively new chemical. Presence of the drug was not tested in Prince's case, but the levels of fentanyl in his system were more than enough to be toxic, the official said. \n Tests on Prince prior to his death did not show fentanyl in his system, which means he wasn't a long-time abuser of that drug, but likely took the fatal dose sometime in the 24 hours before he died, the official said. \n The official did not elaborate on those tests. But at least one doctor, Michael Todd Schulenberg, saw Prince on April 7 and again on April 20, the day before he died. According to a search warrant, he told a detective he had ordered tests for Prince and prescribed medications. Schulenberg's attorney, Amy Conners, has said patient-privacy laws do not allow her to say what the prescriptions were. \n The autopsy report also shows Prince had diazepam, lidocaine and hydrocodone acids in his body, the official said. Diazepam is an anti-anxiety pill sold as Valium. It's a sedative and can also be used to control seizures, which Prince suffered from as a child. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Official: Pills found at Prince's estate contained fentanyl"}

{"date": "August 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Spectators take selfies before the final of the women's Olympic football tournament between Germany and Sweden at Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. \n RIO DE JANEIRO >> Taking the Olympics to Rio de Janeiro was always considered a bit of a risk. Now that South America's first games are drawing to a close, the question is: Did the gamble pay off? \n The answer, according to experienced Olympic officials and experts, is a mixed bag. \n Yes, Brazil managed to pull it off under difficult economic and political conditions, with the sports competitions, venues, athletes, friendly hosts, television images and Rio's scenic backdrops all rising to the occasion. \n Yet, behind the scenes, these were also troubled Olympics that fell short in other areas \u2014 empty seats, ticket fiascos, organizational mishaps, spread-out venues, green water, street crime, traffic chaos and lack of a clear Olympic feel in the parks. \n The Olympics on TV are never the same as the Olympics on site. That's been the case more than ever this time, reminiscent of the 1996 Games in Atlanta, where great sporting moments contrasted with lost buses, failures in the technology system and other off-the-field problems. \n \"This has been probably a little below the expectations of the experts, but will have televised well for the 99.9 percent of the population of the world that experiences the Olympics,\" senior Canadian IOC member Dick Pound said. \n International Olympic Committee vice president John Coates of Australia acknowledged the games have not run as smoothly as desired. \n \"It's been difficult,\" he said. \"To be fair, some of that was because of the economic and political background on which the games are being held.\" \n For Olympic historian David Wallechinsky, attending his 17th games, the shortage of volunteers, lack of Olympic signage and other logistical glitches have outweighed the well-run competitions and welcoming Brazilian people. \n \"I think these games will be seen in the continuum of Atlanta, Athens, Rio \u2014 the ones that didn't work out,\" he said. \"One just hopes the lessons are learned.\" \n But the games must also be judged from a local perspective. Many Brazilians and Rio residents \u2014 known as Cariocas \u2014 will feel pride over how they've put on the world's biggest sports event and will cherish their moments on the global stage. \n And, for the host country, the games are ending on a delirious high\u2014 with a gold medal in men's soccer. Brazilian fans wanted more than anything to finally win the top Olympic prize that has eluded them in their national sport. \n Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes said the Olympics have been a catalyst for building new public transport lines and renovating the port area, insisting that no white elephants will be left behind. Comparing Rio to the richer cities that lost out for the 2016 Games would be misguided, he said. \n \"We come from a tropical experience, the Latin ways of Brazil, which sometimes made the IOC members a little bit crazy,\" Paes said. \"If you want to be fair to Rio, you cannot compare us to Tokyo, to Chicago, to Madrid. These are cities that have much better infrastructure. They come from developed countries. You have to compare Rio to Rio.\" \n When Rio was chosen as host city seven years ago, IOC members were convinced the time had come to take the games to South America. Brazil was a rising economic force at the time. But local organizers quickly fell behind in preparations and were forced into an Athens-like mad dash to catch up. \n Then, over the last two years, the economy plummeted into its worst recession in 80 years, the country was engulfed by a massive corruption scandal centering on the state-run oil company Petrobras, and the president was suspended and sent for impeachment. \n \"It's also a games in the middle of reality, not organized in a bubble,\" IOC President Thomas Bach said Saturday. \"They were games in a city where there are social problems and social divisions. \u2026 The IOC has shown that it is possible to organize games also in countries which are not at the top of the GDP rankings.\" \n The athletes produced the goods \u2014 Bolt with three more gold medals to take his career tally to nine, Michael Phelps with five more golds for a total of 23, and gymnast Simone Biles with four golds. But the games also were marred by the bad behavior \u2014 and concocted stories \u2014 of Ryan Lochte and his U.S. swimming teammates. \n For all the drumbeat of bad news in the months ahead of the Olympics, two of the biggest issues caused barely a ripple. The Zika virus, which had led some scientists to call for the games to be postponed or moved, was hardly mentioned. Worries over Rio's sewage-filled waters did not hamper the competitions, with only a handful of athletes falling ill. \n Elsewhere, there were embarrassing setbacks, mostly during the first week: the green water that marred the diving and water polo events; the windows of a media bus shattered in an attack; foreign team officials and government ministers mugged in the street; volunteers who never showed up or just quit. \n \"It's just not acceptable with seven years in advance not to signs ready, not to have volunteers who know anything, as friendly as they may be,\" Wallechinsky said. \n Arguably the most damaging drawback was the lingering issue of empty seats. Some venues, such as tennis, basketball, swimming and gymnastics, drew good crowds and produced a lively atmosphere. But others suffered from lesser turnouts and lack of buzz. The track and field stadium was a quarter- or half-full for some sessions; the stands were not even completely packed for Usain Bolt's gold medal races. \n The long distances and travel times between the three main venue clusters meant there was no single area where large, colorful crowds could congregate and produce a Carnival atmosphere. \n For the future, Olympic officials believe greater oversight and concrete benchmarks are needed to make sure organizers are on time and delivering as promised. Pound said the IOC and international federations should carry out a \"forensic analysis\" after Rio on what worked, what didn't and why. \n \"Going forward, the IOC has to learn from the experience in Rio if it wants to take the games to places other than settled, affluent cosmopolitan cities,\" IOC vice president Craig Reedie said. \"We should train the city well in advance. We have to work out how better to prepare them and help them.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "After Rio risk, Olympic officials can learn lessons"}

One mother complained that a girl who uses an insulin pump had taken it off for gym class and had to evacuate without it. \n \"Nobody who sends their kids to school should have to go through that kind of stress and that type of disruption,\" Fornshell said. \n Such violent or disruptive threats are increasing nationwide, according to police, school employees, security consultants and others, blamed sometimes on local students and sometimes on outsiders seeking to cause disruptions or a big emergency response. \n State and local agencies don't track the threats, meaning there's no formal accounting of the collective costs. The disruptions typically aren't long enough to merit makeup classes, but the learning time lost to evacuations and cancellations adds up, as do the hours police spend responding and investigating. \n Less measurable but still significant are the ways threats can dent staff and students' sense of security even when they're false alarms, as they almost always are. \n \"Schools are in a really bad position,\" said researcher Amy Klinger, of the nonprofit Educator's School Safety Network. \"People are going to be mad if you evacuate; people are going to be upset if you don't evacuate.\" \n The number of school bomb threats the last academic year alone, based on media reports, was at least 1,267, roughly twice as many as in 2012-13, said Klinger, who also teaches educational administration at Ohio's Ashland University. \n Her group estimates there were about eight bomb threats per school day last year, and that doesn't include other threats of violence and disruption. Massachusetts had the most in that tally at 135 bomb threats, followed by Ohio with 96. \n Because administrators and police can't simply ignore threats , they grapple with the fallout while trying to deter copycats. \n In Ohio, more than 170 school threats were reported in the 2015-16 school year, according to an Associated Press tally based on police updates and media coverage. Threats of bombs, shootings and unspecified violence were called in, written as notes, scrawled on walls and shared via social media and apps. Over 100 Ohio public school districts, or roughly one in every six districts, dealt with at least one threat, as did a handful of private and charter schools and several college-level facilities. \n Ohio-based consulting firm National School Safety and Security Services had flagged the state as having more school threats \u2014 64 \u2014 than any other state in the first half of the previous academic year. The firm said it studied over 800 threats around the country in that period, up from 315 in a similar span a year earlier. \n At least a couple of the recent Ohio threats occurred one day in late May when dozens of threats were made against schools nationwide as officials investigated whether it might be a case of \"swatting,\" when hoaxers playing online games anonymously make threats online or by phone to trigger big responses from police and SWAT teams. Some of those schools evacuated; others didn't. \n Months earlier, an email threatening a large-scale jihadi attack had prompted the Los Angeles Unified School District to cancel classes for a day in December, while school officials in New York City quickly dismissed a similar email as a hoax. \n Schools where students and visitors entered freely a decade or two ago now have surveillance cameras, locked doors and special security procedures. The National Association of School Resource Officers estimates the number of such officers in schools has grown to between 14,000 and 20,000, some armed. And teachers are sometimes perceived as first responders. \n Lawmakers in Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere have explored strengthening penalties for school threats. \n In Ohio, lawmakers are proposing legislation to let schools expel students for months for making certain kinds of threats and have them evaluated to determine whether they're a danger to themselves or others. \n The bill, supported by associations representing school boards, superintendents and school business managers, also would let districts and law enforcement agencies seek restitution from a student's parents for the costs of responding to their threat. \n One supporter of the measure, Hilliard Superintendent John Marschhausen, whose suburban Columbus district had a student accused of threatening a school shooting, described threats \"an all too frequent reality.\" \n At least half of the Ohio threats last school year led to evacuations, dismissals or cancellation of classes or activities, according to AP's analysis. \n The frequency of evacuations concerns Lt. Joe Hendry, a veteran Kent State University police officer and a trainer and consultant on threat responses. There's no catch-all response for schools, he said, but he suggests they consider whether it would be better to evaluate the legitimacy of a threat before automatically or habitually evacuating. \n Besides the disruption, security experts note that neatly filing out of a building and gathering masses of people in one place potentially puts them in further jeopardy if someone wants to target them. \n People intending real violence don't generally call ahead, Hendry said, so \"I'm more worried about the threat that I don't know about rather than the threat that I do.\" \n Even the false alarms can have broad consequences, and the prosecutor overseeing the \"bomb week\" cases is trying to drive home that point. \n A handful of students were blamed for those threats, including a 12-year-old girl. Fornshell said he would ask a judge to make those found responsible for evacuations write handwritten apology letters to each of the hundreds of affected families in the district \u2014 perhaps 1,500 or more, depending on the district \u2014 in addition to time in juvenile detention or any other discipline. \n \"My hope is that it gives them a better appreciation of how wide-reaching their conduct was and how much disruption is actually caused,\" Fornshell said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "When schools are threatened, untold learning time is lost"}

{"date": "August 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n First lady Michelle Obama, left, daughters Sasha Obama, Malia Obama and President Barack Obama return from a 16-day vacation to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., arrive at the White House in Washington today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama, followed by daughter Sasha Obama, returns from a 16-day vacation to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., arriving at the White House in Washington, late today. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb President Barack Obama returned from vacation today, ready for a busy fall season and more battles with Congress over Zika funding, the federal budget and $400 million the administration paid Iran this year for the never-completed sale of military equipment. \n Obama is also expected to campaign doggedly throughout October to help elect Democrat Hillary Clinton as president. \n A theoretically rested president returned to the White House after a 16-day getaway to Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, with his wife, Michelle, daughters Malia and Sasha, and their dogs. He played 10 rounds of golf and went out to dinner eight times. \n Throughout Sunday, scores of residents lined roads to watch and wave as the motorcade crisscrossed the island on the last day of Obama's final vacation there as president. Signs posted around the island's various towns thanked the family for coming. \n Obama will be at the White House for about a day before hitting the road again Tuesday to survey damage from heavy flooding in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that killed at least 13 people and displaced thousands more. \n The president had resisted pressure from Louisianans and others to interrupt his vacation to go meet with officials and flood victims, and the White House stressed that he was receiving regular briefings on the flooding during the vacation. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump filled the void created by Obama's absence, touring the ravaged area Friday with his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. \n With Congress still on a seven-week break, Obama and aides probably will focus on what the White House can get from lawmakers before they leave town to campaign for re-election. Congress returns after Labor Day, and the House and Senate will have just a month to pass a catch-all spending bill by the end of the federal budget year on Sept. 30 to keep the government operating. \n Lawmakers plan to leave Washington again in October and not return until after the Nov. 8 elections. \n The White House will continue to push for money to help keep the mosquito-borne Zika virus from spreading and develop a vaccine. Florida last week identified the popular Miami tourist haven of South Beach as the second site of Zika transmission on the U.S. mainland. A section of Miami's Wynwood arts district was the first. \n Obama asked Congress for $1.9 billion this year for Zika prevention. Republicans offered $1.1 billion and added provisions Democrats objected to, including language on Planned Parenthood, leaving the matter in limbo before Congress adjourned in mid-July. Lawmakers could end up adding Zika money to the broader spending bill. \n In turn, incensed lawmakers have promised to keep the heat on the administration over $400 million it delivered to Iran in January. Republicans say the money was ransom to win freedom for four Americans held in Iran. Questioned about the payment earlier this month, Obama said: \"We do not pay ransom. We didn't here. And we \u2026 won't in the future.\" \n The president and other officials denied any linkage. But administration officials also said it made little sense not to \"retain maximum leverage,\" as State Department spokesman John Kirby put it last week, for the money long owed to Iran, to ensure the U.S. citizens' release, given uncertainty about whether Iran would keep its promise to free them the day the money was to be delivered. \n Iran had paid $400 million in the 1970s for U.S. military equipment, but the Iranian government was overthrown and the equipment wasn't delivered. \n The explanations have not satisfied critics in and out of Congress. Trump has begun telling supporters at his campaign rallies that Obama \"openly and blatantly\" lied about the prisoners. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said Obama has set a \"dangerous precedent\" and owes the public a \"full accounting of his actions.\" \n Obama heads into the fall, and what's expected to be a dogged effort on his part to boost Clinton to the White House, in improved public standing, according to the Pew Research Center. \n His job approval rating stands at 53 percent, about the same as just before July's political conventions. But Obama's standing among independent voters has reached positive territory for the first time since December 2012. Fifty-three percent of independents approve of Obama's job performance, the center found, while 40 percent disapprove. Independents had split 46 percent to 46 percent on the question in June. \n Obama won't spend much time at the White House in the coming weeks. \n After visiting Louisiana, the president heads to Nevada on Aug. 31 to discuss environmental protection at the Lake Tahoe Summit. He follows with a trip to China and Laos from Sept. 2-9. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama eyes busy fall after return from summer vacation"}

{"date": "August 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this frame from surveillance video released by Brazil Police, swimmers from the United States Olympic team appear with Ryan Lochte, right, at a gas station during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. \n NEW YORK >> American swimmer Ryan Lochte said he over-exaggerated what happened at a Rio de Janeiro gas station and acknowledged it was his \"immature behavior\" that got him and three teammates into a mess that consumed the final days of the Olympics. \n \"It's how you want to make it look like,\" Lochte said. \"Whether you call it a robbery or whether you call it extortion or us just paying for the damages, we don't know. All we know is that there was a gun pointed in our direction and we were demanded to give money.\" \n But he admitted that he understood that he was being told that the Americans had to pay for the damage or the police would be called. \n At that point, Lauer said: \"You're striking a deal. Is that fair?\" \n \"We just wanted to get out of there,\" Lochte said, adding the swimmers were frightened. \n Lauer told Lochte that his story had morphed from one about \"the mean streets or Rio\" to a negotiated settlement to cover up dumb behavior. \n \"That's why I'm taking full responsibility for it, because I over-exaggerated the story,\" Lochte said. \"If I had never done that, we wouldn't be in this mess.\" \n Lochte also said he had lied in telling NBC interviewer Billy Bush the next day that a gun had been cocked and pointed at his forehead. He said he was still under the influence of alcohol when he talked to Bush. \n \"I definitely had too much to drink that night and I was very intoxicated,\" he said. \n Lochte, who dyed his hair white for the games and had it turn a light shade of green from the pool, had changed his hair back to its regular shade of brown for the interview, which was conducted in New York. As Brazilian police investigated his robbery claim, and eventually held his teammates for questioning while they sorted out his story, he had tweeted he intended to dye it back. \n He said he hoped to continue competitive swimming but acknowledged that it won't be his decision about whether he'd be able to be part of the American team again. USA Swimming and the International Olympic Committee could issue sanctions. \n Lochte said he regretted how the incident had tarnished Rio and the last week of the Olympics. He also gave an interview to Brazil's main broadcaster Globo on Saturday to apologize for his actions. \n \"Brazil doesn't deserve that,\" he said to Globo. \"I am sorry that my immaturity caused all this ruckus.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ryan Lochte says 'immature behavior' got him into a mess"}
