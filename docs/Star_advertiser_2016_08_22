{"date": "August 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Rosalind Alexander-Kasparik cares for her fiance, David Rector, who is seeking to have his voting rights restored five years after a judge ruled that a traumatic brain injury disqualified him from casting a ballot in San Diego. \n SAN DIEGO \u00bb As the November presidential election neared, it looked like David Rector would once again be unable to vote. Five years ago, a judge ruled that a traumatic brain injury disqualified him. \n Then the 66-year-old former NPR producer learned about a California law that makes it easier for people with developmental disabilities to keep and regain the right to vote. The law, which took effect Jan. 1, protects that right if they can express a desire to vote. \n On Tuesday, Rector will seek to have his voting rights restored, and advocates representing him and others who have been disqualified will file a complaint with the U.S. Justice Department asking that California be required to notify them of the new law in time for the Nov. 8 ballot. \n All but about a dozen states have some type of law limiting voting rights for individuals based on competence. Advocates say how those laws are enforced varies widely \u2014 not just by state but by county and judge. \n Supporters of these limits say restrictions are in place to protect against voter fraud. \n Under California's new law, seniors and others with disabilities that are assigned conservators to manage their financial and other affairs keep the right to vote unless a court finds \"clear and convincing evidence\" that they can't express a desire to exercise it. \n Thomas Coleman, legal director of the Spectrum Institute, which is filing the complaint on Rector's behalf, said he anticipates the law will provide voting protections in conservatorship cases going forward. The challenge, he says, is getting the word out to people who have lost the right \u2014 a number he estimates at 32,000 in California based on a review of Los Angeles County records. \n Previously, California judges stripped voting rights of people with developmental disabilities including autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy \"almost as a matter of routine,\" Coleman said. \n \"No one should expect them to understand that this new law went into effect and that they have the right to ask for it back,\" Coleman said. \"They're disenfranchised. The law has changed and they don't know about it.\" \n Many counties are informing people during in-person visits, Coleman said, but because of backlogs that will be too late for many to register by the Oct. 24 deadline for the November election. \n California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in a statement that his office hadn't seen the complaint and couldn't comment specifically on it. But Padilla noted he supported the bill that became the law. \n \"We continually explore ways to provide information to California's diverse population and are always open to receiving recommendations to improve our outreach efforts,\" Padilla said. \n Calls to the Judicial Council of California, which sets policies for state courts, were not returned Monday. \n Rector moved to San Diego from Washington, D.C., in July 2008 to join his fiancee, Rosalind Alexander-Kasparik. He registered to vote almost immediately, even before getting a new driver's license. \n Eight months later, Rector clutched his chest and fell to his knees while reading a newspaper at breakfast, stricken by a tear in his aorta. After two days in the hospital, he had a severe brain trauma that left him unable to speak or use his arms and legs. \n Today, he uses a wheelchair to move around and can write with limited use of his right thumb. He communicates with electronic devices, using his thumb or eye-tracking software to indicate what he wants. According to the complaint, he can think, feel, comprehend, remember, see, hear and express emotions. During an interview, he cried out when Alexander-Kasparik described his injury and extended his hand to say goodbye. \n Alexander-Kasparik says her fiance is still a voracious consumer of TV and radio news and that they collaborate on a comic book series. He laughs when watching scenes from \"Star Wars.\" \n Rector voted in 2010, telling his fiancee of his opinions on a flurry of state ballot measures. At a hearing the following year to appoint Alexander-Kasparik his conservator, Rector cried out after a judge checked a box that said he could no longer vote. \n \"We knew it was coming, but we didn't know there was anything that could be done about it,\" said Alexander-Kasparik, describing it as a devastating blow. \n As this year's election neared, Alexander-Kasparik asked friends on social media for help getting Rector's rights restored. She eventually learned about the law authored by state Sen. Marty Block, a San Diego Democrat. \n \"(Voting) is central to his life,\" Alexander-Kasparik said. \"Civic responsibility is central to his life \u2026 There are so many people who died for this right. So many people take it for granted.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Restored voting rights sought for California disabled people"}

Contreras is part of a unique program at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix that aims to assist abuse survivors who have suffered head trauma. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Susan Contreras stands next to her bed in a Phoenix-area shelter for victims of domestic violence on Aug. 3. Contreras is part of a unique program at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix that aims to assist abuse survivors who have suffered head trauma. \n CHICAGO \u00bb There are no bomb blasts or collisions with burly linemen in Susan Contreras' past. Her headaches, memory loss and bouts of confused thinking were a mystery until doctors suggested a probable cause: domestic violence. \n A former partner repeatedly beat her, she says. \n \"He would hit me mainly in the head so that nobody would see the injuries. He'd hit me in the back of the head so the bruises wouldn't show,\" the Phoenix woman said. \n The abuse from her ex-partner took a heavy emotional toll, Contreras says. But even though he sometimes knocked her out, she hadn't considered that her brain might have been as damaged as her psyche. \n \"Honestly, there's so many holes in my memory, thinking problems,\" she said. \"My memory is really gone.\" \n Brain trauma in domestic violence survivors has been overshadowed by concerns about injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan war vets, and by effects of repeated head blows in football players. Experts believe many cases go undetected and untreated in abused women, making them vulnerable to problems with thinking, mood and behavior. \n Advocates say the injuries leave some survivors so impaired that they can't manage their jobs and lives. Some even end up homeless. \n About one-quarter of U.S. women and 14 percent of men have experienced severe physical assaults by a partner in their lifetime, including hitting, punching, being slammed against something hard or pushed down stairs, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Head and neck injuries are among the most common, and data suggest that domestic assaults may cause traumatic brain injuries in at least 60 percent of survivors, according to a research review published this year in the journal Family & Community Health. \n Traumatic brain injuries can result from even a single sudden blow to the head. The symptoms may be short-term or long-lasting, and repeated assaults increase chances for permanent neurological damage. Whether that damage can cause the downward spiral that domestic violence survivors sometimes get caught in is unproven, but studies have found these brain injuries are more common in homeless people than in the general population. And there's no dispute that they can cause life-changing disabilities. \n \"This population is not unlike that of our athletes,\" said Dr. Javier Cardenas, director of a brain injury program at Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. He's a trauma consultant for the National Football League and also treats domestic violence survivors. \n Cardenas cited Baltimore Ravens' running back Ray Rice's 2014 attack on his then-fiancee, caught on an elevator video camera. Much of the public discussion about the incident was about whether brain injuries in football players may be linked to violent behavior off the field. It overlooked a far more obvious injury. \n \"When Janay Rice was knocked out cold in the elevator, attention was all about how Ray Rice had previous concussions. Nobody mentioned that the woman in the elevator suffered a brain injury right in front of everybody's eyes,\" Cardenas said. \n Traumatic brain injuries include concussions and don't always cause loss of consciousness or damage that can be detected on imaging scans. Symptoms may not occur immediately but can develop over time, making it difficult sometimes to link them with previous abuse. \n The brain isn't a hard, fixed organ. It's more like jello, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid that works like a shock absorber when the head is hit. A violent blow \u2014 from colliding with a linebacker's helmet, from blast pressure after an explosion, or from a partner's angry fist \u2014 can damage brain cells at the point of impact and slam the brain against the skull, sometimes bruising tissue, tearing nerve fibers, or causing bleeding. \n Repeated blows have been linked with a degenerative brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy. CTE first made headlines several years ago when it was found in the brains of retired NFL players who had killed themselves. Research linking domestic violence with suicide is sparse, although several small studies have suggested that suicide attempts are much more common among battered women than among those who have not experienced partner abuse. \n CTE is linked with memory loss, confusion, mood changes including depression and eventually dementia. Some scientists think domestic violence survivors might be at risk. \n \"I have no doubt that there are many women who have been abused enough that some of them probably have CTE,\" said Dr. Robert Cantu, a leading expert on football-related brain injuries and co-director of Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. \n He said medical literature contains just one published case about probable CTE linked with domestic violence \u2014 a 1990 Lancet report about an autopsy on an abused 76-year-old British woman who had developed dementia. Her brain showed abnormalities resembling those seen in the brains of \"punch-drunk\" boxers. \n Survivors often don't seek immediate medical attention, or when they do, they often fear disclosing what caused their injuries. Some wait years, when troublesome symptoms persist or emerge, and then, many victims and doctors don't connect the problems with domestic abuse, said researcher Jacquelyn Campbell, a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. \n Many physician groups recommend that doctors screen women for domestic violence in emergency rooms or doctor offices, and the Affordable Care Act says insurance plans should cover the screening with no copays. But when screening occurs, questions often don't address traumatic brain injuries, and symptoms are sometimes thought to be a psychological reaction to abuse, so doctors don't probe further, Campbell said. \n Jennifer Kershaw, a Columbus, Ohio-area school teacher who won a court victory last year in an abuse lawsuit against her ex-husband, says she doesn't remember doctors ever mentioning traumatic brain injury after her 2013 beating, despite her symptoms. \n \"He put me in a headlock and punched me in the face I don't know how many times,\" she said. \"Then he kneed me in the face.\" She said she went to the emergency room with a black eye, broken cheekbone, nausea and dizziness, and still has difficulty concentrating. \n Though it's not clear if she did have a concussion or other brain injury, her symptoms are among those many experts say should lead doctors to investigate further. \n \"If a woman comes in with a black eye\" or is otherwise being assessed for domestic violence, \"we need to provide some good neurological workups like the help that is being provided to our veterans with traumatic brain injury,\" Campbell said. \n That includes detailed questions about symptoms, physical and mental exams, and sometimes imaging scans if more severe brain injury is suspected. \n Susan Contreras, 47, didn't get that kind of exam until almost 10 years after her final beating, after she landed in a Phoenix homeless shelter. A therapist there was concerned about her symptoms and sent her last December to the Barrow institute. The neurological center has established an unusual program offering an array of free treatment to homeless domestic violence survivors. \n Social worker Ashley Bridwell helped create the program after working with homeless shelters and noticing many women with suspected brain injuries. \n Many were hit in the head dozens of times, Bridwell said. \"Some were slammed into a wall or down a flight of stairs. These women have lived pretty hard lives,\" and their brain damage can make it hard to navigate out of homelessness, she said. \n Sometimes imaging tests show brain scarring that, in a strange way, can be comforting to survivors. \n \"They feel a sense of relief knowing there is a physical or medical reason for their problems,\" Dr. Cardenas said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fists not football: Brain injuries seen in domestic assaults"}

Police said that Derrick Dearman, 27, of Leakesville, Miss., has been taken into custody in connection with the murders. \n GEORGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT VIA AP \n A photo provided by the Greene County Sheriff's Department shows Derrick Dearman, a suspect in the Saturday massacre of five adults in Citronelle Ala. Dearman, of Leakesville, Mississippi, will be charged with six counts of capital murder, Mobile County sheriff's spokeswoman Lori Myles said Sunday. \n CITRONELLE, Ala. \u00bb A Mississippi man arrested after five people were found dead in a rural Alabama home blamed the gruesome rampage on drugs, telling reporters today there weren't words to express his regret for what had happened. \n Wearing shackles and escorted by law enforcement officers as he arrived in Mobile, Alabama, from Mississippi, where he surrendered to authorities, Derrick Dearman said he was on methamphetamine when he went to the house the night of the killing. \n Dearman, 27, said he turned himself in after sobering up. \n \"I came down and realized what was really going on,\" said Dearman, who didn't describe exactly what happened inside the home but apologized for his actions. \n Earlier, a Mississippi sheriff said Dearman had admitted killing at least one of the five adults slain at a rural home where his estranged girlfriend had sought shelter amid allegations of abuse. \n Hours after the slayings, Dearman walked into the sheriff's office in Leakesville, Mississippi, \"stating that he had killed someone or more than one person in Citronelle, Alabama,\" Greene County Sheriff Stanley McLeod said in a statement. \n The slayings, which happened at the end of a dirt road outside Citronelle, left three men and two women dead. The victims included a pregnant woman and her unborn child. \n Authorities said Dearman abducted estranged girlfriend Laneta Lester and a child from the house after the slayings, but both were later released unharmed. The home belonged to Lester's brother, who was among the victims and had let his sister stay there because she was afraid of Dearman, friends and relatives of the victims said. \n Dearman, in comments recorded on video, apologized to Lester by name and described the victims as his friends. \n A teenager who said she was related to all five victims by marriage or blood shook her head and fought back tears as she described her anguish over the slayings. \n \"They were really good people. They'd call and check on you, ask if you want to come down and eat,\" said Madison McDaniel, 17, who lives near the scene of the horrific violence. \n Relatives of the victims started an online fundraiser to help cover funeral expenses, and clerk Dawn Sullivan collected donations in a plastic jug on the counter at D&B Quick Stop, where the victims often stopped for snacks and drinks. \n \"It's a sad situation. It never should have gotten to that point,\" said Sullivan, whose husband was related to one of the victims. \n Dearman, of Leakesville, will be charged with six counts of capital murder, including one charge for the unborn child, Mobile County sheriff's spokeswoman Lori Myles said. \n Alabama court records don't indicate whether Dearman has an attorney who could speak on his behalf. \n The slain were identified as Shannon Melissa Randall, 35; Joseph Adam Turner, 26; Justin Kaleb Reed, 23; Chelsea Marie Reed, 22; and Robert Lee Brown, 26, Myles said. \n Turner was Lester's brother and had let her stay at the house, which all the victims shared, McDaniel and Sullivan said. Turner and Randall were married. \n \"I'd always get on my horse and ride down there bareback,\" McDaniel said. Her step-aunt Randall would say, \"'Be careful because you're already got a hurt knee.' I'd say, 'OK, Shan-Shan.' That's what I called her.\" \n Brown was Randall's brother, McDaniel said, and Chelsea Reed was Randall's niece. Chelsea Reed was pregnant with the child of her husband, Justin Reed, said McDaniel. \n About 1 a.m. Saturday, someone inside the home called 911 and reported that Dearman was on the property, authorities said in a statement. Citronelle police came to the house, but Dearman had left before officers arrived, sheriff's officials said. \n Before daylight Saturday, Dearman returned to the home and attacked the victims while they were sleeping, the sheriff's department said. Mobile County District Attorney Ashley Rich said \"multiple weapons\" were used. \n After the killings, Dearman forced Lester and a 3-month-old identified by relatives as the child of Randall and Turner into a vehicle, and they drove to Dearman's father's house in Mississippi. Dearman released Lester and the infant and turned himself in, authorities said. \n Dearman's ex-wife, Crystal Dearman, told WALA-TV the man \"always had a temper, especially when he doesn't get his way.\" \n \"I woke up to him holding a knife to my throat in bed with my baby in the crib,\" said Dearman, who said the two divorced in 2010. \"He's made threats the entire time we were together and after we separated.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Suspect in deaths of 5 in Alabama blames drugs for slaughter"}

Rick Scott, foreground, speaks during an Aug. 4 news conference along with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden, left, Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-FL, and Fla. Surgeon General and Secretary, Dr. Celeste Philip, far right, in Doral, Fla. \n MIAMI \u00bb On his third visit to Miami since the nation's first outbreak of Zika, Florida Gov. Rick Scott today once again asked Washington for more help fighting the infectious disease \u2014 even as he fended off accusations that he's not disclosing new cases quickly enough.  \n \"We are still asking the federal government to be a partner in this,\" said Scott, who asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to send an additional 5,000 Zika antibody tests and 10,000 prevention kits to Florida \u2014 an order that federal officials have promised to fill by Tuesday. \n State health officials say the virus has begun spreading locally in Miami-Dade County, first in a mile-square area of Wynwood and, most recently, in a 1.5-square-mile section of Miami Beach. \n At a roundtable meeting in the De Hostos Senior Center in Wynwood, Scott said the state is \"working hard\" to fight the virus and provide the resources it can. In a bipartisan push for federal Zika dollars, he appeared with U.S. Reps. Frederica Wilson \u2014 a Democrat \u2014 and Carlos Curbelo, a Republican, as well as Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez and Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine. \n But the coalition quickly fell apart. Levine, a Democrat with gubernatorial aspirations, had accused the Republican governor earlier that day of playing politics with Zika and keeping the city in the dark about the number of local infections. He confronted the governor. \n \"It's important that myself, the city manager, our counterparts at the county are getting timely, accurate information as fast as possible,\" Levine said. \"As you know, we have our constituents. We have our businesses \u2026 We've just got to have that information.\" \n He continued: \"I hope that after this meeting we can be assured by you and your team that we will get information as soon as possible.\" \n Scott responded to Levine that the state has a responsibility to ensure that the information it issues on Zika is \"timely and accurate.\" A few hours earlier, he told reporters that he had released the information about the Miami Beach cases within hours of confirming them on Friday morning. \n But after the meeting, the governor criticized Levine for not returning his telephone calls and failing to attend previous community meetings the governor had hosted on Zika. \n \"Everybody's had the opportunity to participate,\" Scott said. \n Gimenez, a Republican who has participated in the governor's community meetings prior to the first local Zika case, also took a shot at Scott during Monday's meeting. \n \"Everything's not rosy, governor,\" Gimenez said to Scott, who was seated near him. \"There are times when communication has broken down a little bit and we want to make sure that doesn't happen. We want to make sure we are all on the same page, and we are all communicating the same thing. We are all Floridians.\" \n Florida has 37 cases of locally transmitted Zika virus, according to the state health department. State Surgeon General Celeste Philip said there were no new local cases to report on Monday. There were seven new travel-related cases, with four in Miami-Dade, two in Osceola and one involving a pregnant woman \u2014 raising the statewide total to 600 people who have been infected with Zika this year. \n Philip vowed an aggressive response to knock down mosquitoes and educate the public about Zika in Miami Beach. She said Wynwood has seen improvement after weeks of aerial spraying. \n \"So far in Wynwood,\" she said, \"we've seen that we've gone several weeks without any new cases.\" \n Florida Agricultural Commissioner Adam Putnam reported the state has trapped and tested 32,000 mosquitoes statewide, including 6,000 in Miami-Dade, and none have returned positive for Zika virus, which he said was \"a good thing.\" \n During the Wynwood meeting, Scott promised Miami-Dade that the state is sending an additional $5 million to help offset the county's costs for increased mosquito-control efforts in response to Zika, including aerial spraying in Wynwood and trucks and backpack foggers in Miami Beach. \n \"I'm very happy to hear that there's a check in the mail. We'll be waiting for it,\" responded Gimenez, who has estimated that Zika will force the county to spend about $8 million. \n Gimenez said the county has launched an aggressive response with more than 100 workers in the field every day dedicated to mosquito control. \n Last week, Scott announced a second area in Miami-Dade with active transmission of the virus by mosquitoes on Miami Beach between Eighth and 28th streets, and Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean \u2014 the heart of the region's tourism industry. Federal health officials issued an unprecedented advisory, telling pregnant women to avoid the tourist destination \u2014 and to consider postponing travel to Miami-Dade County altogether. \n The governor has yet to visit Miami Beach since announcing the news that Zika was spreading in the resort city. Scott's absence was criticized on Monday by U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, who held a news conference alongside Levine, the Miami Beach mayor, at an Alton Road cafe. \n \"He isn't planning on coming to Miami Beach, which is astonishing,\" said Wasserman Schultz, who has criticized congressional Republicans for failing to fund an emergency appropriation requested by President Barack Obama in February to fight Zika. \n Wasserman Schultz and Levine also criticized Scott for providing insufficient information to local leaders when he announced the news that Zika was spreading on the beach. \n \"This issue is serious,\" Levine said. \"To play politics with people's lives is wrong, and there's no place for that.\" \n In Wynwood, business owners complained to the governor about the economic impacts of the CDC's travel advisory telling pregnant women to avoid a square-mile area just north of downtown Miami.  \n While Scott's administration has \"cleared\" sections of the square-mile area in Wynwood, the CDC's guidance advising pregnant women to avoid the entire zone has remained unchanged. \n Albert Garcia, vice chair of the Wynwood Business Improvement District, said Zika has put at risk a decade's worth of redevelopment efforts to transform the once-blighted area into a cultural attraction. \n \"We can lose this in the next couple of weeks if we don't act quickly,\" Garcia said. \n \"When the box gets drawn, there's tremendous implications,\" said Joseph Furst, the group's chairman, \"and it sends an incorrect message to individuals outside that box where those individuals feel there's no concern if they're outside that area, and we know that's inaccurate.\" \n \"The reality of that box is suffocating,\" added Jessica Goldman, CEO of Goldman Properties. \"Businesses have seen anywhere from a 50 to 60 percent decrease. \u2026 It's been a message of fear.\" \n Scott acknowledged the importance of tourism to Florida's economy, noting that the industry employs about 1.2 million people statewide. He wouldn't say whether the state's public-private partnership to promote tourism, Visit Florida, would handle Zika. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Miami Herald  \n ", "author": "By Daniel Chang and Patricia Mazzei Miami Herald", "title": "Florida governor to feds: Help us fight Zika"}

He said the guidelines contradicted existing statutes and regulatory texts. \n And he appeared to agree with Texas' assertion that the guidelines \"hold a gun to the head\" of local school districts. \n \"The information before the court demonstrates defendants have 'drawn a line in the sand' in that they have concluded plaintiffs must abide by the guidelines, without exception, or they are in breach of their \u2026 obligations,\" he wrote in a 38-page order. \n The decision is a blow for the Obama administration, which had said that schools should allow transgender students to use bathrooms that match their gender identity. \n Federal officials had defended their interpretation that the word \"sex\" in anti-discrimination statutes also covers \"gender identity.\" They also argued that the lawsuit was filed too soon, because the transgender policy isn't binding and enforcement action hasn't been taken. \n Attorneys representing Texas, however, said the guidelines would force school districts \"to mix the sexes in intimate areas.\" They said the federal policies \"obliterate\" past rules, putting Texas and other states at risk of losing millions of dollars in education funding. \n Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Monday that he was pleased with the decision \"against the Obama administration's latest illegal federal overreach.\" \n \"This president is attempting to rewrite the laws enacted by the elected representatives of the people, and is threatening to take away federal funding from schools to force them to conform,\" Paxton said in a written statement. \n Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said the \"department is disappointed in the court's decision, and we are reviewing our options.\" And transgender advocates, while decrying the ruling as dangerous, predicted that it would be just a temporary setback. \n \"One judge in a district court is simply a bump on the road,\" said Paul Castillo, a staff attorney for Lambda Legal, an LBGT rights group that filed a \"friend of the court\" brief in this case. \"Any adverse decision on this is an outlier, based on other decisions that have been issued.\" \n The preliminary injunction, which comes as school starts in Texas, applies all across the country. But other courts in the U.S. have tackled similar questions differently, and experts said the order doesn't prevent schools from having the policies encouraged by the federal government. \n Even O'Connor, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, cautioned in his order that \"resolution of this difficult policy issue\" is not final. \n \"This case presents the difficult issue of balancing the protection of students' rights and that of personal privacy when using school bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and other intimate facilities, while ensuring that no student is unnecessarily marginalized,\" he wrote. \n The battle over transgender rights has emerged as a new front in America's culture wars, with an outsize portion of the attention focused on bathrooms. \n Social conservatives, who've cast the issue in terms of safety, have pursued the fight in various arenas. Just last week, they claimed victory over Target and its transgender policy after the big box retailer announced it would spend $20 million to add single-stall bathrooms to its stores. \n \"Clearly, Target has responded to the nationwide outcry against this ridiculous policy,\" Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said last week in a fundraising appeal. \n But the debate has only sharpened with the inclusion of schools, as seen by the stir created this year by the Fort Worth school district's more inclusive transgender policy. And no matter the venue, LGBT advocacy groups say they are seeking to protect essential rights. \n \"Transgender Texans, and in particular transgender kids, must be afforded the most basic dignity to use the bathroom,\" Chuck Smith, chief executive of Equality Texas, said in a news release on Monday. \n At the center of the latest legal dispute is Harrold Independent School District, a tiny Texas district of about 100 students near the Oklahoma border. \n The district rose to prominence after the U.S. Education and Justice departments in May \u2014 after a separate legal battle over the matter in North Carolina \u2014 explained what schools should do to ensure that there is no discrimination against transgender children. \n The directive, while nonbinding, left little doubt that federal funds could be at stake. \n As top Texas Republicans sprung into action, Paxton's office recruited Harrold ISD to be the lawsuit's lead plaintiff. Though Superintendent David Thweatt isn't aware of any transgender students in the district, the district affirmed a policy of limiting restroom use by biological sex. \n Texas was ultimately joined in the lawsuit by Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, along with the Republican governors of Kentucky, Maine and Mississippi. \n Much of the disagreement can be distilled to the word \"sex,\" as it's used in the anti-discrimination statutes known as Title IX and Title VII. Title IX \u2014 arguably most well-known in the context of collegiate sports \u2014 focuses on education, while Title VII addresses employment.  \n The Obama administration has argued that ambiguity in the law over the definition of \"sex\" gives federal officials the ability to interpret it as including \"gender identity.\" Justice Department attorney Benjamin Berwick this month described the matter as \"an emerging issue.\" \n \"Gender is a sex-based characteristic,\" he told O'Connor at a hearing in Fort Worth. \n But Texas officials countered that the plain meaning of the law refers only to sex \u2014 biological sex. And O'Connor agreed, saying the feds didn't pursue the proper process to make a change of such substance. \n \"A definition that confuses instead of clarifies is unpersuasive,\" O'Connor wrote in his order. \n The more immediate question fueling the preliminary injunction, however, was whether Texas and others faced immediate \"irreparable harm.\" \n Federal officials stressed that the transgender guidelines didn't carry the force of law. Arguing that the lawsuit was actually filed prematurely, Berwick said this month that the plaintiffs \"have identified no action being taken against them.\" \n But Austin Nimocks, a Texas associate deputy attorney general said the guidelines are indeed \"coercive because they place into jeopardy a very substantial sum\" of federal education dollars. And again, O'Connor agreed. \n \"Although defendants have characterized the guidelines as interpretive, post-guidance events and their actual legal effect prove that they are 'compulsory in nature,'\" he wrote. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 The Dallas Morning News  \n ", "author": "By Tom Benning The Dallas Morning News", "title": "Federal judge blocks Obama's rules on bathrooms for transgender students"}

She would falsely verify the prescriptions when suspicious pharmacies called with questions, the court documents said. \n The conspiracy involved about 15,000 pills, prosecutors said \n A federal judge ruled Monday that Vasconcellos can be released to a drug treatment program on $50,000 bond. U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Kurren, who called the case troubling, said he was prepared to release him so he can get drug treatment. \n \"I actually thank the system right now because something happened,\" Vasconcellos said, adding that he's thinking clearly now. \n He promised that he'll abide by conditions of his release and won't flee. \n \"He maintains he was not forging the prescriptions,\" Vasconcellos' defense attorney, Megan Kau, said after the hearing.

{"date": "August 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former Justice Secretary and now Senator Leila De Lima, center back, talks to relatives of victims of alleged extra judicial killings at the start of the Senate probe on the rising number of deaths related to President Rodrigo Duterte's \"War on Drugs\" today in suburban Pasay city, south of Manila. \n  MANILA >> Philippine senators opened an inquiry into the killings of more than 1,700 suspected drug dealers and users amid a crackdown spearheaded by President Rodrigo Duterte, with witnesses accusing some policemen of gunning down suspects or being involved in illegal drugs. \n Sen. Leila de Lima, who heads the Senate justice committee leading the investigation, said that she was worried about the widespread killings, and that law enforcers and vigilantes may be using the crackdown \"to commit murder with impunity.\" \n At least 1,779 drug suspects have been killed, including 712 who were gunned down in clashes with police, with the rest being slain in still-unclear circumstances, possibly by anti-crime vigilantes, national police chief Director-General Ronald dela Rosa told the senators Monday, adding that he did not condone extrajudicial killings. \n The high number of deaths has alarmed human rights groups and leaders of the dominant Roman Catholic church, as well as the United States and U.N.-appointed human rights experts, who have warned the Philippine government and its officials that they could be held liable amid the widespread killings. \n Another senator, Antonio Trillanes IV, asked dela Rosa why the police have failed to stop the killings by suspected anti-crime vigilantes, including motorcycle-riding gunmen. \n \"This is like anarchy,\" Trillanes said. \"It's continuing under your watch.\" \n Trillanes warned policemen who might get involved in extrajudicial killings that they would be held criminally liable and convicted despite an assurance from Duterte that he would defend them if they face criminal and human rights charges while fighting crime. \n \"What I'm saying, general, is the world revolves,\" Trillanes told dela Rosa and other police generals at the hearing, citing instances when military and police personnel were criminally charged for heeding unlawful orders. \n \"President Duterte is in position now, but what if his successor will prioritize human rights and conduct investigations?\" he asked. \n The brash Duterte, who built a name as a tough crime-busting mayor before rising to the presidency in June, has repeatedly threatened criminals, especially drug dealers, with death, which dela Rosa has emulated and even joked about. After facing criticism, both have clarified that policemen were under orders to shoot only if their lives are threatened. \n Harra Besorio, one of a dozen witnesses scheduled to testify before the Senate committee, told the senators that policemen illegally arrested her boyfriend and his father, and beat them up in front of her. Neighbors then took them to a police anti-drugs station, where they were shot and killed last month, she said. \n While searching her house without any warrant, one of the policemen forcibly removed the underwear of her 2-year-old daughter to check if the child was used to hide illegal drugs but found nothing, Besorio said in the nationally televised inquiry, acknowledging that her husband had peddled drugs to feed his family. \n Two policemen accused of shooting Besorio's boyfriend and his father argued that the suspects fought back and one tried to grab a police officer's gun, but Commission on Human Rights official Gilbert Boiser said that was unlikely because an investigation showed the two suspects have been weakened by the beatings and were already in police custody in a station when they died, adding that each was shot three times. \n \"There were human rights violations,\" Boiser said. \n The two policemen accused in the killings of Besorio's boyfriend and his father have been charged with murder, police said. \n Another witness, Mary Rose Aquino, testified that her poor father, accompanied by her mother, had peddled drugs supplied by policemen and then remitted the money to them. In June, however, her parents were called by the policemen and the two were never seen alive again, she told the senators. \n Duterte, a former state prosecutor, has been hypersensitive to criticism of his anti-drugs campaign and accused de Lima last week of having an affair with her driver, who allegedly collected protection money from detained drug lords when she was still the justice secretary. De Lima denied any wrongdoing and vowed to proceed with her Senate committee inquiry of the massive killings. \n Over the weekend, Duterte threatened to withdraw the Philippines from the United Nations after two of its appointed human rights experts expressed concerns about the drug killings. However, Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. said Monday that the Philippines has no plans to break off from the U.N., adding that Duterte was expressing his disappointment over the experts' criticisms and was hungry and tired when he uttered those remarks. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philippine senators investigate hundreds of drug-related killings"}

{"date": "August 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This combo shows two examples of some of the social media postings by Trump campaign staff members discovered by the Associated Press in an online search. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Donald Trump's paid campaign staffers have declared on their personal social media accounts that Muslims are unfit to be U.S. citizens, ridiculed Mexican accents, called for Secretary of State John Kerry to be hanged and stated their readiness for a possible civil war, according to a review by The Associated Press of their postings. \n The AP examined the social media feeds of more than 50 current and former campaign employees who helped propel Trump through the primary elections. The campaign has employed a mix of veteran political operatives and outsiders. Most come across as dedicated, enthusiastic partisans, but at least seven expressed views that were overtly racially charged, supportive of violent actions or broadly hostile to Muslims. \n A graphic designer for Trump's advance team approvingly posted video of a black man eating fried chicken and criticizing fellow blacks for ignorance, irresponsibility and having too many children. A Trump field organizer in Virginia declared that Muslims were seeking to impose Sharia law in America and that \"those who understand Islam for what it is are gearing up for the fight.\" \n The AP's findings come at a time when Trump is showing new interest in appealing to minority voters, insisting he will be fair in dealing with the 11 million people in the U.S. illegally and explicitly pitching himself to African-Americans, saying \"what do you have to lose?\" \n Since Trump declared his candidacy last summer, he has paid about 120 people on his campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Over the weekend, the campaign reported about 70 people drawing salaries, a number that did not include a few dozen more working as consultants. A slew of hires in early August were not yet reflected in Trump's filings. \n The AP was able to review the accounts of only a minority of Trump staffers: Others set their accounts to private, some could not be found or identified with confidence as Trump campaign employees. \n The AP also reviewed the public social media accounts of more than three dozen employees of Hillary Clinton's far larger campaign staff and found nothing as inflammatory. One staffer said Trump's style of speaking reminded him of a roommate who had taken too many hallucinogenic mushrooms. AP also reviewed images attached to more than 19,000 stolen internal emails from the Democratic National Committee for racially or religiously inflammatory memes, finding nothing of note. \n The Clinton campaign declined to comment on its procedures for vetting staff. It employs more than 650 people, according to its FEC filings. \n One month ago, the AP sent written questions to the Trump campaign with examples of the posts. The campaign has not commented, despite several requests since. \n Veteran Republican campaign operatives said keeping an eye on staffers' social media postings has long been a standard practice. \n \"In vetting a prospective staffer, I'm not sure where the line would be for not hiring someone or simply asking them to take something down from social media, but there is a line,\" said Beth Myers, a former top Mitt Romney campaign aide. \n During Myers' work for Mitt Romney in the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, she said, social media was newer, so indiscrete or embarrassing photos were more often concerns than inflammatory views. Even outside social media, she stressed to the campaigns' staffers that what they said and did would reflect on the candidate who employed them. \"Don't put anything in an email that you wouldn't want on the front page of The New York Times,\" she recalled telling staff. \"The same thing I told my kids, I told my staffers.\" \n The AP found little questionable content in the ranks of Trump's top officials. The campaign's social media director, Dan Scavino, tweets prolifically but avoids discussing race and religion. Field organizers representing Trump's campaign around the country, however, have had no such reservations, either before or during their employment with the campaign. Their judgment matters beyond the campaign because the paid staff of winning presidential candidates often receives jobs in the next administration. \n Before being tapped as statewide director of coalitions, Craig Bachler of Bradenton, Florida, posted jokes in 2015 about Mexican accents superimposed over pictures of an overweight man wearing a sombrero. Bachler was named by the campaign as official staff in November, though there is no record he has been paid for his work. Bachler did not respond to a request for comment via Facebook or a message left at his office voicemail. After AP's inquiries, Bachler blocked access to an AP reporter, and his Facebook account \u2014 which included a photo of Bachler with Trump \u2014 was scrubbed to remove the offensive post. \n Teresa Unrue, a field organizer and graphic designer in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for Trump's advance team, shared a video on her Facebook account July 11 \u2014 the week before the Republican National Convention \u2014 of a black man eating fried chicken while shaming fellow black people. \n \"Why are you mad about slavery?\" the man asks. \"Y'all weren't no damn slaves.\" \n \"Had me crack'n up!! Thank you!\" Unrue wrote of the video. \"Please share this with people.\" \n In a short phone conversation, Unrue said she tried to keep her personal social media comments positive and referred questions to the campaign. \n Some posts fixated on stories of black-on-white violence with claims that news about such crimes was being suppressed. \n \"How about this little white boy being murdered by a black man,\" grassroots organizer Annie Marie Delgado of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, wrote in December 2014 post, one of a number highlighting crimes against white people before Trump declared his candidacy. Delgado also shared a discredited, hoax photo of the State Department's Kerry with Jane Fonda, and commented: \"I say hang them!\" She was paid $11,146 through April, according to campaign records. \n Fear or dislike of Muslims was a recurring theme. Though Trump at one point proposed temporarily barring foreign Muslims from entering the country and scrutinizing the activities of mosques, he has sometimes distinguished Islamic extremists who pose a risk and those who don't. \"I love the Muslims,\" Trump said in September, expressing willingness to appoint one to his Cabinet. \n On Facebook, Mark Kevin Lloyd of Lynchburg, Virginia, who has been paid $36,000 as Trump's field director in the state, shared a post June 30 calling Islam \"a barbaric cult.\" He shared a meme June 16, four days after the Orlando nightclub shooting by a heavily armed Muslim who professed allegiance to the Islamic State group. The meme said people should be forced to eat bacon before they can purchase firearms. \n Lloyd declined to talk to the AP without the Trump campaign's permission, citing his nondisclosure agreement with the campaign. \n Other campaign staffers also singled out Muslims for special scrutiny. \n Unrue shared the statement, \"We need Islam control, not gun control.\" \n During her time with the campaign, Delgado deplored the appointment of a Muslim-American judge in New York. \n \"Step by step\u2026 this is how American culture will end,\" she wrote Feb. 27, saying it was only reasonable to believe that the judge would implement Sharia law. \n Delgado said in a telephone interview she stopped working for the campaign in April. She said she did not recall making some of the posts the AP asked her about and does not stand by others. \n \"If I read the whole thing, I probably wouldn't have posted it,\" she said of one post she shared, a short essay declaring that Muslims are inherently incapable of being good Americans. \n Phillip Dann, a field organizer in Massachusetts who recently relocated to Florida, was paid $6,153 between January and March. He shared a meme mocking \"Muslim sympathizers.\" He also shared an article about Trump threatening to bring back waterboarding \"or worse,\" and added \"where is the gasoline?\" Dann told the AP in a phone interview he had no antipathy against Muslims in general. \n Dann attributed inflammatory comments of other Trump staffers to the fact that the campaign had drawn on people inexperienced in politics. While he has been politically active for decades \u2014 originally as a leftist, he said \u2014 he described the field staff Trump acquired in the primary as unfamiliar with traditional campaign rules. \n \"We get hired because there was no one left,\" Dann said. In a later email, he acknowledged some of his and other staff postings were \"clearly over the top\" \u2014 but said that criticism of the posts would amount to intimidation. \n Scott Barrish, who earned $12,250 as Trump's political director for the Tampa Bay, Florida, region, took his views beyond social media posts. In 2011, he drew local press coverage for writing to the head of the nonprofit Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy group for Muslims in the U.S., saying he was wise to its plans to establish a totalitarian theocracy in the United states. \n \"This is us vs. you,\" wrote Barrish. \"In the great words of the late President Ronald Reagan, 'I win, you lose!'\" \n Separately, Barrish tweeted in 2013 that he hoped America wasn't headed for civil war, but \"if our freedoms must be defended against a tyrannical government, so be it.\" \n \"Those comments at that time were made by me and were my own personal view,\" Barrish said in a brief interview with AP. He said he stopped working for Trump's campaign after the Florida primary. \"I don't want to detract anything from the campaign.\" \n Barrish separately complained to editors at AP about its review of publicly accessible material on Trump employees' social media accounts, saying \"the liberal media, yellow journalists are really grasping at straws with their ad hominem circumstantial logical fallacies!\" \n Many accounts AP reviewed embraced conspiracy theories. Lloyd, the Virginia field director, said Obama is aiding the Iranian nuclear program as part of the president's \"'final solution' to the Israel problem,\" a phrase evoking the Holocaust. \n Delgado, the Florida organizer, circulated a theory that the company Edible Arrangements LLC is funneling money to Hamas, a claim that the Anti-Defamation League, a U.S. Jewish organization, has repeatedly dismissed as false. \n Unrue posted a link to a website that alleged that the U.S. government assassinated Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died earlier this year after a history of heart trouble. \n Racially charged social media posts from Trump campaign employees and associates have already been a repeated source of embarrassment. Trump fired one adviser who had used a racial slur to describe Obama's children, and the campaign denounced Trump's longtime Mar-a-Lago butler for saying he would support dragging Obama from the White House and hanging him. \n Katie Packer, a 2012 Romney deputy campaign manager who opposes Trump, said the social media posts AP reviewed would have all been immediate disqualifiers for anyone who had applied for a campaign job \u2014 even if the postings weren't visible to the public. \n \"A comfort level with people who think this is OK is indicative of what you think is OK,\" Packer said. \"Maybe the campaign just doesn't know about this, but that's malpractice.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Chad Day and Ted Bridis in Washington and Nick Riccardi in Denver contributed to this story. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Racism and talk of religious war: Trump staff's online posts"}

One witness, a 16-year-old tourist, said he was walking with his younger siblings on a beach-area walkway when he heard a scream from the lagoon and saw the alligator taking the boy away. \n \"The alligator first came in head first toward the beach but turned around once it had the child in its mouth and crawled back into the water headfirst,\" Peter Courakos told deputies. \n Several guests at the resort reported seeing the alligator swimming in the lagoon shortly before the attack. \n Tourist Alfred Smith said he photographed the alligator from his hotel room balcony about an hour and a half before the attack. A short time before the attack, he said, he saw children playing in the ankle-deep water. He was heading out the door to warn them about the alligator when he heard Lane's mother screaming, the wildlife agency report said. \n Another tourist, Shawna Giacomini told investigators her two daughters saw the alligator five feet from shore about 45 minutes before the attack. The eldest daughter told a Disney employee about it, and that employee went to inform another Disney worker. The Giacominis went to a nearby store and when they returned the boy had been attacked, according to the wildlife agency's report. \n Disney lifeguard Christopher Tubbs told deputies that after the boy was snatched he saw Lane's feet sticking out about 20 feet from shore. \n \"He saw the alligator start slash(ing) around and the shoes went under the water and the alligator began its death roll,\" the sheriff's office report said. \n The wildlife agency's report said Lane did nothing to provoke the alligator and that the death is classified as a predatory attack. \n The alligator may have had a diminished fear of people by being in an area with lots of humans, and wildlife officials are still investigating if alligator feeding took place, according to the wildlife agency. \n Lane's parents have said publicly they don't plan to sue Walt Disney World over the death. \n After Lane's death, Disney World made changes to limit possible visitor contact with alligators on the property. \n Workers were building a stone wall around the lagoon and \"No Fishing\" signs were installed around waterfront areas. Fishing at Disney World was changed to be limited only to excursions. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Report: Alligator bit boy's head during Disney attack"}

{"date": "August 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former President Bill Clinton greets members of the public after participating in a meeting about economic issues with developer Kem Gardner in downtown Salt Lake City. \n WASHINGTON >> Former President Bill Clinton defended the work of his charitable foundation Monday, telling supporters that it had \"improved millions of lives around the world\" but needs to change if his wife, Hillary Clinton, wins the White House. \n The former president outlined the Clinton Foundation's accomplishments and planned shift in scope in an email to about 500,000 supporters. It came hours after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called the foundation \"the most corrupt enterprise in political history\" adding, \"It must be shut down immediately.\" \n Bill Clinton announced last week that the foundation will no longer accept contributions from foreign governments and corporations if his wife, the Democratic presidential nominee, is elected. The ex-president, who oversees the foundation with daughter Chelsea Clinton, also said he would hold his final Clinton Global Initiative meeting next month in New York regardless of the election's outcome. \n \"Since Hillary began her presidential campaign in 2015, Chelsea and I have made it clear that the work the Clinton Foundation started should continue if Hillary is elected, but that changes would be necessary,\" Bill Clinton said in the email. \"While it would be presumptive to assume a victory in November, now that Hillary is her party's nominee, it would be irresponsible not to plan for it.\" \n The changes aim to address criticism from Republicans and some Democrats that the foundation has created a significant conflict of interest as Hillary Clinton seeks the presidency. While Trump has donated to the foundation previously, he has charged Hillary Clinton with creating a \"pay-for-play\" scheme at the State Department through the work of the foundation. \n Defending the foundation's mission, Bill Clinton pointed to more than 11.5 million people in more than 70 countries who have gained access to HIV/AIDS drugs at a much lower cost and millions of American students who have healthier food and more physical education options because of the foundation. He also noted the foundation's work around the globe, including efforts to help improve Haiti's sustainability, foster job training in Latin America and support farmers in East Africa. \n The ex-president said in the event of another Clinton presidency, the foundation's work, funding and his role in it would raise questions that would need to be resolved \"in a way that keeps the good work going while eliminating legitimate concerns about potential conflicts of interest.\" \n If Hillary Clinton is elected, the former president said the foundation would accept contributions only from U.S. citizens, permanent residents and U.S.-based independent foundations, whose names would continue to be disclosed on a quarterly basis. He said the official name would be changed from the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation to the Clinton Foundation. And he said he would step down from the board and no longer raise money for it. \n Bill Clinton said that much of the foundation's international activities would be transitioned to other organizations to continue that type of work. \n John Podesta, the chairman of the Clinton campaign, said in a statement on Monday that the foundation had laid out \"unprecedented steps\" that it would take if Hillary Clinton is elected. He urged Trump to \"come clean\" with the electorate about the business mogul's \"complex network of for-profit businesses\" that are in debt to big banks, the Bank of China and business groups with ties to Russia. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Bill Clinton defends work of Clinton Foundation"}

Republican leaders fear that Trump can't win \u2014 and could drag down GOP congressional candidates \u2014 if he doesn't increase his support beyond his white, male base. \n Trump met Saturday with Hispanic supporters, representatives of a community that has been wary of the billionaire businessman's deportation proposals and his plans to build a giant wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Questioned on whether Trump still intends to deploy the deportation force, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Sunday: \"To be determined.\" \n There have been previous signs that Trump might be moderating his stance on deportations. At last month's GOP convention, the Republican National Committee's director of Hispanic communications, Helen Aguirre Ferre, told reporters at a Spanish-language briefing that Trump has said he will not do massive deportations. Hispanic and religious leaders who met privately with Trump ahead of the convention said he signaled that he is open to embracing a less punitive immigration policy that focuses on \"compassion\" along with the rule of law. \n Trump's comments today come as Republican officials insist the GOP nominee is finally hitting his stride and will catch up with Democrat Hillary Clinton by early September, following a major shake-up to his campaign. Polls now mostly show Trump lagging Clinton by 5 percentage points or more nationally. \n \"Donald Trump has been disciplined and mature. And I think he's going to get this thing back on track,\" Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, said Sunday. \n Conway echoed Priebus' optimism, contending that the candidate just had the best week of his campaign, \"mostly because he's able to be himself, the authentic Donald Trump.\" \n Conway was named to her post last week in a shake-up in which the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, resigned and conservative media firebrand Stephen Bannon, who led Breitbart News, took over as campaign chief executive. \n A new style was immediately evident as Trump, in a first, offered regrets for any remarks that had caused offense, stuck with his teleprompter at a series of events, and paid a visit to flood-ravaged Louisiana. Trump also announced his first ad buys of the campaign, more evidence of an acceptance of the traditional campaign elements most experts believe he will need in order to have a shot at winning. He made a direct appeal to African-American voters, insisting he wants the Republican Party to become their political home. \n Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, disputed claims of a turnaround in Trump's candidacy. \"We're not seeing a pivot. Donald Trump himself said this was not a pivot. He wants to double down on letting Donald Trump be Donald Trump,\" Mook said. \n Indeed, Trump was back to his old self on Twitter this morning. He went after MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" tweeting that the show is \"unwatchable!\" and said its host, Mika Brzezinski, \"is off the wall, a neurotic and not very bright mess!\" \n Conway had said Sunday that Trump \"doesn't hurl personal insults.\" \n Conway, Mook and Priebus were interviewed on ABC's \"This Week.\" and Conway also spoke on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump says he's not flip-flopping on immigration"}

{"date": "August 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Reporters gathered at a chain link fence corner of a parking lot, trying to hear Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's remarks to a crowd of about 1,000 supporters during a fundraiser at the Pilgrim Monument and Provincetown Museum in Provincetown, Mass. on Sunday. \n PROVINCETOWN, Mass. \u00bb It was a very busy, very lucrative weekend for Hillary Clinton in the summer playground of the East Coast's moneyed elite. \n She brunched with wealthy backers at a seaside estate in Nantucket, snacking on shrimp dumplings and crabcakes. A few hours later, she and her husband dined with an intimate party of thirty at a secluded Martha's Vineyard estate. And on Sunday afternoon, she joined the singer Cher at a \"LGBT summer celebration\" on the far reaches of Cape Cod. \n By Sunday evening, Clinton had spoken to more than 2,200 campaign donors. But what she told the crowds remains a mystery. \n Clinton has refused to open her fundraisers to journalists, reversing nearly a decade of greater transparency in presidential campaigns and leaving the public guessing at what she's saying to some of her most powerful supporters. \n It's an approach that differs from the Democratic president she hopes to succeed. Since his 2008 campaign, President Barack Obama has allowed reporters traveling with him into the backyards and homes of wealthy donors to witness his some of his remarks. \n While reporters are escorted out of Obama's events before the start of the juicier Q&A, the president's approach offers at least a limited measure of accountability that some fear may disappear when Clinton or Republican nominee Donald Trump moves into the White House. \n \"Unfortunately these things have a tendency to ratchet down,\" said Larry Noble, the general counsel of the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. \"As the bar gets lower, it's hard to raise it again.\" \n Clinton's campaign does release limited details about her events, naming the hosts, how many people attended and how much they gave. That's more than Trump, whose far fewer fundraisers are held entirely away from the media, with no details provided. \n Even some Democrats privately acknowledge that Clinton's penchant for secrecy is a liability, given voters continued doubts about her honesty. \n While Clinton will occasionally take questions from reporters at campaign stops, she has not held a full-fledged news conference in more than 260 days. Trump has held several. She refuses to release the transcripts of dozens of closed-door speeches she delivered to companies and business associations after leaving the State Department, despite significant bipartisan criticism. \n And since announcing her presidential bid in April 2015, Clinton has held around 300 fundraising events \u2014 only around five have been open to any kind of news coverage. \n \"It does feed this rap about being secretive and being suspicious,\" said GOP strategist Whit Ayers. \n Clinton's aides have promised for weeks that greater access to her events will be coming soon. But Trump's lack of disclosure has given her political cover to keep the doors closed, particularly as she conducts a period of intense fundraising before the final sprint to Election Day. \n While Clinton is expected to make only two public appearances before the end of August, she and her top backers will mingle with donors at no fewer than 54 events according to a fundraising schedule obtained by The Associated Press. \n Reporters covering these events wait outside, in vans, parking lots and vacant guesthouses \u2014 even at homes they've entered with Obama at previous events. In Provincetown on Sunday, five reporters crowded into the corner of a parking lot, clinging to a chain link fence as they tried to catch Clinton's speech to a crowd of about 1,000 supporters. \n None of her remarks seemed particularly remarkable: The candidate could faintly be heard running through her standard stump speech. \n During a Saturday fundraiser at a stately Martha's Vineyard estate, faint cheers could be heard as Clinton addressed 700 donors on a green lawn overlooking the water. Staffers instructed drivers to roll up the windows of the vans where reporters waited before being ushered into a nearby guesthouse. \n What a candidate tells his or her rich donors has long been a subject of intense speculation in American politics, in part because the message can be different than what they offer to voters. \n Obama is still haunted by a comment he made at a 2008 fundraiser in San Francisco, calling voters in small town Pennsylvania \"bitter\" and saying they cling to \"guns or religion.\" He learned a lesson: At events during his 2012 campaign, staffers set up a table where guests were expected to check their cellphones before entering. Clinton has tried to ban tweeting, Instagram and other forms of social media at some of her events. \n Four years ago, a waiter recorded and leaked remarks GOP nominee Mitt Romney made about the \"47 percent\" of voters who are \"dependent on government and would vote for Obama \"no matter what\" at a closed Florida fundraiser. After his convention, Romney started opening his fundraisers to the media to grab headlines, especially on days when he had no other public appearances. \n His former aides say that's not a problem for Clinton. \n \"Quite frankly, if I'm her, it may not be a bad thing to let Donald Trump be the only candidate making news on any given day,\" said former Romney campaign aide Ryan Williams. \"She can stay dark for five straight days and let Trump trip all over himself.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "As Clinton asks for money, what she says remains a mystery"}
