{"date": "August 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A Turkish army tank and an armored vehicle are stationed near the border with Syria, in Karkamis, Turkey. \n ANKARA, Turkey >> Turkey's military launched an operation before dawn Wednesday to clear a Syrian border town from Islamic State militants, and a private Turkish TV station reported that a small number of Turkish special forces had crossed into Syria as part of the operation. \n Turkish government officials could not immediately confirm the report of the cross-border incursion. \n The office of Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the operation, carried out by Turkish and U.S.-backed coalition forces, began at 4 a.m. (0100 GMT), with Turkish artillery launching intense cross-border fire on the town of Jarablus, followed by Turkish warplanes bombing IS targets in the town, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. \n The operation was launched hours before Vice President Joe Biden was due in Ankara for talks that include developments in Syria. \n Turkish Interior Minister Efkan Ala said the operation meant to safeguard Turkey's own security. Ankara \"cannot sit and watch\" he said, adding that \"it is Turkey's legal right, it is within its authority\" to take action. \n The minister also said Wednesday's operation aimed to support the moderate Syrian opposition and was being carried out in coordination with the U.S.-led coalition forces. \n Haber Turk television and Hurriyet newspaper, citing unnamed military sources, said a ground offensive has not started. Hurriyet said efforts were underway to open a \"passage\" into the region. It quoted the sources as saying Turkish Howitzers and rocket launchers had fired 224 rounds at 63 targets within an hour and 45 minutes, and that the Turkish air raids started just after 6 a.m. \n But the private NTV television said Turkish special forces entered Syria in what it described was an \"intruder mission\" to carry out \"pinpoint operations\" against IS as part of the mission to clear the town of Jarablus of the extremists. \n The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said Turkish ground troops had entered Syria. The activist group, which tracks the war through a network of local residents and fighters, said Turkish tanks and anti-mine vehicles crossed into Syria and were heading to Jarablus on Wednesday morning. \n The Turkish government said the border a rea had been declared a \"special security zone,\" and asked journalists not to try access it, citing safety concerns and threats posed by the IS. \n The assault followed Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlet Cavusoglu's pledge on Tuesday of \"every kind\" of support for operations against IS along a 100-kilometer (62-mile) stretch of Syrian frontier. \n The development puts the NATO member on track for a confrontation with U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in Syria, who have been the most effective force against IS and who are eyeing the same territory. \n Cavusoglu said Turkey would support twin operations stretching from the Syrian town of Afrin in the northwest, which is already controlled by Kurdish forces, to Jarablus, in the central north, which is held by the Islamic State group. \n The Syrian town of Jarablus, which lies on the western bank of the Euphrates River where it crosses from Turkey into Syria, is one of the last important IS-held towns standing between Kurdish-controlled areas in northern Syria. \n Located 20 miles (33 kilometers) from the town of Manbij, which was liberated from IS by Kurdish-led forces earlier this month, taking control of Jarablus and the IS-held town of al-Bab to the south would be a significant step toward linking up border areas under Kurdish control east and west of the Euphrates River. \n In recent days Turkey has increased security measures on its border with Syria, deploying tanks and armored personnel carriers. On Tuesday, residents of the Turkish town of Karkamis, across the border from Jarablus, were told to evacuate after three mortars believed to be fired by IS militants landed there, Turkey's Dogan news agency said. \n Turkey has vowed to fight IS militants at home and to \"cleanse\" the group from its borders after a weekend suicide bombing at a Kurdish wedding in southern Turkey killed at least 54 people, many of them children. Turkish officials have blamed IS for the attack. \n Ankara is also concerned about the growing power of U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces, who it says are linked to Kurdish groups waging an insurgency in southeastern Turkey. \n The Kurdish-led group known as the Syria Democratic Forces, or SDF, recaptured Manbij from IS earlier this month, triggering concerns in Ankara that Kurdish forces would seize the entire border strip with Turkey. The U.S. says it has embedded some 300 special forces with the SDF, and British special forces have also been spotted advising the group. \n The Kurds' outsized role in the Syrian civil war is a source of concern for the Syrian government as well. Fierce clashes erupted between the two sides over control of the northeastern province of Hasakeh last week, and Syrian warplanes bombed Kurdish positions for the first time, prompting the U.S. to scramble its jets to protect American troops in the area. \n The Syrian government and the Kurds agreed on a cease-fire Tuesday, six days after the clashes erupted. The Kurdish Hawar News Agency said government forces agreed to withdraw from Hasakeh as part of the truce. \n Syrian state media did not mention any withdrawal, saying only that the two sides had agreed to evacuate the wounded and exchange detainees. Government and Kurdish forces have shared control of Hasakeh since the early years of the Syrian war. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Issa reported from Beirut. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n This story has been corrected to fix the misspelling of Turkish foreign minister's last name, to Cavusoglu. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Turkey in cross-border operation to free IS-held Syrian town"}

{"date": "August 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Workers walk past a part of the Qinshan No. 2 Nuclear Power Plant, China's first self-designed and self-built national commercial nuclear power plant in Qinshan, about about 90 miles southwest of Shanghai, China. \n BEIJING >> On a seaside field south of Shanghai, workers are constructing a nuclear reactor that is the flagship for Beijing's ambition to compete with the United States, France and Russia as an exporter of atomic power technology. \n The Hualong One, developed by two state-owned companies, is one multibillion-dollar facet of the Communist Party's aspirations to transform China into a creator of profitable technology from mobile phones to genetics. \n In the case of nuclear reactors, industry experts say China is underestimating how tough it will be for its novice exporters to compete with the foreign companies that helped create its industry, given the political hurdles, safety concerns and uncertain global demand following Japan's Fukushima disaster. \n China's government-run nuclear industry is based on foreign technology but has spent two decades developing its own with help from Westinghouse Electric Co., France's Areva and EDF and other partners. A separate export initiative is based on an alliance between Westinghouse and a state-owned reactor developer. \n The industry is growing fast, with 32 reactors in operation, 22 being built and more planned, according to the World Nuclear Association, an industry group. China accounted for eight of 10 reactors that started operation last year and six of eight construction starts. \n Abroad, builders broke ground in Pakistan last year for a power plant using a Hualong One, supported by a $6.5 billion Chinese loan. Also last year, Argentina signed a contract to use the reactor in a $15 billion plant financed by Chinese banks. \n State-owned companies are lining up to invest in nuclear power plants in Britain and Romania. Such deals usually involve financing packages from state banks, a model that has helped Chinese companies break into the market for building highways and other public works in Africa and the Middle East. \n \"This is generating significant build-up of skills and industrial experience,\" Mycle Schneider, a nuclear energy consultant in Paris, said in an email. \n Still, Schneider said Beijing is \"seriously underestimating\" how hard global sales will be. Obstacles include strict quality controls, regulations that differ from country to country and competition from the falling cost of wind and solar, he said. \n \"There is simply no market out there,\" Schneider said in an email. \n At home, Chinese fret over an avalanche of industrial accidents and product safety scandals. \n This month, thousands in Lianyungang, north of Shanghai, protested after rumors spread that a facility to process nuclear waste might be built there. Authorities said the city, home to one of China's biggest nuclear power plants, was only one of several being considered. After more protests, they announced the search for a site was suspended. \n Overseas, China's nuclear companies face questions over their status as arms of the state. \n British Prime Minister Theresa May ordered a security review of plans to allow China General Nuclear Power Corp., to become a minority investor in the planned Hinkley Point C power station being built by EDF. \n In response, China's ambassador to London wrote in The Financial Times newspaper that a delay might harm official ties. \n The Hualong One under construction in Fuqing, near the southeastern city of Fuzhou, is a hybrid created by CGN and its main rival, China National Nuclear Corp. after they were ordered in 2011 to merge two competing reactors into a single export product. \n Based on French systems of the 1970s and '80s, it belongs to the industry's third generation of reactors, with more advanced safety features and working life of 60 years instead of the previous generation's 40. \n CNNC is installing two Hualong One reactors at the Fuqing Nuclear Power Plant, due to go online in 2019 and 2020. The power station also has two Areva units and is building two more. \n CGN is building its own version in Fangchenggang on the southern coast near Vietnam and says it wants to seek regulatory approval of the Hualong One design for possible use in a power plant in Bradwell on Britain's east coast. \n China's nuclear industry has yet to report a major accident but reflexive official secrecy makes it hard for outsiders to assess its safety. \n Alterations to foreign-based technology, such as making reactors bigger while using cooling techniques for smaller units, \"raise questions about safety and the good judgment of Chinese reactor engineers,\" Edward Lyman, a nuclear power specialist for the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, said in an email. \n \"It is crucial for countries importing Chinese nuclear technology to rigorously conduct their own oversight over the products they are buying.\" Lyman said. \n After China's first commercial nuclear plant went online in 1991 in Qinshan, south of Shanghai in Zhejiang province, Beijing tested competing technologies, buying reactors from U.S., Russian, French and other suppliers. \n Chinese companies couldn't export models they developed on their own, because foreign companies owned the underlying technology. \n So last year, Beijing declared nuclear power one of 16 \"national science and technology projects,\" with generous financial support to develop homegrown know-how. \n The ruling party's latest five-year development plan calls for China to have 58 gigawatts of nuclear generating capacity by 2020 and another 30 gigawatts under construction. By 2030, it wants 120 to 150 gigawatts of nuclear capacity supplying 8 to 10 percent of China's power. \n China's status as an important market for global suppliers is giving Beijing leverage in acquiring technology. Westinghouse, which was acquired by Japan's Toshiba Corp. in 2006, Areva and France's EDF have had partnerships with Chinese researchers since the early 1990s. \n \"I see them as customers, competitors and partners,\" said Jeff Benjamin, Westinghouse's senior vice president for new plants and major projects. \n Other global suppliers include GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, South Korea's KEPCO, Canada's Candu Energy Inc. and Russia's Atomstroyexport. \n Westinghouse transferred technology for its latest reactor, the AP1000, to China's State Nuclear Power Technology Corp. in 2007 as part of a transaction that included the sale of four reactors. \n The AP1000 became the basis for future Chinese reactor development, and Westinghouse agreed to jointly sell those reactors with SNPTC. The Chinese partner, which merged with another state company to form the State Power Investment Corp. last year, also developed its own, bigger version, the CAP1400. \n The two companies are in talks with Turkey about selling four reactors based on the AP1000. \n The AP1000 has been approved by U.S. and British regulators, Benjamin said, while the CAP1400 is just beginning the review process. \n \"We look forward to participating in the China market for many years to come,\" he said, adding, \"there will be markets either SPIC on their own or Westinghouse on our own might not have access to, but together we can gain access.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "China sets sights on new global export: nuclear energy"}

{"date": "August 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Rescuers search a crumbled building in Arcuata del Tronto, central Italy, where a 6.1 earthquake struck just after 3:30 a.m. \n AMATRICE, Italy >> A devastating earthquake rocked central Italy early Wednesday, collapsing homes on top of residents as they slept. At least 37 people were killed in hard-hit towns where rescue crews raced to dig survivors out of the rubble, but the toll was likely to rise as crews reached homes in more remote hamlets. \n \"The town isn't here anymore,\" said Sergio Pirozzi, the mayor of Amatrice. \n The magnitude 6 quake struck at 3:36 a.m. (0136 GMT) and was felt across a broad swath of central Italy, including Rome, where residents felt a long swaying followed by aftershocks. The temblor shook the Lazio region and Umbria and Le Marche on the Adriatic coast. \n Premier Matteo Renzi planned to head to the zone later Wednesday and promised: \"No family, no city, no hamlet will be left behind.\" \n The hardest-hit towns were Amatrice and Accumoli near Rieti, some 100 kilometers (80 miles) northeast of Rome, and Pescara del Tronto further east. Italy's civil protection agency said the preliminary toll was 38 dead, several hundred injured and thousands in need of temporary housing, though it stressed the numbers were fluid. \n The center of Amatrice was devastated, with entire buildings razed and the air thick with dust and smelling strongly of gas. \n Rocks and metal tumbled onto the streets and dazed residents huddled in piazzas as some 39 aftershocks jolted the region into the early morning hours, some as strong as 5.1. \n \"The whole ceiling fell but did not hit me,\" marveled resident Maria Gianni. \"I just managed to put a pillow on my head and I wasn't hit luckily, just slightly injured my leg.\" \n Another woman, sitting in front of her destroyed home with a blanket over her shoulders, said she didn't know what had become of her loved ones. \n \"It was one of the most beautiful towns of Italy and now there's nothing left,\" she said, too distraught to give her name. \"I don't know what we'll do.\" \n As daylight dawned, residents, civil protection workers and even priests began digging out with shovels, bulldozers and their bare hands, trying to reach survivors. There was relief as a woman was pulled out alive from one building, followed by a dog. \n \"We need chain saws, shears to cut iron bars, and jacks to remove beams: everything, we need everything,\" civil protection worker Andrea Gentili told The Associated Press. Italy's national blood drive association appealed for donations to Rieti's hospital. \n The devastation harked back to the 2009 quake that killed more than 300 people in and around L'Aquila, about 90 kilometers (55 miles) south of the latest quake. The town sent emergency teams Wednesday to help with the rescue. \n \"I don't know what to say. We are living this immense tragedy,\" said the Rev. Savino D'Amelio, a parish priest in Amatrice. \"We are only hoping there will be the least number of victims possible and that we all have the courage to move on.\" \n Another hard-hit town was Pescara del Tronto, in the Le Marche region, where the main road was covered in debris. The ANSA news agency reported 10 dead there without citing the source, but there was no confirmation. \n Residents were digging their neighbors out by hand since emergency crews hadn't yet arrived in force. Photos taken from the air by regional firefighters showed the town essentially flattened; Italy requested EU satellite images of the whole area to get the scope of the damage. \n \"There are broken liquor bottles all over the place,\" lamented Gino Petrucci, owner of a bar in nearby Arquata Del Tronto where he was beginning the long cleanup. \n The Italian geological service put the magnitude at 6.0; the U.S. Geological Survey reported 6.2 with the epicenter at Norcia, about 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of Rome, and with a relatively shallow depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). \n \"Quakes with this magnitude at this depth in our territory in general create building collapses, which can result in deaths,\" said the head of Italy's civil protection service, Fabrizio Curcio. He added that the region is popular with tourists escaping the heat of Rome, with more residents than at other times of the year, and that a single building collapse could raise the toll significantly. \n The mayor of Accumoli, Stefano Petrucci, said six people had died there, including a family of four, and two others. He wept as he noted that the tiny hamlet of 700 swells to 2,000 in the summer months, and that he feared for the future of the town. \n \"I hope they don't forget us,\" he told Sky TG24. \n In Amatrice, the Rev. Fabio Gammarota, priest of a nearby parish, said he had blessed seven bodies extracted so far. \"One was a friend of mine,\" he said. \n Pirozzi estimated dozens of residents were buried under collapsed buildings and that heavy equipment was needed to clear streets clogged with debris. \n A 1997 quake killed a dozen people in central Italy and severely damaged one of the jewels of Umbria, the Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi, filled with Giotto frescoes. The Franciscan friars who are the custodians of the basilica reported no immediate damage from Wednesday's temblor. \n Pope Francis skipped his traditional catechism for his Wednesday general audience and instead invited pilgrims in St. Peter's Square to recite the rosary with him. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Death toll rises as strong earthquake strikes central Italy"}

{"date": "August 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Austin, Texas, today. \n AUSTIN, Texas >> Donald Trump suggested today that he is open to \"softening\" laws dealing with immigrants in the country illegally, the latest sign that the Republican presidential nominee is considering easing the hardline stance he has taken since the beginning of his campaign. \n Taping a town hall in Austin, Texas, for Fox News, Trump was asked by moderator Sean Hannity if he would change current statutes to accommodate law-abiding citizens or longtime residents who have raised children in the United States. \n \"There certainly can be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people,\" Trump answered. \"We want people \u2014 we have some great people in this country.\" \n \"We are going to follow the laws of this country,\" he added \n Trump has repeatedly declared that if elected, he would deport the 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally. But he has hedged his stance in recent days, and during the taping he ruminated aloud about the fairness of breaking up families. He even polled the audience about what they would do about the crucial policy. \n \"So you have somebody who's been in the country for 20 years, has done a great job, and everything else,\" Trump said. \"Do we take him and the family and her and him or whatever and send him out?\" \n The crowd's reaction was split: Some cheered when Trump suggested that the immigrants be allowed to stay, others roared when he suggested deporting them. \n The Republican nominee then said he \"would come out with a decision very soon\" about deportations. \n Trump had been scheduled to outline his immigration policies Thursday in Colorado. But that speech has been postponed, likely until next week \n Trump's public deliberation could be the latest signal that as the general campaign heats up, he is moving away from one of his divisive, signature proposals from the Republican primary in order to broaden his base of support. On Monday, he first suggested he was open to allowing some immigrants to stay, suggesting that he wanted a \"fair, but firm\" policy. \n That is a far cry from the early days of the primaries, when Trump vowed to use a \"deportation force\" to round up and deport the millions of people living in the country illegally. That proposal excited many of his core supporters, but alienated Hispanic voters who could be pivotal in key states. \n The celebrity businessman, however, has stuck to his vow to build a wall to fortify the nation's southern border with Mexico and to deport immigrants here illegally who have committed criminal and violent acts. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump says immigration laws can be softened"}

{"date": "August 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Singer and actress Cher stops to talk to media as she leaves a fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at the Pilgrim Monument and Provincetown Museum in Provincetown, Mass. \n DES MOINES, Iowa >> Entertainer Cher unloaded a freewheeling barrage of insults at Donald Trump during a private fundraiser for Hillary Clinton, comparing him to Hitler and saying he reminded her of the actress who played a murdering child in the film, \"The Bad Seed.\" \n Speaking Sunday in Provincetown, Massachusetts, the singer and actress gave a stinging \u2014 and at times profane \u2014 assessment of the Republican presidential nominee. Invoking \"The Bad Seed\" she said: \"He's so Patty McCormack, consummate liar, doesn't care who she hurts, insane.\" \n Before an enthusiastic crowd, Cher also said of Trump: \"Do you remember 'Fun with Dick and Jane'? It's like racist fun with Dick and Jane.\" \n She later added: \"He doesn't mean we want to make America great again. He means we want to make America straight and white.\" She also said that she was reminded of \"despots, you know Stalin and Hitler.\" \n A video of Cher's remarks at the \"LGBT summer celebration\" was posted on Facebook and first reported by The New York Times. \n Cher, who has been campaigning with Clinton, offered praise, though with a few caveats. \n \"She is shy and she's not the greatest speaker in the world,\" Cher said. \"But this is what I believe and this is what I know. I know she will work every moment of every day.\" \n After the event, Cher told reporters that Trump was \"a racist, he's a misogynist, he's a horrible person.\" \n A partial clip of Clinton's remarks was also posted on Facebook. Thanking Cher, Clinton said: \"I can't tell you how excited I am to have Cher here.\" \n A popular entertainer for decades, Cher came to fame in the 1960s as part of a singing duo with then-husband Sonny Bono.

{"date": "August 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Aug. 16, 2016 file photo, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks in Philadelphia. \n WASHINGTON >> More than half the people outside the government who met with Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state gave money \u2014 either personally or through companies or groups \u2014 to the Clinton Foundation. It's an extraordinary proportion indicating her possible ethics challenges if elected president. \n At least 85 of 154 people from private interests who met or had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton while she led the State Department donated to her family charity or pledged commitments to its international programs, according to a review of State Department calendars released so far to The Associated Press. Combined, the 85 donors contributed as much as $156 million. At least 40 donated more than $100,000 each, and 20 gave more than $1 million. \n Donors who were granted time with Clinton included an internationally known economist who asked for her help as the Bangladesh government pressured him to resign from a nonprofit bank he ran; a Wall Street executive who sought Clinton's help with a visa problem; and Estee Lauder executives who were listed as meeting with Clinton while her department worked with the firm's corporate charity to counter gender-based violence in South Africa. \n The meetings between the Democratic presidential nominee and foundation donors do not appear to violate legal agreements Clinton and former president Bill Clinton signed before she joined the State Department in 2009. But the frequency of the overlaps shows the intermingling of access and donations, and fuels perceptions that giving the foundation money was a price of admission for face time with Clinton. Her calendars and emails released as recently as this week describe scores of contacts she and her top aides had with foundation donors. \n The AP's findings represent the first systematic effort to calculate the scope of the intersecting interests of Clinton foundation donors and people who met personally with Clinton or spoke to her by phone about their needs. \n The 154 did not include U.S. federal employees or foreign government representatives. Clinton met with representatives of at least 16 foreign governments that donated as much as $170 million to the Clinton charity, but they were not included in AP's calculations because such meetings would presumably have been part of her diplomatic duties. \n Clinton's campaign said the AP analysis was flawed because it did not include in its calculations meetings with foreign diplomats or U.S. government officials, and the meetings AP examined covered only the first half of Clinton's tenure as secretary of state. \n \"It is outrageous to misrepresent Secretary Clinton's basis for meeting with these individuals,\" spokesman Brian Fallon said. He called it \"a distorted portrayal of how often she crossed paths with individuals connected to charitable donations to the Clinton Foundation.\" \n Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump fiercely criticized the links between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department, saying his general election opponent had delivered \"lie after lie after lie.\" \n \"Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to hold public office,\" he said at a rally Tuesday night in Austin, Texas. \"It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office.\" \n Last week, the Clinton Foundation moved to head off ethics concerns about future donations by announcing changes planned if Clinton is elected. \n On Monday, Bill Clinton said in a statement that if his wife were to win, he would step down from the foundation's board and stop all fundraising for it. The foundation would also accept donations only from U.S. citizens and what it described as independent philanthropies, while no longer taking gifts from foreign groups, U.S. companies or corporate charities. Clinton said the foundation would no longer hold annual meetings of its international aid program, the Clinton Global Initiative, and it would spin off its foreign-based programs to other charities. \n Those planned changes would not affect more than 6,000 donors who have already provided the Clinton charity with more than $2 billion in funding since its creation in 2000. \n \"There's a lot of potential conflicts and a lot of potential problems,\" said Douglas White, an expert on nonprofits who previously directed Columbia University's graduate fundraising management program. \"The point is, she can't just walk away from these 6,000 donors.\" \n Former senior White House ethics officials said a Clinton administration would have to take careful steps to ensure that past foundation donors would not have the same access as she allowed at the State Department. \n \"If Secretary Clinton puts the right people in and she's tough about it and has the right procedures in place and sends a message consistent with a strong commitment to ethics, it can be done,\" said Norman L. Eisen, who was President Barack Obama's top ethics counsel and later worked for Clinton as ambassador to the Czech Republic. \n Eisen, now a governance studies fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that at a minimum, Clinton should retain the Obama administration's current ethics commitments and oversight, which include lobbying restrictions and other rules. Richard Painter, a former ethics adviser to President George W. Bush and currently a University of Minnesota law school professor, said Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton should remove themselves completely from foundation leadership roles, but he added that potential conflicts would shadow any policy decision affecting past donors. \n Fallon did not respond to the AP's questions about Clinton transition plans regarding ethics, but said in a statement the standard set by the Clinton Foundation's ethics restrictions was \"unprecedented, even if it may never satisfy some critics.\" \n State Department officials have said they are not aware of any agency actions influenced by the Clinton Foundation. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday night that there are no prohibitions against agency contacts with \"political campaigns, nonprofits or foundations \u2014 including the Clinton Foundation.\" He added that \"meeting requests, recommendations and proposals come to the department through a variety of channels, both formal and informal.\" \n GOP vice presidential candidate Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said the AP analysis was evidence of \"pay-to-play\" politics at Clinton's State Department. He called for the foundation to be shut down and for an independent prosecutor to be appointed to investigate. \n Some of Clinton's most influential visitors donated millions to the Clinton Foundation and to her and her husband's political coffers. They are among scores of Clinton visitors and phone contacts in her official calendar turned over by the State Department to AP last year and in more-detailed planning schedules that so far have covered about half her four-year tenure. The AP sought Clinton's calendar and schedules three years ago, but delays led the AP to sue the State Department last year in federal court for those materials and other records. \n S. Daniel Abraham, whose name also was included in emails released by the State Department as part of another lawsuit, is a Clinton fundraising bundler who was listed in Clinton's planners for eight meetings with her at various times. A billionaire behind the Slim-Fast diet and founder of the Center for Middle East Peace, Abraham told the AP last year his talks with Clinton concerned Mideast issues. \n Big Clinton Foundation donors with no history of political giving to the Clintons also met or talked by phone with Hillary Clinton and top aides, AP's review showed. \n Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for pioneering low-interest \"microcredit\" for poor business owners, met with Clinton three times and talked with her by phone during a period when Bangladeshi government authorities investigated his oversight of a nonprofit bank and ultimately pressured him to resign from the bank's board. Throughout the process, he pleaded for help in messages routed to Clinton, and she ordered aides to find ways to assist him. \n American affiliates of his nonprofit Grameen Bank had been working with the Clinton Foundation's Clinton Global Initiative programs as early as 2005, pledging millions of dollars in microloans for the poor. Grameen America, the bank's nonprofit U.S. flagship, which Yunus chairs, has given between $100,000 and $250,000 to the foundation \u2014 a figure that bank spokeswoman Becky Asch said reflects the institution's annual fees to attend CGI meetings. Another Grameen arm chaired by Yunus, Grameen Research, has donated between $25,000 and $50,000. \n As a U.S. senator from New York, Clinton, as well as then-Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and two other senators in 2007 sponsored a bill to award a congressional gold medal to Yunus. He got one but not until 2010, a year after Obama awarded him a Presidential Medal of Freedom. \n Yunus first met with Clinton in Washington in April 2009. That was followed six months later by an announcement by USAID, the State Department's foreign aid arm, that it was partnering with the Grameen Foundation, a nonprofit charity run by Yunus, in a $162 million commitment to extend its microfinance concept abroad. USAID also began providing loans and grants to the Grameen Foundation, totaling $2.2 million over Clinton's tenure. \n By September 2009, Yunus began complaining to Clinton's top aides about what he perceived as poor treatment by Bangladesh's government. His bank was accused of financial mismanagement of Norwegian government aid money \u2014 a charge that Norway later dismissed as baseless. But Yunus told Melanne Verveer, a long-time Clinton aide who was an ambassador-at-large for global women's issues, that Bangladesh officials refused to meet with him and asked the State Department for help in pressing his case. \n \"Please see if the issues of Grameen Bank can be raised in a friendly way,\" he asked Verveer. Yunus sent \"regards to H\" and cited an upcoming Clinton Global Initiative event he planned to attend. \n Clinton ordered an aide: \"Give to EAP rep,\" referring the problem to the agency's top east Asia expert. \n Yunus continued writing to Verveer as pressure mounted on his bank. In December 2010, responding to a news report that Bangladesh's prime minister was urging an investigation of Grameen Bank, Clinton told Verveer that she wanted to discuss the matter with her East Asia expert \"ASAP.\" \n Clinton called Yunus in March 2011 after the Bangladesh government opened an inquiry into his oversight of Grameen Bank. Yunus had told Verveer by email that \"the situation does not allow me to leave the country.\" By mid-May, the Bangladesh government had forced Yunus to step down from the bank's board. Yunus sent Clinton a copy of his resignation letter. In a separate note to Verveer, Clinton wrote: \"Sad indeed.\" \n Clinton met with Yunus a second time in Washington in August 2011 and again in the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka in May 2012. Clinton's arrival in Bangladesh came after Bangladesh authorities moved to seize control of Grameen Bank's effort to find new leaders. Speaking to a town hall audience, Clinton warned the Bangladesh government that \"we do not want to see any action taken that would in any way undermine or interfere in the operations of the Grameen Bank.\" \n Grameen America's Asch referred other questions about Yunus to his office, but he had not responded by Tuesday. \n In another case, Clinton was host at a September 2009 breakfast meeting at the New York Stock Exchange that listed Blackstone Group chairman Stephen Schwarzman as one of the attendees. Schwarzman's firm is a major Clinton Foundation donor, but he personally donates heavily to GOP candidates and causes. One day after the breakfast, according to Clinton emails, the State Department was working on a visa issue at Schwarzman's request. In December that same year, Schwarzman's wife, Christine, sat at Clinton's table during the Kennedy Center Honors. Clinton also introduced Schwarzman, then chairman of the Kennedy Center, before he spoke. \n Blackstone donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Eight Blackstone executives also gave between $375,000 and $800,000 to the foundation. And Blackstone's charitable arm has pledged millions of dollars in commitments to three Clinton Global aid projects ranging from the U.S. to the Mideast. Blackstone officials did not make Schwarzman available for comment. \n Clinton also met in June 2011 with Nancy Mahon of the MAC AIDS, the charitable arm of MAC Cosmetics, which is owned by Estee Lauder. The meeting occurred before an announcement about a State Department partnership to raise money to finance AIDS education and prevention. The public-private partnership was formed to fight gender-based violence in South Africa, the State Department said at the time. \n The MAC AIDS fund donated between $5 million and $10 million to the Clinton Foundation. In 2008, Mahon and the MAC AIDS fund made a three-year unspecified commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative. That same year, the fund partnered with two other organizations to beef up a USAID program in Malawi and Ghana. And in 2011, the fund was one of eight organizations to pledge a total of $2 million over a three-year period to help girls in southern Africa. The fund has not made a commitment to CGI since 2011. \n Estee Lauder executive Fabrizio Freda also met with Clinton at the same Wall Street event attended by Schwarzman. Later that month, Freda was on a list of attendees for a meeting between Clinton and a U.S.-China trade group. Estee Lauder has given between $100,000 and $250,000 to the Clinton Foundation. The company made a commitment to CGI in 2013 with four other organizations to help survivors of sexual slavery in Cambodia. \n MAC AIDS officials did not make Mahon available to AP for comment. \n When Clinton appeared before the U.S. Senate in early 2009 for her confirmation hearing as secretary of state, then- Sen. Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, questioned her at length about the foundation and potential conflicts of interest. His concerns were focused on foreign government donations, mostly to CGI. Lugar wanted more transparency than was ultimately agreed upon between the foundation and Obama's transition team. \n Now, Lugar hopes Hillary and Bill Clinton make a clean break from the foundation. \n \"The Clintons, as they approach the presidency, if they are successful, will have to work with their attorneys to make certain that rules of the road are drawn up to give confidence to them and the American public that there will not be favoritism,\" Lugar said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Many foundation donors met with Clinton at State Department"}

{"date": "August 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky has recused himself from making his first key decision in another sex case. The Mercury News reported Monday, Aug. 22, 2016 that Persky filed a statement saying that some people might doubt that he could be impartial. The judge is the target of a recall campaign after he sentenced a former Stanford swimmer to six months in jail for sexually assaulting an intoxicated woman. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> The Northern California judge who sentenced a former Stanford University swimmer to six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman reignited debate Tuesday about his ability to serve on the bench after removing himself from a separate sex-crimes case. \n Santa Clara County Judge Aaron Persky formally recused himself Monday from deciding whether to reduce a San Jose plumber's felony child pornography charges to misdemeanors. A law professor called the move unusual and said it makes it look like Persky is susceptible to \"political pressure.\" \n It's the second sex-crimes case that Persky has departed since his June sentencing of 20-year-old Brock Turner exploded in national media. It comes amid an effort to recall Persky and a formal misconduct complaint that a women's advocacy group filed with the state agency that disciplines judges. \n Another judge will rule on Robert Chain's child porn case in October. \n \"While on vacation earlier this month, my family and I were exposed to publicity surrounding this case,\" the judge wrote in a brief ruling. \"This publicity has resulted in a personal family situation such that 'a person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that the judge would be able to be impartial.'\" \n Persky didn't respond to requests for comment. Two attorneys who argue cases in his courtroom have backed up his abilities. Santa Clara County deputy public defender Gary Goodman in June called him a \"solid and respected judge,\" while defense attorney Barbara Muller said he's \"one of the fairest judges\" in the county. \n In Chain's case, Persky said last year that he was \"receptive\" to reducing the conviction if Chain stayed sober and out of trouble for a year. \n Persky, who has handled the case since early 2015, sentenced Chain to four days in jail and ordered him to register for life as a sex offender after he pleaded guilty to possessing dozens of sexually explicit images of children. The judge said he would consider reducing the conviction if Chain complied with the terms of his probation. \n Chain's lawyer, Brian Madden, has said his client \"worked hard\" to turn around his life since his 2014 arrest, including receiving alcohol abuse counseling. Madden didn't return a phone call Tuesday. \n University of California, Berkeley, law professor Christopher Kutz said \"no formal or actual conflict\" appears to exist between Persky and the child porn case, but the \"appearance that he seems susceptible to political pressure\" does. \n \"It's a very unusual case,\" Kutz said. \n It comes two months after the district attorney's office removed Persky from a different sexual assault case, saying \"we lack confidence\" in the judge's ability to decide it impartially. \n Organizers of an effort to get Persky removed from the bench say they will begin collecting signatures in April to qualify the issue for the November 2017 ballot. \n \"Case after case, Judge Persky has demonstrated that his own personal bias compels him to prioritize the well-being of privileged men \u2014 rapists, abusers and possessors of child porn \u2014 over the survivors of their crimes,\" said Nita Chaudhary, co-founder of women's advocacy group UltraViolet, which has asked the Commission on Judicial Performance to remove Persky. \n The six-month sentence he handed down to Turner, a Dayton, Ohio, resident who had been attending Stanford on a swimming scholarship, drew outrage. Persky cited a probation department recommendation and the effect the conviction will have on Turner's life. \n A jury convicted the former Olympic hopeful of sexually assaulting a young woman he met at a campus fraternity party in January 2015 after she passed out behind a trash bin. The two had been drinking heavily. \n The case sparked a national debate on college drinking and sexual assault. \n Stanford unveiled a revised student alcohol policy on Monday, banning hard alcohol from undergraduate parties and shots from graduate gatherings in an effort to combat binge drinking. \n Beer and wine are still allowed, a policy that the Distilled Spirits Council says \"sends a dangerous message to college students\" that beer and wine are \"softer\" than hard liquor. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Stanford judge reignites debate after leaving other sex case"}

{"date": "August 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Martin Blackwell looks on during his trial in Atlanta, Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2016. Blackwell is accused of pouring boiling water on his girlfriend's gay son and his friend as they slept. \n ATLANTA >> In a vicious, premeditated attack, a Georgia man threw boiled water on a same-sex couple who were asleep in bed, and told one of the men \"get out of my house with all that gay,\" a prosecutor said Tuesday. \n Martin Blackwell is on trial facing charges including aggravated battery and assault in the Feb. 12 attack that caused severe burns and multiple surgeries for Anthony Gooden and Marquez Tolbert, who were asleep together after working an overnight shift. \n \"I woke up to the most unimaginable pain in my entire life,\" Tolbert said, sobbing frequently during his testimony. \"I'm wondering why I'm in so much pain. I'm wondering why I'm wet. I don't understand what's going on.\" \n If convicted, Blackwell faces up to 80 years in prison, according to prosecutors. \n Blackwell last week had agreed to plead guilty as part of a deal with prosecutors but decided against it after the judge said he would order him to serve 30 years of a 40-year sentence, multiple news outlets reported. \n As Tolbert and Gooden testified, Blackwell showed no emotion. \n After they were doused with hot water, Gooden and Tolbert leapt from bed. Gooden ran from the apartment and Tolbert jumped around the room screaming and crying, Fulton County Assistant District Attorney Franklin Engram told the jury. \n Blackwell, 48, began dating Gooden's mother, Kim Foster, about two and a half years ago. Foster had moved into her sister's apartment in College Park with her children. Blackwell, a long-distance truck driver, would often stay there when he was in town, the prosecutor said. \n Gooden had told his family he was gay a short time before the attack and, with the exception of Blackwell, they embraced and supported him, Engram said. \n Gooden and Tolbert met when Tolbert ordered food at Taco Bell while Gooden was working at the drive-thru. They'd been dating for about a month at the time of the attack. \n They had found jobs together working an overnight shift and after their second shift, they went to sleep as others in the apartment were getting ready to start their day. \n When Foster's teenage daughters came home in the afternoon, Blackwell gave them money to go get something to eat to get them out of the apartment, the prosecutor said. Then he went to the kitchen, pulled out the biggest pot he could find, filled it with water, put it on the stove and waited for it to boil. \n He then threw the hot water on the sleeping couple, Engram said. \n Gooden's first instinct was to flee the apartment because he said he didn't know whether Blackwell had more water on the stove. Outside, without their wallets or cellphones, they frantically sought help. A frightened neighbor shut the door in their faces. Eventually, a friend called 911. \n College Park police Officer Wayne Hood testified that he went to the apartment and Blackwell told him the two young men were having sex, making noise and were \"stuck together like two hotdogs.\" Blackwell said he \"poured a little hot water on them\" but that they'd be fine, Hood testified. \n Gooden said the couple hadn't ever had sex. \n Both men suffered severe burns that required skin graft surgeries. Tolbert spent 10 days in the hospital; Gooden was there for about a month, including two weeks in a medically induced coma. \n Georgia doesn't have a hate crime law, but the FBI has opened a hate crime investigation. An FBI spokesman didn't immediately respond to an email Tuesday asking about the progress of that investigation. \n Foster testified that Blackwell had an \"up and down\" relationship with her children. He had said derogatory things about her son's sexuality, but she was still shocked when she learned about the attack, she said. \n \"I didn't know where it came from,\" she said. \"I still don't know where it came from.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Prosecutor: Boiled water attack on gay men was premeditated"}

{"date": "August 23, 2016", "text": "An Oahu Circuit Court judge issued a temporary retraining order Monday barring state officials from implementing a new law that provides severance payments and retirement bonuses for state hospital workers when their jobs are privatized. \n The Hawaii Employees' Retirement System filed a lawsuit on Aug. 9 to block the new law, which would affect about 1,500 Maui County hospital workers. \n Those workers at Maui Memorial Medical Center, Kula Hospital and Lanai Community Hospital will lose their state jobs when Kaiser Permanente takes control of those facilities later this year in what will be the largest privatization of public facilities in state history. \n Kaiser will retain those workers at least through the end of 2017 and many are expected to remain on the job at those facilities after the transition is complete. However, they will no longer be state employees. \n To ease that transition, lawmakers approved Senate Bill 2077 this year to provide either a lump sum cash payment or early retirement to workers who lose their state jobs, regardless of whether they later go to work for Kaiser. \n Gov. David Ige vetoed the bill, warning that the measure could threaten the federal tax-exempt status of the ERS. Ige also cited concerns that lawmakers had not provided funding to pay for the severance payments for the hospital workers. \n The Legislature overrode the governor's veto last month, and the ERS promptly sued to try to block the new law. The ERS claimed the severance and retirement bonus package could be \"catastrophic\" to the ERS because it threatened the tax exempt status of the retirement fund. \n On Monday Circuit Judge Jeannette Castagnetti issued a temporary retraining order preventing the state from implementing the new law until the court can consider an ERS request for a preliminary injunction in the case. \n The ERS contends the new law could violate the Hawaii State Constitution by giving certain state employees an improper choice between either a cash severance payment or special early retirement benefits. The ERS contends the U.S. Internal Revenue Code does not allow the State to offer employees such a choice, and the new law could therefore prompt the Internal Revenue Service to disqualify the ERS as a tax-exempt entity. \n Castagnetti ruled that the public interest \"supported the issuance of a (temporary restraining order) as it is in the public interest to maintain the ERS's tax-qualified status and to avoid any impairment of benefits to the ERS's members,\" according to a statement from the ERS. \n The temporary stay delays implementation of the severance and retirement bonus package so that the ERS can seek guidance from the IRS on what the potential impact of the new law might be, according to the ERS. \n Thomas Williams, executive director for the ERS, said in a written statement that he is \"pleased that the court took action (Monday) and look forward to getting a response from the IRS as soon as possible. As we have maintained all along, our sole objective is to protect the State and county employees' retirement benefits.\" \n The ERS is the retirement fund for 120,000 current and former state and county employees, and the fund currently has an unfunded liability of about $8.8 billion. \n The severance payments for the hospital workers are not expected to affect the unfunded liability because the ERS does not expect it will have to fund those payments. However, the retirement bonuses would add to the ERS' unfunded liability unless lawmakers provide money to cover the cost of those bonuses, ERS officials say. \n Randy Perreira, executive director of the Hawaii Government Employees Association, was unavailable for comment on Castagnetti's ruling. The HGEA staged an all-out lobbying effort at the state Legislature this year to convince lawmakers to approve the severance and retirement bonus package for the hospital workers. \n The restraining order will not have any impact on the pending transfer of the three Maui County medical facilities, which has been strongly resisted by the public worker unions. The transfer is scheduled to be completed as early as Nov. 6. \n ", "author": "Kevin Dayton kdayton@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Judge grants TRO in ERS lawsuit over Maui hospitals"}

{"date": "August 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A selection of private medical files published by transparency website WikiLeaks was shown in Paris today. WikiLeaks' global crusade to expose government secrets is causing collateral damage to the privacy of hundreds of innocent people, including survivors of sexual abuse, sick children and the mentally ill, The Associated Press has found. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange stood on the balcony of the Ecuadorean Embassy in London on Feb. 5. WikiLeaks' global crusade to expose government secrets is causing collateral damage to the privacy of hundreds of innocent people, including survivors of sexual abuse, sick children and the mentally ill, The Associated Press has found. \n CAIRO \u00bb WikiLeaks' global crusade to expose government secrets is causing collateral damage to the privacy of hundreds of innocent people, including survivors of sexual abuse, sick children and the mentally ill, The Associated Press has found. \n In the past year alone, the radical transparency group has published medical files belonging to scores of ordinary citizens while many hundreds more have had sensitive family, financial or identity records posted to the web. In two particularly egregious cases, WikiLeaks named teenage rape victims. In a third case, the site published the name of a Saudi citizen arrested for being gay, an extraordinary move given that homosexuality is punishable by death in the ultraconservative Muslim kingdom. \n \"They published everything: my phone, address, name, details,\" said a Saudi man who told AP he was bewildered that WikiLeaks had revealed the details of a paternity dispute with a former partner. \"If the family of my wife saw this \u2026 Publishing personal stuff like that could destroy people.\" \n WikiLeaks' mass publication of personal data is at odds with the site's claim to have championed privacy even as it laid bare the workings of international statecraft, and has drawn criticism from the site's allies. \n Attempts to reach WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange were unsuccessful; a set of questions left with his site wasn't immediately answered today. In a tweet responding to AP's story, the organization said the privacy allegations were \"recycled\" and \"not even worth a headline.\" \n WikiLeaks' stated mission is to bring censored or restricted material \"involving war, spying and corruption\" into the public eye, describing the trove amassed thus far as a \"giant library of the world's most persecuted documents.\" \n The library is growing quickly, with half a million files from the U.S. Democratic National Committee, Turkey's governing party and the Saudi Foreign Ministry added in the last year or so. But the library is also filling with rogue data, including computer viruses, spam, and a compendium of personal records. \n The Saudi diplomatic cables alone hold at least 124 medical files, according to a sample analyzed by AP. Some described patients with psychiatric conditions, seriously ill children or refugees. \n \"This has nothing to do with politics or corruption,\" said Dr. Nayef al-Fayez, a consultant in the Jordanian capital of Amman who confirmed that a brain cancer patient of his was among those whose details were published to the web. Dr. Adnan Salhab, a retired practitioner in Jordan who also had a patient named in the files, expressed anger when shown the document. \n \"This is illegal what has happened,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"It is illegal!\" \n The AP, which is withholding identifying details of most of those affected, reached 23 people \u2014 most in Saudi Arabia \u2014 whose personal information was exposed. Some were unaware their data had been published; WikiLeaks is censored in the country. Others shrugged at the news. Several were horrified. \n One, a partially disabled Saudi woman who'd secretly gone into debt to support a sick relative, said she was devastated. She'd kept her plight from members of her own family. \n \"This is a disaster,\" she said in a phone call. \"What if my brothers, neighbors, people I know or even don't know have seen it? What is the use of publishing my story?\" \n Medical records are widely counted among a person's most private information. But the AP found that WikiLeaks also routinely publishes identity records, phone numbers and other information easily exploited by criminals. \n The DNC files published last month carried more than two dozen Social Security and credit card numbers, according to an AP analysis assisted by New Hampshire-based compliance firm DataGravity. Two of the people named in the files told AP they were targeted by identity thieves following the leak, including a retired U.S. diplomat who said he also had to change his number after being bombarded by threatening messages. \n The number of people affected easily reaches into the hundreds. Paul Dietrich, a transparency activist, said a partial scan of the Saudi cables alone turned up more than 500 passport, identity, academic or employment files. \n The AP independently found three dozen records pertaining to family issues in the cables \u2014 including messages about marriages, divorces, missing children, elopements and custody battles. Many are very personal, like the marital certificates which reveal whether the bride was a virgin. Others deal with Saudis who are deeply in debt, including one man who says his wife stole his money. One divorce document details a male partner's infertility. Others identify the partners of women suffering from sexually transmitted diseases including HIV and Hepatitis C. \n Lisa Lynch, who teaches media and communications at Drew University and has followed WikiLeaks for years, said Assange may not have had the staff or the resources to properly vet what he published. Or maybe he felt that the urgency of his mission trumped privacy concerns. \n \"For him the ends justify the means,\" she said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Initially conceived as a Wikipedia-style platform for leakers, WikiLeaks' initial plan was for a \"worldwide community of informed users\" to curate the material it released wholesale, according to the site's now defunct question-and-answer page. Prominent transparency advocate Steven Aftergood privately warned Assange a few days before the site's debut that the publish-everything approach was problematic. \n \"Publication of information is not always an act of freedom,\" Aftergood said in an email sent in late 2006. \"It can also be an act of aggression or oppression.\" \n Those concerns were heightened after WikiLeaks published a series of documents leaked by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning, now known as Chelsea, in 2010. The publication provided explosive evidence of human rights abuses in Iraq and Pakistani cooperation with the Taliban in Afghanistan \u2014 among many other revelations \u2014 but it also led to allegations that civilians in war zones had been endangered. \n Assange insisted WikiLeaks had a system to keep ordinary people's information safe. \n \"We have a harm minimization policy,\" the Australian told an audience in Oxford, England in July of 2010. \"There are legitimate secrets. Your records with your doctor, that's a legitimate secret.\" \n Assange initially leaned on cooperating journalists, who flagged sensitive material to WikiLeaks which then held them back for closer scrutiny. But Assange was impatient with the process, describing it as time-consuming and expensive. \n \"We can't sit on material like this for three years with one person to go through the whole lot, line-by-line, to redact,\" he told London's Frontline Club the month after his talk in Oxford. \"We have to take the best road that we can.\" \n Assange's attitude has hardened since. A brief experiment with automatic redactions was aborted. The journalist-led redactions were abandoned too after Assange's relationship with the London press corps turned toxic. By 2013 WikiLeaks had written off the redaction efforts as a wrong move. \n Withholding any data at all \"legitimizes the false propaganda of 'information is dangerous,'\" the group argued on Twitter. \n But some private information genuinely is dangerous, courting serious consequences for the people involved. \n Three Saudi cables published by the WikiLeaks identified domestic workers who'd been tortured or sexually abused by their employers, giving the women's full names and passport numbers. One cable named a male teenager who was raped by a man while abroad; a second identified another male teenager who was so violently raped his legs were broken; a third outlined the details of a Saudi man detained for \"sexual deviation\" \u2014 a derogatory term for homosexuality. \n Scott Long, an LGBT rights activist who has worked in the Middle East, said the names of rape victims were off-limits. And he worried that releasing the names of people persecuted for their sexuality only risked magnifying the harm caused by oppressive officials. \n \"You're legitimizing their surveillance, not combating it,\" Long said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n WikiLeaks was criticized last month after it released what it described as \"AKP emails,\" a reference to Turkey's governing Justice and Development Party, known by its Turkish acronym AKP. But dissidents' excitement turned to scorn when they realized the 300,000 documents were little more than a vast collection of junk mail and petitions. \n Vural Eroz, 66, was one of many people who'd written to the AKP, complaining in 2013 that his car had been towed from his lawn by authorities in Istanbul. He was startled to find that WikiLeaks had published the message along with his personal number. \n \"I would like to know for what purpose they exposed me,\" he said in a phone interview. \n Prominent anti-censorship campaigner Yaman Akdeniz, who reviewed hundreds of messages like Eroz's, said there was nothing newsworthy in any of them. \n Eroz said he admired WikiLeaks for exposing wrongdoing but said, \"they should try to protect innocent civilians. They should screen what they leak.\" \n Experts say WikiLeaks' apparent refusal to do the most minimal screening is putting even its own readers at risk. \n Vesselin Bontchev, a researcher at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences' National Laboratory of Computer Virology, said he was startled to find hundreds of pieces of malicious software in WikiLeaks' dumps \u2014 suggesting the site doesn't take basic steps to sanitize its publications. \n \"Their understanding of journalism is finding an interesting document in a trash can and then dumping the can on your front door,\" he said. \n Even Assange's biggest backers are getting uncomfortable. Journalist Glenn Greenwald, one of the site's leading allies in the media world, has distanced himself from WikiLeaks over its publication strategy.

Just an urge.\" \n The man, who has not been identified, had come to the hospital two weeks ago complaining of severe pain in his abdomen. \n \"In an endoscopy, we saw a big mass in his abdominal area,\" Malhotra said by phone. \"We initially thought it was a tumor or some cancerous growth. But it was like nothing we doctors had seen before.\" \n A team of two surgeons, two critical care physicians and an anesthetist conducted the surgery, during which they initially removed 28 knives. But further investigation revealed 12 more, the hospital said. \n There was massive internal bleeding during the surgery because the knives, which were all made of iron, had lacerated the man's stomach walls, Malhotra said. \n Since the surgery, the man has told doctors that he can't bear to look at another knife. \"He even asked his wife to get out of the room when she was cutting some fruit for him,\" Malhotra said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Doctors in India remove 40 knives from man's stomach"}

Mylan N.V., which has headquarters in Hertfordshire, England, and Pittsburgh, has hiked prices as frequently as three times a year over the past nine years, pushing its list price for a package of two syringes to more than $600. \n A look at the situation: \n Roughly 40 million Americans have severe allergies to spider bites, bee stings and foods like nuts, eggs and shellfish. They at risk for a serious reaction \u2014 anaphylactic shock. Symptoms quickly escalate from wheezing, hives and skin swelling to rapid heartbeat, trouble breathing and convulsions and, without treatment, possibly death. \n As a precaution, many carry EpiPens, which contain the best \"antidote,\" the hormone epinephrine. Last year, more than 3.6 million U.S. prescriptions for two-packs of EpiPens were filled, according to data firm IMS Health. That earned Mylan nearly $1.7 billion. \n Like all drugmakers, Mylan periodically hikes its prices. In 2007, when Mylan took over rights to EpiPen, a pair of syringes cost $93.88. According to Elsevier Clinical Solutions' database of prices set by manufacturers, Mylan raised the price 5 percent the in 2008 and 2009, when a competitor hit the market. Its price jumped 20 percent in late 2009, followed by a series of 10 percent and 15 percent increases. The price hit $609 per pair in mid-May. \n A: In the U.S., drug manufacturers charge what they think the market will bear. Unlike other countries, the U.S. government doesn't regulate drug prices, though the Veterans Affairs and Medicaid negotiate big discounts. Mylan hasn't answered questions about how it justifies its price hikes. A statement released Monday didn't address prices. \n The statement recommended that people review their coverage. It also says that since 2012, Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program has given schools more than 700,000 free EpiPens. \n EpiPen has a U.S. patent giving it a monopoly until 2025, according to Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat. Generic maker Teva has permission to launch a version but hasn't gotten regulatory approval yet. A rival injector called Auvi-Q was recalled last year because of potential inaccurate dosing, Raffat noted, and a third product has twice been rejected because of issues with the injector. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "How EpiPen's maker raised prices, and hackles, so much"}

{"date": "August 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Storms caused a big spike in the number of trees blown down or lost to heavy branch damage in forests where migrating monarch butterflies spend the winter in central Mexico, experts reported Tuesday. \n MEXICO CITY >> Storms earlier this year blew down more than a hundred acres of forests where migrating monarch butterflies spend the winter in central Mexico, killing more than 7 percent of the monarchs, experts reported today. \n Rain, cold and high winds from the storms caused the loss of 133 acres of pine and fir trees in the forests west of Mexico City, more than four times the amount lost to illegal logging this year. It was the biggest storm-related loss since the winter of 2009-10, when unusually heavy rainstorms and mudslides caused the destruction of 262 acres of trees. \n This year's storm also appears to have frozen or killed about 6.2 million butterflies, almost 7.4 percent of the estimated 84 million butterflies that wintered in Mexico, said Alejandro Del Mazo, the attorney general for environmental protection. \n \"Never had we observed such a combination of high winds, rain and freezing temperatures,\" monarch expert Lincoln Brower said of the storms, which struck March 8-9. \n Two big storm losses within five years may suggest changes in the climatic conditions that have allowed the survival of patches of mountaintop forests. An additional 16 acres of trees were lost to drought this year. \n \"This points up just how fragile these forests are, and how fragile the monarchs are, and it makes clear the importance of reforestation efforts,\" said Omar Vidal, director of the conservation group World Wildlife Fund Mexico, which carried out the forest survey along with experts from Mexico's National Autonomous University and the government. \n The monarchs depend on finding relatively well-preserved forests, where millions of the orange-and-black butterflies hang in clumps from the boughs. The trees, and the clumping, help protect the butterflies from cold rains and steep drops in temperature. \n That is why illegal logging in the 33,484-acre nucleus of the reserve is so damaging. Conservationists have tried to convince the largely impoverished farm and mountain communities which actually own most of the land that the forest is worth more to them in terms of tourism when left standing instead of being cut down. \n In April, Mexico's government announced it would create a special national police squad to patrol nature reserves and fight environmental crimes. While the force has not yet formally deployed, illegal logging in the monarch reserve dropped this year, from almost 49.4 acres in 2015 to about 29.6 acres. \n Unlike in past years, when most logging was done in the farming communities, about three-quarters of the tree-cutting this year occurred on public lands in the reserve's core area \u2014 precisely the kind of terrain that environmental police could most effectively protect. \n \"This is why we insist that illegal logging in the reserve has to be eliminated, and that the destruction of (the butterfly's) milkweed habitat in the United States has to be stopped, so that the monarchs have the ability to better respond to these extreme climate events\" like the March storms, Vidal said. \n Brower criticized authorities' decision to quickly approve \"salvage\" logging of trees downed by the storms, suggesting it strengthened logging interests and disturbs the forest's chances for natural regrowth. \n He wrote that the \"decision to authorize the very extensive salvage logging was possibly the worst management mistake that could have been made.\" \n Environmentalist and author Homero Aridjis said, \"The negative impacts of this logging on the forest cover will become all too apparent when the monarchs begin arriving (usually in November) just as the 'salvaging' comes to an end. \" \n \"The Mexican government should be taking measures to mitigate the probable effects of climate change on the reserve, instead of turning a blind eye to illegal logging, such as the virtual clear-cutting\" of the forest on government-owned land, Aridjis wrote. \n The damage comes after a rebound for the monarch. The area covered by the butterflies this winter was more than 3 1/2 times that of a year earlier. They clump so densely in the pine and fir forests that they are counted by the area they cover rather than by individual insects. \n The number of monarchs making the 3,400-mile migration from the United States and Canada had been declining steadily before recovering in 2014. This winter was even better. In December, the butterflies covered 10 acres, compared with 2.8 acres in 2014 and a record low of 1.66 acres in 2013. That's still well become the 44 acres the covered 20 years ago. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Experts: Mexico storms led to deaths of millions of monarch butterflies"}
