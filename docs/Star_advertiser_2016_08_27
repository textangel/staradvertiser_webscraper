{"date": "August 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Dawn breaks over Pyongyang, North Korea, as buildings poke through the midst. The hero, a police inspector, prowls a city known more for its political malevolence than its street crime. There have been no murders reported there for years, no bank robberies, no muggings. \n NEW YORK >> The hero, a police inspector, prowls a city known more for its political malevolence than its street crime. If you read the local newspapers, you could think it's a city with almost no crime at all. There have been no murders reported there for years, no bank robberies, no muggings, no rapes. \n The city is Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, which has long hidden so many realities beneath layers of propaganda and isolation. \n The hero is Inspector O, a policeman who knows those realities. And so, in many ways, does the policeman's creator, the bearded man in the crowded Manhattan restaurant who calls himself James Church. \n Church doesn't want you to know his real name, his nationality or the name of the organization where he worked for so many years. All he'll say is that he was raised in California, that he spent decades watching North Korea as an intelligence officer for a Western country, and that he traveled there dozens of times. \n Church has also, in novels about a tormented Pyongyang police inspector who loves his country despite its many failings, found a way to write about the country he studied for so long. \n Inspector O \u2014 his first name is never given; his surname is common in Korea \u2014 is a hard-boiled, old-school investigator, a Raymond Chandler character trying to do the right thing in a brutal world. But he is also quick to defend that world, especially when outsiders criticize it. \n \"We know how the world sees us,\" he tells a Swiss intelligence official in \"Bamboo and Blood,\" the third Inspector O novel. \"But we are not as weak as people think \u2014 or hope.\" \n Inspector O is \"a good, solid police detective who just wants to do his work,\" said Church, whose sixth book in the series, \"The Gentleman from Japan,\" will be released late this year. \"He really doesn't care about politics. He knows it gets in the way, that it's annoying. He knows that sometimes he has to bow to it.\" \n But O still refuses to wear one of the small lapel pins, decorated with portraits of North Korea's leaders that are ubiquitous in the country. \n Church's books often center around outsiders \u2014 an Israeli spy, a Scottish policeman, that Swiss intelligence guy \u2014 thrust into a North Korea they constantly misunderstand. \n \"I couldn't pretend that I was writing from the inside. I couldn't pretend that I was a North Korean,\" said Church, whose first Inspector O novel was released a decade ago, and whose work has been warmly received by critics. Now retired from government work, he was in New York recently for a visit. \"What interested me was the point at which the North Korean reality and our reality meet. Because I have a lot of experience with that, and that's where it illuminates what they think.\" \n The world has spent years misunderstanding the North Korean reality, Church says, reducing it to cliches of goose-stepping soldiers, brain-washed people, and dictators waiting for the chance to reduce the world to a smoldering, radioactive pulp. \n But much of what Inspector O encounters would be familiar anywhere. \n Church's North Korea is a place of squabbling relatives, office bullies, bureaucratic turf wars and bitter spouses. It's a place where most people quietly go along with the government, but a few find ways to quietly push back. It's a place where politics is a constant presence, something to be extremely wary of, but where most people are more worried about office politics or troublesome children. \n \"We've seen time after time, when authoritarian countries fall, that people pretty much live normal lives,\" he said. \"Some aspects of life are exaggerated in North Korea in many ways. But I think that when the end finally comes and we understand more fully how people live their lives, we'll be surprised.\" \n Still, North Koreans do face myriad dangers, from arrests by the country's web of security agencies to powerful bureaucrats who can upend a person's life in a moment. \n \"There are always storm clouds on the horizon,\" said Church. \"There is a thunderstorm that could break at any moment.\" \n O regularly hints at those storms. \n \"We all knew that we were drifting, and we knew where,\" the policeman reflects in \"Bamboo and Blood,\" which takes place during North Korea's brutal mid-1990s famine. \"A nation of shriveled leaves floating on a doomed river toward the falls. A winter of endless sorrow.\" \n Church's real name and his background are widely known in the small community of North Korea watchers, where he is seen as one of the most insightful analysts of the isolated nation. Inspector O also has plenty of fans. \n \"If you want to understand North Korea then you need to read Inspector O,\" said Michael Madden, who has spent years studying the North Korean leadership. Church \"is giving you the conversations that these people have, the bureaucracy there and just the North Korean mood and attitude. He gets that culture. Not many people do.\" \n Church also understands that, beyond the propaganda, North Korea pulls powerfully at its people, including Inspector O. \n \"We had something to believe in, a way to order existence,\" O says angrily in one book, when a South Korean derides North Korea's entire history. \"Maybe people didn't have much, most of them had very little, but for practically all of those years they felt they belonged to something.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "In North Korea, a hardboiled (and fictional) cop keeps watch"}

{"date": "August 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A makeshift memorial outside the Pulse nightclub was still filled with mementos and well-wishes on July 11, a month after the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. \n The more than 430 fundraisers posted on the GoFundMe website after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando have exposed weaknesses inherent in these popular do-it-yourself charity campaigns: waste, questionable intentions and little oversight. \n The fundraisers \u2014 an average of more than four for each of the 49 killed and 53 wounded \u2014 include travelers asking for cash, a practitioner of ancient healing, a personal safety instructor who sells quick loaders for assault rifles, and even convicted identity impostors. \n \"There was a deluge,\" said Holly Salmons, president of the Better Business Bureau for Central Florida. \"It was almost impossible for us or anyone else to be able to vet.\" \n The crowdfunding sites operate outside traditional charitable circles and often beyond the reach of government regulation. Appeals can be created in minutes by almost anyone and shared around the world. \n The officially sanctioned Equality Florida campaign raised more than $7 million via GoFundMe, but another $1.3 million went to smaller appeals \u2014 mostly set up by people with little or no charity experience. \n The Associated Press examined 30 campaigns chosen from throughout the lengthy list produced by a GoFundMe search for \"Orlando shootings.\" Within a month of the June 12 shootings, they had raised more than $265,000. \n Half said donations would be used for legitimate-sounding purposes: to cover funeral, medical and other costs. Some campaign organizers were relatives of the dead or wounded. A high school basketball coach raised $15,297 for the family of Akyra Murray, a star player who had just graduated before dying in the attack. \n But most campaigns lacked key details, such as exactly what the donations would cover or even who was asking for them. Only nine of the 30 organizers agreed to interviews. \n One man wanted money for travel costs to Orlando to shoot independent news video. He hadn't raised anything two months later. Another organizer raised just $25 for travel money to hold a community healing ceremony inspired by ancient shamanic rituals. She dropped that plan in favor of sending painted rocks with an inspiring word of support. \n Jackson Yauck of Victoria, British Columbia, put up a lighthearted appeal to let the highest donor burn a pair of skimpy gold-colored shorts he wore to gay-pride events. He had created the appeal on Jan. 1 on behalf of other charities and when he tried to switch it to benefit the Orlando victims, GoFundMe froze his account for at least a week, he said. He agreed to transfer the donations to Equality Florida, and GoFundMe let the appeal go forward. \n Yauck said he knew all but one of his 11 donors personally and didn't feel a need to tell them of the switch. \"It was just for fun. If you look at the bigger picture, we raised $600 off a pair of underwear,\" he said. \n Several businesses asked for contributions. One appeal raised $1,375 from 14 donors within two months to keep open a hair salon run by partners killed in the attack. A counseling center raised $150 to subsidize services to victims but closed its campaign when it found grant money elsewhere. GoFundMe helps make refunds when contributions go unused. \n Weapons-accessory dealer Craig Berberich, of Bradenton, Florida, proposed holding public classes on personal safety. He posted a link to his business at the bottom of his appeal. He said he \"wasn't trying to promote my business.\" Then he added: \"I hope we didn't give the impression that we were a charity.\" \n He said he was shutting down his appeal. It remained online over a month later \u2014 but with only $100 in donations. Among his store products: a high-speed loader for assault weapons. \n Efe Atalay, of Clermont, Florida, raised $1,145 from 81 donors to buy security wands for nightclub entrances, but didn't say which clubs and spoke vaguely of lobbying politicians to require such security measures. He didn't respond to emails sent to his GoFundMe address. \n Florida charities law generally requires no filings by crowdfunding campaigns meant for particular victims or their families or in support of other established charities. That accounts for the vast majority of appeals. Other states apply a patchwork of laws. \n Yet, crowdfunding campaigns can distribute aid more quickly than large bureaucratic funds. And they have less overhead than traditional charities, with only 8 percent of donations on GoFundMe going to the website and credit card fees. \n Bobby Whithorne, a GoFundMe spokesman, said the website's staffers were vetting the Orlando campaigns before releasing funds, and only a small fraction of a percent of past appeals involved outright fraud. \n GoFundMe froze funds from entertainment company manager David Luchsinger's campaign when donations piled up quickly. Luchsinger said he was asked for more details of his plans to replace the ruined equipment of one of his deejays who was working at the club during the attack. Luchsinger set an initial goal of $5,000, and raised $8,742 in one month. \n Asked about the website's vetting process, he replied, \"Was it so strenuous that you couldn't fake it? No, you could definitely fake it.\" \n Despite his good intentions, things got mixed up. He didn't realize someone else had launched a GoFundMe appeal for his deejay, who got his name removed from the second appeal. Two companies eventually replaced the equipment for free, so the deejay kept some of the donations to replace his lost salary and shared the rest with other club deejays, Luchsinger said. \n Several big funds have joined forces in an official centralized campaign that raised more than $23 million, including the $7 million from Equality Florida's GoFundMe campaign. \n The donations to the central fund are generally tax-deductible, since they go to registered charities. Donations to a crowdfunding site are typically not tax-deductible, unless the organizer is a tax-exempt charity. \n The bigger charities \u2014 unlike many crowdfunding campaigns \u2014 give timetables for distributing aid, and detail recipients and how decisions are made. Ken Feinberg, administrator for the centralized fund, has already held two town hall meetings with survivors and family members of the victims. \n In one crowdfunding campaign, friends Guardini Bellefleur and Demetrice Naulings asked for $25,000 to set up a vaguely defined foundation in memory of Eddie Justice, a friend of Naulings killed in the shootings. They said the money would pay for Justice's funeral and victim counseling. \n Six people donated $253. \n Wilhemina Justice said no one consulted her about the appeal in her son's name or made arrangements to give her proceeds. \"To me, it's fraud,\" she said. \n Florida bars anyone convicted in the past decade of certain crimes, including identity fraud, from running a charity. Yet, court records show Bellefleur was convicted in 2012 of buying $3,570 worth of furniture by impersonating the son of an account holder, and Naulings was convicted in 2008 of giving police a false name and driving with a suspended license. \n \"We've all done some bad things that we would want to change, but this was my moment to change,\" Naulings said. \n Naulings acknowledged he never consulted Justice's mother or helped pay for his funeral, but said, without offering details, his future nonprofit would someday help her. \n Bellefleur did not respond to repeated messages, but in an online video, rejected the idea the pair wanted the money for themselves. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Scams, waste loom as charity millions donated after Orlando"}

{"date": "August 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Rodney Earl Sanders, 46, of Kosciusko, has been charged with two counts of capital murder in connection with the killing of Sister Margaret Held and Sister Paula Merrill, both nurse practitioners who were found dead in their Durant, Miss., house Thursday. \n DURANT, Miss. >> A man suspected in the slayings of two nuns found dead in their Mississippi home confessed to the killings, a sheriff said Saturday, in the latest twist to a crime that has horrified people in the small communities where the women served. \n Rodney Earl Sanders, 46, of Kosciusko, Mississippi, was arrested and charged in the deaths of Sister Margaret Held and Sister Paula Merrill, Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesman Warren Strain said late Friday. Both women were 68. \n Willie March, the sheriff of Holmes County where the killings occurred, said Saturday he had been briefed by police from the town where the killings occurred and Mississippi Bureau of Investigation officials who took part in Sanders' interrogation. \n Sanders confessed in the interrogation to the killings and gave no reason for the crimes, March said. \n The sheriff said police work and tips from the community led police to Sanders, and the investigation is ongoing. \n Durant police could not be reached for comment. Strain, whose department includes the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, said the organization would neither confirm nor deny that Sanders confessed. \n Sanders was convicted last year of a felony DUI, said Grace Simmons Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Corrections. \n He was later released from prison and is currently on probation. \n Sanders was also convicted of armed robbery in Holmes County, sentenced in 1986 and served six years, Fisher said. \n People who knew the nuns, known for their generosity and commitment to improving health care for the poor, have been grappling with why anyone would want to kill them. \n Dr. Elias Abboud, the physician who oversees the clinic in Lexington where the nuns worked, said Saturday that Sanders was not a patient there. \n The Rev. Greg Plata, sacramental minister at St. Thomas Catholic Church in Lexington where the women led Bible study for years, said Saturday he does not think people at the church knew Sanders. \n The women's bodies were discovered Thursday after they failed to show up for work in Lexington, about 10 miles from where they lived. \n The sheriff said they had been stabbed. \n \"Sanders was developed as a person of interest early on in the investigation,\" Lt. Colonel Jimmy Jordan said in the statement. \n Authorities said Sanders was being held in an undisclosed detention center pending a court appearance. They have not given any details on why they think Sanders killed the women or whether he knew them. \n Strain said he does not know if Sanders has an attorney. Authorities do not anticipate making any other arrests. Strain said \"investigators believe Sanders acted alone.\" \n Merrill's nephew, David Merrill, speaking by telephone from Stoneham, Massachusetts, said Saturday the family was \"thankful\" Sanders is off the streets. \n But the family still has to deal with the loss. \n Merrill said he agrees with the idea of forgiveness and that is something his aunt would want for whoever killed her but he's not sure if he's capable of completely forgiving. \n Merrill said he would not support the death penalty if Sanders were to be convicted but that decision will ultimately be made by the people in Mississippi. The capital murder charge leaves open the possibility Sanders would face the death penalty but that determination would be made by prosecutors later. \n The order Held belonged to \u2014 School Sisters of St. Francis \u2014 thanked law enforcement officers working on the case and thanked people who offered prayers and support in the wake of the sisters' deaths. \n In the poverty-stricken Mississippi county where the two nuns were slain, many people were still mourning their loss. \n Jonell Payton, a Durant alderwoman, lives across the street and a few doors down from Held and Merrill's house. She said the nuns were \"the most precious two people\" and were known for helping provide medicine for those who couldn't afford it. \n Both women worked at the clinic, where they gave flu shots, dispensed insulin and provided other medical care for children and adults who couldn't afford it. \n Their stolen car was found abandoned a mile from their home, and there were signs of a break-in, but police haven't disclosed a motive. \n Plata said both nuns' religious communities have asked that people pray for the killer or killers. Asked about people's struggles to forgive, the priest said: \"Forgiveness is at the heart of being a Christian. Look at Jesus on the cross: \"Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.'\" \n The clinic and the nuns' home in Durant are in Holmes County, population 18,000. With 44 percent of its residents living in poverty, Holmes is the seventh-poorest county in America, according to the Census Bureau. \n The nuns' death leaves a gaping hole in what was already a strapped health care system. \n The clinic provided about 25 percent of all medical care in the county, Abboud said. \n Merrill's sister Rosemarie, speaking by telephone from her Stoneham, Massachusetts, home, said her sister had been in Mississippi helping the poor since 1981. \n Held \u2014 impressionable and idealistic \u2014 was committed to ending racism and poverty, according to an interview she did earlier with her order's magazine. \n \"The invitation to come to Mississippi provided me with the setting in which I hoped to make a difference with my life. I came here because of a dream and a cause but I stayed here because of the people,\" she said. \n A former nun who knew Held said she had always been interested in working with the \"poorest of the poor.\" \n Darlene Nicgorski said Saturday that she had recruited Held to come to Holly Springs, Mississippi, to work as a social worker in a program there that ran schools and offered day care to help young mothers finish school. \n Nicgorski said the sisters' deaths just don't make sense. She said they would have given the suspect anything he needed. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Sheriff: Man confesses in killings of 2 Mississippi nuns"}

{"date": "August 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The submarine USS Illinois travels along the Thames River after departing General Dynamics Electric Boat in Groton, Conn., for initial sea trials, where the ship's performance is tested prior to delivery to the U.S. Navy. The submarine will officially join the Navy fleet in a fall 2016 ceremony. \n An attack submarine that is sponsored by first lady Michelle Obama and will be named for her home state has been delivered to the U.S. Navy. \n Submarine builder General Dynamics Electric Boat, based in Groton, Connecticut, delivered the submarine that will become the USS Illinois to the Navy on Saturday after nearly five and a half years of construction. \n The first lady, who's from Chicago, will be involved in the life of the submarine and the lives of its sailors and their families. \n The submarine will become the USS Illinois, SSN 786, and begin its active service at a commissioning ceremony in Groton on Oct. 29. \n It took thousands of shipyard employees in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Virginia and submarine supply businesses nationwide to build the $2.7 billion submarine, the 13th member of the Virginia class. \n There were no major issues during construction, and the submarine performed \"superbly\" during recent tests at sea, said an Electric Boat vice president, Kenneth Blomstedt. \n Capt. Michael Stevens, the Navy's Virginia-class program manager, said these attack submarines are needed to replace those that were built during the Cold War and are retiring. \n \"Every submarine counts,\" he said. \"Every submarine is needed out there.\" \n Electric Boat, which has been designing and building submarines since 1900, had until Aug. 31 to transfer ownership of the future USS Illinois to the Navy, per the contract. It's the ninth submarine in a row to be delivered to the Navy early and on budget, Stevens said. \n The submarine has a redesigned bow with two large tubes to launch Tomahawk missiles, instead of 12 smaller tubes. The larger tubes were designed so the Navy would have the flexibility to also launch future weapons and unmanned vehicles, Blomstedt said. \n Cmdr. Jess Porter, the submarine's commanding officer, described the Illinois as a \"stealthy weapon\" that can influence adversaries in a way that makes the U.S. more secure. The crew of about 130 men will take the submarine to sea for additional testing to prove its capabilities, Porter said. \n Construction began in March 2011. Modules were built in Rhode Island, at Electric Boat's manufacturing facility, and in Virginia, at Newport News Shipbuilding. The two shipyards build Virginia-class attack submarines under a teaming agreement and alternate the deliveries. The final assembly and testing took place at Electric Boat's headquarters in Groton. \n Obama, who has made it a priority to support military families, broke a bottle of champagne across the submarine's hull to christen it last year. She has been invited to give the order to \"bring the ship to life\" at the commissioning ceremony in October. \n Inside the submarine, there's a metal plate inscribed with the first lady's initials, which each sailor will see several times a day. It's mounted where the crew eats. \n The Navy has ordered 15 more Virginia-class submarines, and 10 of those are under construction. The last of the 15 is scheduled to be delivered in 2023 as the 28th member of the class. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Navy gets $2.7B attack submarine sponsored by Michelle Obama"}

Joni Ernst came just hours after Clinton received her first national security briefing as the Democratic presidential nominee. \n Trump skipped the 42-mile motorcycle ride that preceded the event in a state where polls show a tight contest, a rare bright spot for Trump amid a sea of challenging battleground states. Joining him on stage were top Iowa Republicans \u2014 among them Ernst, Gov. Terry Branstad, Sen. Chuck Grassley and Rep. Steve King \u2014 in a rare show of support for a candidate who has struggled to unite his party. \n In a hat tip to Iowa's agriculture industry, Trump renewed his commitment to continuing a requirement that all gasoline sold contain an ethanol-based additive, an issue important to corn growers. He also promised to cut taxes on family farms, which he called the \"backbone\" of the country. \n \"Hillary Clinton wants to shut down family farms just like she wants to shut down the mines and the steelworkers,\" he said in front of a wall of straw bales at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. \"She will do this not only through radical regulation, but also by raising taxes on family farms \u2013 and all businesses \u2013 to rates as high as nearly 50 percent.\" \n Clinton's campaign website touts a plan to increase funding to support farmers and ranchers in local food markets and regional food systems, saying she'll create a \"focused safety net to help family farms get through challenging times.\" It also says she plans to target federal resources in commodity payment, crop insurance, and disaster assistance programs to support family operations. \n Branstad, in an interview with The Associated Press prior to the speech, said he felt that Trump could score points against Clinton by focusing on agricultural issues. Branstad, whose son runs Trump's campaign in the state, said he also hopes Trump would launch campaign ads there and that he sees the race as \"about even.\" \n \"I don't like that but, hopefully, that's going to change,\" Branstad said. \n Speaking to an overwhelmingly white crowd, he again pledged that as president he would help African-Americans living in cities with high crime and low employment. He offered no specifics for how he would achieve that goal. He also continued to criticize Clinton for branding young criminals as \"super-predators\" in comments more than 20 years ago. \n \"Remember that? 'Super-predators,'\" he said. \"And they were very, very insulted. But now people have forgotten.\" Clinton's primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, had criticized her for the remark, and she has since apologized for it. \n Amid his ongoing appeal to black voters, Trump drew an online backlash Saturday for a tweet he sent in response to the shooting death of NBA star Dwayne Wade's cousin, who was gunned down near the Chicago school where she had planned to register her children. \n \"Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!\" Trump tweeted.

She was near the school, which is about a mile and a half southwest of the University of Chicago, when two males walked up and fired shots at a third man but hit Aldridge in the head and arm. She wasn't the intended target, police said. \n Police said Saturday afternoon that two \"people of interest\" were being questioned by detectives but no one has been charged in the shooting. Authorities are investigating whether the encounter between the men was a robbery, possibly involving a driver from a ridesharing company, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. \n Chicago has been plagued by gun violence for years, especially in a few South and West Side neighborhoods.

Reed said he fought in Iraq and is now fighting \"fighting for our children and our water.\" \n NEAR THE STANDING ROCK SIOUX RESERVATION, N.D. >> Native Americans from reservations hundreds of miles away from North Dakota have joined the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's growing protest against a $3.8 billion four-state oil pipeline that they say could disturb sacred sites and impact drinking water for 8,000 tribal members and millions further downstream. \n About 30 people have been arrested in recent weeks and the company has temporarily stopped construction. A federal judge will rule before Sept. 9 on whether construction can be halted on the Dakota Access pipeline, which will pass through Iowa, Illinois, North Dakota and South Dakota. \n Meet a few of the people camping out near the confluence of the Cannonball and Missouri Rivers in southern North Dakota: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n WAMBLI JOHNSON was supposed to begin third grade last week in northern Arizona's Black Mesa, on the Navajo Nation. Instead, she rode horses, saw buffalo up close for the first time and made new friends from other tribes. \n \"This is school,\" the soft-spoken 11-year-old who speaks Navajo as her first language said of her experience outside of the 2.3 million-acre reservation. \n It was Wambli who persuaded her mother, Osh, to make the daylong drive and join members of nearly 100 tribes and other protesters from around the country after hearing about the protest through relatives and social media. \n On Thursday, Wambli presented protest organizers with $150 she earned selling her homemade laundry detergent soap door-to-door in one of the poorest and most remote communities on the Navajo Nation, which spans parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. It took her nearly a month to raise the money, one $2 to $4 soap at a time. Her pitch: \"I don't want water to be poisoned,\" she said. \n It wasn't a tough sell, said Wambli, whose own home has no running water and instead has to be hauled in, a chore in which she helps. \n \"We know water is life,\" Osh Johnson said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n VIVIAN JOHNSON's first few years were spent living in traditional Sioux teepee on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation in north-central South Dakota. \n For the past several weeks, the 65-year-old, her four children and seven grandchildren have been making teepees and tents their home at the protest site. \n \"I'm here to save our water and to save our children,\" she said. \n Johnson, visibly exhausted, said she intended to stay \"as long as it takes\" until the pipeline plan is killed. \n \"It's a shame it has to be this way.\" Johnson said. \"I'm tired. And I'm tired of the people fighting over this. I just want peace and this pipeline to go away.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n JON DON ILONE REED is no stranger to conflict. The 30-year-old member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe said he answered the call of his country, joining the Army and taking part in a military offensive to drive the insurgents from the late dictator Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, Iraq. \n \"Now, I hear the call of my people,\" Reed said of his decision to join the protest. \n Imposing but polite, Reed wore a mixture of Army camouflage and traditional tribal dress and his chest bears the scars of a Sun Dance, a sacred \u2014 and once illegal \u2014 Lakota ceremony. Dancers pierce their bodies with sticks tethered to tree by ropes. After days of dancing under the sun, the sticks are ripped from their flesh by pulling away from the tree. The dance is a symbol of sacrifice in hopes their creator will hear their prayers. \n Reed said he wants the government and the Texas-based pipeline company to hear the pleas of protesters, and prays the protest will remain peaceful. \n \"I fought in Iraq,\" he said. \"Now I'm fighting for our children and our water.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n JOYE BRAUN, an organizer of the \"spirit camp,\" has been on site since April 1 \u2014 \"when there was still snow on the ground.\" \n \"Now we're getting ready for winter again,\" said Braun, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network. \"We're not going anywhere.\" \n She also hopes the protests stay peaceful. \n \"We're not against the police at all,\" she said. \"We're not against the construction crews \u2014 we know they are just trying to make a living. But they are working for the wrong company.\" \n Braun said the issue is just as much about tribal rights as it is protecting the water and sacred sites. \"It will not come through.

{"date": "August 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, seen in silhouette center, arrives at an FBI office in White Plains, N.Y. for a national security briefing. \n WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. >> Hillary Clinton received her first national security briefing Saturday as the Democratic presidential nominee, meeting with intelligence officials for an overview of the major threats facing the nation around the globe. \n Clinton attended the briefing for more than two hours at the FBI office in White Plains, New York, near her suburban New York City home. Republican Donald Trump received his briefing earlier this month, a customary move for major party nominees but one that has been the subject of a political tussle during the campaign. \n Trump was campaigning on Saturday in Iowa, headlining Republican Sen. Joni Ernst's annual \"Roast and Ride\" fundraiser at the Iowa State Fairgrounds. The celebrity businessman was not planning to join the 42-mile motorcycle ride that is part of the event but bringing his campaign to a state where polls show a tight contest, a rare bright spot for Trump amid a sea of challenging battleground states. \n The activities capped a week that saw some of the harshest exchanges between the two presidential rivals, with Clinton asserting in a fiery Reno, Nevada, speech on Thursday that Trump was stoking a \"radical fringe\" within the Republican Party, including anti-Semites and white supremacists. Trump, who is trying to win over moderate voters and minorities who have been unsettled by some of his provocative remarks and policy proposals, has tried to paint Clinton as a racist. \n The Republican released an online video that includes footage of the former first lady referring to some young criminals as \"super predators\" in the 1990s. The video also shows Clinton's former Democratic rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, denouncing the phrase as \"a racist term.\" Clinton has since apologized. \n Clinton has said that Trump and his supporters have taken on extremist views, casting the race in a Friday MSNBC interview as \"not a normal choice between a Republican and a Democrat.\" \n The back-and-forth also has been waged in the national security space. \n As President Barack Obama's secretary of state, Clinton held a high security clearance and received a copy of the President's Daily Brief \u2014 the highest-level U.S. intelligence document that includes sensitive intelligence and analysis from around the world. \n Saturday's briefing was Clinton's first since becoming her party's nominee and she did not receive it with any aides present, her campaign said. Trump received his first briefing earlier this month and was accompanied by retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. \n The briefings, which are delivered by career staffers from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, have been traditional for presidential nominees for more than 60 years to ensure a smooth transition for the next commander in chief. But the lead-up to the meetings for both candidates have been steeped in politics. \n Prior to Trump's briefing, leading Democrats questioned whether the celebrity businessman could responsibly handle receiving sensitive information because of some of his comments, including the suggestion that Russia should attempt to hack Clinton's emails. \n Trump and his supporters have said that Clinton's use of a private email server and FBI Director James Comey's rebuke of her \"extremely careless\" handling of classified information at the State Department should bar her from receiving the briefing. \n House Speaker Paul Ryan, meanwhile, wrote National Intelligence Director James Clapper, saying that many questions remain about how Clinton handled her email and requested she not receive the intelligence overview for the remainder of the campaign. \n But Clapper rejected Ryan's request, responding that the meetings would be provided on a non-partisan basis. \"I do not intend to withhold briefings from any officially nominated, eligible candidate,\" Clapper wrote. \n Trump is also trying to shore up his standing with Latino voters. In Las Vegas, Trump met Friday with two dozen Latino supporters to discuss strategies for boosting Hispanic turnout in the swing state. He has sought to make the case that his economic policies would be better for small minority-owned businesses than those of Clinton. \n \"People don't know how well we're doing with the Hispanics, the Latinos,\" Trump said at his hotel just off the Vegas Strip. \"We're doing really well.\" \n Trump has suggested that minorities have been left behind by Democratic economic policies and hammered the nation's sluggish GDP growth as \"a catastrophe.\" \n But he has continued to send mixed signals about a key issue for many Latinos: immigration. While he has not wavered on his desire to build an impenetrable wall along the border with Mexico, he exhibited indecisiveness in recent days about his plan to deport 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. \n Aides have said he would announce his immigration policy in a speech in the coming days, but his campaign has yet to set a date. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton receives first intelligence briefing as nominee"}

Rescuers began digging, finding at first a doll and then a cold human leg, that of Giulia. \n Then he saw the ground nearby moving \"in the rhythm of what could be breathing.\" \n \"Maybe they hugged each other in their sleep or in fear, and the body of Giulia saved Giorgia,\" Caico told the newspaper. \n According to Italian news reports, Giorgia is in a state of shock and is practically not speaking anymore.
