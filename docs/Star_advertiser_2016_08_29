{"date": "August 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama's view of Wal-Mart shifted early in his presidency when he realized he needed business support to advance his health care overhaul. \n WASHINGTON >> As a freshman senator with his eye on the presidency, Barack Obama said he'd never shop at a Wal-Mart and held the company up as an emblem of corporate greed.  \n Today, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is one of Obama's most reliable corporate allies, a go-to partner that's backed the White House on more than a dozen business initiatives, particularly Obamacare and climate change. \n The pairing benefits both. Obama can point to Wal-Mart's support to beat back Republican charges that he's hostile to business. Wal-Mart can point to the president's embrace to lure squeamish shoppers who, like Obama of old, have stayed away out of a belief the company hurts workers and undercuts competition. This is a key part of the company's effort to spur continued growth. \n \"It only makes sense for the president to be willing to strike a partnership with the nation's largest retailer,\" said Dwight Hill, a Plano, Texas-based partner with retail consultancy McMillan Doolittle. \"And Wal-Mart has made more strides of late to try to be more transparent about worker pay and benefits. They have certainly seen the light.\" \n The president completed the turn from Wal-Mart antagonist to fan when he visited one of the retailer's stores in Mountain View, Calif., in 2014 to praise its use of renewable energy. Obama's visit represented a \"major milestone\" for the company and its public image, said Jib Ellison, whose consulting firm worked on Wal-Mart's sustainability program. \n \"When he got elected, his rhetoric was very anti-Wal-Mart,\" said Ellison, who continues to advise Wal-Mart on environmental policies. \"So it's reaffirming.\" \n The partnership between the president and the retailer is especially strong in two areas: health care and climate change. \n Obama's view of Wal-Mart shifted early in his presidency when he realized he needed business support to advance his health care overhaul, which Republicans claimed would kill jobs and drive companies out of business. Wal-Mart was one of the first major employers to sign on to the plan. In June 2009, as debate raged in Congress, Wal-Mart publicly released a letter to Obama saying it supported requiring employers to offer health insurance to their workers, a keystone of the law. \n For Wal-Mart, the Affordable Care Act resolved a major gripe about the company: that it provided weak health benefits for its more than 1 million workers in the U.S. Obamacare created a system of subsidized insurance for middle-income Americans and expanded the Medicaid program for the poor to cover people earning poverty-level wages. Pressure subsided on Wal-Mart to provide coverage. When government-run insurance exchanges opened in 2014, Wal-Mart stopped offering health insurance to 30,000 part-time workers. \n \"Obamacare is great for Wal-Mart workers; it was a huge transfer of wealth,\" said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor, and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who wrote a book on Wal-Mart. \"The pressure is off Wal-Mart to provide better health insurance to its own employees. If you're a single mom and work at Wal-Mart you now qualify for Medicaid.\" \n Wal-Mart and the White House have cooperated on Obama's climate agenda, which current and former company executives described as a natural gelling of interests rather than a political calculation. Wal-Mart began pushing to cut its carbon footprint in 2005 as a way to not only help the environment, but also improve its public image, and is now the largest corporate user of solar energy. \n Last year, the company endorsed the global accord Obama negotiated in Paris to reduce carbon emissions. \n Leslie Dach, who ran Wal-Mart's government relations and corporate affairs department from 2006 until 2013 before joining the Obama administration, published a piece in the Huffington Post shortly before leaving the company titled: \"Wal-Mart Agrees With the President: The Time for Renewables Has Come.\" The retailer seized upon an offhand comment by the president during a speech that week at Georgetown University, in which he said \"Wal-Mart deserves a cheer\" for reducing carbon pollution. \n Obama's senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said the White House has found in Wal-Mart a willing partner as it reached out to various businesses to embrace administration's initiatives. \n \"We recognize that the private sector is the economic engine of our country,\" Jarrett said in an interview. \"It's not enough just to have these policies on the books.\" \n Working with the administration helps the retailer address the social and environmental issues that the company's customers care about, said Kathleen McLaughlin, Wal-Mart's chief sustainability officer and CEO of the Wal-Mart Foundation. \n \"It's so essential that we have these collaborations,\" she said. \n When Wal-Mart announced it would raise its minimum wage for employees in early 2015, after some encouragement from the administration, Obama called Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon from Air Force One to congratulate him and told a crowd in North Carolina that \"once Wal-Mart is paying people more, then you know that something is happening, right?\" \n The pair have also worked on veteran employment, financial security, workforce training, gun control, criminal justice issues and first lady Michelle Obama's healthy lifestyle campaign. As Obama was urging Congress to pass tougher restrictions on guns, Wal-Mart removed military-style rifles from its stores in August 2015, citing declining demand. \n For Wal-Mart, all of this is aimed at bolstering its standing with a key demographic of shoppers it must reach for continued growth \u2014 upper-income families in traditionally liberal areas like Chicago, Los Angeles and the East Coast. \n \"Given the fact the company isn't growing that much, they really need to expand, in these coastal cities,\" Lichtenstein said. \"There has been a certain percentage of Americans that just won't shop there for political reasons.\" \n The company's warm ties with Obama don't seem to bother its base of customers in redder parts of the country. In Elizabeth, Colo., a fast-growing area about 46 miles southeast of downtown Denver where just 13 percent of voters identify themselves as Democrats, some shoppers recoiled at a reporter's mention of Obama's name. Others said they didn't care. \n Betty Erickson, 82, a retired cashier, said she cares more about whether Wal-Mart's shelves are fully stocked and their prices stable than the company's decision to discontinue selling rifles or other politically controversial products. \n \"But I am glad that they are paying their workers more,\" she said. \n Money has followed Wal-Mart's embrace of Obama. The company increased its political spending during his presidency, with donations to Democrats no longer trailing Republicans by huge margins. \n Wal-Mart's political action committee gave $1.2 million to federal candidates during the 2012 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington nonprofit that tracks campaign spending. Democrats claimed about half that money, up from 21 percent in 2004 and only 14 percent in 2000. So far this cycle, Democrats have received about 41 percent of Wal-Mart's $1.1 million in contributions, with Republicans getting the rest. \n Alice Walton, the daughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, gave $353,000 to Hillary Clinton's joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee. \n The detente, however, does not include some Democrats who continue to criticize Wal-Mart \u2014 as Obama once did \u2014 for its labor practices and relatively low wages. The retailer is still a favorite target for attacks by party activists. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to hold the company up as the epitome of inequality and has said it should \"get off of welfare, pay your workers a living wage.\" \n Robert Reich, labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, said he was upset that Obama had visited the \"viciously anti-union\" retailer's Mountain View store. But he said he understood the rationale for working with the company.  \n \"It is the largest employer in America and I think it's understandable that a president would want to work with them and coax them along,\" Reich, now a public policy professor at University of California, Berkeley said in a telephone interview. \n Aware of the criticism he would face from his base for building closer ties with Wal-Mart, Obama's outreach was part of a broader strategy to court a range of businesses during a time of heightened congressional gridlock. The president in 2014 partnered with companies on initiatives including finding jobs for the long-term unemployed, improving worker training and fighting climate change. Wal-Mart was often part of those projects. \n Wal-Mart still has work to do before coastal liberals brave its Supercenters, said Allen Adamson, founder of BrandSimple Consulting, and it will likely have to continue to cozy up with Democrats to sway opinions.  \n \"They are starting to make some progress, but it is very hard if you are very big to change people's perceptions,\" Adamson said. \"Once consumers categorize you as big, but not necessarily good, it is hard to change that perception.\" \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "Obama finds an ally in Wal-Mart, whose stores he once shunned"}

{"date": "August 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / JUNE 12 \n Barbra Streisand praised longtime friend Hillary Clinton and dissed her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, during her nine-city \"Encore\" tour \n HACKENSACK, N.J. >> Have the entertainment industry's bold-faced names been behaving a little too boldly in this year's presidential race? Or, are this election's nominees \u2014 and their assorted, outsized foibles, trials and tribulations \u2014 simply too irresistible to ignore?  \n This summer, Barbra Streisand praised longtime friend Hillary Clinton and dissed her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, during her nine-city \"Encore\" tour. During an interview at the Sarajevo Film Festival, Robert De Niro compared Trump to Travis Bickle, the deranged fictional character he played in Martin Scorsese's \"Taxi Driver.\" And horror author Stephen King described Trump \u2014 rather horrifically \u2014 as \"a rabid coyote with bad hair.\" \n More than one stand-up comedian has characterized Trump as \"the gift that keeps on giving.\" But Clinton isn't faring much better. Throughout the campaign she's been clobbered by high-profile, right-leaning celebrities \u2014 and more than a few on the left. Among the most virulent: outspoken conservative actor James Woods, who said in one tweet that Clinton \"could set a school bus on fire and get away with it.\" \n When it comes to celebrities and their often colorful political opinions, Giancarlo Ghione, a 24-year-old Lyndhurst resident and an executive member of the Young Republicans of Bergen County, says: \"For me, it really depends which celebrity we're talking about. Is it Oprah Winfrey? Is it Alec Baldwin? Oprah has a huge following, she's not controversial and she's respected. That's what she's known for. Baldwin is best known for yelling at paparazzi at the airport.\" \n A Trump supporter, Ghione said he was handing out literature recently for county candidates in Rutherford and spoke to a woman who attended one of Streisand's Brooklyn concerts \u2014 and was still livid about the Trump jokes. (In one of the shows on this tour, Streisand introduced mentalist Lior Suchard, who she said was capable of reading anyone's mind except for Donald Trump's \u2014 \"because he doesn't have one.\") \n \"The political stuff really bothered this woman,\" Ghione said, \"and I understood that. If you're speaking at a rally or putting stuff on your website, that's one thing. But these people paid a lot of money to see a concert.\" \n During the Chicago leg of Streisand's tour, one member of the audience screamed out, \"Shut up and sing!\" (Perhaps it made a difference. Days later, at her Boston show, Streisand reached out to her Republican fans, thanking them for showing up, \"despite our differences.\") \n Many performers, Dolly Parton among them, prefer to avoid politics altogether. When asked by Fox News host Bill O'Reilly whether she was conservative or not, Parton said, \"I'm more patriotic than political.\" \n And that's just fine with Clinton supporter Jared Cardenas of Bergenfield. \n \"I completely understand and respect that. But others do want to speak out,\" Cardenas said. \n \"A few months ago, at a Springsteen concert, a fan had an anti-Trump sign and Bruce grabbed it and held it up. And people got mad, which baffles me. They say, 'He should stick to making music,' which makes it clear to me that they're not listening to the music he's making. And, why shouldn't he share his views? When I'm at work and someone says something political I don't say 'Hey, why don't you stick to program managing?'\" \n Certainly, actor James Woods, a two-time Oscar nominee, three-time Emmy winner and often-outspoken conservative, isn't sticking to acting. On Aug. 7, he took to Twitter, posting a green-tinged photo of Clinton \u2014 looking not unlike the Wicked Witch of the West \u2014 in a meme that asked \"Who in hell is voting for this woman?\" \n Then, days later, Woods wrote, \"She is not of this earth when it comes to the truth. She would lie about the color of the moon, just to lie.\" \n Susan Sarandon, who supported Bernie Sanders before and during the primary season \u2014 and who has rarely passed up an opportunity to share her political views \u2014 has also repeatedly attacked Clinton on talk shows and in print interviews over the candidate's support of fracking and the Iraq War. \n Sarandon has even chastised Sen. Elizabeth Warren for moving into the Clinton camp, saying that Clinton \"represents everything (Warren) has fought against.\" \n Most voters are used to the political barbs they hear nightly from Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Kimmel. And on \"Saturday Night Live,\" larger than life political caricatures (\"I can see Russia from my house!\") are routine fare. But that doesn't necessarily mean that people want to hear about politics during a concert, interview or awards ceremony. \n Scott Blakeman, a political comedian who performs frequently in the Garden State and often appears as a commentator on NPR and cable news shows, notes that many performers, regularly promote their causes onstage. \"And I think a true fan (doesn't mind) as long as they sing their hits.\" \n But Blakeman added that, in his experience on the road, audiences are much more polarized than they used to be and this can have a huge effect on how they react to what a performer \u2014 even one they admire \u2014 says onstage. \"Audiences,\" he said, \"are less likely to laugh at (these jokes) or accept the political views that they disagree with.\" \n Pundits on both sides agree that, as a presidential candidate, Trump's celebrity has contributed to the enormous amount of media coverage he has received. In May alone, The New York Times reported, Trump earned $400 million worth of free media, roughly what Sen. John McCain spent on his entire presidential run eight years ago. \n Still, the most curious thing about this race may be that, according to polls by Gallup and Survey Monkey, Clinton and Trump still rank among the worst-rated presidential candidates in American history \u2014 a situation that no celebrity-generated jokes or endorsements seems likely to change. \n ", "author": "By Tribune News Service", "title": "Should celebrities share political views or just 'shut up and sing'?"}

{"date": "August 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this May 17 photo, Sirwan Jalal, director of Mass Graves for the Kurdish Regional Government, points to an image of the site of a mass grave during an interview with the Associated Press in Irbil, northern Iraq. \n KURDISH MASS GRAVES DIRECTORATE VIA AP \n This image released by the the Mass Graves Directorate of the Kurdish Regional Government shows a human skull in a mass grave containing Yazidis killed by Islamic State militants in the Sinjar region of northern Iraq in May 2015. \n HARDAN, Iraq \u00bb Surrounded by smoke and flames, the sound of gunshots echoing around him, the young man crouched in the creek for hours, listening to the men in his family die.  \n On the other side of the mountain, another survivor peered through binoculars as the handcuffed men of neighboring villages were shot and then buried by a waiting bulldozer. For six days he watched as the extremists filled one grave after another with his friends and relatives. \n Between them, the two scenes of horror on Sinjar mountain contain six burial sites and the bodies of more than 100 people, just a small fraction of the mass graves Islamic State extremists have scattered across Iraq and Syria. \n In exclusive interviews, photos and research, The Associated Press has documented and mapped 72 of the mass graves, the most comprehensive survey so far, with many more expected to be uncovered as the Islamic State group's territory shrinks. In Syria, AP has obtained locations for 17 mass graves, including one with the bodies of hundreds of members of a single tribe all but exterminated when IS extremists took over their region. For at least 16 of the Iraqi graves, most in territory too dangerous to excavate, officials do not even guess the number of dead. In others, the estimates are based on memories of traumatized survivors, Islamic State propaganda and what can be gleaned from a cursory look at the earth. Still, even the known victims buried are staggering \u2014 from 5,200 to more than 15,000. \n Sinjar mountain is dotted with mass graves, some in territory clawed back from IS after the group's onslaught against the Yazidi minority in August 2014; others in the deadly no man's land that has yet to be secured. \n The bodies of Talal Murat's father, uncles and cousins lie beneath the rubble of the family farm, awaiting a time when it is safe for surviving relatives to return to the place where the men were gunned down. On Sinjar's other flank, Rasho Qassim drives daily past the graves holding the bodies of his two sons. The road is in territory long since seized back, but the five sites are untouched, roped off and awaiting the money or the political will for excavation, as the evidence they contain is scoured away by the wind and baked by the sun. \n \"We want to take them out of here. There are only bones left. But they said 'No, they have to stay there, a committee will come and exhume them later,'\" said Qassim, standing at the edge of the flimsy fence surrounding one site, where his two sons are buried. \"It has been two years but nobody has come.\" \n IS made no attempt to hide its atrocities. In fact it boasted of them. But proving what United Nations officials and others have described as an ongoing genocide \u2014 and prosecuting those behind it \u2014 will be complicated as the graves deteriorate. \n \"We see clear evidence of the intent to destroy the Yazidi people,\" said Naomi Kikoler, who recently visited the region for the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. \"There's been virtually no effort to systematically document the crimes perpetrated, to preserve the evidence, and to ensure that mass graves are identified and protected.\" \n Then there are the graves still out of reach. The Islamic State group's atrocities extend well outside the Yazidi region in northern Iraq. \n Satellites offer the clearest look at massacres such as the one at Badoush Prison in June 2014 that left 600 male inmates dead. A patch of scraped earth and tire tracks show the likely killing site, according to exclusive photos obtained by the imagery intelligence firm AllSource Analysis. \n Of the 72 mass graves documented by AP, the smallest contains three bodies; the largest is believed to hold thousands, but no one knows for sure. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ALL THEY COULD DO WAS WATCH THE SLAUGHTER  \n On the northern flank of Sinjar mountain, five grave sites ring a desert crossroads. It is here that the young men of Hardan village are buried, under thistles and piles of cracked earth. They were killed in the bloody IS offensive of August 2014. \n Through his binoculars, Arkan Qassem watched it all. His village, Gurmiz, is just up the slope from Hardan, giving a clear view over the plain below. When the jihadis swept over the area, everyone in Gurmiz fled up the mountaintop for refuge. Then Arkan and nine other men returned to their village with light weapons to try to defend their homes. \n Instead, all they could do was watch the slaughter below. Arkan witnessed the militants set up checkpoints, preventing residents from leaving. Women and children were taken away. \n Then the killings began. The first night, Arkan saw the militants line up a group of handcuffed men in the headlights of a bulldozer at an intersection, less than a kilometer (half mile) down the slope from Gurmiz. They gunned the men down, then the bulldozer plowed the earth over their bodies. \n Over six days, Arkan and his comrades watched helplessly as the fighters brought out three more groups of men \u2014 several dozen each, usually with hands bound \u2014 to the crossroads and killed them. He didn't always see what they did with the bodies. One time, he saw them lighting a bonfire, but he couldn't see why. \n Finally, the jihadis brought in artillery and prepared to make an assault on Gurmiz. Arkan and his comrades fled up the mountain to where their families had taken refuge. \n Now, since IS fighters were driven out of the area, the 32-year-old has returned to his home. But he's haunted by the site. As documented by the aid group Yazda, which has mapped the Sinjar sites, the graves are in a rough pentagon flanking the crossroads, largely unprotected. Around one of them is a mesh fence and a wind-battered sign. As Arkan spoke at the site, a shepherd herded his flock nearby. \n \"I have lots of people I know there. Mostly friends and neighbors,\" he said. \"It's very difficult to look at them every day.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \"THIS BODY IS WEARING MY FATHER'S CLOTHES\"  \n As IS fighters swarmed into the Sinjar area in early August 2014, Talal fled his town along with his father, mother, four sisters and younger brother. They and dozens of other men, women and children from his extended clan converged on an uncle's farm outside the town of Tel Azer. They prayed it was remote enough to escape the killings that were already engulfing so many Yazidis. \n It wasn't. \n The jihadis fired at the house from a distance. Then they rolled up in their vehicles and shot one man in the head as they stood in the yard. They surrounded the farmhouse, ordered everyone outside and demanded the impossible: Convert. \n The Yazidi faith, one of the region's oldest, has elements of Christianity and Islam but is distinct. Yazidis worship the Peacock Angel, fallen and forgiven by God under their tradition, and their shrines feature carved images of the birds and references to the sun. Muslim extremists condemned them as \"devil worshippers\" and over the centuries have subjected them to multiple massacres \u2014 72, by the Yazidis' count. \n In its own propaganda, the Islamic State group made clear its intention to wipe out the Yazidi community. In an issue of its online English-language magazine Dabiq, it scolded Muslims for allowing the Yazidis to continue existing, calling their ancient religion a form of paganism. It quoted Quranic verses to justify killing the Yazidis unless they become Muslim. \n Thwarted in their halfhearted attempt at conversions, the fighters separated about 35 teenage girls and young women from the rest, crammed them into a few cars and drove away. The militants herded the older women and young children into the farmhouse and locked the door. \n Then they lined the men and teenaged boys against the wall of the stables \u2014 around 40 in all, including Talal. \n There were too many of them, too bunched up, to efficiently mow down, so the fighters then ordered them to lie on the ground in a row, Talal said. That was when his uncle told him to make a run for it. Talal bolted into his uncle's hayfield, as did several other men. The militants fired at them, and the bullets ignited the hay, dry from the summer sun. The fire covered Talal's escape, and he took shelter in a nearby creek. \n There he hid, listening as the gunmen shot his family to death. He eventually fled toward the mountain, joined by three others who had survived the massacre. Four out of 40. \n Back at the farm, the gunmen eventually left and the women and children emerged, looking around with growing horror. \n Nouri Murat, Talal's mother, found her husband. His body was untouched, but his head was shattered. Her daughters, she said, were confused at first. \"This is strange, this body is wearing my father's clothes,\" one of them said. As Nouri frantically searched around the property for any surviving menfolk, her 9-year-old daughter Rukhan lay down beside her father's corpse. \n Finally, other women persuaded the family to head to the mountain before the Islamic State fighters returned. \n As they began the long walk north, Nouri noticed Rukhan's bloody fist. Fearing her daughter was wounded, she pried open the girl's clenched fingers. Inside were a handful of her father's teeth. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \"THEY DON'T EVEN TRY TO HIDE THEIR CRIMES\"  \n Nearly every area freed from IS control has unmasked new mass graves, like one found by the sports stadium in the Iraqi city of Ramadi. Many of the graves themselves are easy enough to find, most covered with just a thin coating of earth. \n \"They don't even try to hide their crimes,\" said Sirwan Jalal, the director of Iraqi Kurdistan's agency in charge of mass graves. \"They are beheading them, shooting them, running them over in cars, all kinds of killing techniques, and they don't even try to hide it.\" \n No one outside IS has seen the Iraqi ravine where hundreds of Shiite prison inmates were killed point blank and then torched. Satellite images of scraped dirt along the river point to its location, according to Steve Wood of AllSource. His analysts triangulated survivors' accounts and began to systematically search the desert according to their descriptions of that day, June 10, 2014. \n The inmates were separated out by religion, and Shiites were loaded onto trucks, driven for a few kilometers (miles) and forced to line up and count off, according to accounts by 15 survivors gathered by Human Rights Watch. Then they knelt along the edge of the crescent-shaped ravine, according to a report cited by AllSource. \n \"I was number 43. I heard them say '615,' and then one ISIS guy said, 'We're going to eat well tonight.' A man behind us asked, 'Are you ready?' Another person answered 'Yes,' and began shooting at us with a machine-gun. Then they all started to shoot us from behind, going down the row,\" according to the Human Rights Watch account of a survivor identified only as A.S. \n The men survived by pretending to be dead. \n Using their accounts and others, AllSource examined an image from July 17, 2014, that appeared to show the location as described, between a main road and the railway outside Mosul. The bodies are believed to be packed tightly together, side by side in a space approximately the length of two football fields end to end, in what the AllSource analysis described as a \"sardine trench.\" Tire tracks lead to and from the site. \n \"There's actually earth that has been pushed over and actually moved to cover parts of the ravine. As we look across the entire ravine we only see that in this one location,\" said Wood. \"Ultimately there are many, many more sites across Iraq and Syria that have yet to be either forensically exhumed or be able to be detailed and there's quite a bit more research that needs to take place.\" \n The key, Wood said, is having photos to indicate a grave's location taken soon after its creation. \n Justice has been done in at least one IS mass killing \u2014 that of about 1,700 Iraqi soldiers who were forced to lie face-down in a ditch and then machine-gunned at Camp Speicher. On Aug. 21, 36 men convicted in those killings were hanged at Iraq's Nasiriyah prison. \n But justice is likely to be elusive in areas still firmly under IS control, even though the extremists have filmed themselves committing the atrocities. That's the case for a deep natural sinkhole outside Mosul that is now a pit of corpses. In Syria's Raqqa province, thousands of bodies are believed to have been thrown into the giant al-Houta crevasse. \n Conditions in much of Syria remain a mystery. Activists believe there are hundreds of mass graves in IS-controlled areas that can only be explored when fighting stops. By that time, they fear any effort to document the massacres, exhume and identify the remains will become infinitely more complicated. \n Working behind IS lines, local residents have informally documented some mass graves, even partially digging some up. Some of the worst have been found in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour. There, 400 members of the Shueitat tribe were found in one grave, just some of the up to 1,000 members of the tribe believed to have been massacred by IS when the militants took over the area, said Ziad Awad, the editor of an online publication on Deir el-Zour called The Eye of the City who is trying to document the graves. \n In Raqqa province, the bodies of 160 Syrian soldiers, killed when IS overran their base, were found in seven large pits. \n So far, at least 17 mass graves are known, though largely unreachable, in a list put together from AP interviews with activists from Syrian provinces still under IS rule as well as fighters and residents in former IS strongholds. \n \"This is a drop in an ocean of mass graves expected to be discovered in the future in Syria,\" said Awad. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "IS buried thousands in 72 mass graves, AP finds"}

{"date": "August 29, 2016", "text": "UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN VIA AP \n This undated photo provided by the University of Texas at Austin shows the distal radius \u2014 a wrist bone \u2014 of Lucy, a fossil specimen of an early human ancestor, Australopithecus afarensis, undergoing computed tomographic scanning at the university in Austin, Texas. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS / AUG. 2007 \n This file photo shows a three-dimensional model of the early human ancestor, Australopithecus afarensis, known as Lucy, on display at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. It's a scientific estimation of what Lucy may have looked like in life. \n It's the coldest case in science, and it may have just been cracked.  \n Forty years after researchers discovered Lucy, an early human ancestor who lived 3.2 million years ago, scientists think they now know how she died. \n After examining high-resolution CT scans of broken bones in Lucy's right shoulder, as well as the damage to other parts of her skeleton, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin propose that the small hominid's life ended shortly after a catastrophic fall from a great height \u2014 probably from a tree. \n \"What we see is a pattern of fractures that are well documented in cases of people who have suffered a severe fall,\" said John Kappelman, a UT professor of anthropology and geological sciences. \"This wouldn't happen if you just fell over.\" \n In a paper published today in Nature, Kappelman and his colleagues suggest that Lucy tumbled out of a tree, landed hard on her feet and then pitched forward, extending her arms straight out in front of her in a desperate attempt to break her fall. \n The force of the impact of her hands hitting the ground is likely responsible for the debilitating compression fracture in her shoulder, the authors write. But the fall also caused several bones in her body to break and probably lead to severe organ damage. Death would have followed swiftly. \n If their hypothesis is correct, Lucy was likely conscious in the last few moments before she died. \n \"She did exactly what we would do,\" Kappelman said. \"She was trying to save her life.\" \n Lucy was discovered in 1974 by paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson in the Hadar area of central Ethiopia. Johanson and his colleagues named the fossil after the Beatles song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" because it was playing over and over again at their camp the night she was found. \n Part of what made the Lucy find so important was her unusual mix of features. She had relatively short legs and long arms like a chimpanzee, but her wide pelvis indicated that she walked upright. This combination of traits suggests her species, Australopithecus afarensis, may have been a link between modern humans and our tree-living ancestors. \n Lucy was much smaller than modern humans. Although she was probably a full grown adult at the time of her death, she stood just 3 feet 6 inches tall, and weighed about 60 pounds \u2014 about the size of a first-grader. \n Her fossilized remains have been studied by dozens of scientists, but this is the first study to hypothesize how she met her end. Kappelman said that's because for the most part, ancient bones do not reveal how an animal died. \n \"Despite what you see on shows like 'CSI,' skeletons only rarely preserve evidence of death,\" he said. \"If we didn't see those arms sticking out, the argument we make might not be so powerful.\" \n Kappelman's research into Lucy's demise began in 2008, when the Ethiopian government granted him 10 days to scan the preserved parts of her skeleton at the high-resolution CT lab at the University of Texas. \n Previous attempts to peer into the interior of Lucy's bones in the late 1970s had failed because CT scanners at that time were not powerful enough. \n \"Lucy is a fully mineralized fossil, so she's like a rock, and the problem with lower energy CT is that they can't see through rock\" Kappelman said. \"Up until 2008, we had had no data at all on the internal structure of her bones. She was radiographically opaque.\" \n It was while he was scanning her right humerus, the upper arm bone, that Kappelman realized the fractures on the end of the bone closest to the shoulder were unlike anything he'd seen in other fossils. \n Bone by bone, paleoanthropologist John Kappelman pieced together the life and death of Lucy, the most famous fossil of a human ancestor. He concluded that she probably died from injuries suffered in a fall from a tall tree, suggesting that she foraged or nested in trees. \n Ancient fossils often break apart due to geological forces. For example, breaks could be caused by the tremendous pressure of rock that can build up on fossils over time. They can also fracture when shifts in the Earth's crust tear them apart. But Kappelman thought the fissures in Lucy's bones might have a different origin. Perhaps they were due to an injury instead. \n To check his hunch, he called Dr. Stephen Pearce, a friend of a friend and an orthopedic surgeon at the Austin Bone and Joint Clinic. Pearce agreed to take a look at a cast of Lucy's right humerus bone in his medical office. \n \"It looked very distinctly like a proximal fracture we see pretty routinely as orthopedists, usually because of a fall off a ladder or scaffolding, or a car crash,\" Pearce said. \"I'm not an anthropologist, but it certainly looked like the fracture pattern you would see if she fell out of a tree.\" \n Over time, Kappelman showed his cast of the humerus to eight different orthopedic surgeons. All of them said it looked like a four-part proximal humerus fracture that occurs when a person puts out their hands to break a fall. \n \"It wasn't like they were saying, 'It might be this or it could be something else,'\" Kappelman said. \"It was not even a question from their perspective.\" \n But how could the researchers know that the event that caused the bone fractures also caused her death? \n Kappelman and his co-authors argue that the fall could not have occurred much before Lucy died because the bone breaks were clean and showed no sign of healing. \n They also say the injury could not have happened long after death because tiny slivers of bone that broke off in the impact remained in their post-injury position rather than scattering all over the ground. This could only happen if the fibrous tissue that forms a type of skin around the bone had not yet decayed, the authors said. \n \"Kappelman's point is that these slivers of bone can only be accounted for if the fibrous tissue was still there, holding everything in place,\" said Jack Stern, an anatomist and professor emeritus at Stony Brook University in New York who was not involved in the work. \"That argument impressed me.\" \n In addition, the authors describe a series of other devastating fractures in Lucy's left shoulder, right ankle, left knee, pelvis and first rib that are consistent with their great fall hypothesis. \n But not everyone is buying the argument. \n Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University and the man who discovered Lucy more than 40 years ago, said the paper does not provide convincing evidence for how Lucy died. \n \"Tens of thousands of fossils have been recovered by numerous paleontologists and they all show the same kind of bone breakage interpreted by me and my team to be due to geological forces,\" he said. \"Once these bones get interred in the water, sandstone starts building up on top of them and it's a lot of pressure. These forces cause these kind of fractures.\" \n According to Johanson, we will probably never know how Lucy died. \n William Jungers, an anthropologist at Stony Brook who reviewed the paper for Nature, said he also had \"severe doubts\" about the possibility of diagnosing the cause of death in a fossil as old as Lucy. However, Kappelman's argument won him over.  \n \"Virtually every major reservation I had was anticipated or addressed head-on in the review process,\" he said. \"The detailed, comprehensive analysis of her fracture pattern compared to the extensive human clinical literature on skeletal trauma resulting from a rapid 'vertical deceleration event' is especially compelling to me.\" \n Although \"paleo-forensics\" doesn't allow for replication experiments, John Fleagle, an evolutionary biologist at Stony Brook who was not involved in the work, said there may be ways to test Kappelman's hypothesis. \n \"If the bones of antelopes, warthogs and lions show similar bone breakage, it probably wouldn't be due to a fall from a great height,\" he said. \"I look forward to seeing such a study.\" \n Kappelman said he's working on it. \n \"My co-author Dr. Todd and I are currently working up the fossils from Trinil in Java, the site where Homo erectus was first discovered in the 1890s. There are many thousands upon thousands of fossil mammals (including Homo erectus) at this site,\" he said. \"Spoiler alert: Not a single one of these thousands of fossils show any fractures similar to the compressive fractures preserved in Lucy's skeleton.\" \n In the meantime, people with access to a 3-D printer can evaluate the findings presented in the paper for themselves.  \n The Ethiopian National Museum has made a set of 3-D files of Lucy's shoulder and knee available online at eLucy.org that will let users replicate Lucy's bones in the comfort of their homes and classrooms. \n Kappelman said he is looking forward to getting feedback on his findings. \n \"What we presented is a scientific hypothesis, but it doesn't mean we're right,\" he said. \"This is the most famous fossil in the world. I'm curious to hear what other people say about it.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times  \n ", "author": "By Deborah Netburn Los Angeles Times", "title": "Autopsy reveals Lucy probably died after falling from a tree"}

Warrants for his arrest were issued today and he was taken into custody in the courtroom during a hearing regarding lawyer Leonard Feuer's request to cut ties with him. \n Records show Love-Robinson, who had been free on $18,000 bail, later posted another $8,000 in bail and was allowed to leave jail. He's expected to appear in court for an Oct. 5 hearing with his new lawyer. For now, his trial remains set to start Nov. 7. \n Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Krista Marx granted defense attorney Feuer's request to get off the high-profile case, for reasons involving an apparent ethical conflict that were not made public. \n Feuer, who had been working on the case for free since his hiring in late June, told the Sun Sentinel that his removal \"had nothing to do with money.\" \n In a pleading filed last Tuesday, Feuer wrote that he called the Florida Bar Ethics Hotline, which advised he had no option other than halting his representation of Love-Robinson. Feuer indicated the issue came about through no fault of his own, and it became clear that there was an \"incompatibility\" with continuing to represent Love-Robinson and complying with the state's Rules of Professional Conduct for attorneys. \n Two weeks ago, Feuer had won a delay in the scheduling of Love-Robinson's trial, as the attorney was exploring a possible insanity defense. \n Love-Robinson, who's accused of donning a white lab coat and stethoscope and portraying himself as a doctor in a West Palm Beach clinic and on house calls, was ordered by a judge in March to undergo a mental health examination. He has been obtaining treatments since then. \n Feuer asked for, and received, the judge's approval to use $1,563 in public funds to obtain 1,563 pages of treatment records from St. Mary's Medical Center. \n Love-Robinson was arrested Feb. 16 and again on March 1 and charged with: two counts of practicing medicine without a license; two counts of practice of naturopathy without a license; three counts of forgery; two counts of grand theft from a person 65 or older; and three counts of fraudulent use of personal identification information. \n These charges are punishable by up to 70 years in prison. The new charges are grand theft over $20,000, and obtaining property in return for a worthless check, draft or debit card, which combined are punishable by up to 20 years in prison. \n Love-Robinson, of West Palm Beach, was first accused of masquerading as a doctor in January 2015. Then 17, he wore a doctor's coat at St. Mary's Medical Center and peeked in on at least one gynecological exam, according to a West Palm Beach police report. \n Records show that last October he opened a clinic in Boynton Beach but closed it after he was issued a cease-and-desist order that same month from the Florida of Department of Health because he didn't have a medical license. \n State investigators then got a tip that Love-Robinson was again practicing medicine without a license from an office called The New Birth New Life Medical Center in West Palm Beach, according to an arrest report. \n Love-Robinson was presenting himself as a licensed physician and had employees, but no one there was licensed to diagnose and treat patients, the report said. He was arrested in February after allegedly conducting a physical examination of a female undercover officer, who came to his office complaining of feeling sick. \n Love-Robinson allegedly told the officer, with the Palm Beach Narcotics Task Force, that he was a \"doctor of homeopathic medicine\" and a health care practitioner specializing in all-natural treatments. He also said he had an \"MD\" on staff to prescribe antibiotics for other physical ailments, the arrest report said. \n Among the second set of charges, Love-Robinson was accused of stealing personal checks from Anita Morrison, an 86-year-old West Palm Beach woman he visited several times concerning severe intestinal pain.  \n Officials say Love-Robinson tapped Morrison's checking account to make $34,504 in payments for his personal auto loans and credit cards. He's also accused of forging three checks totaling $2,794. \n Because of Morrison's \"deteriorating\" condition, her testimony has been preserved on video in case she is not well enough to take the witness stand. \n Morrison has told investigators she found Love-Robinson last December during a search for doctors using natural therapies. During one house call, she said, Love-Robinson called for an ambulance when she became too sick.  \n Morrison told detectives Love-Robinson recommended against bringing her keys and purse to the hospital so she gave them to him and asked that he lock up her home. The woman said she later discovered her bank account was empty when she tried to complete a routine transaction, records show. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)  \n ", "author": "By Marc Freeman Sun Sentinel", "title": "Accused teen 'doctor' arrested on new theft charges"}

Bills was sentenced to 10 years. \n CHICAGO \u00bb John Bills, the central figure in a massive corruption scheme at Chicago City Hall, was sentenced to 10 years in prison today for taking up to $2 million in bribes and gifts in return for steering tens of millions of dollars in red light camera contracts to an Arizona company. \n The sentence came moments after Bills choked up in a packed federal courtroom and apologized for his actions and the shame it brought to his family. \n Bills, 55, who rose through City Hall as part of the political patronage army of longtime House Speaker Michael Madigan, faced up to 30 years in prison for personally profiting in exchange for helping grow the city's $600 million red-light camera program into the largest in the nation. \n The scheme was first exposed by the Chicago Tribune in 2012. \n Standing with his hands braced on the lectern, Bills had to stop himself several times when he became emotional as he addressed U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall. He said he is still trying to come to terms with how he threw away a good job that provided for his family and promised a steady pension. \n \"I lost all of that,\" Bills said as his wife and children watched from the front row of the courtroom gallery. \"It's all gone. It's all gone because I fell at the finish line.\" \n Bills acknowledged in his statement that his \"broken moral compass\" had caused him to commit \"immoral\" acts, but he denied being a \"power broker or mastermind\" of any criminal scheme. \n \"Your honor, that is not the truth,\" Bills said. \"I was a midlevel manager who was directed by my superiors and given a responsibility that I obviously wasn't prepared for.\" \n Bills said he was unable to navigate what was a \"broken city contracting process\" and was under \"intense pressure to begin and expand\" the red-light camera program. \n Bills said that despite a potentially long prison sentence, his renewed faith in God has helped him realize his life \"is not falling apart, it's falling into place.\" \n In handing down the sentence, Kendall called Bills' 10-year corruption scheme \"a huge setback for the rule of law in the city of Chicago.\" \n Kendall said corruption erodes the public's trust in government and that it takes years to build it back up. \n \"It's like an arrow in your quiver \u2014 once you shoot it, it's gone forever,\" she said. \n Prosecutors had argued that Bills deserved at least 10 years in prison, while his lawyer emphasized that Bills' wrongdoing didn't rank with that of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. \n \"Mr. Bills is not ex-Gov. Blagojevich,\" Bills lawyer, Nishay Sanan, said in reference to Blagojevich's 14-year prison term. \"He's not selling Senate seats.\" \n U.S. Attorney Zachary Fardon, who led the prosecution of Bills, urged Kendall to send a message with her sentence. \n \"Chicago officials need to know that if they choose a path of corruption, the end of that path is a prison cell,\" Fardon said. \n The probation office recommended to the judge that Bills be given a 10-year prison term. \n A federal jury convicted Bills in January on all 20 counts, including bribery, conspiracy, extortion and fraud after deliberating for only five hours. \n Sanan had portrayed Bills at trial as a fall guy but provided scant evidence as he tried to spread blame for the conspiracy on a phalanx of well-connected lobbyists and Bills' elected bosses, including such political luminaries as Madigan himself and former Mayor Richard Daley. \n But even as Sanan publicly argued before jurors that Madigan and Daley were really to blame, Bills was still quietly standing firm in his refusal to cooperate with federal prosecutors looking to expand their investigation. \n Fardon's office has repeatedly asked Bills to finger other potential conspirators in exchange for leniency, according to Sanan, who said the most recent request came soon after Bills' conviction in January. \n \"It has always been his contention that he has no evidence to offer them,\" Sanan said. \n In its sentencing memorandum, the prosecution team \u2014 led by Fardon himself \u2014 suggested Bills deserved to go to prison for 20 to 30 years based on the massive amount of the bribes, his lack of remorse, violation of public trust and leadership role in the decadelong conspiracy. \n \"To this day, defendant refuses to acknowledge his culpability, instead continuing to deflect and heave blame on others despite the mountain of evidence introduced at trial against him,\" wrote Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Storino. \"Chicago has a long, sad history with public corruption. Bills now stands tall in a long line of greedy officials who have carved that tragic history.\" \n Sanan sought a sentence of three to four years in prison for Bills. In court papers, he argued that Bills was never a leader of the conspiracy and that the size of the scheme should be limited only to the value of those payments and gifts Bills acknowledges accepting, about $42,900, not the more than $2 million in bribes. \n During the two-week trial, jurors heard evidence about how Bills rose through the ranks at City Hall as a top Madigan precinct captain and political operative, eventually becoming the No. 2 manager in the Chicago Department of Transportation during then-Mayor Daley's administration. \n According to testimony, Bills began scheming almost immediately after he was handed the responsibility of overseeing the red-light camera pilot project, hatching a plot to steer traffic camera contracts to Redflex Traffic Systems Inc., an Arizona-based firm. \n Bills manipulated the process to ensure Redflex won the contract, orchestrated votes and met with Daley and Madigan in his efforts to promote the company's agenda. He coached the company's executives before their meetings with other city officials and advised them about which lobbyists to hire, what politicians to court and to whom to make political contributions. \n In return, Redflex showered Bills with more than $560,000 in cash bribes, including up to $2,000 for each of the 384 red-light cameras installed under his watch. The company also lavished hundreds of thousands of dollars more in gifts \u2014 including car, a condominium, lavish hotel stays and vacations. \n All the while, Bills was working to expand the program to include speed and school bus cameras, all in an effort to sweeten his own deal, according to testimony at the trial.  \n When Bills retired from the city in 2011, he went to work in Chicago for a Redflex consultant, Greg Goldner, a former campaign manager to both Daley and Mayor Rahm Emanuel. According to testimony, Redflex was paying Goldner to keep Bills on the payroll. \n Karen Finley, the former Redflex chief executive officer, pleaded guilty to her role in the conspiracy and testified for the government at Bills' trial. She is set to be sentenced in November. Martin O'Malley, a former Chicago consultant for Redflex who testified that he acted as Bills' bagman, is set to be sentenced next month. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Chicago Tribune  \n ", "author": "By David Kidwell Chicago Tribune", "title": "Figure in Chicago traffic cameras scandal admits 'immoral' acts, gets 10 years"}

{"date": "August 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Reports of a gunman opening fire that turned out to be false caused panicked evacuations at Los Angeles International Airport on Sunday night, while flights to and from the airport were delayed. \n LOS ANGELES >> In the moments before reports of gunshots created a panic at the Los Angeles airport, police with weapons drawn had confronted a masked man outside a terminal who was carrying a plastic sword and dressed like Zorro. \n Authorities have now determined that there were no gunshots. The only people at the airport with guns Sunday night were officers, but false reports of an active shooter triggered a ripple of chaos that sent frantic travelers racing into the streets and onto the tarmac. \n As police tried Monday to sort out the disruption, experts said the incident \u2014 the second of its kind at a major U.S. airport in two weeks \u2014 highlights one of the challenges faced by airports at a time of terrorism and frequent unsubstantiated reports. \n \"You can't always avoid them, and when they occur you need to respond as if it's a legitimate attack every single time,\" said Anthony Roman, who runs a security consulting firm in Lynbrook, New York. \"There are false alarms. There are pranksters who pull fire alarms, and we evacuate right away because we're all terrified of fire.\" \n Investigators were focusing on what prompted the first of several 911 calls from multiple terminals, airport police officer Rob Pedregon said. The initial call came from Terminal 8 around 8:45 p.m. \u2014 about five minutes after officers detained the man dressed as Zorro. \n Police found no connection between the call and the man in the costume. They were investigating a report of loud noises that spurred the first call, Pedregon said. \n What followed was pandemonium similar to an incident two weeks ago at JFK Airport in New York when a raucous celebration of an Olympics victory may have led to noises people believed were shots. The chain reaction turned into a panic as crowds bolted. \n On Sunday, active shooter reports quickly spread on social media and word-of-mouth, and passengers in five terminals fled or pushed through security checkpoints, airport police said. \n \"We were on the jetway, and someone starts pushing behind us,\" Jon Landis, a sales representative from Boston who was boarding a flight home, told The Associated Press. \"One man was frantic, saying there was a shooter.\" \n Police officers, including one with a shotgun, eventually led passengers out of the terminal, through a security gate and into a parking lot, where several hundred people waited. \n The scare created a mess, with three terminals shut down, roads closed and flights held in the air and on the ground, but no one was hurt. About 280 flights were delayed, at least 27 planes diverted and two flights canceled, airport spokeswoman Nancy Castles said. \n Officers with rifles stormed the airport but uncovered no evidence of a gunman or shots fired. \n With deadly terrorist bombings at airports in Brussels and Turkey this year, it's understandable that travelers are jittery. And LAX is no stranger to violence. A lone gunman shot and killed a Transportation Security Administration screening agent and wounded three other people in 2013. \n \"It doesn't take much for people to go into a panic mode and not think,\" said Douglas R. Laird, the former director of security for Northwest Airlines and a consultant to airports and airlines. \n \"You can't blame the police because they think something is happening. So you want to go in with your guns drawn, but that adds fuel to the fire.\" \n Kenny Stavert, an opera singer from Houston, said the chaos began after he noticed the man dressed as Zorro at the baggage claim. He said he was nonthreatening and posed for pictures and hugged a woman before walking outside the terminal, where he was confronted by police. \n \"Once people started running, bags were slamming to the ground, people were falling down,\" Stavert said. \"There was so much chaos you couldn't tell if people were falling down because they were shot.\" \n He said rumors about an active shooter spread quickly as people turned to their phones for answers. Police and airport personnel hustled Stavert and others from the scene and told them to drop to the floor when they were deeper into the airport. \n Isaac Yeffet, former head of security for El Al Israel Airlines who runs his own firm, Yeffet Security Consultants, said the root of the problem is weak airport security in the U.S. He cited a 2015 inspector general report from the Homeland Security Department that found in 67 out of 70 tests across the nation, TSA screeners failed to find mock weapons and explosives. \n \"When you don't have security, don't be surprised that somebody can drive you crazy with a false alarm,\" Yeffet said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Airport scare hard to avoid with cascade of false reports"}

But what do you do when you're not ready and the storm is upon you? Here are some dos and don'ts. \n >> DO fill your tub(s) with water. If the water is shut off, you don't have to give up using your toilet. Fill the back tank of your toilet and flush as needed. \n >> DO charge your phone. You should have some time between the warning and a power outage. \n >> DO sign up for emergency alerts. Your cell phone may be your only avenue for updates regarding the storm. Sign up at nixle.com. \n >> DO protect electronics. Guard TVs and computers from water damage by covering them with plastic bags. Turn off and unplug any unnecessary electrical equipment to keep them safe from power surges. \n >> DO pack your fridge and freezer. A tightly packed space stays better insulated than an empty one. Fill in the gaps with containers of water and turn the thermostat to the coldest setting. \n >> DON'T drive unless it is an absolute emergency. With hurricanes come flying debris and flooded roads. This does not mean you should stay if you are in an evacuation zone. If local authorities direct you to evacuate, follow instructions and proceed with caution. \n >> DON'T open a window. It's a common belief that a cracked window will relieve the pressure in a home, but it's not true. In fact, windows can actually cause more damage when opened. An open window allows wind to enter the home. The wind must exit somewhere, which often results in a roof or ceiling being blown off. \n >> DON'T make phone calls unless it is an absolute emergency. If you need to contact someone, choose a text over a phone call when possible. Texting uses less power than a phone call and may go through more reliably when lines are busy. \n >> DON'T be fooled when the eye of the storm passes.

{"date": "August 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke on Aug. 27 in Des Moines, Iowa. \n JERSEY CITY, N.J. \u00bb It's been the driving issue of Donald Trump's campaign. Build a wall along the southern border. Make Mexico pay for it. And expel everyone living in the U.S. illegally with the help of a \"deportation force.\" \n Ten weeks before the election, however, buffeted by conflicting advice from aides and advisers, Trump has seemed to be in full indecision mode. \n At a Fox News town hall tall taping last week, in the face of pressing questions, he proceeded to poll the audience at length on the fate of an estimated 11 million people. \n Trump is now planning a major speech on Wednesday, during which he's expected to finally clarify his stance. Supporters are hoping for a strong, decisive showing. But for critics, many already disposed to vote against him, his wavering on what has been his signature issue, seems like a warning that he's unable to handle a central element of any president's job \u2014 making decisions. \n It also underscores how little his Republican campaign has invested in the nitty gritty of outlining what he would do as president, especially when compared with the more detailed plans of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. \n \"It's just puzzling,\" said Lanhee Chen, who has served as a policy adviser to several Republican presidential candidates. \"This is the issue on which he rose to prominence in the primary and the issue on which he continues to stake much of his campaign.\" \n From the start, Trump has never been the kind of candidate to pore over thick policy books. \n Indeed, he has mocked Clinton on the subject. \n \"She's got people that sit in cubicles writing policy all day. Nothing's ever going to happen. It's just a waste of paper,\" he told Time Magazine in June. \"My voters don't care and the public doesn't care. They know you're going to do a good job once you're there.\" \n To date, Trump's campaign has posted just seven policy proposals on his website. There are 38 on Clinton's site, ranging from efforts to cure Alzheimer's disease to Wall Street and criminal justice reform. \n \"I've laid out the best I could, the specific plans and ideas that I want to pursue as your president because I have this old-fashioned idea,\" Clinton said during a recent speech in Colorado. \"When you run for president, you ought to tell people what you want to do as their president.\" \n Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, has said she's pushing her boss to get more specific. Yet his positions on a host of issues remain vague at best. \n For example, while Trump has slammed the Common Core education standards and touts the benefits of local control of education, he has no formal, detailed plans for improving public schools. He talks about student loan debt and the increasing costs of higher education, but has yet to propose solutions. He has teased plans to make childcare more affordable, but has missed his own deadline for unveiling them. \n Until recently, however, there has been no doubt about where Trump stood on illegal immigration. The wall was going up \u2014 Mexico would have to pay \u2014 and those estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally were going to have to leave. \n But over the summer, Trump began suggesting in closed-door conversations with Hispanic leaders that he might be open to softening his stance. On August 20, he convened a closed-door round table of Hispanic lawmakers and business leaders, and left some with the same impression. The day after, campaign manager Conway said his position on deportations was \"To be determined.\" \n Trump's supporters say questions about his recent waffling are overblown. His running mate, Mike Pence, describes him as \"a CEO at work\" as he consults with various stakeholders. \n \"You see someone who is engaging the American people, listening to the American people,\" Pence told CNN on Sunday. \"He is hearing from all sides.\" \n But Stephen Moore, a conservative economist who has worked with Trump to shape his tax and economic plans, says the vagueness on policies is also by design. \n \"We want to talk about the big visionary stuff. We don't want to have a big debate about this loophole, that loophole,\" he said. \"This is a campaign, it's not a write-up of a tax bill in the Ways and Means Committee.\" \n Ari Fleischer, a White House press secretary under George W. Bush, says the confusion that now exists about Trump's plans for immigration underscores \"the risk in electing someone whose candidacy is based on his personality and image, as opposed his experience and policy knowledge.\" \n While a Trump could succeed as president as a \"big picture, set the tone, drive the direction and move the government\" kind of leader, Flesher said that would require him to surround himself with a knowledgeable and capable staff. \n \"But the lesson in how he's run his campaign \u2014 and frankly in how he's run his businesses \u2014 doesn't give you confidence that he would surround himself with a lot of capable people,\" he said. \n In addition, Chen said that a President Trump arriving at the White House without detailed plans could be limited in how much he might achieve. \n \"If you're not able to hit the ground running, chances are you're going to run into serious resistance if you sit there studying something for the first 100 days,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Suddenly unsure on immigration, Trump trying to clear it up"}

{"date": "August 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The FBI is warning state officials to boost their election security in light of evidence that hackers breached the election systems of a pair of states. \n NEW YORK >> The FBI is warning state officials to boost their election security in light of evidence that hackers targeted related data systems in two states. \n In a confidential \"flash\" alert from its cyber division, first reported by Yahoo News and posted online by others, the FBI said it's investigating the pair of incidents and advised states to scan their systems for specific signs of hacking. \n The FBI said Monday that it doesn't comment on specific alerts, but added that it routinely sends out advisories to private industry about signs of cyber threats that it comes across in its investigations. \n The FBI didn't name the states that were targeted, but it described a \"compromise\" of one elections board website and \"attempted intrusion activities\" in another state's system. State election websites in Illinois and Arizona experienced hack-related shutdowns earlier this summer. In both cases, the parts of the websites affected involved online voter registration. \n The FBI's Aug. 18 warning also came just days after Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson hosted a call with secretaries of state and other state election officials to talk about cybersecurity and election infrastructure. \n In that call, Johnson said that while DHS isn't aware of any particular cyber threat against election-related computers, it's \"critically important\" to make sure that election systems are secure amid a rapidly changing threat landscape, according to a DHS summary of the call. \n In the Arizona case, the FBI notified state officials in June about what the agency called a \"critical threat\" to the state's voter registration system, which shut down on June 28, according to Matt Roberts, a spokesman for the secretary of state's office. \n A county worker had downloaded a piece of malware that exposed their access credential and password, which then wound up online, Roberts said. A forensic examination of the state database found no evidence of unauthorized access. \n Roberts said he's not positive the new FBI's \"flash alert\" refers to Arizona, but said it appears likely. The system came back online on July 7 with new security features. \n Federal officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the possibility that hackers, particularly those working for Russia or another country, could breach U.S. elections systems and wreak havoc on the November presidential election. \n Some experts, along with Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign, believe that Russia was behind the embarrassing email hack of the Democratic National Committee right before its national convention last month. The hacked emails showed an apparent lack of neutrality in the primary race between Clinton and Bernie Sanders, with some party officials disparaging Sanders. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "FBI warns of possible state election-system hacks"}

It says only 235 have asked to stay out of the settlement and pursue legal action on their own. Another 110 objections to the settlement were filed. \n U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer has given the $15 billion settlement preliminary approval, with a final decision expected Oct. 18. \n Terms call for the German carmaker to spend up to $10 billion buying back or repairing Volkswagen and Audi 2-liter vehicles and paying owners another $5,100 to $10,000 each. \n The motion was filed late Friday by Elizabeth Cabraser, the lead attorney in the class-action settlement. It says the number of owners who signed up for settlements, about 44 percent, was \"a noteworthy level of participation in a program whose claims deadline does not occur until September 2018.\" \n Owners have until Sept. 16 of this year to opt out of the settlement. \n The Federal Trade Commission, which sued Volkswagen along with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department, came out in support of the settlement on Friday. The agency, which had contended that VW deceived buyers through false advertising, says the settlement is fair because it gives owners the value of their cars before the scandal became public last Sept. 18.

Groups such as Proactiva Open Arms and Doctors Without Borders helped take on some 3,000 people who had been travelling in some 20 small wooden boats. \n In images and video by The Associated Press, migrants from Eritrea and Somalia cheered as the rescue boats arrived, with some jumping into the water and swimming toward them while others carefully carried babies onto the rescue ships. \n Their boats too weak and technically unequipped for a voyage across the stretch of the Mediterranean to the shores of Italy, the migrants had set off with a bit of gasoline in the overcrowded vessels, hoping to make it at least 15-20 miles out to sea and reach awaiting rescuers. \n Tens of thousands of Africans take the dangerous Mediterranean Sea route as a gateway to a better life in Europe, alongside those fleeing wars from Syria to Afghanistan. \n Libya's chaos and lack of border controls have made it into a transit route. Since the 2011 ouster and killing of longtime Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, the country has sunk into lawlessness, facing a myriad of militias vying for influence and an emerging Islamic State affiliate. \n In June, the European Union expanded its anti-smuggling operation in the central Mediterranean to include training Libyan coastal and naval forces, which are intercepting boats and returning migrants to Libya, where some are being held in abusive conditions. \n Rights groups and experts estimate that there are about 3,500 migrants held in roughly 20 official detention facilities across Libya.

{"date": "August 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this photo taken Nov. 30, 2015, President Barack Obama meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Le Bourget, France. \n WASHINGTON >> President Barack Obama faces thorny talks about the fight against the Islamic State group, climate change and human rights when he sets off this week across the Pacific for an eight-day valedictory tour through Asia. \n Obama is to leave Wednesday to attend back-to-back summits in Hangzhou, China, and Vientiane, Laos. Coming five months from the end of Obama's term, the White House has planned the trip as a moment to highlight his administration's seven-year effort to expand U.S. influence Asia, including his push for massive free-trade and a landmark climate agreement with China. \n White House officials said Obama will underscore the message even before leaving the U.S., heading first to Lake Tahoe for a series meetings on conservation and then on to Hawaii's remote Midway Atoll, where Obama recently expanded the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. \n The White House said Monday that Obama's stop will come with announcements of new executive actions aimed at boosting clean energy production in the U.S. and mitigating the effect of climate change such as wildfires and drought. \n Obama will keep up the drumbeat in China, where he is attending a meeting of the Group of 20 industrial and emerging-market economies. Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to offer an update on the nation's progress toward ratifying the Paris agreement. White House officials have said they hope the historic climate change pact could enter into force by the end of the year. \n But Obama's climate change agenda will only be part of his busy agenda. Obama will sit down Sunday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the first meeting since a failed summer coup added new tensions to an already complex relationship. \n Obama and Erdogan are slated to discuss the recent clashes between Turkish troops and Kurdish forces in northern Syria. The U.S. has criticized Turkey, a NATO ally, for the assault, saying the conflict distracts from the fight against the Islamic State group. Erdogan has said he plans to continue the operations until the Kurdish forces no longer pose a security threat to Ankara. \n The meeting also comes as Turkey is pressing the U.S. to extradite a U.S.-based Muslim cleric it blames for the July coup. U.S. officials have pleaded for patience as the legal process unwinds, but the U.S. is clearly under pressure to move quickly. \n Obama's schedule also includes a visit with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, whose bloody anti-drug campaign has drawn criticism from human rights activists. The president plans to raise those concerns with the new leader, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Monday. \n Rhodes said Obama will use the trip to make the case for this Trans-Pacific free-trade agreement, a massive multination deal that has stalled out in Congress amid fierce election-year opposition from both Democrats and Republicans. \n As a centerpiece of Obama's Asia policy, the agreement is seen as a \"litmus for U.S. leadership,\" Rhodes said. \n \"It's also seen as a demonstration of America's commitment to be a Pacific power. And we would be stepping back from that leadership role, we would be ceding the region to countries like China who do not set the same types of high standards for trade agreements\" if the U.S. does not follow through with TPP, he said. \n While in Asia, Obama will also pay the first visit by a sitting U.S. president to Laos, where he'll see both the president and prime minister. Ahead of the visit, the White House acknowledged the \"very difficult history\" between the countries, alluding to the roughly 270 million cluster bombs the U.S. dropped on Laos in the \"secret war\" during the Vietnam War. Obama is expected to announce new steps to help clear unexploded ordinance from Laos. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama to juggle security, climate, rights on final Asia trip"}

{"date": "August 29, 2016", "text": "Foster parents will see a boost in the amount the state pays them to care for foster children under a settlement announced today that's expected to resolve a federal class action lawsuit and related case filed in state court in which parents claimed that state stipends were woefully inadequate to cover the basic expenses of the foster children they were caring for. \n The class action lawsuit was filed against Hawaii's Department of Human Services in December 2013 by foster parent Raynette Ah Chong on behalf of more than 1,000 foster parents in Hawaii. \n When the lawsuit was filed, foster parents were provided with a monthly stipend of $529, which was intended to cover all the costs of caring for a foster child, according to a press release from the Hawaii Appleseed Center for Law and Economic Justice; Honolulu's Alston Hunt Floyd and Ing and global firm Morrison Foerster, law firms representing the foster parents. \n That rate remained in place for 24 years, even though applying inflation would have increased that amount to $950 per month. \n Six months after the lawsuit was filed, DHS increased the stipend to $576 for children aged newborn to five years-old; $650 for ages six to 11; and $676 for ages 12 and up, even though the agency had previously claimed that there were insufficient funds within the state budget to increase the stipends, according to the press release. \n Under the terms of the settlement, the payments will increase to $649 for children aged newborn to five years-old; $742 for ages six to 11; and $776 for ages 12 and up. \n The annual clothing allowance will increase by between $210 to $426, depending on the age of the child. \n DHS has agreed to pay a separate payment of $35 per month to foster parents for each child they were caring for between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2014. \n The increases are expected to cost the state an extra $8.5 million annually. \n The settlement will remain in place for 10 years, during which time DHS has agreed to pursue adjustments to account for inflation. \n \"This means so much to the keiki in the foster system and the families that care for them,\" said Ah Chong, who has been a foster care provider for 20 years, in a statement. \"Over the time I've been a foster parent, it has gotten more and more expensive to provide for the keiki that come to my family, and we have had to make difficult financial trade-offs that affected my own kids. We are so grateful to have more support to help the keiki and make their lives better.\" \n The agreement is subject to court approval and the funding for the settlement still needs to be appropriated by the Legislature. \n \"Foster parents make extraordinary sacrifices to care for some of the state's most vulnerable and disadvantaged children,\" said attorney A.C. Johnston of Morrison and Foerster, in the news release. \"They give their homes, their time and their hearts to make these children a part of their families.

{"date": "August 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Actor Gene Wilder listened as he was introduced to receive the Governor's Awards for Excellence in Culture and Tourism at the Legislative Office Building in Hartford, Conn. in April 2008. Wilder, who starred in such film classics as \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" and \"Young Frankenstein\" has died. He was 83. \n Gene Wilder, the frizzy-haired actor who brought his deft comedic touch to such unforgettable roles as the neurotic accountant in \"The Producers\" and the mad scientist of \"Young Frankenstein,\" has died. He was 83. \n Wilder's nephew said Monday that the actor and writer died late Sunday at his home in Stamford, Connecticut, of complications from Alzheimer's disease. No funeral arrangements have been announced. \n Jordan Walker-Pearlman said in a statement that Wilder was diagnosed with the disease three years ago, but kept the condition private so as not to disappoint fans. \n Wilder started his acting career on the stage, but millions knew him from his work in the movies, especially his collaborations with Mel Brooks on \"The Producers,\" \"Blazing Saddles\" and \"Young Frankenstein.\" The last film \u2014 with Wilder playing a California-born descendant of the mad scientist, insisting that his name is pronounced \"Frahn-ken-SHTEEN\" \u2014 was co-written by Brooks and Wilder and earned the pair an Oscar nomination for adapted screenplay. \n \"Gene Wilder, one of the truly great talents of our time, is gone,\" Brooks wrote in a statement Monday. \"He blessed every film we did together with his special magic and he blessed my life with his friendship. He will be so missed.\" \n With his unkempt hair and big, buggy eyes, Wilder was a master at playing panicked characters caught up in schemes that only a madman such as Brooks could devise, whether reviving a monster in \"Young Frankenstein\" or bilking Broadway in \"The Producers.\" Brooks would call him \"God's perfect prey, the victim in all of us.\" \n But he also knew how to keep it cool as the boozing gunslinger in \"Blazing Saddles\" or the charming candy man in the children's favorite \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\" His craziest role: the therapist having an affair with a sheep in Woody Allen's \"Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex.\" \n Tweeted Jim Carrey: \"Gene Wilder was one of the funniest and sweetest energies ever to take a human form. If there's a heaven he has a Golden Ticket.\" \n Cloris Leachman, Wilder's \"Young Frankenstein\" co-star, tweeted, \"Oh, Gene, it's too soon!\" \n Wilder was close friends with Richard Pryor and their contrasting personas \u2014 Wilder uptight, Pryor loose \u2014 were ideal for comedy. They co-starred in four films: \"Silver Streak,\" \"Stir Crazy,\" \"See No Evil, Hear No Evil\" and \"Another You.\" And they created several memorable scenes, particularly when Pryor provided Wilder with directions on how to \"act black\" as they tried to avoid police in \"Silver Streak.\" \n But Wilder would insist he was no comedian. He told Robert Osborne in a 2013 interview that it was the biggest misconception about him. \n \"What a comic, what a funny guy, all that stuff! And I'm not. I'm really not. Except in a comedy in films,\" Wilder said. \"But I make my wife laugh once or twice in the house, but nothing special. But when people see me in a movie and it's funny then they stop and say things to me about 'how funny you were.' But I don't think I'm that funny. I think I can be in the movies.\" \n A Milwaukee native, Wilder was born Jerome Silberman on June 11, 1933. When he was 6, his mother suffered a heart attack that left her a semi-invalid. He soon began improvising comedy skits to entertain her, the first indication of his future career. \n He started taking acting classes at age 12. In 1961, he became a member of Lee Strasberg's prestigious Actor's Studio in Manhattan. \n That same year, he made both his off-Broadway and Broadway debuts using the stage name Gene Wilder. He won the Clarence Derwent Award, given to promising newcomers, for the Broadway work in Graham Greene's comedy \"The Complaisant Lover.\" \n A key break came in 1963 when he co-starred with Anne Bancroft in Bertolt Brecht's \"Mother Courage,\" and met Brooks, her future husband. \n Brooks cast Wilder in \"The Producers\" as Leo Bloom, an accountant who discovers the liberating joys of greed and corruption as he and Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) conceive a Broadway flop titled \"Springtime For Hitler\" and plan to flee with the money raised for the show's production. Wilder's performance received a supporting actor Oscar nod. \n Before starring in \"The Producers,\" he had a small role as the hostage of gangsters in the 1967 classic \"Bonnie and Clyde.\" He peaked in the mid-1970s with the twin Brooks hits \"Blazing Saddles\" and \"Young Frankenstein.\" \n Wilder went on to write several screenplays and direct five features, including \"The Woman in Red\" and \"Haunted Honeymoon,\" in which he co-starred with his third wife, Gilda Radner. The two met while making the 1982 film \"Hanky-Panky\" and married in 1984. \n After Radner died of ovarian cancer in 1989, Wilder spent much of his time after promoting cancer research and opened a support facility for cancer patients.

{"date": "August 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A police officer stood guard as passengers waited in line at Terminal 7 in Los Angeles International Airport on Sunday. \n LOS ANGELES \u00bb A false report of gunshots that sent panicked travelers fleeing from Los Angeles International Airport came right after officers with weapons drawn detained a masked man dressed in black and possibly carrying a plastic sword, officials said. \n Soon after, hundreds of passengers raced onto streets or the tarmac, causing major flight delays that the airport was still recovering from today. Video shows at least six officers confronting the man dressed as the fictional crime fighter Zorro outside Terminal 7 around 8:40 p.m. Sunday. \n False reports of an active shooter quickly spread, and passengers in five terminals evacuated or pushed through security checkpoints, airport police said. \n Officers with rifles stormed the airport but uncovered no evidence of a gunman or shots fired. \n The confusion was similar to a false alarm that led to a panicked evacuation two weeks ago at Kennedy Airport in New York, when a boisterous celebration of the Olympics may have been misinterpreted as gunfire, according to authorities. \n The Los Angeles scare created a mess, with three terminals shut down, roads closed and flights held in the air and on the ground, but no one was hurt. About 280 flights were delayed, and at least 27 planes were diverted to other airports. Two flights were canceled, airport spokeswoman Nancy Castles said. \n Sam Macon of Los Angeles was waiting for his bag when he noticed the man dressed as Zorro walk past. He followed the man outside to snap a photo. That's when Macon saw police with guns drawn \"snaking their way through the crowd\" toward the man in the costume. \n He said police and airport personnel began yelling at people to get back, while the masked man sat calmly on the bench. Macon filmed as police asked the man to get on the ground then handcuffed him. The panic started soon afterward, he said. \n \"Lots of crying, yells and misinformation traveling rapidly,\" he said in an email to The Associated Press. Macon said he was fairly certain the whole time that it was a case of mass hysteria. \n Vehicle traffic was flowing again on the upper departure level during this morning rush hour, but cars backed up on the lower arrival area, Castles said. \n All terminals and roads into the airport reopened by 11 p.m., about two hours after the initial reports, officials said. Besides traffic, travelers faced a massive backup in security lines because those who fled had to be rescreened through security. \n \"We were on the jetway, and someone starts pushing behind us,\" Jon Landis, a sales representative from Boston who was boarding a flight home, told The Associated Press. \"One man was frantic, saying there was a shooter.\" \n Police officers, including one with a shotgun, eventually led passengers out of the terminal, through a security gate and into a parking lot, where several hundred people waited. Ninety minutes after the scare, Landis said he was still waiting for word on his flight. \n Scott McDonald said he was getting off a plane in the middle of the chaos and the crew told him to get back on. Looking out the window, he said he could see many evacuees gathered on the tarmac, a strange sight even for someone who travels constantly. \n \"I've never seen passengers, just normal people, on the tarmac anywhere in the United States,\" McDonald told Los Angeles news station KCAL-TV. \n Douglas Lee, who was traveling home to Albuquerque, New Mexico, with his wife and son, said the greatest danger was being trampled. \n \"You can imagine hundreds of adults trying to go through an exit door,\" he said. \n At one point, he picked up his young son and left their luggage. Abandoned bags littered sidewalks as people fled. \n Corey Rosenbusch was relaxing inside a terminal club during a layover between his home in Washington, D.C., and Sydney when the lights went off and the staff told everyone to shelter in place. \n \"People immediately started looking at social media, where they saw reports that there was an active shooter,\" Rosenbusch told the AP. \n He said several officers, including some with assault rifles, led the group out of the area. \n The false alarm came as police investigate whether a raucous celebration Aug. 14 at JFK Airport led to noises people believed were shots. The ensuing chain reaction turned into a panic as crowds ran to evacuate. \n The Los Angeles airport had an actual shooting in November 2013, when a man opened fire in the terminal, killing a security agent and wounding three other people. \n Associated Press writers Justin Pritchard and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles and Alina Hartounian in Phoenix contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police detain man dressed as Zorro just before LAX panic"}

Abedin said today that she is separating from her husband, Anthony Weiner, after the former congressman was accused in yet another sexting scandal. \n NEW YORK \u00bb Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin is done playing the good wife to Anthony Weiner, announcing today she is leaving the serially sexting ex-congressman after he was accused of sending raunchy photos and messages to yet another woman. \n Abedin, who as vice chair of Clinton's campaign is destined for big things if the Democrat is elected president, stayed with Weiner after a sexting scandal led him to resign from Congress in 2011 and after a new outbreak of online misbehavior wrecked his bid for New York mayor in 2013. She didn't leave even when a recent documentary blew up tense moments in their marriage to big-screen proportions. \n But today, she effectively declared she had had enough. \n \"After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,\" she said in a statement issued by the campaign. \"Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life.\" \n The New York Post published photos late Sunday that it said Weiner had sent last year to a woman identified only as a \"40-something divorcee\" who lives in the West and supports Republican Donald Trump. The photos included two close-ups of Weiner's bulging underpants. \n In one of the pictures, Weiner is lying on a bed with his toddler son while texting the woman, according to the Post. The tabloid also ran sexually suggestive messages that it said the two exchanged. \n Weiner told the Post that he and the woman \"have been friends for some time.\" \n \"She has asked me not to comment except to say that our conversations were private, often included pictures of her nieces and nephews and my son and were always appropriate,\" the 51-year-old Democrat told the newspaper. \n Weiner didn't return a call, text or email from The Associated Press. He deleted his Twitter account today. \n The Post didn't say how it obtained the photographs and messages. \n Abedin, 40, is a longtime Clinton aide and confidante who is often referred to as the candidate's second daughter. \n Trump immediately seized on the aide's marital split to accuse Clinton of \"bad judgment.\" He suggested that Weiner might have compromised national security, but offered no evidence to support the allegation. \n \"I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Who knows what he learned and who he told?\" \n Abedin has been under scrutiny during the probe into Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. Federal prosecutors declined to file charges in the investigation, but FBI Director James Comey said Clinton and her aides had been \"extremely careless\" in their handling of classified information. \n Abedin began working for the former first lady as a White House intern and became a trusted aide as Clinton won a seat in the Senate representing New York in 2000, ran for president in 2008 and served as President Barack Obama's secretary of state. Former President Bill Clinton officiated when Abedin and Weiner married in 2010. \n The marriage would provide years of fodder for political commentators, armchair psychologists and spouses all over America who wondered: How could she stay with him? \n Abedin was pregnant with the couple's son, Jordan, when a photo of a man's bulging underpants appeared on Weiner's Twitter account in 2011. After initially claiming his account was hacked, Weiner acknowledged inappropriate online communication with several women. \n Two years later, Abedin was all in for her husband's mayoral bid, raising money, appearing on the campaign trail and participating in interviews in which the couple talked about rebuilding their trust and marriage. Then a new series of sexually explicit pictures and messages emerged, and Weiner was forced to acknowledge he kept sexting after he had resigned from Congress. \n Still, Abedin said, \"I love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him, and \u2026 we are moving forward.\" \n Voters weren't ready to forgive, however. Weiner lost the Democratic primary. \n Weiner has since remained in the public eye, commenting on politics on cable news shows. \"Weiner,\" the documentary offering a cringe-inducing inside view of his mayoral campaign and its unraveling, played in theaters earlier this year and is set to air on Showtime this fall. \n He recently refused to answer when asked whether he was still sexting, telling The New York Times Magazine in an interview published Aug. 16: \"I'm not going to go down the path of talking about any of that.\" \n Some psychology experts, while cautioning they haven't treated him, suggested his behavior smacks of extreme impulsiveness, compulsion or addiction. \n \"Impulsivity is something that a lot of people really struggle with,\" said Jeannette Stern, a New York therapist. While there are various approaches people can try to change such behavior, she noted, \"they have to really be willing to stop.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton aide Abedin dumps husband Weiner over new scandal"}

The Big Island is also under a hurricane watch. \n At 5 a.m., Madeline was 445 miles east of Hilo, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph and higher gusts, moving west at 10 mph. \n A tropical storm warning means that tropical storm conditions are expected within 36 hours, while a watch means storm conditions are possible within 48 hours. A flash flood watch has also been issued for the Big Island. \n According to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, tropical storm conditions are expected over Hawaii island Wednesday while hurricane conditions are possible. Tropical storm conditions are also possible over Maui County on Wednesday. \"Heavy rains associated with Madeline may reach Hawaii County on Wednesday, and may impact other Hawaiian islands later Wednesday into Friday. Madeline is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 5 to 10 inches, with isolated maximum amounts near 15 inches, across the Big Island, especially over windward portions. This rainfall may lead to dangerous flash floods and mudslides. Madeline may produce up to 4 inches of rainfall across Maui County,\" forecasters said. \n Dangerous surf is also expected as the storm approaches. A high surf warning is in effect for eastern shores of Maui through 6 a.m. Thursday, while an advisory has been issued for eastern shores of the other islands. \n Farther east in Pacific, Hurricane Lester was weakening but remained a powerful Category 3 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. Lester was about 1,355 miles east of Hilo, moving west at 14 mph at 5 a.m. \n Gradual weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours and its forecast track has it moving just north of the Big Island Saturday. \n Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 35 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles, according to the National Hurricane Center. \n Previous coverage \n The National Weather Service posted a hurricane watch for Hawaii island as Madeline strengthened into a major category 4 storm that could come \"dangerously close\" to the Big Island Wednesday. \n Madeline had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph and was centered 490 miles east of Hilo and 680 miles east of Honolulu moving west at 9 mph at 2 a.m. Hurricane-force winds extend 30 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds go out 125 miles from the center. \n A hurricane watch means hurricane conditions are possible on Hawaii island in the next 48 hours. \n \"Impacts from Madeline are becoming increasingly likely over portions of the state, including the possibility of damaging winds and flooding,\" forecasters said. \"It is important for those in the State of Hawaii to not focus too closely on the exact forecast track of Madeline. With an average forecast track error of about 85 to 150 miles in the 48 to 72 hour time range, it is still too soon to say with certainty which islands could be directly impacted. It is also important to note that significant impacts can extend well away from the center of a tropical cyclone.\" \n A high surf warning has been issued for the east-facing shores of Maui from 6 a.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Thursday. \n The east shores of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, and west Maui are under a high surf advisory. \n Surf is expected to build to 10 to 15 feet on Tuesday afternoon and rising to 10 to 20 feet late Tuesday night and Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service. \n A flash flood watch is also posted for Hawaii island Wednesday and Thursday because of the threat of flooding rainfall. \n On its current track, Madeline is expected to pass south or over Hawaii island on Wednesday at hurricane strength. \n Madeline is likely to bring strong waves, winds and rains to Hawaii island and Maui through Thursday. \n Forecasters expect humidity to increase and an increase in showers starting Tuesday as tropical moisture ahead of Madeline reaches the state. \n Surf on east shores is also expected to rise and could build to 8 to 12 feet on Tuesday and 15 to 25 feet on Wednesday on Hawaii island. \n The weather service estimates Hilo has a 7 percent chance of seeing hurricane-force winds and a 63 percent chance of tropical storm-force winds. South Point has a 16 percent chance of hurricane-force winds and Kona has a 5 percent chance. \n The chance of tropical storm-force winds at South Point is 73 percent and Kailua Kona's chance of getting tropical storm-force winds is 56 percent. \n The storm's impact on other islands is still uncertain. \n \"We're still going to get an increase in wind speeds. If it takes the northerly track you'll get an increased chance of wind, surf and an increased chance of rain and flooding for Oahu,\" said Chevy Chevalier, a meteorologist with the Honolulu office of the National Weather Service. \n Effects on Oahu and Kauai will be less if the storm takes a southerly route. \n Air Force reserve hurricane hunter planes are heading to Hawaii and will fly through the storm Tuesday, which should give forecasters better information to track and predict the storm, Chevalier said. \n The storm could also coincide with the scheduled visit of President Obama to Oahu Wednesday night and the start of the World Conservation Congress Thursday. \n Behind Madeline, Hurricane Lester weakened slightly to powerful category 3 storm with winds of 125 mph, about 1,435 miles east of Hilo in the East Pacific tonight. Lester continued to move west at 14 mph and should cross into the Central Pacific Wednesday. \n Hurricane-force winds extend 35 mph from the center and tropical storm-force winds extend 90 miles from the center. \n Forecasters said Lester is still too far away to predict what effects it will have on Hawaii. If it takes a northerly track, it may just bring surf and not much in the way of winds or rains. But the potential is there for Lester to pass over or near Hawaii. \n Forecasters said people should be prepared for a hurricane, if they haven't already done so, with seven days of emergency supplies and a plan of what to do and how to keep in touch with relatives in the event of a storm. \n \"If you're not prepared, you should be, especially if you live on the Big Island or Maui,\" Chevalier said. \"Don't let your guard down.\" \n ", "author": "By Craig Gima cgima@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Hurricane Madeline heads west toward Hawaii; storm warnings, watches issued"}

Schatz, and the departments of Interior and Agriculture for recognizing that this disease presents an enormous biosecurity risk to Hawaii.\" \n According to DLNR officials, rapid ohia death threatens the state's tropical forests and other ecosystems and could jeopardize local water supplies and the local economy. \n The funding immediately activates an early detection rapid response team, made up of federal and state agencies, and a consortium of scientists who will continue conducting field surveys for the disease and support critical research to pioneer adaptive treatments. \n ", "author": "By Star-Advertiser staff", "title": "State to get federal funding to combat rapid ohia death"}
