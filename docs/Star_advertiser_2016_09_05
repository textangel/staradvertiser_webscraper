O' Flaherty, will compete for the Miss America crown on Sept. 11, as the first openly lesbian contestant. \n ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. \u00bb After competing in pageants for generations in the closet or working behind the scenes, gays and lesbians finally get to see one of their own take one of pageantry's biggest stages.  \n Miss Missouri, Erin O' Flaherty, will compete for the Miss America crown this weekend as the first openly lesbian contestant. \n \"Behind the scenes, we've been well-represented, but I'm the first openly gay title holder, so I'm very excited,\" she told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \"I knew going in that I had the opportunity to make history. Now I get to be more visible to the community and meet more people.\" \n Rich Helfant, executive director of the Greater Atlantic City GLBT Alliance, helps run the Miss'd America pageant, a drag spoof of the Miss America pageant that has become popular in Atlantic City as an entertainment and fundraising event. He said he'll watch the Miss America pageant finals Sept. 11 with extra interest this year. \n Miss'd America took its name from the fact that many gay pageant workers toiled behind the scenes during Miss America and never got to see what was happening onstage. \n \"They literally missed Miss America,\" Helfant said. \n Robert Hitchen of Philadelphia appears regularly in the Miss'd America pageant under the stage name Sandy Beach and recalled decades of behind-the-scenes work on pageants, including designing floats, and later riding on them in Miss America parades. \n The \"Show Us Your Shoes\" parade that has become a fixture of Miss America, in which contestants ride in vehicles on the Boardwalk and show off their state-themed footwear, sprang from the interest of gay spectators, he said. \n \"We would watch the parade from the deck of a hotel and we'd look down into the cars and see some of the women wearing slippers or being barefoot, and we started calling out, 'Show us your shoes!'\" he recalled. \"We sort of embarrassed them into wearing these big elaborate shoes, which are the highlight of the parade now.\" \n Antwan Lee, who won the Miss Gay America 2016 pageant under the stage name Asia O'Hara, would excitedly watch Miss America every year as a child and a young man, imagining what it would be like onstage. \n \"I would always gravitate toward celebrities and singers and actresses that had a high level of glam: beautiful, poised people who would live their life with a high degree of dignity,\" he said. \"To see that on TV with 50 women, as a young gay boy, that's the first place you see such a concentration of that. I was like, 'Wow, look at all those beautiful women, all the class, all the glamor!' It's very alluring.\" \n Lesbians have been more visible in pageants lately. Djuan Trent competed in the Miss America pageant as Miss Kentucky in 2011, when she finished in the top 10. She came out as a lesbian in 2014. \n Patricia Yurena, two-time winner of the Miss Spain contest and a runner up in the 2013 Miss Universe competition, announced in 2014 that she is a lesbian, posting a photo of her and her girlfriend cuddling, titling it \"Romeo and Juliet.\" \n In 2012, two openly lesbian contestants, Jenelle Hutcherson and Mollie Thomas, competed in the Miss California USA pageant but did not advance to the national Miss USA pageant competition. \n O'Flaherty is the first Miss America contestant to win a state title after coming out; Trent came out after competing. \n Hitchen said the social activism of many Miss America contestants resonates with the gay community; the Miss'd America drag queen parody pageant raises $300,000 a year for local and national charities and has become the top social event of the year in Atlantic City's gay community. \n Josh Randle, chief operating officer of the Miss America Organization, said the pageant reflects an evolving America. \n \"Through every major milestone of our nation's evolution, Miss America has provided a voice for women from all walks of life, and, this year, we welcome our first openly gay contestant,\" he said. \"Miss America contestants continue to be the best and brightest in the country, and we proudly support each and every young woman who competes in our national program.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "There she is: Out of the closet, and ready for Miss America"}

Cosby could learn the date of his felony sexual assault trial when he returns to court Tuesday in suburban Philadelphia. \n PHILADELPHIA \u00bb Bill Cosby's defense team will have a new look when the actor returns to court for a hearing on Tuesday in his sexual assault case.  \n Cosby has streamlined his legal team as the felony case heads to trial and dropped his media handler, Washington lawyer Monique Pressley. \n A judge in suburban Philadelphia could set a trial date. \n The defense also will push on Tuesday to keep key evidence out of the case. They hope to suppress several days of testimony Cosby gave in the accuser's civil lawsuit a decade ago. Cosby acknowledged giving Andrea Constand several pills before what he calls a consensual sexual encounter. She later said she was in and out of consciousness. \n \"I don't hear her say anything. And I don't feel her say anything. And so I continue and I go into the area that is somewhere between permission and rejection. I am not stopped,\" Cosby testified in the 2005 lawsuit. \n Veteran Philadelphia defense lawyer Brian McMonagle is expected to lead the courtroom fight as the case moves forward. \n Cosby also replaced one top-tier Los Angeles law firm with another on his defense team, the second such switch in about a year. Angela Agrusa of Liner LLP also will handle the civil defamation suits filed in several states by accusers who say they were defamed when Cosby or his agents denied their accounts. \n Cosby had countersued some of them. \n But he has since abandoned that strategy in Philadelphia, where he dropped the lawsuit filed against Constand, her lawyers and her mother. Cosby had accused them of violating the confidentiality of their 2006 settlement, in part by cooperating with police last year. \n The defense also hopes to suppress a secretly recorded 2005 phone call Cosby had with Gianna Constand, when he described his sexual encounter with her daughter. \n District Attorney Kevin Steele will fight to use both the phone call and his deposition at trial. \n Cosby has so far lost his efforts to have the charges thrown out. \n And so the long-beloved comedian known as \"America's Dad\" for his top-rated show on family life that ran from 1984 to 1992 finds himself spending his time and fortune in his waning days in a Pennsylvania courtroom. The women who accuse him of similar misconduct say the charges were a long time coming. \n Cosby's defenders instead suggest he is a wealthy target for the many women he met during five decades as an A-list celebrity. \n \"None of us will ever want to be in the position of attacking a victim. But the question should be asked \u2014 who is the victim?\" his wife, Camille, asked as more accusers came forward in 2014. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Cosby due in Pennsylvania court with streamlined legal team"}

The bombardment left behind deep scars, millions of unexploded cluster bombs across the countryside and decades-worth of cleanup. \n As a first sign of the new relationship, the Obama administration announced Tuesday it was committed $90 million over the three years to clearing the unexploded ordnance. The U.S. has contributed $100 million to the effort in the last 20 years, as annual deaths have fallen from more than 300 to fewer than 50, the White House said. \n The Lao government said it would increase efforts to recover remains and account for Americans missing since the Vietnam War. \n Obama is one of several world leaders arriving for a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Taking its turn as the chair of the regional forum, the Laos' communist government is using the moment to seize the spotlight. \n For Obama, the visit is a capstone to his years-long effort to bolster relations with Southeast Asian countries long overlooked by the United States. The outreach is a core element of Obama's attempt to focus U.S. policy on Asia in order to counter China's dominance in the region and ensure a foothold in growing markets. \n Obama was slated to tout his so-called Asia pivot policy and his legacy in the region in a speech later Tuesday. \n But Obama's outreach to those regional powers hit a snag just as he arrived in the region from China. The White House called off a planned meeting Tuesday with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, after the brash new leader referred to Obama as a \"son of a bitch.\" \n Duterte, who had been expecting Obama to criticize his deadly, extrajudicial crackdown on drug dealers, later said he regretted the personal attack on the president. \n In a statement read out Tuesday by his spokesman, Duterte said his \"strong comments\" to certain questions by a reporter \"elicited concern and distress.\" \n \"We look forward to ironing out differences arising out of national priorities and perceptions, and working in mutually responsible ways for both countries,\" the statement said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "On historic trip to Laos, Obama aims to heal war wounds"}

The emails, later revealed by WikiLeaks, showed some DNC officials favoring Clinton over her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders \u2014 who has since endorsed Clinton for president. \n She said Russian President Vladimir Putin appears \"quite satisfied with himself\" and said Trump \"has generally parroted what is a Putin-Kremlin line.\" \n Meanwhile, Trump extended a rare invitation to journalists to accompany him on his private plane from Cleveland to Youngstown, Ohio. The billionaire businessman appeared to pivot away from his hard-line position on immigration, saying, \"I'm all about jobs now.\" Any immigrants who want full citizenship must return to their countries of origin and get in line, he told reporters \u2014 but he would not rule out a pathway to legal status for the millions living in the U.S. illegally, as he did in a long-awaited policy speech last week. \n \"We're going to make that decision into the future,\" Trump said. \n Clinton powered through a coughing fit at a Labor Day festival at a Cleveland park, sharply criticizing Trump's recent trip to Mexico as \"an embarrassing international incident.\" Unwilling to allow Trump to modify his immigration stances, she said his address later that night in Arizona amounted to a \"doubling down on his absurd plan to send a deportation force to round up 16 million people.\" \n \"He can try to fool voters into thinking somehow he's not as harsh and inhumane as he seems, but it's too late,\" Clinton said. \n Clinton's 25-minute question-and-answer session was her first extensive availability with reporters since early December. Beyond Russia, she answered questions about the ongoing controversy surrounding her use of a private email server while secretary of state, which Trump has used to cast doubt over her ability to protect classified information. \n \"I take classification seriously,\" she said. \n Trump told reporters Monday that \"on occasion,\" he will invite journalists to travel with him. \n The two campaigns arrived in Cleveland within hours of each other, underscoring Ohio's quadrennial role in presidential campaigns. No Republican has won the White House without carrying the state, and the airport offered vivid imagery of that crucial role. \n The airplanes of Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, were parked on the tarmac as Clinton and her vice presidential pick, Tim Kaine, arrived in separate planes. It was a near-encounter that even forced the Trump press corps to the side of the road as Clinton's motorcade whizzed by. \n \"It's kind of interesting to have all the planes here on the same tarmac,\" Kaine said after he and Clinton greeted supporters. \"Just shows you how important Ohio is. We're going to be here a lot.\" \n While Labor Day has traditionally been the kickoff to the fall campaign, both Clinton and Trump have been locked in an intense back-and-forth throughout the summer. \n The start of full-fledged campaigning opens a pivotal month, culminating in the first presidential debate Sept. 26 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. Polls show Trump trailing Clinton in a series of must-win battleground states, meaning the debates could be his best chance at reorienting the race. \n Trump told reporters he does plan to take part in all three presidential debates, joking that only a \"hurricane\" or \"natural disaster\" would prevent him from attending. \n Clinton will have millions of dollars at her disposal this fall to air television advertising and power a sophisticated get-out-the vote operation in key states. \n The former secretary of state raised a combined $143 million in August for her campaign, the Democratic National Committee and state parties \u2014 her best month yet. She began September with more than $68 million in her campaign's bank account to use against Trump, who has not yet released initial fundraising totals for August.

A rougher surf cleared portions of the beachfront. \n MD Mahabub Khan has worked as a taxi cart pusher at the shore for 27 years and said he still attracted some business over the weekend, but the smaller crowds were noticeable. \n \"People from New York and New Jersey are kind of stuck here (during bad weather), so they can still come,\" if forecasts don't play out as predicted, Khan said. \n New York City closed its beaches Monday because of rip currents, and the ban could extend into Tuesday, depending on weather conditions, officials said. \n Hermine rose over the Gulf of Mexico and hit Florida on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane before weakening to a tropical storm across Georgia. \n It has caused three deaths, inflicted widespread property damage and knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people from Florida to Virginia. \n Since sea levels have risen to a foot because of global warming, the storm surges pushed by Hermine could be even more damaging, climate scientists say. \n \"We are already experiencing more and more flooding due to climate change in every storm,\" said Michael Oppenheimer, a geosciences professor at Princeton University. \"And it's only the beginning.\" \n Michael Mann, at Pennsylvania State University, said the 1-foot rise that New York City has experienced over the past century caused an additional 25 square miles and several billions of dollars of damage with Superstorm Sandy in 2012. \n No flooding or other damage had been reported as of Monday afternoon in some of the worst Sandy-hit areas, including Point Pleasant Beach, Bay Head, Mantoloking and Brick. \n On Saturday, high winds tipped over an 18-wheeler, killing its driver and shutting down a bridge in North Carolina's Outer Banks. In Florida, a homeless man in Marion County was hit by a falling tree and was killed. And a man trying to remove a tree that fell on a highway near Cottageville, South Carolina, on Friday was struck by a car and died on Saturday. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hermine lingers offshore, bringing rough waves, rip currents"}

Other rain clouds are being blown in by tradewinds. \n Tradewinds are beginning to return as Tropical Storm Lester continues to weaken and move away from Hawaii. \n The National Weather Service said the humid conditions trailing behind Lester are also moving away from the islands. \n The forecast today calls for brisk, east tradewinds of 15 to 20 mph with higher gusts, bringing the usual windward and mauka showers. Highs will be between 85 and 90 degrees. \n \"Typical trade wind weather is expected to prevail across the area through the middle of the week,\" forecasters said. \"Trade showers may become more active toward later part of the week,\" \n At 11 a.m., Lester was about 720 miles northwest of Honolulu with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, moving northwest at 13 mph. \n The storm is expected to be absorbed into another weather system moving toward the mainland and could bring rains to the Pacific Northwest next weekend. \n The lingering tropical moisture from Lester brought isolated heavy showers to areas across the state on Sunday. \n Saddle Quarry on the Big Island got a little more than 2.9 inches of rain. Puu Kukui on Maui saw 1.8 inches; Lanai got 2.63 inches and the Molokai Airport recorded nearly 1.1 inches.
