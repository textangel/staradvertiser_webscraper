{"date": "September 9, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump smiles as he meets with students and educators before speaking about school choice. \n NEW YORK >> Over and over again, Donald Trump says he opposed the Iraq War before it started. But no matter how many times the Republican candidate for president says it, the facts are clear: He did not. \n There is no evidence Trump expressed public opposition to the war before the U.S. invaded. Rather, he offered lukewarm support. The billionaire businessman only began to voice doubts about the conflict well after it began in March 2003. \n That hasn't kept Trump from making his opposition a centerpiece of his criticism of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's approach to foreign policy. \n Clinton voted in favor of the invasion in 2002 while she was a New York senator. It's a vote she has said was a mistake. \n Trump pushes his claim of early disapproval as \"one of the biggest differences in this race.\" \n \"I was against the war in Iraq, because I said it's gonna totally destabilize the Middle East, which it has,\" Trump said at Wednesday's nationally televised forum on national security. The next day, he spent several minutes at an education event in Cleveland reiterating his opposition and citing a series of interviews as proof. \n \"I was opposed to war from the beginning,\" Trump said. \"I just wanted to set the record straight. There is so much lying going on.\" \n But those interviews offer no such evidence. \n When asked for additional proof, Trump's campaign referred to material from a fact check published by The Washington Post that concluded \"there's no sign that Trump opposed the invasion or was vocal about it prior to the invasion.\" \n Trump's first known public comment on the topic came on Sept. 11, 2002, when he was asked whether he supported a potential Iraq invasion in an interview with radio host Howard Stern. \n \"Yeah, I guess so,\" Trump responded after a brief hesitation, according to a recording of the interview unearthed by BuzzFeed News. Trump then alluded to the first Gulf War in 1991, which ended with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein still in power. \"You know, I wish it was, I wish the first time it was done correctly.\" \n His next comment came in January 2003, during a Fox News Channel interview with Neil Cavuto. Trump suggested the economy and threats from North Korea posed greater problems for then-President George W. Bush than Iraq, but he did not say he opposed a possible invasion. \n Trump also suggested that the American people were looking for an answer one way or another from Bush. \n \"Either you attack or you don't attack,\" Trump said. \n On March 21, 2003, just days after the invasion began, Trump told Cavuto on his show that the invasion \"looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.\" \n As 2003 went on, Trump's opinions started to shift slightly. That September, he said on MSNBC that he \"would have fought terrorism, but not necessarily Iraq.\" In December, he told Fox News that \"a lot of people (are) questioning the whole concept of going in in the first place.\" But he stopped short of saying that he was among those opponents. \n In fact, Trump had voiced support for a hypothetical invasion of Iraq before Bush took office. In his 2000 book, \"The America We Deserve,\" he suggested that he would be in favor of a pre-emptive strike if Iraq was viewed as a threat to national security. \n \"I'm no warmonger,\" Trump wrote. \"But the fact is, if we decide a strike against Iraq is necessary, it is madness not to carry the mission to its conclusion.\" He went on to compare a decision to invade with the \"quick, secret, decisive moves in order to gain a negotiating advantage\" in a business deal. \n During the GOP presidential primaries, Trump repeatedly promoted what he said was his opposition to the war as an advantage over fellow Republicans. At his education event in Cleveland on Thursday, he went further, saying that \"had I been in Congress at the time of the invasion, I would have cast a vote in opposition.\" \n In those remarks, and in notes provided by his campaign, Trump pointed to a pair of interviews as evidence to back up his claim he was against the war from the start. \n He cites comments he made to The Post on March 25, 2003, at a post-Oscars party in which he called the war \"a mess.\" But those remarks, which came four days after he called the invasion a \"tremendous success,\" appeared to be a reference to a friendly fire incident in which a U.S. missile downed a British fighter jet and led to a 300-point fall in the stock market. \n Second, Trump points to the August 2004 issue of Esquire, in which he made his first strong comments opposing the war, saying he \"would never have handled it that way.\" \n \"Very early in the conflict, extremely early in the conflict, right at the beginning, I made a detailed statement in an interview to Esquire Magazine,\" Trump said in Cleveland. \"So, right at the beginning.\" \n That statement did not come at the beginning. Trump's interview with Esquire was printed 16 months after the invasion began, long after U.S. forces became engaged against a violent Iraqi insurgency. This week, Esquire added an editor's note to the story that highlights Trump's falsehood. \n \"The Iraq War began in March 2003, more than a year before this story ran, thus nullifying Trump's timeline,\" the note reads. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fact checking Trump's claim of opposing Iraq War"}

{"date": "September 9, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks at a LBGT For Hillary Gala at the Cipriani Club, in New York today. \n PENSCACOLA, Fla. \u00bb Hillary Clinton said today it was time for a \"rethinking\" of America's strategy for North Korea following the regime's latest test of a nuclear weapon. Donald Trump and his campaign chief, meanwhile, refused to outline the Republican presidential candidate's plans for defusing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.  \n The New York billionaire, however, vowed to deploy military muscle to attack America's enemies if provoked. \n Largely ignoring North Korea, he noted a recent incident in which he said Iranian ships were \"toying with\" an American destroyer near the Strait of Hormuz. During a Trump presidency, he promised at a Friday night rally in Pensacola, Florida, ships trying to provoke the U.S. \"will be shot out of the water.\" \n In New York, Clinton was focused on the North Korean threat after meeting with a bipartisan group of national security experts. \n The former secretary of state said she would seek to impose tougher sanctions on the communist nation, arguing the latest test provides an opening to pressure China, which has been tepid in its response to North Korea's nuclear ambitions. \n \"I think we have an opening here that we haven't had for the last several years that I intend to do everything I can to take advantage of,\" Clinton said. \n Clinton spoke hours after Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, pressed repeatedly on Trump's plans for the region, said only, \"He wouldn't do what's being done now.\" \n \"He's not going to reveal all of his plans and he's made that very clear. And maybe someone can ask him in a debate,\" Conway told \"CBS This Morning.\" \"But the fact is that this entire world would be put on notice that there's a strong leader in the White House.\" \n North Korea's latest atomic test was its fifth, and the second in eight months. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said the detonation, which Seoul estimated was the North's biggest ever in explosive yield, was an act of \"fanatic recklessness\" and a sign that leader Kim Jong Un \"is spiraling out of control.\" \n President Barack Obama condemned the test and said the U.S. would never accept the country as a nuclear power. \n In appearances in Florida and Washington, Trump used the North Korean development to attack Clinton. \"North Korea, like so many other things, is one more Hillary Clinton failure,\" he said in Pensacola. \n He did not say whether he had a plan to address North Korea's claim the test will allow it to build an array of stronger, smaller and lighter nuclear weapons. \n He focused instead on attacking Clinton's credibility. He said Clinton was being \"protected\" during the Justice Department's investigation into her use of a private email server while secretary of state. \n \"She could walk right into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching, right smack in the middle of the heart, and she wouldn't be prosecuted,\" Trump said. \n Meanwhile, Clinton said the United States would not let North Korea pursue a nuclear weapon and said that as president, she would seek new sanctions and work closely with allies in the region, such as South Korea and Japan. \n But she also said she would consider discussions similar to recent negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, because sanctions \"aren't enough.\" \n The development in North Korea comes at the end of a week in which Trump and Clinton clashed repeatedly over national security. \n The New York billionaire attacked Clinton's record as the nation's chief diplomat, yet he faced criticism from within his own party for refusing to outline his plans for combating foreign policy challenges, including threats posed by the Islamic State group. Trump said this week that he does indeed have a plan, but would convene military leaders in his first 30 days in office to craft another plan. \n Trump has also faced criticism for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin during a high-profile national security forum earlier in the week, and appearing on a Russian-backed television network Thursday evening. \n On Friday, Clinton said she was \"disappointed\" by Trump's decision to appear on RT America, saying that \"every day that goes by this just becomes more and more of a reality television show. It's not a serious presidential campaign.\" \n With several prominent Republican national security officials already concerned about Trump's national security acumen, Clinton has tried to cast herself as the better potential commander in chief. She has aggressively promoted her growing list of military endorsements from both parties. \n On Friday, her campaign said the number of retired generals and admirals endorsing Clinton for president has grown to 110. Trump quickly countered by saying his list had ballooned to 120 former U.S. generals and admirals earlier in the week. \n Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, received his first intelligence briefing Friday. The vice presidential nominee declined to offer any specifics since the information was classified. \n Continuing her aggressive fundraising push, Clinton appeared at two fundraisers in New York. One of them was an LGBT event featuring Barbra Streisand. \n Clinton is getting some help from another wealthy backer as well. Billionaire Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz said Friday he's giving $20 million to help defeat Trump. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton: Time for 'rethinking' of U.S. approach to North Korea"}

{"date": "September 9, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally today in Pensacola, Fla. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump arrived at today's Values Voter Summit with the Christian conservative vote in hand \u2014 but not firmly. \n That's why Trump \u2014 and running mate Mike Pence on Saturday \u2014 became the first presidential ticket to address this annual conference of faith-based voters. Trump sought to reassure attendees that he is indeed one of them \u2014 committed to family values, school choice and appointing conservative judges who'll restore religious freedoms that this vital voting bloc feels are under siege. \n \"A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended like you have never seen before. Believe me,\" Trump told a welcoming crowd assembled in a ballroom. \"And that includes religious liberty.\" \n Faith-based voters are coalescing around Trump, but they aren't enthusiastic about it. They're motivated by the fear of a Hillary Clinton presidency in which she could tilt the Supreme Court decidedly left with the selection of one, possibly two, justices. \n However, many are still nervous about Trump, concerned about his beliefs on social issues such as gay rights, his bombastic persona and the personal lifestyle of the thrice-married, twice-divorced New York real estate mogul and former reality-television host. \n A Pew Research poll in July found that 78 percent of self-identified white evangelicals plan to vote for Trump in November but that half of the respondents weren't satisfied with their ballot options. \n More worrisome, 45 percent of white evangelicals said their Trump votes would mainly represent votes against Clinton, while 30 percent said their Trump votes represented support for him. \n \"There are lots of unknowns about him,\" said Abraham Hamilton, 31, a New Orleans attorney and public policy analyst for the American Family Association, a group that promotes fundamentalist Christian values. \"But it's a known question of what to expect from Hillary Clinton. I can't say I'm OK with it, but I'm more OK with it than the prospect of Hillary Clinton.\" \n Don Krahel, an 85-year-old retiree from St. Clairsville, Ohio, said Trump wasn't his \"first choice and not my second choice.\" \n \"Now he's my only choice, and I'm behind him,\" Krahel said. \"I sent him money. It's about the Supreme Court for me.\" \n Trump did his best to woo skeptics. He had faith-based conservative heavyweights like former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani vouch for him before he took the stage. Trump told the audience that he would attend the funeral Saturday of social conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly, who died earlier this week at 92.  \n Trump restated his commitment to appointing justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia, reminding the audience that he already has a list of 11 potential candidates. \n \"The next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others,\" he said. \"It would be record-setting \u2026 . And you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country. It will be a disaster.\" \n He drew the largest applause when he vowed to repeal the so-called Johnson Amendment, a 1954 tax measure introduced by then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson that prevents churches or other tax-exempt charitable groups from endorsing or opposing political candidates. Several church groups say the measure restricts their free speech rights. \n \"I figure it's the only way I'm getting to heaven,\" he said. \"So we're going to get rid of it, and we're going to let your great people speak, and you're going to see something happen that's going to be very, very good, OK? So important.\" \n He blasted an Obama administration plan to admit Syrian refugees and accused President Barack Obama of bungling the battle against the Islamic State. \n \"ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross,\" Trump said. \"ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East. We cannot let this evil continue \u2014 can't let it.\" \n Barry Lynn, the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, accused faith-based Trump supporters of hypocrisy for backing him. \n \"This election season has exposed the leadership of the religious right for the hypocrites that they are,\" said Lynn. \"What tiny bit of moral authority the religious right had left disappeared when they tossed the moral values they supposedly treasure under the Trump campaign bus before jumping aboard.\" \n Corey Spangler, 70, said she'd left Trump's speech more energized about voting for him in November than before. \n \"I believe he's a Christian,\" said Spangler, a Lady Lake, Fla., resident. \"I've evolved.

{"date": "September 9, 2016", "text": "POOL PHOTO VIA AP \n U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov hold a press conference following their meeting in Geneva, where they discussed the crisis in Syria today. \n GENEVA \u00bb The United States and Russia working in lockstep against the Islamic State group and al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria. A rejuvenated truce that will compel President Bashar Assad's air and ground forces to pull back. New flows of badly needed humanitarian aid. \n Those details emerged Saturday as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov capped another marathon meeting in Geneva to present their latest ambitious push to end Syria's devastating and complex war. \n The potential breakthrough deal, which launches a nationwide cessation of hostilities by sundown Monday, will hinge on compliance by Assad's Russian-backed forces and U.S.-supported rebel groups, plus key regional powers such as Turkey, Iran and Saudi Arabia with hands directly or indirectly in Syria's 5-1/2 years of carnage. \n \"We believe the plan as it is set forth \u2014 if implemented, if followed \u2014 has the ability to provide a turning point, a moment of change,\" Kerry said as he and Lavrov laid out the contours, but admittedly not too much fine print, of the hard-won accord. \n The ultimate hope is to silence the Syrian guns so that the long-stalled peace process under U.N. mediation can resume between Assad's envoys and representatives of the opposition, while the two world powers focus on battling jihadis. \n The deal, at least publicly and for now, appears to overcome months of distrust between Russia and the United States that President Barack Obama had cited less than a week ago. \n Now, the two powers are lining up in an unexpected new military partnership targeting IS and al-Qaida-linked militants, while trying to prod Assad and opposition groups to end a civil war that has killed up to 500,000 people and displaced millions. \n \"This is just the beginning of our new relations,\" Lavrov said of the U.S. \n Washington must persuade Syrian rebels to break ranks with Fath al-Sham, an al-Qaida-linked group previously known as the Nusra Front, which has intermingled with U.S.-backed fighters. Moscow is to pressure Assad's government to halt all offensive operations against the armed opposition in specific areas, which were not detailed. \n \"The Syrian government has been informed of these arrangements and is ready to fulfill them,\" Lavrov said at a news conference alongside Kerry after midnight. \n Kerry said the arrangement depends on \"people's choices. It has the ability to stick, provided the regime and the opposition both meet their obligations, which we \u2014 and we expect other supporting countries \u2014 will strongly encourage them to do.\" \n He also alluded to the possibility of backsliding that all but doomed a previous U.S.-Russia cease-fire initiative earlier this year, which briefly halted the fighting and paved the way for new aid convoys before a resurgence of bloodshed. \n \"No one is building this based on trust,\" Kerry said. \"It is based on a way of providing oversight, and compliance, through mutual interest and other things. If this arrangement holds, then we will see a significant reduction in violence across Syria.\" \n The deal culminates months of frenetic diplomacy that included four meetings between Kerry and Lavrov since Aug. 26, and a lengthy face-to-face in China between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n The military deal would go into effect after both sides abide by the truce for a week and allow unimpeded humanitarian deliveries. Then, the U.S. and Russia would begin intelligence sharing and targeting coordination, while Assad's air and ground forces would no longer be permitted to target Fath al-Sham; they would be restricted to operations against the Islamic State. \n The arrangement would ultimately aim to step up and concentrate the firepower of two of the world's most powerful militaries against IS and the group once known as Nusra, listed by the United Nations as terrorist groups. \n Both sides have failed to deliver their ends of the bargain over several previous truces. \n But the new arrangement goes further by promising a new U.S.-Russian counterterrorism alliance, only a year after Obama chastised Putin for a military intervention that U.S. officials said was mainly designed to keep Assad in power and target more moderate anti-Assad forces. \n Russia, in response, has chafed at America's financial and military assistance to groups that have intermingled with the Nusra Front on the battlefield. Kerry said it would be \"wise\" for opposition forces to separate completely from Nusra, a statement Lavrov hailed. \n \"Going after Nusra is not a concession to anybody,\" Kerry said. \"It is profoundly in the interests of the United States.\" \n The proposed level of U.S.-Russian interaction has upset several leading national security officials in Washington, including Defense Secretary Ash Carter and National Intelligence Director James Clapper, and Kerry only appeared at the news conference after several hours of internal U.S. discussions. \n After the Geneva announcement, Pentagon secretary Peter Cook offered a guarded endorsement of the arrangement and cautioned, \"We will be watching closely the implementation of this understanding in the days ahead.\" \n At one point, Lavrov said he was considering \"calling it a day\" on talks, expressing frustration with what he described as an hours-long wait for a U.S. response. He then presented journalists with several boxes of pizza, saying, \"This is from the U.S. delegation,\" and two bottles of vodka, adding, \"This is from the Russian delegation.\" \n The Geneva negotiating session, which lasted more than 13 hours, underscored the complexity of a conflict that includes myriad militant groups, shifting alliances and the rival interests of the U.S. and Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran, and Turkey and the Kurds. \n Getting Assad's government and rebel groups to comply with the deal may now be more difficult as fighting rages around Aleppo, Syria's most populous city and the new focus of the war. \n Assad's government appeared to tighten its siege of the former Syrian commercial hub in the last several days, seizing several key transit points. Forty days of fighting in Aleppo has killed nearly 700 civilians, including 160 children, according to a Syrian human rights group. \n Kerry outlined several steps the government and rebels would have to take. They must now pull back from demilitarized zones, and allow civilian traffic and humanitarian deliveries \u2014 notably into Aleppo. \n \"If Aleppo is at peace, we believe that the prospects for a diplomatic solution will brighten,\" he said. \"If Aleppo continues to be torn apart, the prospects for Syria and its people are grim.\" \n But as with previous blueprints for peace, Saturday's plan appears to lack enforcement mechanisms. Russia could, in theory, threaten to act against rebel groups that break the deal. But if Assad bombs his opponents, the U.S. is unlikely to take any action against him given Obama's longstanding opposition to entering the civil war. \n In the Mideast, the main Syrian opposition umbrella group said it hoped the new U.S.-Russian agreement would be enforced in order to ease the suffering of civilians. Basma Kodmani, of the High Negotiations Committee, told The Associated Press that Russia should pressure Assad to abide by the deal, adding enforcement mechanisms will be needed including the \"cessation of hostilities and the grounding (of) regime air forces.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S., Russia seal Syria cease-fire, new military partnership"}

A lengthy report into the San Bernardino terror attack reveals new details about the killings last year and the way the husband and wife who carried them out died in a police shootout. \n LOS ANGELES \u00bb As their colleagues were cut down by gunfire, three men rushed a shooter in an attempt to thwart the San Bernardino terror attack, according to an in-depth report of the massacre that provided new details today. \n The three county employees were shot in the rampage by a colleague and his wife. The report did not say if any survived, though a federal prosecutor hailed their sacrifice. \n \"These victims had no chance to protect themselves as a result of the callous perpetration of violence, while others heroically sacrificed themselves in an attempt to stop the shooting,\" U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said in a statement. \"In the face of this unfathomable suffering, the law enforcement personnel and citizens who put themselves in harm's way to help others exemplifies the very best that our country has to offer.\" \n The report by the Police Foundation, a policy study group, and the Department of Justice provided a detailed account of the pandemonium that unfolded as the Islamic extremists opened fire at a Dec. 2 meeting of the man's colleagues and, minutes later, as police first arrived at the scene of horrific bloodshed. \n Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people and wounded 22 others in the massacre at a training event and holiday gathering of the San Bernardino County Health Department, where Farook worked as a food inspector. \n Farook had been present at the meeting but got up and left before returning a short time later clad in black, wearing a mask and armed with a semi-automatic rifle. His wife was also wearing black and toting an assault rifle. \n The first victims had been shot outside the Inland Regional Center. One appeared to have been eating lunch at a picnic table and the other was found still holding his cellphone, according to the report based on interviews with over 200 witnesses, law enforcement officers and others. \n Colleagues inside had heard popping sounds, but many didn't recognize the sound of gunfire until the doors burst open and they saw a man in black start spraying bullets. They didn't recognize him or his wife. People ran in horror, some dove to the floor and others fell from the fusillade. \n Even then, some weren't sure what was happening, with one county official taking cover and thinking it was the \"most glorified training I had ever seen.\" \n \"Probably on the second or third clip, it finally clicked that this wasn't an exercise,\" he said. The report provided confidentiality to witnesses, victims and first responders. \n The couple calmly reloaded several times over the course of two to three minutes before they left, and appeared to look for signs victims might still be alive, shooting one or more bullets into those who made a sound or moved. \n One injured woman asked a colleague \"to call her mother and say goodbye for her,\" according to a draft of the report obtained by The Associated Press, but not included in the final version because of its graphic nature. The colleague tried to assure her she'd be OK, but the woman replied, \"I'm not, I'm bleeding from the mouth\" before closing her eyes for good. \n The report, which was first written about by The New York Times, gives law enforcement high marks for their response, though it also points out areas of confusion or challenges law enforcement faced as they encountered the startling aftermath of the violence. \n The carnage was described as looking \"like a bomb had gone off.\" Smoke from gunpowder filled the room and water poured down from a fire sprinkler struck by gunfire. \n \"It was the worst thing imaginable,\" said a patrol officer who was one of the first four officers to enter the scene. \"Some people were quiet, hiding, others were screaming or dying, grabbing at your legs because they wanted us to get them out, but our job at the moment was to keep going.\" \n The officer regretted having to leave the casualties, but they thought the shooters were still in the building and had to first make sure it was safe. \n A rookie officer took a report from one of the survivors, who said Farook had left the meeting early and that there was something about the shooter's body language that looked similar. \n That led officers to Farook and Malik's apartment in nearby Redlands hours later. The two left in a rented black SUV and were trailed by several undercover officers. When a sergeant in a squad car joined in and tried to pull the couple over, his vehicle was hit by gun fire. \n Farook then abruptly stopped and he and Malik began shooting at officers in the street, who took cover behind vehicles and returned fire. \n The couple shot 81 bullets at police before being outgunned by two dozen officers who fired 440 rounds. One officer was shot in the leg and a deputy was grazed by a bullet. \n Farook was struck 25 times, mostly in the legs. Malik was shot twice in the head, and had 13 other wounds. \n Police found more than 2,000 rounds of ammo in the vehicle, along with first-aid equipment. \n It wasn't all they left behind. Back at the conference room more than six hours after the attack, investigators found three pipe bombs in a bag Farook had left behind. The report said authorities now think they were intended to be detonated remotely when first responders aided the victims, but the remote detonating device didn't work. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New report: 3 men tried to stop San Bernardino massacre"}

{"date": "September 9, 2016", "text": "LLNL / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n Glendon Parker, a biochemist with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Forensic Science Center, examines a 250-year-old archaeological hair sample that has been analyzed for human identification using protein markers from the hair. \n A strand of hair at a crime scene, or clinging to human remains unearthed by archaeologists, could hold new promise as a means to identify its unique owner and unravel mysteries sealed by the passage of time.  \n In research published this week, scientists from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories reported they are devising a test of human hair that could fingerprint its owner in cases in which DNA evidence is fragmented, damaged or nowhere to be found. Like DNA sequencing, the test they have devised not only could identify an individual but trace his or her ancestry. \n The researchers' discovery, reported Wednesday in the journal PLoS One, addresses one of forensic scientists' most pressing needs: a reliable alternative to DNA identification. DNA is actually quite fragile and notoriously vulnerable to degradation with time and exposure to the environment. It's tricky to coax a full sequence from an old biological sample or one that's been buried, frozen or baked in the sun. \n While a shaft of hair often is presented as evidence in an old-fashioned whodunit, it does not actually contain nuclear DNA, the chemical blueprint an individual inherits from both parents. It does contain mitochondrial DNA, but because that is passed down matrilineally, it has limits as a means of identification. \n In quainter times, investigators might put a hair under a microscope and compare it to, say, that of a defendant. But in current forensic science, a seeming match under the microscope would not be accepted as proof that two different shafts of hair came from the same person. \n Every strand of hair is made up of proteins. In addition to being more resilient to environmental damage than DNA, those proteins are like an echo of a person's DNA, said Brad Hart, co-author of a paper and director of Livermore's Forensic Science Center. \n It's a simple but ingenious idea, conceived in 2013 by the paper's lead author, Glendon Parker, then a biochemistry professor at Utah Valley University and now a scientist at Livermore: DNA provides the blueprint for proteins. So the coding quirks found in an individual's DNA (called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) will translate into recognizable variants in the proteins, known as single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs). \n These SAPs are the protein markers that could guide future forensic scientists in identifying an individual even when DNA is not available. While they can be found in a single strand of hair, they also can be found in shed skin cells, bones and teeth. \n In an effort to discern how specific SNPs became recognizable SAPs, researchers from seven universities collected and analyzed male and female hair samples from 82 people of varying ethnicities. \n In the hair samples of 66 European-Americans, five African-Americans, five Kenyans and six skeletal remains from the 1750s and 1850s, they identified 185 protein markers that could collectively be used to tell one person from another. \n Each person's number of hair protein markers, combined with his or her pattern of protein markers, is unique, researchers found. The authors of the report suggest that as many as 1,000 protein markers could be used to identify individuals and distinguish one person from another.

{"date": "September 9, 2016", "text": "DETROIT NEWS VIA AP \n Volkswagen engineer James Robert Liang, left, leaves court today in Detroit, after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy in the company's emissions cheating scandal. \n A longtime Volkswagen engineer pleaded guilty in federal court to charges he helped design and implement a software system that helped the German automaker's diesel engines defeat emissions tests.  \n The plea is the first from a staffer involved in the cheating scandal, and it signals the Justice Department is serious about holding Volkswagen employees personally and criminally responsible for producing about 500,000 cars that spew up to 40 times the legally allowed amount of pollutants into the atmosphere. \n James Robert Liang, 62, a Newbury Park, Calif., resident, pleaded guilty in federal court in Detroit to a single charge of conspiring to defraud the United States, commit wire fraud and violate the Clean Air Act. He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \n Neither Liang nor his attorney could be reached for comment. \n As part of the plea agreement, Liang will cooperate with the government in its ongoing criminal investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement. Such cooperation is generally a sign that federal prosecutors are seeking to charge others in a scheme. \n The plea agreement describes a conspiracy that spans nearly 10 years. \n Liang had worked in Volkswagen AG's diesel development department in Wolfsburg, Germany, starting in 1983. In 2006, he and his \"co-conspirators\" started work on a new diesel engine for U.S. vehicles, the plea agreement says. \n As described in a 25-page indictment unsealed Friday along with the plea deal, Liang and his fellow \"co-conspirators\" at Volkswagen knew \"from almost the beginning of VW's process to design its new 'clean diesel' vehicles\" that the cars \"would not meet U.S. emissions standards.\" \n When they realized they could not design an engine that would adhere to the strict U.S. emissions standards, while also delivering solid road performance, they then created and implemented so-called \"defeat devices\" \u2014 software that could recognize when cars were being tested \"in order to cheat\" the tests, according to court papers. \n If it detected the vehicle was undergoing a test, it told the car to emit only enough nitrogen oxide to pass the inspection. Otherwise, the court papers allege, it permitted the cars to pump substantially more nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere. \n In a statement released Friday, the Justice Department said Liang admitted to using the software while working on the diesel engine and \"assisted in making the defeat device work.\" \n Volkswagen said in a statement that it is \"continuing to cooperate with the U.S. Department of Justice,\" but couldn't comment on the indictment. \n In 2008, Liang transferred to the U.S. to help launch Volkswagen's new \"clean diesel\" vehicles, according to the plea agreement. While working at VW's test facility in Oxnard, Calif., he served as \"leader of diesel competence.\"  \n According to the plea agreement, Liang said he and his co-conspirators \"misrepresented\" that the VW diesel vehicles met U.S. emissions standards during certification meetings for new cars with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board and \"hid the existence of the defeat device from regulators.\" \n According to court papers, Liang and his fellow engineers did not stop at creating the defeat devices \u2014 they improved them. \n As the engines aged, Volkswagen noticed increasing complaints about parts and components breaking down. \n Engineers believed that the spike in warranty claims was \"a result of the vehicle operating in 'testing mode' too long rather than switching to 'road mode,'\" prosecutors wrote. \n To blunt the claims, Liang and his fellow employees upgraded the defeat device to help cars better recognize when they no longer were being tested. Volkswagen then pushed the software update out to unwitting customers, claiming it was intended to improve their cars and never mentioning it was partly to cheat emissions tests. \n Liang and his co-conspirators continued to lie to the EPA and state Air Resources Board, even after regulatory agencies started to raise questions about the vehicles' performance, the plea agreement says. \n The scandal erupted last September when the Air Resources Board and the EPA said they had discovered the software in certain 2-liter VW diesel vehicles. In regular driving, they said, the vehicles spew up to 40 times the legally allowed amount of nitrogen oxide. \n Regulators later said the defeat devices also were installed in some Volkswagen and Audi 3-liter diesel vehicles as well. \n Volkswagen in June agreed to pay up to $14.7 billion to settle government allegations in the U.S. linked to its cheating on emissions tests and to buy back or terminate the leases of nearly half a million of its cars. \n The German automaker will spend up to $10 billion to buy back or modify VW and Audi 2.0-liter diesel vehicles in the U.S. It also will pay $2.7 billion into a trust to support environmental programs and reduce emissions. The settlement was reached with the Justice Department, state attorneys general and other agencies, as well as car owners. \n The agreements represented the largest settlement in U.S. history with an automaker. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times  \n ", "author": "By Samantha Masunaga Los Angeles Times", "title": "Volkswagen engineer pleads guilty in U.S. in emissions scandal"}

Members of an international environmental group are voting on a proposal to urge leaders in every country to close domestic ivory markets. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Conference attendees walk by a display of elephants and other wildlife at The International Union for Conservation of Nature World Conservation Congress today in Honolulu. Members of the international environmental group are voting on a proposal to urge leaders in every country to close domestic ivory markets as the savanna elephant population in Africa declines. \n Members of an international environmental group were considering a proposal today to urge leaders in every country to close domestic ivory markets that threaten elephants.  \n Ivory trading is banned internationally, but domestic trade within countries is legal nearly everywhere. \n The International Union for Conservation of Nature plans to vote on the plan at the World Conservation Congress in Honolulu. Some members of the global group of government and nonprofit representatives don't want a ban, and the vote was delayed when they filed a complaint saying their concerns had not been heard. \n \"Some governments just don't see the reality of the crisis that the countries of central and East Africa are facing right now,\" said Susan Lieberman, vice president for international conservation at the Wildlife Conservation Society. \"This is about saying to all governments, 'Make it so people can't buy ivory, because that's the only thing that's going to stop the organized criminals who are causing the poaching of elephants.'\" \n If the group passes the proposal, it won't have the power to enforce it. Each country would have to enact laws individually, but the group's policy experts could help countries craft laws. \n \"While the resolutions are not international law, in many cases, they are the genesis of international agreements,\" said Enrique Lahmann, global director of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \n The number of savanna elephants in Africa is rapidly declining and the animals are in danger of being wiped out because of the ivory trade, according to a recent study, which said the population plummeted by about 30 percent from 2007 to 2014 and is declining at about 8 percent a year. \n Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Paul Allen funded the aerial survey that covered 18 countries using dozens of airplanes and involved 90 scientists. \n The United States announced a near-total ban on the domestic sale of African elephant ivory in June. \n \"We're talking about the extinction of elephants,\" said Joseph Moravec, law student at Pace University and voting member of the conservation congress. \"Ivory markets are going to close one way or the other, whether it's us closing them when the elephant is still alive, or they're going to close in a few years when these species are still extinct and there's no more ivory left.\" \n Meetings to work out disagreements about the ivory ban proposal were closed to the press Wednesday and Friday, and conference organizers did not release the names of the representatives or countries who delayed the vote. \n The IUCN has 1,300 members from more than 160 countries. For a measure to pass, more than half of the eligible members must be voting, and a majority of the votes must support the measure. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "IUCN to vote on urging countries to close ivory markets"}

Judge Michael Bohren appointed two doctors to examine the girl, who sat silently during the proceedings. The judge ordered the doctors to turn in a report on her mental status by Oct. 6. \n Weier and 14-year-old Morgan Geyser each face one count of first-degree attempted intentional homicide as adults for allegedly luring classmate Payton Leutner into a wooded area and repeatedly stabbing her in May 2014. All three girls were 12 years old at the time. \n Anyone age 10 or older who faces that charge in Wisconsin is automatically considered an adult. If convicted, each girl would face up to 40 years in prison and 20 years on extended supervision. Geyser pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect last month. \n Weier's attorney, Maura McMahon, said after the hearing that she was no longer trying to get the case moved to juvenile court, a fight that had been ongoing since Weier and Geyser were taken into custody. Geyser's attorney said last month he'd given up on moving her case after exhausting nearly all legal avenues. \n The Associated Press initially chose not to name the girls in case they were tried in juvenile court, where proceedings are secret and penalties aren't nearly as harsh. In juvenile court, the girls could have been incarcerated for three years and supervised until they turned 18, and their records would have been sealed. \n Moving forward in adult court, the girls would be committed to a mental hospital indefinitely if defense attorneys and prosecutors agree they suffer from a mental disease, McMahon said. If a dispute arises over their mental states, a hearing would ensue and a jury would ultimately make the decision. \n Prosecutors allege that the girls planned for months to kill Leutner, either to gain favor with Slender Man and earn positions as his servants or to avoid his wrath. The girls lured Leutner to a park in Waukesha, a town west of Milwaukee, following a sleepover. Investigators say the girls stabbed Leutner 19 times before fleeing, and Leutner crawled to a road where a bicyclist found her. \n Weier and Geyser were captured on the outskirts of Waukesha. They said they were walking to a national forest in northern Wisconsin where they planned to join Slender Man at his mansion, investigators allege. \n Both girls have asked Bohren for a jury from outside Waukesha County if the cases go to trial, citing heavy media coverage.

{"date": "September 9, 2016", "text": "FLORIDA TODAY VIA AP \n The damaged SpaceX launch complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida is seen on Thursday. A Sept. 1 accident destroyed a SpaceX Falcon rocket and its payload during a test on the launch pad. \n CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. \u00bb SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk is calling last week's launch pad accident the \"most difficult and complex failure\" in the company's 14-year history.  \n After a week of public silence, Musk said via Twitter that the company is still investigating the accident, its second in just 15 months. \n A massive fireball erupted during a prelaunch test Sept. 1 at the company's main launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Falcon rocket and a satellite were destroyed, and the pad was damaged. Ground crews were fueling the Falcon for a brief test-firing of its engines, two days before its scheduled liftoff. \n The blast rocked the launch pad \u2014 which had been cleared of workers for the test-firing \u2014 and shook buildings several miles away at NASA's neighboring Kennedy Space Center. The sound of explosions continued for several minutes and black smoke billowed into the morning sky. \n Particularly puzzling, according to Musk, is \"the quieter bang\" heard a few seconds before what he is calling a fireball, not an explosion. He said the bang may have come from the rocket or something else. \n \"Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation,\" he said in a tweet. \"Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.\" \n In the immediate aftermath, Musk said the trouble appeared to originate around the upper stage's oxygen tank. He made no mention of that in his tweets posted early Friday EDT. \n When pressed for further information Friday, the California-based SpaceX said there was nothing new to share for now. \n \"We are continuing to thoroughly investigate last week's loss of Falcon 9, with support from the FAA, NASA, the U.S. Air Force and industry experts,\" SpaceX spokesman Dex Torricke-Barton said in an email Friday. \"Our priority is to safely and reliably return to flight.\" \n The core investigation team consists of about 20 people, more than half of them representing federal agencies and industry. SpaceX's vice president for flight reliability, Hans Koenigsmann, is heading it up. \n SpaceX is urging anyone with audio, photos or video of the accident to send the material to reportspacex.com for use in the investigation. \n \"Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation,\" Musk said on Twitter. \"Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.\" \n A co-founder of PayPal, the 45-year-old Musk also runs Tesla Motors, the electric car maker, and is chairman of SolarCity, a solar energy company. \n His private space company had been on a roll, with eight launches already accomplished in 2016, two of them space station supply runs for NASA. The company had also, last December, pulled off the world's first landing of a booster rocket used in an orbital mission, and had been repeating the success. It was planning to use a recycled rocket for an upcoming satellite launch. \n SpaceX was attempting to catch up on launches following an accident in June 2015 that grounded the Falcon 9 rocket for six months. That accident, two minutes into a delivery mission for the International Space Station, was blamed on a support strut that broke loose inside the upper stage. The issue was said to have been fixed. \n Now, with more than 70 launches in the wings worth $10 billion, SpaceX said it can rely on its two other launch pads if necessary, one at Kennedy and one in California, once the Falcon rocket is ready to fly again. Both pads are undergoing construction and should be ready soon. \n Facebook had planned to use the lost satellite \u2014 an Israeli-made communications satellite \u2014 to expand internet service in Africa. \n For now, NASA isn't saying much publicly about the SpaceX mishap. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start ferrying astronauts to the space station; even before SpaceX's Sept. 1 accident, next year's targeted launch date had been in jeopardy. \n \"Clearly this incident is a setback for SpaceX,\" said Dale Skran, the National Space Society's executive vice president. At the same time, he noted in a statement earlier this week that NASA was wise to hire multiple companies for cargo and crew transport, not only from a competitive standpoint but for backup. \n At the time of the explosion, NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft was just a mile away, awaiting its own launch to chase down an asteroid. Both NASA and rocket maker United Launch Alliance conducted extra checks to make certain nothing was damaged by the blast before Thursday's successful liftoff. \n NASA launch director Tim Dunn was sympathetic and earlier in the week praised SpaceX's resilience. \"It's nothing that any of us ever want to see,\" he said. \"However, it is part of our business that has very harsh consequences.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "SpaceX accident 'most difficult and complex' in its history"}

There have been 150 shootings and 47 homicides so far this year in the city. \n LOS ANGELES TIMES / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n Firefighters and paramedics extricate Alejandro Herrera, 28, from his Honda after he was shot while sitting in his car at an intersection on Aug. 10 in San Bernardino, Calif. Herrera died at the hospital. \n LOS ANGELES TIMES / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n A San Bernardino Police police officer searched an alleged burglar suspects with gang affiliations on July 29 in San Bernardino, Calif. \n SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. \u00bb The sound of gunfire and sirens drew about a dozen people out of their homes on San Bernardino's west side one recent Wednesday night.  \n A beat-up Honda sat in the street \u2014 a small cross dangling from the rearview mirror, two bullet holes in the door. Rescue workers pulled Alejandro Herrera, 28, from the driver's seat and wheeled him into an ambulance. \n \"The other day, they killed someone down the street,\" said a middle-aged woman, leaning against a fence next to her husband. All around this part of the city, she said, there are candlelight memorials to victims of violence. \n \"Before, we would hear about killings every once in a while. Now, there are so many,\" she said, asking that her name not be published for fear of becoming a victim herself. \n A few days later, in a neighborhood less than two miles away, investigators pulled the body of Jose De La Torre, 24, from the trunk of a Nissan. \n The next night, Shonta Edwards, 33, was shot to death outside an apartment complex about half a mile from there. \n And soon enough, Herrera, who died at the hospital, had his own candlelight memorial on the sidewalk in the neighborhood where he was shot. \n :: \n San Bernardino, still healing from the Dec. 2 terror attack, has seen a surge in violence this year unlike any it has faced in decades. With four months left in 2016, there have been 150 shootings and 47 slayings in the city of 216,000 residents. It had 44 homicides all of last year, including the 14 people killed by terrorists at the Inland Regional Center. \n The city is now on track to have more murders than in any year since 1995, when 67 people were killed, and there is no clear explanation why. \n Residents and officials point to a police force hobbled by budget cuts and attrition. But the budget situation was bad last year too, and the homicide rate was far lower. \n San Bernardino has had about as many homicides as Oakland, which has nearly twice the population. San Jose, almost five times more populous than San Bernardino, has had 35 killings. \n If the current pace continues, San Bernardino will end the year with a homicide rate of about 31 per 100,000 residents. Chicago's rate last year was about 18; Los Angeles had seven. \n In addition to the 47 homicides, three people have been killed by police. \n \"Our city right now is bad,\" said resident Aguadia Brown, 27, whose cousin, a friend and his son all were killed this year. \"It's like everyone is on edge, and nobody really knows how we're going to fix this.\" \n The killings have disproportionately victimized the city's black residents, who account for 14 percent of the population but nearly half of those killed. Certain neighborhoods have been affected, but the mayhem has occurred throughout the city. \n Police Chief Jarrod Burguan says the city has been especially hard hit by state initiatives that reduced some drug and property-related felonies to misdemeanors, leading to shorter sentences for criminals. \n Others say the city's dearth of economic opportunities, its years of cuts to diversion programs and a lack of other basic services \u2014 such as working street lights in many neighborhoods \u2014 have contributed to this year's violence. \n Because of San Bernardino's financial turmoil, which began even before it declared bankruptcy in 2012, the size of the Police Department has been reduced repeatedly over the years. \n The ranks have gotten so thin that officers who specialize in drugs, gangs and traffic enforcement have been reassigned to patrol just to keep up with calls for service. \n \"We're not getting to calls fast enough,\" Burguan said. \"We don't have the capacity to investigate everything that's reported in the city.\" \n The Dec. 2 attack turned the world's eyes toward San Bernardino. And the presidential election has made it an ongoing political talking point. \n But even as its name has come to symbolize the dangers Americans face at the hands of terrorists, the city is suffering a mounting nightly toll with little attention from the outside. \n :: \n On a Friday night in June, Det. Ernest Luna and Officer Brian Olvera drove through town in a patrol car, a rifle mounted between them. \n They had been pulled off their regular gang detail to patrol the streets for a 45-day operation aimed at calming the surge of violence. The city also paid four county deputies to beef up its numbers during that period. \n As they wound their way through San Bernardino, Luna said officers who won widespread support after the terrorist attack at the Inland Regional Center now struggle to get information from residents that might help solve or prevent violence. \n \"During IRC, it seemed like everyone loved us,\" Luna said. \"But it's kind of gone back to how it was. \n \"A lot of times, they're scared,\" he added. \"They have to live in the neighborhood.\" \n Fewer than 40 percent of this year's homicides have been solved. \n In one neighborhood, Luna and Olvera drove past a corner where a long-established gang had painted two tall, elaborate murals of the Virgin of Guadalupe and the Aztec calendar \u2014 each emblazoned with the gang's name in massive letters. \n The brazen graffiti on the walls of two neighborhood stores is a vivid reminder of the city's dwindling resources. \n In 2008, there were more than 340 police officers on the force. Today, there are about 215. \n The gang unit used to be twice its size, Luna said. \n The department has fewer officers per capita than nearby Riverside and Ontario, neither of which have comparable problems with violence. \n Burguan said he needs about 300 officers to comfortably meet the city's basic service needs \u2014 more, he said, if city officials expect to blunt violence through sheer police presence. \n The city is trying to make do as it prepares to emerge from bankruptcy later this year. \n The Police Department is trying to fill about 30 vacancies and is hoping for a federal grant to add 11 officers. But the hiring process is slow. \n In the meantime, officers are busy. \n Before their shift was over, Luna and Olvera stopped to talk with the mother of four young gang members about one of her son's Facebook posts and responded to a man exposing himself at a convenience store. \n They stopped a group of young men drinking beers outside an east-side neighborhood and entered their names on gang identification cards. They helped search for and arrested a teenager who they heard had pulled a gun on people in an apartment complex. \n And nearby, officers responded to a stabbing that \u2014 two weeks later, when the victim died \u2014 would become another homicide. \n :: \n Two days before Herrera was killed, a few dozen clergy members, residents and activists gathered to call for an end to the violence. \n They began in front of St. Bernardine Church, the city's oldest Catholic parish, and walked two-by-two to City Hall, about a half-mile away, shouting, \"Alive and free is what we want to be.\" \n When they reached the steps of City Hall, a woman read aloud the names of San Bernardino's homicide victims. \n \"John Black.\" \n \"We remember you,\" the crowd replied. \n \"Rayshawn Sandy.\" \n \"We remember you.\" \n The march and recitation of names are a monthly ritual organized by Inland Congregations United for Change, a coalition of local religious groups and others that has been pushing the city to do more to stop the killings. \n Organizer Sergio Luna, a father of two young children who has lived in San Bernardino for 17 years, says the violence weighs on the entire community. \n \"Knowing there's a few shootings within a few blocks from your house,\" he said, \"that brings a psychological toll.\" \n While the death toll is particularly high this year, Luna said that for years, San Bernardino has had a high homicide rate that went largely ignored. \n After the terror attack, he said, \"all of a sudden, everyone cared about mass shootings in San Bernardino. But we've been crying about urban gun violence for many years.\" \n Since 2014, when there were 43 homicides \u2014 about one every eight days \u2014 the group has been pushing the city to adopt Operation Ceasefire, a program used in cities around the nation to reduce homicides by reaching out preemptively to those at risk of violence. \n \"We cannot only prioritize first responders after violence takes place if we're not prioritizing preventing violence from taking place in the first place,\" Luna said. \n Burguan, the police chief, said that earlier this year, the city was turned down for a state grant to help fund Operation Ceasefire. \n The decision made Burguan wonder whether the city is alone in its battle against killings, he said. \n \"Who really is that concerned about San Bernardino? Or are people at the state level happy letting San Bernardino drown in this stuff?\" he said. \"We clearly have the most significant crime spike of any place in the state, and all that money went elsewhere.\" \n City Manager Mark Scott said San Bernardino is looking for other private or government grants to fund Operation Ceasefire, which he estimates would cost about $500,000. The city agreed to spend $175,000 on it. \n :: \n On a hot evening in July, a man waiting outside a liquor store on the east side shot 9-year-old Travon Williams, his father and another man. The boy had spent the afternoon swimming with his dad. \n Travon's family didn't have the money to pay for his burial. \n So in a ritual that has been enacted after many of the city's homicides, Travon's family and friends, and those of his father, spent hours in restaurant parking lots, washing cars and soliciting donations from passing drivers. \n On a 104-degree day, they hosted a park barbecue that from afar might have been mistaken for a birthday party. They sold snow cones and popcorn and T-shirts with a photo of Travon and his father, superimposed with angel wings. \n It was more than just a fundraiser, family members said. It was a call to the community to gather, to draw some attention to the onslaught of violence that had now claimed the life of a fourth-grader. \n \"It's not even just because of my nephew, but because of all the killings that happened before him and all the ones that have happened after,\" said Travon's aunt, Erica Newman. \"We're trying to stop all this killing.\" \n When the day of the funeral came, hundreds of mourners filled the Way World Outreach, a large church not far from Cal State San Bernardino. \n Father-and-son caskets were covered with red, white and blue flowers. Travon's younger sisters wore red, white and blue barrettes. \n Toward the end of the service, mourners began a procession past the caskets. Many were in their 20s and held small children by the hand or babies in their arms. They visibly struggled to walk past the slain 9-year-old boy. \n The pastor walked to the front of the room and leaned into a microphone. \n \"This is not normal,\" he said emphatically. \"It's not normal to see mothers cry, aunties cry, because their children are killed. \n \"This is enough, Lord, of young people losing their lives.

{"date": "September 9, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden testified on Capitol Hill on July 13 in Washington, D.C. Frieden, the head of the government's fight against the Zika virus said that \"we are now essentially out of money\" and warned that the country is \"about to see a bunch of kids born with microcephaly\" in the coming months. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb The head of the government's fight against the Zika virus said that \"we are now essentially out of money\" and warned that the country is \"about to see a bunch of kids born with microcephaly\" in the coming months. \n Today's warning from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden came as lawmakers start to sort out a stopgap government funding bill that is being targeted to also carry long-delayed money to battle Zika. \n Zika is spreading more widely in the U.S. and can not only cause microcephaly \u2014 in which babies are born with grave brain defects \u2014 but other problems that the country will face for decades. And 671 pregnant women in the states and Washington, D.C., have the virus, leading to the birth of 17 babies with microcephaly so far. \n Frieden said funding delays have slowed long-term studies of the disease and production of new tests for it. \"We haven't been able to get a running start\" on a long-term battle against Zika, he said. \n Frieden added that \"we don't like to see\" the use of pesticides such as this morning's spraying of naled, in Miami Beach. But, he said, new technologies for the application of such toxic chemicals are safe for humans. The two localized mosquito-borne outbreaks in Miami are \"quite difficult to control,\" Frieden said, adding that the type of mosquitoes that spread Zika \"are the cockroach of mosquitoes.\" \n President Barack Obama in February requested $1.9 billion to fight Zika, but Republicans controlling Congress acted slowly on the request. A Capitol Hill fight this summer stalled the Zika aid. Republicans attached restrictions on any of the money going to affiliates of Planned Parenthood in Puerto Rico. Democrats objected and blocked the $1.1 billion measure. \n In the interim, the administration has shifted about $650 million from other accounts to battle Zika, most of it unused money approved two years ago to fight Ebola. That money is almost gone. \n Now, negotiations are underway to break the impasse over Zika and add it to the only piece of legislation that has to pass Congress before the election: A stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown on Oct. 1. \n Democrats and the White House have greater leverage now since their approval is needed for the stopgap spending bill, and Republicans are signaling they'll likely lift the restrictions on delivering contraception, treatment and care through Planned Parenthood, an organization that many Republicans loathe since it is a major provider of abortion. \n A bipartisan consensus is emerging to fund the government through mid-December, though some House tea party conservatives are opposed and want a longer duration for the measure to avert a lame duck session of Congress. \n Since the summertime impasse, Zika has spread even more widely, and frustration is mounting from lawmakers representing affected areas. Almost 3,000 people in the continental U.S. have been found to have Zika, and the total is far higher since most people don't display symptoms. The figures including Puerto Rico and the other territories are much worse. \n \"Look if we don't, then fire all of us,\" said Florida GOP Rep. David Jolly, whose state is bearing the brunt of the disease in the continental U.S. \"If we can't get Zika funding by the end of September then we're nothing but a bunch of idiots up here.\" \n \"I think we'll look at this delay in time and say, 'How could they have waited so long?' This was so urgent. It was the very definition of an emergency,\" Frieden said. \"Not only is this unanticipated, it's unprecedented. It's potentially catastrophic, and it's certainly that for the kind of brain damage we're seeing.\" \n Frieden noted that it is extremely unusual to have a new cause for a severe birth defect and that the health care system will be grappling with the effects of Zika for years. While microcephaly is the most immediate result of the outbreak, Frieden noted that infants are having problems swallowing and with their vision and hearing. \n \"We don't know what congenital Zika syndrome will look like,\" Frieden said. \"We will likely be dealing with this for decades to come.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "CDC Director: 'Essentially out of money' to fight Zika"}

Hancock County Coroner Jim Faulk said Chief DeNardo died Thursday. \n BAY ST. LOUIS, Miss. \u00bb A Mississippi police chief killed himself soon after learning that authorities were investigating allegations he illegally sold city-owned firearms, including an assault rifle, a sheriff's official said today. \n Hancock County Chief Deputy Don Bass told The Associated Press that Bay St. Louis police chief Mike DeNardo illegally sold one city-owned assault rifle, and that authorities were looking into allegations that other city-owned weapons were sold as well. \n Sheriff Ricky Adam said a \"multipoint investigation\" had been going on for four months and included payroll fraud, the Sun Herald reported. The police chief left three apology letters \u2014 to the sheriff, the mayor and one other unspecified person \u2014 for the payroll fraud, Adam said. Those were turned over to the FBI. \n These are the latest developments in a case that has shocked many in this small, tourist-friendly beach community. \n On Thursday, hours after DeNardo killed himself in the police station's parking lot, the mayor had said the chief was under investigation. A federal official also had said investigators received \"unsubstantiated criminal intelligence\" about DeNardo. But until now, there were no details of what the investigation concerned. \n Bass said the investigation started from an anonymous tip and was in its early stages. He lamented the death of a man who he said was well-regarded around town. \n \"We can't get his side of the story,\" Bass said. \"It's terribly upsetting. We're in shock.\" \n It wasn't clear if the buyer knew the sale was illegal, and Bass said he could not discuss whether the weapon was evidence from a case or had been purchased for the department's use. \n DeNardo was informed of the investigation Thursday at city police headquarters, where he was suspended from his duties by city officials who were confiscating his equipment. He then went to the parking lot, retrieved a shotgun from his trunk and shot himself, Bass said. \n Earlier Friday, Jason Denham, the resident agent in charge for the Gulfport field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said the agency received \"unsubstantiated criminal intelligence\" about DeNardo only a day or two before his death. They had not yet opened a formal investigation and had not approached him or confronted him about the allegations. \n He said barring DeNardo's death, the agency would have moved forward to confirm or dispel the intelligence. He could not give details on what the intelligence was about. \n Mayor Les Fillingame told The Associated Press on Thursday that he believed DeNardo would have been cleared of any wrongdoing. \n DeNardo also appears to have been grieving a personal loss. Doug Seal, a member of the city council, said today that DeNardo's mother had passed away last week, and he had been away for her services. \n As the beachside bars and restaurants prepared for the weekend influx of tourists, no one could fathom why DeNardo would take his own life. They knew little of the events before he killed himself \u2014 his suspension without pay pending an investigation by the Hancock County Sheriff's Office or his recent family loss. \n Cafe owner Alicein Schwabacher knew him as a strong but soft-spoken man, a lover of veggie burgers, who ran a good police department and was \"loved by the community.\" \n At the Mockingbird Cafe, executive chef Julie Ragusa spent the morning preparing freshly baked muffins for delivery, along with fresh coffee, to the grieving police department. \n \"It's tragic and it's sad and this is such a small, tight-knit community it affects a lot of people,\" Ragusa said. \n Ragusa was gassing up her car near the police station Thursday when a sudden onslaught of police cars and other emergency vehicles rushed by. \n \"I honestly thought they were running some kind of drill,\" she said. \n During an emergency city council meeting Thursday, the council turned control of the police department over to the sheriff's department. The Sun-Herald reported that the move was temporary, as the city goes through a tumultuous period. \n An interim replacement for DeNardo has been named but will report to the sheriff's department. \n DeNardo had been with the department since 2004, according to the department's website. The mayor appointed him police chief in 2010. Before coming to Bay St. Louis, DeNardo worked for 18 years at the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office in Louisiana, the website said. \n DeNardo's death hit especially hard in this city, which bounced back from bleak devastation 11 years ago when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. \n \"So much healing has taken place here. I don't know what he was dealing with, that he felt he had no one to reach out to,\" Schwabacher said. \"He was loved by the community.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Official: Police chief investigated for illegal gun sales"}

The Peugeot 607 \u2014 its hazard lights flashing \u2014 contained gas canisters, a blanket with traces of fuel, and a burned-out cigarette. No detonators were found. \n Among three women arrested together Thursday was Ines Madani, a 19-year-old whose father owned the Peugeot, Molina said. Her written pledge of allegiance to the Islamic State was found by police, he added. \n Also arrested in the raid was a 39-year-old woman, identified as Amel S., and her oldest daughter was detained in the suburb of Clichy-Sous-Bois, authorities said. Another woman, arrested earlier in the week, also remained in custody. \n One fiance, Larossi Abballa, killed two police officials in Magnanville in June and filmed the aftermath on Facebook Live before dying in a police raid, he said. \n The other was Adel Kermiche, who slit the throat of the Rev. Jacques Hamel, 85, during morning Mass in July in the northwestern town of Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, he added. Kermiche and another attacker were shot to death by police. \n Molins didn't say when she was engaged to either man. \n He said Sarah H., who was shot in the leg during the raid, had stabbed a police officer through the open window of a car, while Ines stabbed another officer as she tried to escape. \n In video shot by a neighbor, a veiled woman whose face was uncovered is seen being carried away by police as she cried out in Arabic: \"God is great!\" \n Madani's father flagged his daughter to police Sunday, 14 hours after his car was discovered. Since then, authorities have worked frantically to untangle the relationships among the group and thwart what they increasingly feared was another plot. \n Ines Madani was one of five sisters and had already tried to leave for Syria before, Molins said. \n More than a third of the nearly 700 French citizens who have reached Iraq and Syria are women, according to government figures. Officials have said for months that adolescent girls and young women are increasingly being recruited by IS in France. \n Women in the Islamic State have not traditionally taken part in attacks, said Matthieu Suc, author of \"Wives of Jihadis.\" \n They are there \"to ensure the longevity of the caliphate\" by having children and providing moral support, Suc told France Info radio. \n But he added that \"there are often young girls, who are just as radicalized as the young men, and they also want the status of martyr, and they want to act.\" \n Security around Paris was visibly higher Friday amid the investigation. \n A bomb squad with dogs and a scanner was deployed when a gas canister with a timer but no detonator was found outside a police station Friday morning in the suburb town of La Plaine Saint Denis, just north of Paris, and one kilometer (a half-mile) from the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, a local police official said. \n The possibility of car bombs increasingly worries French security officials. \"We risk facing a new kind of attack: A terrorist campaign characterized by explosive devices in places where there are crowds,\" Hollande told lawmakers in May. \n In a sign of fraying nerves, the son of a gas delivery driver was detained briefly because he had canisters in his car.

Frederic Labrunye, commander of the provincial gendarmerie group of Haute-Savoie. \"By the volume of people to rescue \u2013 we rarely rescue 110 people at the same time in high mountain \u2013 and by the environment in which it happens \u2026 in the heart of one of the largest glaciers in Europe, over a distance of five kilometers of cable with 36 cabins.\" \n Helicopters had to carefully fly over the cables, which is risky itself, then lower a rescuer onto an area \"not larger than a table,\" strap on passengers one by one and extract them, he said, describing it as \"air surgery.\" \n Then fog descended and darkness started to fall, and authorities called off the helicopter rescue. \n So they switched to \"Plan B,\" Fournier said. \n Mountain guides identified the cable cars closest to the ground, and used climbing ropes to carry passengers to the surface of the glacier below, one by one. \n From there, rescuers brought the passengers by foot to the nearest mountain station. \n Fournier said 65 people were rescued overall Thursday, and another 12 were brought down overnight using \"Plan B.\" \n The remaining 33 people were in cable cars too high off the ground, so they stayed overnight. They included a 7-year-old and 9-year-old from Korea and a 10-year-old Italian child. \n \"They didn't get a lot of sleep, it was a strange experience, but they were warm under blankets and with their families,\" Fournier said. \n Five rescuers stayed overnight in the cable cars and provided blankets, food and water to help weather the chilly mountain night-time conditions. \n Kathy Cook, a tourist from Michigan who was carried down to the ground by a rescuer after almost 10 hours aloft, called it \"really quite an experience.\" \n \"The helicopter rescue failed because the fog moved in, so we had to just wait and then they decided they could belay us safely to the ground, and we walked up the glacier to the hut,\" she said upon arrival in Courmayeur. \n The cable car, which offers spectacular up-close views of Western Europe's tallest mountains and deep valleys below, connects the Aiguille de Midi peak in France, at 3,842 meters (12,605 feet), to Pointe Helbronner in Italy, at 3,462 meters (11,358 feet). \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Charlton reported from Paris.
