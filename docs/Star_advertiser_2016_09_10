{"date": "September 10, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n North Koreans watch a news report regarding a nuclear test on a large screen outside the Pyongyang Station in Pyongyang, North Korea. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> North Korea's latest nuclear test, its most powerful to date, is a game-changer \u2026 according to North Korea. \n As with anything reported by Pyongyang, an authoritarian state run by a third-generation dictator who allows zero dissent or outside investigation, there's reason to be skeptical. But even if the North's assertion that it has rounded a crucial corner in nuclear development is more rhetoric than real, the content of its claim holds some important clues about where the country's atomic efforts may be heading. \n In a meeting in Seoul on Saturday, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se said that Friday's test showed that North Korea's nuclear capacity has reached a \"considerable level\" after quickly progressing in the past 10 years. \n The newest test by North Korea raises many big questions, including: \n WHAT DID NORTH KOREA ACCOMPLISH? \n North Korea says its \"standardization\" of a warhead will allow it to produce \"at will and as many as it wants a variety of smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear warheads of higher strike power.\" This puts \"on a higher level (the North's) technology of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic rockets.\" \n It may indicate North Korea feels it can confidently build miniaturized warheads, mass-produce those weapons and then deploy them on ballistic missiles. \n If so, Pyongyang has developed a unified design for nuclear weapons that could be used on a variety of its ballistic missiles, including Scuds, midrange Rodong and Musudan missiles, and submarine-launched missiles, said Kim Dae Young, a military expert at South Korea's Korea Defense and Security Forum. \n Combine that with everything scientists have learned from the four previous tests and North Korea may now have nuclear weapons capable of attacking its Asian neighbors, said nuclear expert Whang Joo-ho of Kyung Hee University in South Korea. \n Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association, provided a similar assessment, saying that North Korea is either at or very close to the point where they can arm short-range ballistic missiles with a nuclear warhead. \n \"The cumulative knowledge of the five nuclear test explosions and the dozens of ballistic missile tests, especially in the last 12 months, are giving their technical people greater confidence that they can deploy warheads on their ballistic missiles. If they have not reached that capability today, they certainly will relatively soon with further nuclear test explosions and ballistic missile tests,\" he said. \n Whatever the state of the program, one thing is clear: The fifth test was the most powerful to date. \n Seoul said the magnitude-5.0 seismic event dwarfs the four past quakes associated with North Korean nuclear tests. Artificial seismic waves measuring 3.9 were reported after North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006, for instance, and a 4.8 was reported from its fourth test this January. \n The explosive yield of Friday's blast would have been 10 to 12 kilotons, or 70 to 80 percent of the force of the 15-kiloton atomic bomb the United States dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945, according to South Korea's weather agency. The North's fourth test, in January, was an estimated 6 kilotons. \n This power strongly indicates a legitimate advance. \n \"If previous tests were conducted with the purpose of acquiring the nuclear bomb, the newest test shows that the North finally owns a real, weaponized nuclear bomb,\" Kim said. \n The RAND National Defense Research Institute, a federally funded U.S. think tank, said in a 2010 report that the detonation of a 10-kilton nuclear weapon in the South Korean capital of Seoul could cause more than 200,000 deaths and would easily overwhelm doctors and beds in hospitals throughout the country. \n WHAT CAN IT BUILD NOW? \n The big question, though, is whether Pyongyang can make warheads small and light enough to be armed on a missile that can reach the mainland United States \u2014 much more advanced technology. \n Kimball from the Arms Control Association said North Korea has not yet demonstrated the ability to launch a medium- or long-range missile that can re-enter the Earth's atmosphere and is still years away from having an intercontinental ballistic missile that can deliver a nuclear warhead that can hit the continental U.S. \n If the North has mastered miniaturization, the next step would be making and stamping bombs that can be put on warheads. \n But how many? \n North Korea is a very poor country and has much less to work with than, for instance, the United States and Soviet Union did in their nascent nuclear stages. This means that Pyongyang likely can't develop different warheads for different missiles. \n Much also depends on how much nuclear fuel the country has. \n Estimates vary, but North Korea may have about 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of weapons-grade plutonium, according to a 2014 South Korean report, which is enough for about seven atomic bombs. \n But Pyongyang also has a highly enriched uranium program, which is much more easily concealed and which outsiders know very little about; if that program is advanced, the North could have much more fuel for bomb-building. \n Stephen Schwartz, an independent nuclear weapons expert, said that North Korea's statement about the test suggested that the detonated nuclear device employed a composite fissile core that used both plutonium and highly enriched uranium, which, if true, would enable the North to build more nuclear weapons than would be otherwise possible with plutonium or uranium alone. \n ARE MORE TESTS COMING? \n It's a possibility. \n New tests would help improve the design of North Korean warheads and develop a stronger \"boosted\" hybrid bomb, which uses some nuclear fusion fuel with conventional uranium or plutonium fuel to achieve a larger explosive force, said Lee Choon Geun, an analyst at South Korea's Science and Technology Policy Institute. \n But North Korea has vowed to pursue both nuclear and economic development. \n This test, portrayed as an overwhelming success, could allow the North to turn more attention to its moribund economy and a population that often struggles to find enough to eat. \n WHAT'S RHETORIC? WHAT'S REAL? \n Some outsiders were struck by the name of the agency that announced the nuclear test, something called the Nuclear Weapons Institute, which hasn't appeared previously in North Korean media. \n This important-sounding institute may be a way for Pyongyang to play up another important goal: that it considers itself a full-fledged nuclear weapons state, despite a refusal by Washington, Seoul and others to accept the North in this role. \n From a purely propaganda point of view, the North's statement Friday satisfies an important requirement: It portrays a strong, proud country led by a great leader. \n Whether the North's announcement of its test is simply the same mixture of boast, threat and propaganda that characterizes much of what North Korea chooses to show in its tightly controlled state media, or a major nuclear advancement, the picture that the North paints for the world may be as important as what actually happened. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Rhetoric or real?

{"date": "September 10, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Brock Turner at the Greene County Sheriff's Office in Xenia, Ohio, where he officially registered as a sex offender. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> When ex-Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner became a registered sex offender for life last Tuesday, he joined a nationwide list of registered sex criminals that has grown dramatically in recent years to more than 800,000. \n Even some who have denounced Turner's six-month jail sentence as too lenient for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman question whether he should spend his life with the stigma and onerous restrictions of a registered sex offender. \n They join a growing number of defense attorneys, advocates and judges who are questioning the fairness of applying lifetime, blanket restrictions to expanding definitions of sex crimes that frequently treat first-time offenders the same as serial rapists. \n In California, Florida, South Carolina and Alabama it's impossible for people convicted of any sex crime to be removed from the online registries showing their pictures, addresses, convictions and probation details. Offenders have been turned into victims themselves when they are targeted in vigilante attacks or can't find jobs or places to live, critics say. \n Stanford University law professor Michele Dauber, who lambasted Turner's sentence as too lenient and is leading a campaign to oust the judge who imposed, said requiring the 21-year-old man to be registered as a sex offender until he dies may be too harsh. \n \"No one should be defined by their worst decision for the rest of their life,\" Dauber said in an interview. \"Deciding who should be removed, which cases or crimes should qualify would require thoughtful legislation, a fair process and, of course, an unbiased judge.\" \n Dauber stressed there are many criminals who deserve lifetime registration, but said at some point after at least 10 years on the registry Turner should be given a chance to get off it by proving he has successfully rehabilitated himself. \n Turner was released from jail Sept. 2 and moved to his parent's home in Bellbrook, Ohio, registering as a sex offender at the Greene County sheriff's office four days after his release from a California jail for good behavior after serving half his sentence. Protesters demonstrated in front of the home before and after his arrival and Turner's parents told police eggs were thrown at the house. \n Advocates for sex crime victims insist that lifetime registries make the public safer by preventing offender recidivism and giving citizens and police access to crucial information on the whereabouts of sex offenders and where they are prohibited from going \u2014 like schools and other areas frequented by children. Access to that information in 50 state registries plus a federal government registry, they say, far outweighs complaints about the registry burdens for criminals who have served their prison sentences. \n \"Sex offender registries are an important part of the criminal justice system,\" said Staca Shehan of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. \"Registries assist law enforcement \u2014and the public \u2014 to keep track of the locations of convicted sex offenders.\" \n But some defense attorneys say registration has turned into such a harsh punishment that they now negotiate longer jail terms for their clients in return for prosecutors dropping sex offender registry requirements, trading incarceration for pleading guilty to charges that don't require registration. \n \"At least a prison sentence ends,\" said Gary Goodman, a public defense lawyer from Palo Alto, California. \"Registration is forever.\" \n Most states allow peeping toms and people convicted of crimes like indecent exposure to have their names removed from registries after 10 to 30 years of good behavior, while more serious sex crimes like rape and the sexual assault Turner was convicted of are punishable with lifetime registration whether they are committed by first time offenders or people with a history of sex crimes. \n California attorney Janice Bellucci has filed more than 50 federal lawsuits challenging sex offender registration conditions in cases that have forced cities to amend or eliminate residency restrictions imposed on criminals listed in in the registries, rescinding prohibitions for them to be physically present in public places like street side bus stops and parks. \n The U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 upheld the legality of sex offender registries, but the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that changes to Michigan's sex offender registry law cannot be applied retroactively to offenders convicted before the changes were put in place. \n Calling Michigan's residency and loitering prohibitions for registered sex offenders similar to \"the ancient punishment of banishment,\" the appeals court panel wrote that the state \"brands registrants as moral lepers solely on the basis of a prior conviction.\" \n Federal officials have been trying with mixed success for a decade to get all 50 states to adopt uniform registration requirements as part of a single national database they say would make the system uniform and improve tracking of sex offenders who move from state to state. But only 17 states have substantially compiled so far. \n The federally registry has helped investigators quickly identify potential sex crimes suspects and capture offenders who have fled their home states, said Luis deBacca, the U.S. Justice Department official in charge of the federal sex offender registration and tracking office. \n \"We really do see this as making a difference in the community,\" deBacca said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Brock Turner sex assault focuses attention on sex registries"}

{"date": "September 10, 2016", "text": "WASHINGTON >> The man who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan has been released from a Washington mental hospital for good, more than 35 years after the shooting. \n A spokeswoman for the District of Columbia's Department of Mental Health said early today that all patients scheduled to leave St. Elizabeths Hospital had been discharged. John Hinckley Jr. was among those scheduled for discharge. \n An Associated Press reporter saw a hired car pull into the driveway of the Hinckley home about 2:30 p.m. Officers from the Kingsmill Police Department chased reporters away. \n A federal judge ruled in late July that the 61-year-old Hinckley is not a danger to himself or the public and can live full-time at his mother's home in Williamsburg. \n Hinckley had already been visiting Williamsburg for long stretches at a time and preparing for the full-time transition. He'll have to follow a lot of rules while in Williamsburg, but his longtime lawyer Barry Levine says he thinks Hinckley will be a \"citizen about whom we can all be proud.\" \n This is what life will look like in Williamsburg for Hinckley: \n ___ \n WORK \n Hinckley will have to work or volunteer at least three days a week. He hasn't yet done paid work in Williamsburg, but he has volunteered at a church and a mental health hospital, where he has worked in the library and in food service. \n ___ \n HOME SWEET HOME \n Hinckley's mother lives in the gated community of Kingsmill. The unassuming home is on the 13th hole of a golf course. Hinckley's room has a king-size bed and TV and is decorated with paintings he has done of houses and cats, according to court documents. In the past, he has done chores like cleaning, dishwashing, laundry and leaf-raking. After a year, he may live alone or with roommates. \n ___ \n THERAPY \n Hinckley will continue to go to therapy while in Williamsburg. For at least the first six months he'll see his psychiatrist twice a month and he'll have to attend weekly group therapy sessions. He'll also see a therapist individually. He'll return to Washington once a month to St. Elizabeths' outpatient department to discuss his mental health and compliance with the conditions of his leave. \n ___ \n ROAD TRIPPING \n Hinckley got a driver's license in 2011. The court order in his case lets him drive within 30 miles of Williamsburg by himself, which gets him to Newport News but not Norfolk. He can go up to 50 miles from the city if accompanied by his mom, sibling or a therapist or social worker. He can also drive to and from Washington once a month for his outpatient meetings. \n ___ \n LEISURE \n Hinckley has long considered himself a musician and an artist. He paints and plays the guitar and has been involved in both as part of his therapy. He'll continue to see a music therapist once a month while in Williamsburg. At court hearings in the case in late 2011 and early 2012, lawyers discussed the fact that Hinckley had recently developed an interest in photography. \n There are limits to how Hinckley can spend his leisure time. He also can't drink or use illegal drugs. He can surf the web but, at least initially, he's not allowed to search for information about his crimes or victims, among other things. He can't have accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube or LinkedIn without permission. \n ___ \n VOTING \n Hinckley can register to vote in Virginia. He has expressed an interest in voting in the past and tried unsuccessfully to get a ballot in the 1980s and 1990s.

I regret saying 'half' \u2014 that was wrong.\" But she argued that the word \"deplorable\" was reasonable to describe much of Trump's campaign. \n \"He has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices, including by retweeting fringe bigots with a few dozen followers and spreading their message to 11 million people,\" the Democratic nominee said. \n Responding in a statement, Trump said it was \"disgraceful that Hillary Clinton makes the worst mistake of the political season and instead of owning up to this grotesque attack on American voters, she tries to turn it around with a pathetic rehash of the words and insults used in her failing campaign?\" \n Trump added that Clinton was showing \"bigotry and hatred for millions of Americans,\" arguing that she was \"incapable to serve as President of the United States.\" \n Clinton, who has said she is the candidate to unify a divided country, made the \"deplorables\" comment at an LGBT fundraiser Friday night at a New York City restaurant, with about 1,000 people in attendance. She has made similar comments recently, including on an Israeli television station. \n \"To just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic \u2014 you name it,\" she said, before stressing that other Trump supporters are frustrated and need sympathy. \n Trump and his supporters quickly pounced on the remark, arguing that it revealed Clinton as disconnected from struggling Americans. \n \"Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard-working people. I think it will cost her at the polls!\" Trump said in a tweet. \n Running mate Mike Pence, in remarks at the Values Voter conference in Washington, shot back: \"The truth of the matter is that the men and women who support Donald Trump's campaign are hard-working Americans, farmers, coal miners, teachers, veterans, members of our law enforcement community, members of every class of this country who know that we can make America great again.\" \n Of course, while Clinton is taking heat for her comment, Trump's brand is controversy. At a rally in Pensacola, Florida, on Friday, he said Clinton is \"so protected\" that \"she could walk into this arena right now and shoot somebody with 20,000 people watching, right smack in the middle of the heart. And she wouldn't be prosecuted.\" \n Clinton's rhetorical stumble came as the candidates head into the final two months of the campaign, with Trump trying to make up ground before the Nov. 8 election. \n Clinton has not let the media into many private fundraisers, but press was allowed in to hear her remarks Friday. At the New York restaurant, Clinton bemoaned the people she described as \"deplorables,\" saying \"unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people \u2014 now how 11 million. He tweets and retweets their offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoric. Now, some of those folks \u2014 they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America,\" said Clinton, who was the country's top diplomat during President Barack Obama's first term. \n Clinton then pivoted and tried to characterize the other half of Trump's supporters, putting them in \"that other basket\" and saying they need empathy. \n She described them as \"people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they're just desperate for change.\" \n Seeking to explain the statements, Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in a series of tweets after the remarks that Clinton has been talking about the \"alternative right,\" or \"alt-right\" movement, which often is associated with efforts on the far right to preserve \"white identity,\" oppose multiculturalism and defend \"Western values.\" Merrill argued that \"alt-right\" leaders are supporting Trump and \"their supporters appear to make up half his crowd when you observe the tone of his events.\" \n But the moment recalled comments about voters \u2014 also at private fundraisers \u2014 that have tripped up presidential nominees in the past. \n Weeks before the 2012 election, Republican Mitt Romney landed in hot water for saying that 47 percent of the public would vote for President Barack Obama \"no matter what\" because they depended on government benefits and his job was \"not to worry about those people.\" \n During the 2008 Democratic primary, then-Sen. Obama said that small-town voters \"cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.\" \n Today, Clinton's staff said she attended another fundraiser at the Armonk, New York, home of attorney David Boies. But reporters traveling with her campaign were not allowed in and did not see her. \n Trump, meanwhile, did not address Clinton's comment at his only scheduled public appearance on Saturday, a funeral in St. Louis for social conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly. \n Trump noted that Schlafly rooted for the underdog, and \"the idea that so-called little people, or the little person that she loved so much, could beat the system \u2014 often times, the rigged system.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton: 'Deplorables' comment was 'grossly generalistic'"}
