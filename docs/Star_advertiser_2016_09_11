{"date": "September 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / SEPT. 2014 \n In this Sept. 24, 2014 file photo, students compete in a high school soccer game in Burgaw, N.C. A study released on Monday found soccer injuries are sending increasing numbers of U.S. youth to emergency rooms, a trend driven partly by young players with concussions seeking urgent medical care. \n CHICAGO \u00bb Soccer injuries are sending soaring numbers of U.S. kids to emergency rooms, a trend driven in part by young players with concussions seeking urgent medical care, a study has found.  \n The findings, based on 25 years of data, partly reflect soccer's growing popularity. But the researchers and sports medicine experts believe the trend also is a result of greater awareness about concussions and their potential risks. Coaches and parents are likely seeking emergency treatment for symptoms that in previous years might have been downplayed or overlooked. \n Nearly 3 million players aged 7 through 17 received ER treatment for soccer-related injuries in the 2000-2014 study. The overall rate of injuries, which takes into account soccer's rising popularity, more than doubled to 220 per 10,000 players in 2013, from 106 per 10,000 players in 1990. Researchers did not have enough data to calculate 2014 rates. \n More than 200,000 concussions or head injuries were treated in emergency rooms, or 7 percent of injuries. The rate jumped to almost 30 per 10,000 people in 2013 from just under 2 per 10,000 players in 1990. \n That trend underscores a need for better safety education and injury prevention in youth soccer, said Dr. Huiyun Xiang, the lead author and a researcher at the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. \n \"Concussions can have significant consequences in terms of cognitive function and brain development,\" Xiang said. \n His study is an analysis of data from a national injury surveillance system and was published Monday in Pediatrics. \n According to U.S. Youth Soccer, there were more than 3 million registered soccer players younger than 19 in 2014, almost twice as many as in 1990. \n The rate of injuries from playing soccer has ranked second behind football in other studies on youth sports, including an analysis of 2015-2016 data from Reporting Information Online, an internet-based injury surveillance system for high school sports. \n For boys, football-related concussions result in more ER visits than other sports, according to previous research. For girls, it's soccer, according to an analysis of 2001-2012 data by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The current study lacks information on gender-specific soccer injury rates. \n Sprains and fractures were the most common injuries; most players were not hospitalized. Falling and getting hit by another player or the ball were among leading causes of injury but there's no data in the study on whether many injuries were from heading the ball. \n Concern about kids' injuries from heading led to the U.S. Soccer Federation's recent restrictions including a ban for kids aged 10 and younger and limits on heading for those aged 11-13. \n Many concussions in soccer occur when heads collide as two players jump up to head the ball, said Dr. Cynthia LaBella, a sport medicine specialist at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital. She said learning proper technique including tensing neck muscles can help kids avoid injury while heading the ball. \n Labella noted that soccer has become so popular that it attracts kids with a wide range of athletic ability, and that many injuries she treats are in kids who lack adequate strength and conditioning for their soccer level. \n \"Everyone's so eager to join the soccer team. They're signing up because they want to be with their buddies,\" she said. \"The range of athleticism especially at the youth and preteen level is pretty broad.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Surge in ER visits for injuries, concussions from soccer"}

She was asked during her onstage interview what she thought of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton; she answered that while both Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have done a good job thus far, \"they also need to watch what they're doing.\" \n Meeting reporters after the pageant, Shields elaborated. \n \"What I want both candidates to focus on is compromise,\" she said. \"Our country was founded on compromise. We're in a state now where both parties just seem to be yelling at one another.\" \n Monday morning, Shields will take the traditional romp in the surf on the beach in Atlantic City across from Boardwalk Hall, where she won the crown. It is a ritual in which the newly crowned Miss America skips along the beach as shallow waves roll in, jumps in the air, and poses for the first of the countless thousands of photos in which she will star over the next year. \n She topped a field of 52 contestants to win the crown and the title of Miss America 2017, succeeding the outgoing Miss America Betty Cantrell. \n She was asked one of several political questions by the panel of celebrity judges. \n \"If you're trying to be leader of the free world, everything you say and do matters and all of your actions are held to a higher standard,\" Shields said. \"Both of the contestants have done a good job, but they also need to watch what they're doing.\" \n Shields performed a jazz dance to a song from the TV show \"Smash,\" for which she won a preliminary competition earlier in the week. She said she still has the soundtrack from the canceled TV show in her car, where she plays it often. \n Shields is an art major at the University of Arkansas who wants to help people make better food choices. Her secret dream is to be a backup dancer for Beyonc\u00e9. \n The runners-up were as follows: Fourth runner-up, Miss Mississippi Laura Lee Lewis; third runner-up, Miss Washington Alicia Cooper; second runner-up Miss New York Camille Sims; first runner-up Miss South Carolina Rachel Wyatt. \n The first openly gay contestant in the Miss America pageant, Miss Missouri Erin O'Flaherty, was eliminated Sunday night when the top 15 finalists were chosen. \n She was the first openly gay contestant to win a state title. Djuan Trent competed in the Miss America pageant as Miss Kentucky in 2011, when she finished in the top 10. She came out as a lesbian in 2014. \n The top 15 finalists were: Kentucky; Washington; Massachusetts; Arkansas; South Carolina; Idaho; Iowa; Texas; California; Oklahoma; Maryland; New York; Tennessee; Louisiana, and Mississippi. \n Sunday's finale was held on the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. Many of the contestants noted the solemn anniversary, professed strong support for America's armed forces and struck patriotic themes. Miss Maryland Hannah Brewer sang \"God Bless America\" for her talent program. \n The pageant from Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall included contestants from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. \n The pageant began in Atlantic City in 1921 as a way to extend the summer tourist season beyond Labor Day weekend. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New Miss America has advice for Trump, Clinton: 'Compromise'"}

The U.N.

North Korea is capable of detonating another nuclear device anytime at one of its unused tunnels at the country's main atomic test site, Seoul officials said Monday, three days after the country carried out its fifth bomb explosion. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n North Koreans watch a news report regarding a nuclear test on a large screen outside the Pyongyang Station in Pyongyang, North Korea on Friday. North Korea said Friday it conducted a \"higher level\" nuclear warhead test explosion, which it trumpeted as finally allowing it to build \"at will\" an array of stronger, smaller and lighter nuclear weapons. \n SEOUL \u00bb North Korea is capable of detonating another nuclear device anytime at one of its unused tunnels at the country's main atomic test site, Seoul official said Monday, three days after the country carried out its fifth bomb explosion. \n The North's latest nuclear test was the most powerful to date and its claim to have used \"standardized\" warheads sparked worries it was making headway in its push to develop small and sophisticated warheads to be topped on missiles. Seoul, Washington and their allies subsequently vowed to apply more pressure and sanctions on Pyongyang. \n After the test, the North's nuclear weapons institute said it will take unspecified measures to further boost its nuclear capability, which analysts said hinted at a possible sixth nuclear test. \n South Korea's Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang Gyun said Monday that South Korea and U.S. intelligence authorities believe North Korea has the ability to detonate another atomic device anytime at the Punggye-ri test site, where the five previous atomic explosions took place. \n Moon refused to say what specific evidence pointed to another possible North Korea test. \n Yonhap news agency, citing unidentified Seoul government sources, reported Monday there were signs the North had finished test preparations in an unused tunnel. Yonhap did not elaborate. \n South Korea's top military intelligence officer, Kim Hwang Rok, said Friday that North Korea has two or three unused tunnels in the Punggy-ri site where it can conduct an additional test if it wants. Kim, director of the Korea Defense Intelligence Agency, made the remarks during a meeting with South Korea's ruling party chief Lee Jung-hyun, according to party spokesman Yeom Dong-yeol. \n South Korea has long avoided harsh rhetoric against North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un but after Friday's nuclear test, South Korean President Park Geun-hye said Kim's \"mental state is spiraling out of control\" and that his government has \"fanatic recklessness.\" \n South Korea's military also started talking publicly about its military capabilities, revealing it has retaliation plans involving precision-strike missiles and special operations forces for direct attacks on the North's leadership in the case of a North Korean nuclear attack. \n Yonhap, citing an unidentified military source, said Sunday that the plan would turn areas in Pyongyang, where the North's war commanders were likely to hide, into ashes and \"eliminate those places from the map permanently.\" South Korea's Defense Ministry said it would not comment on the report. \n Bad weather Monday also delayed a U.S. plan for at least 24 hours to send warplanes from Guam to South Korea in a show of force, as it has done in the past after major provocations by North Korea. \n \"The U.S. stands resolutely with the Republic of Korea and continues its ironclad support,\" Christopher Bush, a spokesman at the U.S. military command in South Korea. \n North Korea's pursuit of missiles and nuclear weapons is one of the most intractable foreign policy problems for the U.S. and South Korea. Diplomacy has so far failed. Six-nation negotiations on dismantling North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for aid were last held in late 2008 and fell apart in early 2009. \n The Korean Peninsula remains technically at war, as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.

{"date": "September 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / JULY 2007 \n In this file photo, Alexis Arquette arrives at the \"Comedy Central Roast of Flavor Flav\" in Burbank, Calif. Arquette, the transgender character actress and sibling of actors David, Rosanna, Richmond and Patricia Arquette, died early today in Los Angeles. She was 47. \n LOS ANGELES \u00bb To hear her sister Patricia tell it, Alexis Arquette knew who she was before she even had words enough to express it. \n \"I remember Alexis growing up, and we'd be in school in kindergarten, and they'd say, 'Get in line, boys here, girls here.' Alexis would always get in the girls' line,\" Patricia Arquette recounted to the Los Angeles Times in a 2008 interview. \"I remember Alexis getting dressed in drag at 4.\" \n At first spurred by playground taunts, Alexis took her classmates at their word and assumed that she must be gay, until one day realizing, in Patricia's words, \"That's not what's different about me, it's not that I'm a gay man. It's that I'm in the wrong body: I am a woman.\" \n Transgender activist and actress Alexis Arquette died Sunday morning surrounded by family, according to a Facebook post from brother Richmond Arquette and later confirmed by his agent. She was 47. \n The cause of death is unknown. \n Born into the Arquette acting dynasty, including sisters Patricia and Rosanna and brothers Richmond and David, all of whom followed in the footsteps of their father, Lewis, and grandfather Cliff, Alexis starred in several films including \"Bride of Chucky\" and \"The Wedding Singer.\" \n But acting was far from the only career Alexis pursued throughout her life. She worked as an art director for clubs, performed as drag queen Eva Destruction and spent several years at Mattel as a toy designer, an experience that left her underwhelmed. \n \"We had some really great educational, interesting, fun new technological ideas. After a while, it just became so frustrating to me,\" Alexis told the Times in a 1992 interview promoting her first starring role in \"Jumpin at the Boneyard.\" \"They turned down our brilliant ideas for dumb pieces of junky plastic.\" \n It was this straightforward honesty that made Alexis Arquette such a powerful advocate for the transgender community. \n In 2006, Alexis starred in the sixth season of \"The Surreal Life,\" a VH1 reality series that centered on the lives of a handful of faded celebrities focused on the next acts of their careers, while living together in a Hollywood Hills mansion. \n Her inclusion on the show raised transgender visibility in popular culture, a trend she continued with her participation in the 2007 documentary \"Alexis Arquette: She's My Brother.\" \n The film focused on a year-and-a-half period in her life during which she, along with her family, processed her transition. \n Having the last name Arquette benefited Alexis in more ways than one, as a trans woman, a fact that she acknowledged in an interview with \"Entertainment Tonight\" in 2009. \n \"Coming out as transgender in America from a celebrity family is a lot easier than it can be for private individuals anywhere else in the world,\" Alexis said of her experience. \"In fact, if you come out as transgender in certain parts of the world, you may be murdered in the street.\" \n In his announcement on his sister's passing on Facebook, Richmond wrote about feeling fortunate to share his life with Alexis, from whom he had learned so much. \n With her family gathered around her, Alexis died just after midnight as David Bowie's \"Starman\" played. As she transitioned to another dimension, her family cheered, as Alexis requested, according to Richmond's statement. \n In the early hours of the morning, Patricia tweeted a link to Bowie's classic along with the words, \"Breaking through the veil singing StarMan.\" \n Several hours earlier, Patricia had tweeted a link to the T. Rex song \"Cosmic Dancer\" with the message, \"To My first best friend \u2014 Cosmic Dancer.\" \n Sunday afternoon, Patricia responded to her own tweet clarifying, \"(My Lexy).\" \n Younger brother David also posted to Twitter regarding his sister's death, saying, \"Thank you all for your love and kind words about Alexis. My hero for eternity,\" and sharing a photo of the pair. \n Among the celebrities to respond to the news over social media were Boy George, Roseanne Barr and Elvira. \n Throughout her life, Alexis labored to remain true to who she was, regardless of what package she was in. \n \"What difference does it make what container we're in? Am I who I am because I'm a woman? Or does it matter?\" Alexis asked of her sister, in response to Patricia's original questions about transitioning. \"Am I who I am regardless of whether I'm a woman or a man?

{"date": "September 11, 2016", "text": "ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH VIA AP \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump before the funeral Mass for Phyllis Schlafly on Saturday in St. Louis. Schlafly, the outspoken conservative activist who helped defeat the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s and founded the Eagle Forum political group, died Monday at the age of 92. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Richard Nixon is back. \n The ghost of the 37th president hovers over Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Both presidential campaigns use the president who resigned in disgrace over the Watergate scandal in 1974 as the gold standard to show how crooked and dishonest the other is. \n Yet both candidates also seem to have a little of the notoriously thin-skinned, conspiratorial, and vengeful Nixon in them, presidential historians say, from Trump embracing the \"law and order\" theme that catapulted Nixon to the White House in 1968 to their utter disdain for the press to political controversies spawned from technology \u2014 Nixon's secret Oval Office tape recorder and Clinton's private home email server. \n \"The shadow of Nixon hangs over the campaign,\" said David Gergen, who worked under Nixon and former President Bill Clinton. \"It's remarkable how many times we've gone back to Nixon to make comparisons over the last few months.\" \n Just Wednesday, Trump conjured up Nixon anew, saying that Hillary Clinton's email controversy \"is like Watergate, only it's worse because here our foreign enemies were in a position to hack our most sensitive national security secrets.\" \n Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine referenced Nixon last Sunday by comparing the cyber hack of the Democratic National Committee to the Watergate break-in and blasting Trump for seemingly encouraging Russia to engage in cyber espionage to unearth some of Clinton's missing emails. \n Nixon \"had to resign over an attack on the DNC during a presidential election,\" Kaine said on ABC. \"This is serious business.\" \n Trump's campaign has borrowed liberally from Nixon in terms of policy and personnel. Nixon disciples such as Roger Stone and recently ousted Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes frequently speak with Trump. Ailes is reportedly helping Trump prepare for debates against Clinton. \n Trump also used Nixon's 1968 Republican National Convention acceptance speech in Miami as inspiration for the 2016 candidate's convention acceptance address in Cleveland in July, according to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. \n And Nixon's law and order message to an America reeling from the Vietnam War, anti-war protests on college campuses, crime and racial unrest in cities in the late 1960s is \"pretty much on line with a lot of the issues that are going on today,\" Manafort told reporters at a convention breakfast hosted by Bloomberg. \n Nixon's victory over Vice President Hubert Humphrey in 1968 marked a comeback for a figure who'd earned a reputation as a hard-edge, sometimes unscrupulous, politician and the unflattering nickname of \"Tricky Dick\" for his unapologetic style. \n After losing the presidential election to John F. Kennedy in 1960, Nixon re-emerged as the \"New Nixon\" in 1968, softening the sharp elbows he'd wielded as a hard-charging member of the Communist-seeking House Committee on Un-American Activities in the 1940s and a U.S. senator and Dwight Eisenhower's vice president in the 1950s. He ran as an empathetic candidate yet one who would stand up to lawbreakers. \n But once in the White House, parts of the old Nixon resurfaced. He had a vindictive streak toward Washington elites, certain elected officials, journalists and others who he thought were out to get him. \n He maintained an enemies list and tried to use the FBI and Internal Revenue Service to investigate those who he felt had wronged him. \n Both Trump and Clinton channel some of Nixon's mean streak, especially when it comes to the press, said Robert Watson, the editor of the \"American Presidents\" and \"American First Ladies\" books. \n Angry over what he considers unfairly negative coverage, Trump banned some reporters and media outlets from his campaign events. He lifted the ban last week. \n As president, he said he would \"open up\" libel laws to make it easier to sue reporters. \n Clinton has shown her dislike for the press by not conducting a news conference in more than 270 days before finally taking questions last week aboard her new campaign plane. \n \"Hillary's disdain and her lack of access to press is even beyond Nixon,\" Watson said. \"But I would say Trump is unprecedented in American history. We have never seen a candidate flat-out making a blacklist of media outlets and reporters he will not talk to. We have never had a major-party candidate simply censor the media and threaten the media. This even goes beyond Nixon.\" \n Clinton shares another problematic trait with Nixon: trust issues. A recent CNN poll found that only 35 percent of voters consider her honest and trustworthy vs. 50 percent for Trump. \n \"I think it's unfair to call her Nixonian, but there are some traits that are similar: secretiveness, being a little careful with the truth,\" Gergen said. \"Trump has done better than anyone would have expected in making the charges stick that she is somehow unethical.\" \n She could turn that around by adopting another Nixonian trait \u2014 reinvention, suggested Gil Troy, a history professor at Montreal's McGill University. \n \"Nixon reintroduced himself in 1968 as older, wiser, even-tempered,\" said Troy, the author of \"The Age of Clinton: America in the 1990s.\" \"He was well-known in politics and hated, but he was able to reinvent himself and reassure people on the trust issue just enough.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 McClatchy Washington Bureau  \n ", "author": "By William Douglas McClatchy Washington Bureau", "title": "He's baaack: How Nixon shadows Clinton and Trump"}

The film took flight with $35.5 million, according to studio estimates Sunday, surpassing expectations by around $10 million.  \n Tom Hanks stars as Captain Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger, who made an emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River in 2009, minutes after taking off. In addition to showing Sully's feat, the film explores the little-known National Transportation Safety Board investigation of the landing. \n Both audiences and critics responded strongly to the taut drama \u2014 Eastwood's first since \"American Sniper.\" An estimated 80 percent of those who turned out this weekend were over the age of 35, too, according to Warner Bros. \n \"This is the kind of sophisticated drama that is the antidote for older audiences to the youth-driven blockbuster stylings of the summer season,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box office tracker comScore. \"It proves that going to the movies is not just a youth-driven habit. Older audiences love to go to the movies as well, and 'Sully' is exactly the kind of movie that can bring them out.\" \n In fact, according to comScore's PostTrak audience survey, 39 percent turned out because of Hanks. Dergarabedian said that for stars that number is normally in the single digits. \n \"The movie sells itself,\" Warner Bros. distribution executive Jeff Goldstein said. \"Clint Eastwood is the master of being understated \u2026 he always wants the film to speak for itself, and it did.\" \n Goldstein was also struck by how well the film, despite its hyper-local New York story, played in all areas of North America. \n The Warner Bros. film cost a reported $60 million to produce. It's the first-ever to be shot entirely with IMAX cameras. The 375 IMAX screens accounted for about $4 million of the total this weekend. \n Taking second place with $15 million was the Screen Gems thriller \"When the Bough Breaks\" starring Morris Chestnut and Regina Hill. It surpassed its modest $10 million budget, but failed to meet both analyst expectations and the precedent set by last year's African-American thriller \"The Perfect Guy,\" which made $25.9 million on the same weekend. \n \"Because of the success of so many of these films, most of us thought it would do more this weekend, but no one is going to be crying about it over at Sony.

{"date": "September 11, 2016", "text": "NASA \n Scott Kelly, left, and his twin brother, Mark Kelly, are both former space shuttle astronauts. \n Dr. Francine Garrett-Bakelman arrived at NASA's Johnson Space Center in the middle of the night, ready to get her hands on Scott Kelly's blood.  \n She watched on a laptop as the astronaut stepped off a plane March 2 about 1:30 a.m., back in Houston after his record 340 days aboard the International Space Station. Then, in a nearby molecular biology lab, she set the centrifuge to the right temperature and looked over her pre-labeled test tubes. \n Within an hour, a NASA staffer brought in two samples \u2014 one drawn just minutes before, and the other taken during Kelly's final hours in orbit. \n The physician-scientist shifted into high gear: Blood doesn't keep forever, and every minute counts. So does every drop \u2014 these tiny samples had to be split among several research groups. \n \"It's a big responsibility, because you have four to five teams that are depending on you,\" she said. \n The blood work is part of the NASA Twins Study, an ambitious research project that explores the long-term health effects of living in space. Understanding those risks \u2014 and finding ways to mitigate them \u2014 will be crucial if NASA makes good on its pledge to send astronauts to Mars by the mid-2030s. \n Scott Kelly, who circled the globe about 16 times each day, is only half of this unusual experiment. The other is his identical twin, Mark Kelly, a former member of NASA's astronaut corps who spent the last year planted firmly on Earth. By studying both men at the same time, researchers hope to pinpoint the biological consequences of spending nearly a full year unshielded from radiation and untethered from gravity. \n Space-farers experience well-known changes in microgravity: They get an inch or two taller, their faces puff up, and their bones become porous and weak. But the 10 teams participating in the Twins Study are going deeper, examining factors related to cancer risk, cardiovascular disease and immune system function. \n That's why Garrett-Bakelman spent six hours carefully processing Kelly's blood \u2014 spinning test tubes, separating plasma and pulling out different cell types one by one. She didn't finish until 8 a.m. \n \"It's very surreal,\" she said of the otherworldly feeling of handling blood drawn in space. \"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\" \n The idea for the study came from Scott Kelly himself, said Craig Kundrot, life sciences lead at NASA's Office of the Chief Scientist in Washington. The agency was making plans to track the health of Kelly and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko over the course of the mission when Kelly asked whether any research would involve his brother, who flew four missions on the space shuttle. \n \"Our immediate response at the program was no,\" Kundrot said. It was well past the usual window for soliciting research proposals. \n But identical twin astronauts do not come around often. So NASA scrambled to put out a call to scientists. \n The result was a collection of projects spanning physiology, microbiology, genomics and behavioral health. \n One study out of Stanford uses flu vaccines to investigate how Kelly's immune response changes in space. Two others, from Johns Hopkins and Cornell, examine the mechanisms underlying how gene expression changes in orbit. \n Additional groups are analyzing how the gut microbiome fares in space and searching for molecular signals linked to problems that may result when the body's fluids, freed from gravity, rush toward the head. \n The leaders of the 10 chosen projects were called to the Johnson Space Center more than two years ago. Many had never worked with the space agency before. \n University of California, San Diego molecular geneticist Brinda Rana, leader of the body fluid study, thought she might get a sample of about 10 milliliters of blood \u2014 a vial's worth \u2014 each time the Kellys were sampled. \n It quickly became clear that NASA would treat Scott Kelly's biological samples like the moon rocks gathered by Apollo astronauts \u2014 precious scientific resources that must be doled out sparingly and shared by many. \n NASA officials were polite but firm. Rana recalled the gist of their message: \"You're only going to get one vial of blood during each session, and you're going to have to share that vial of blood between all 10 of you.\" \n One reason for their thrift was that Scott Kelly's blood had already been promised to several other experiments. Up against NASA's strict safety limits, he had little left to give. \n So the Twins Study researchers spent months adapting their research routines to use every last drop of blood they were allowed. \n The protein-rich plasma would go to Stanford University, where Michael Snyder was compiling a full chemical profile of the human body, including Kelly's genome, proteome, transcriptome and metabolome. Several types of white blood cells \u2014 mainly certain B cells and T cells \u2014 would be shared by several teams. \n \"We became like a family,\" said Dr. Andrew Feinberg of Johns Hopkins University, leader of a study on the twins' epigenetic markers. \n The scientists worked to perfect their methods in the months leading up to Kelly's departure. Feinberg and his son Jason spent many late nights in the lab figuring out how to maximize the number of B and T cells they could extract from special test tubes, getting high-quality results with about one-fifth of the volume they would normally work with. \n Once Kelly was in space, some blood samples could be frozen, but others needed to be processed first. The astronaut timed his blood draws so his samples could hitch a ride to Kazakhstan on a departing Soyuz spacecraft, then be whisked halfway around the world to Houston. That way, the blood could be processed within 48 hours of exiting Kelly's arm. \n \"You say, 'Oh, it's just a blood draw,' but even just a blood draw is not a simple thing when you're operating on the space station,\" said Susan Bailey, a radiation biologist at Colorado State University who is studying the twins' telomeres for signs of accelerated aging. \n The scientists put their trust in one another. One of them, such as Garrett-Bakelman, often processed and divvied up samples for several other groups. \n Weill Cornell Medicine geneticist Christopher Mason, leader of a study on gene regulation and RNA modifications, said he often sent his colleagues samples that were just a few hundred microliters in volume. \n \"Sometimes it's frozen, and then when you thaw the blood, a lot of your cells have died,\" he said. \n Even scientists who don't need biological samples have to deal with limited resources. Dr. Mathias Basner of the University of Pennsylvania, who is studying the astronauts' cognitive function, shortened his battery of mental tests to fit into Kelly's tight schedule. \n \"It can't be too long,\" he said. \"Time in space on the ISS is very valuable.\" \n The only scientists who didn't have to deal with such sample-limiting issues were the ones who needed stool, to study the twins' microbiomes. \n \"It's a very noninvasive procedure,\" Northwestern University neurobiologist Martha Hotz Vitaterna said. \n Coordinating the twins' hectic schedules to collect samples on or around the same day was another challenge, said Basner, who referred to Mark Kelly as the \"free-range\" sibling. \n Mark Kelly, who retired from NASA in 2011, leads a very busy life. He's married to former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who survived an assassination attempt in 2011. The couple now campaign for gun-control measures. \n Scott Kelly retired from the space agency a few weeks after returning to Earth. \n The scientists have held off testing most of the twins' biological samples for months, waiting to collect a few more from both Kellys on the ground. This is a precaution to avoid what are known as \"batch effects,\" variations that can crop up because of tiny differences in the way samples are handled.  \n \"It's sometimes a challenge because we're all anxious to see what's going to come out of this,\" Vitaterna said. \"But it's better science to wait and do it all together.\" \n With Scott Kelly's last \"integrated\" sample being taken last week, that prospect is finally within reach. \n The biggest challenges may lie ahead, in integrating all of these different pieces of evidence into a coherent picture of the astronauts' health, said Snyder, the Stanford genomicist. \n \"That's the fun part,\" he said. \"You can really see what the puzzle looks like.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times  \n ", "author": "By Amina Khan Los Angeles Times", "title": "NASA studying twins to find out long-term health effects of living in space"}

{"date": "September 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama listens as Secretary of Defense Ash Carter speaks during a memorial ceremony to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks today at the Pentagon in Washington. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama, right, with Defense Secretary Ash Carter, center, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford, stand at attention as the national anthem is played during a memorial ceremony at the Pentagon in Washington today to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb President Barack Obama today marked the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks by calling on Americans to embrace the nation's character as a people drawn from every corner of the world, from every religion and from every background. He said extremist groups will never be able to defeat the United States.  \n Obama spoke to hundreds of service members, and relatives and survivors of the attack that occurred at the Pentagon when American Airlines Flight 77 slammed into the Defense Department's headquarters, killing 184 people. The youngest victim was only 3 years old. \n In all, about 3,000 people lost their lives that day as a result of the planes that crashed into New York City's World Trade Center and in a Pennsylvania field. \n The president said extremist organizations such as the Islamic State group and al-Qaida know they can never drive down the U.S., so they focus on trying to instill fear in hopes of getting Americans to change how they live. \n \"We know that our diversity, our patchwork heritage is not a weakness, it is still and always will be one of our greatest strengths,\" Obama said. \"This is the America that was attacked that September morning. This is the America that we must remain true to.\" \n Obama spoke on warm, mostly sunny morning, noting that the threat that became so evident on Sept. 11 has evolved greatly over the past 15 years. Terrorists, he said, often attempt strikes on a smaller, but still deadly scale. He specifically cited attacks in Boston, San Bernardino and Orlando as examples. \n In the end, he said, the enduring memorial to those who lost their lives that day is ensuring \"that we stay true to ourselves, that we stay true to what's best in us, that we do not let others divide us.\" \n \"How we conduct ourselves as individuals and as a nation, we have the opportunity each and every day to live up to the sacrifice of those heroes that we lost,\" Obama said. \n Obama's comments also came in the heat of a presidential election in which voters will weigh which candidate would best keep America safe. \n Republican nominee Donald Trump said he would suspend Muslim immigration into the United States, a policy he later amended by saying he would temporarily ban immigration from \"areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\" Obama's speech Sunday reinforced themes he has emphasized in recent months when he has described Trump's proposals on Muslim immigration as \"not the America we want.\" \n Obama also marked his final Sept. 11 observance as president with a moment of silence inside the White House to coincide with when the first plane hit the Twin Towers. Atop the White House, the American flag flew at half-staff. Obama invited governors, interested organizations and individuals to follow suit. \n Obama said he has been humbled by the people whose 9/11 stories he's come to learn over the past eight years, from the firefighters who responded to the attacks, to family members of those who died, to the Navy Seals who made sure \"justice was finally done\" in the killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. He said the nation's security has been strengthened since 9/11 and that other attacks have been prevented. \n \"We resolve to continue doing everything in our power to protect this country that we love,\" he said, facing the benches that are a hallmark of the Pentagon Memorial. \n Behind the president, a U.S. flag stretching some three stories tall hung on the section of the Pentagon that was struck on Sept. 11. The president said 15 years may seem like a long time, but he imagined that for the families, it can seem like yesterday. He said he has been inspired by their efforts to start scholarship programs and undertake volunteer work in their communities. \n \"In your grief and grace, you have reminded us that, together, there's nothing we Americans cannot overcome,\" Obama said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama calls on Americans to embrace diversity on 9/11"}

A generation later, the federal government has adopted guidelines intended to prevent prison rape in part by separating young offenders from adult inmates. \n HOUSTON >> Miguel Moll knew the risk of rape when he was thrown into a Texas jail in 1989 after joyriding in a stolen car. \n Then 17, he was placed in a holding pen in Houston, and an older inmate said of the teenager, \"I got this one.\" The comment sparked the first of many fights Moll had while behind bars. \n \"The mentality you have to develop very quickly is either that of a wolf or that of a lamb,\" he recalled. \n A generation later, the federal government has adopted guidelines intended to prevent prison rape in part by separating young offenders from adult inmates. But four years after the rules were supposed to take effect, they are proving difficult to adopt in the nation's crowded jails and penitentiaries. \n Since 2012, states have been working to meet the standards set forth by the Prison Rape Elimination Act, or PREA, which was partially inspired by the 1996 death of Rodney Hulin, an undersized 17-year-old inmate who hanged himself in Texas after his requests for help following repeated rapes by adult inmates were denied. \n Texas sheriff's offices say separating the two populations has been a challenge because of overcrowding and steep financial costs. \n \"It's a big logistical headache,\" Brazos County Sheriff Chris Kirk said. \n The law was also supposed to provide for better staff training, improved reporting and investigation of all sexual assaults behind bars and more money for research. \n In 2011-12, an estimated 4 percent of state and federal inmates and 3.2 percent of jail inmates reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another inmate or facility staff, according to the Justice Department. \n The rape-prevention law \"is a valuable and important act, and we take it very seriously,\" said Ryan Sullivan, a spokesman for the Harris County Sheriff's Office, which has about 150 youth offenders at its jail in Houston. The facility holds more than 9,000 inmates. \n The Harris County Jail was cited in a May audit for not housing 17-year-old offenders apart from adult inmates. Elsewhere in Texas, Dallas County is spending more than $11,000 per week to keep at least 60 juveniles separated from adults at its jail complex. \n Like Moll, Art Medina was incarcerated at 17 in Texas. He was later sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for his role in a fatal Houston-area carjacking and spent 15 years in solitary confinement after seriously wounding an inmate who threatened to rape him. He was paroled after serving a total of 26 years. \n Now in their 40s, both men have returned to the prison system as volunteers to help adopt the PREA standards. Medina said in the past inmates felt like \"nobody cares about them.\" \n \"That culture has changed. People are being held accountable,\" he said. \n The nation's 7,600-plus prisons, jails, community-based facilities and juvenile detention centers are being checked on their compliance with the law. So far, only 12 states are in full compliance, according to the Justice Department. Thirty-six other states say they are working to comply. \n Still, the department said in an email that it is sees \"evidence of a very substantial effort nationwide\" to satisfy the new standards. \n The age separation has been especially complicated in states such as Texas that prosecute 17-year-olds as adults. Advocates say some facilities still question whether the federal mandate applies to them. \n In many jurisdictions, one of the biggest barriers is summoning the political will to make changes, said Brenda Smith, who was a member of the National Prison Rape Elimination Commission, which helped develop the standards. \n States that do not comply face losing 5 percent of their federal prison grants. County jails and local lockups are usually not included in the determination of whether a state is in compliance. Locally run facilities have no risk of losing federal money unless that funding is directly tied to a state contract for jail services. \n Smith, a law professor at American University in Washington, D.C., said that means local authorities can only be held accountable by public criticism or lawsuits. \n In Michigan, the prison system faces federal and state lawsuits filed by prisoners who allege officials failed to adequately separate offenders ages 14 to 17 from adults, resulting in sexual assaults. \n A Wisconsin legislative report concluded in July that the state's prison system was not splitting up the age groups. And an American Civil Liberties Union survey in North Carolina in 2014 found that none of the 60-plus county jails that responded appeared to be in complete compliance. \n Those findings have renewed calls for the states that prosecute 17-year-olds as adults to raise their age of adult criminal responsibility to 18. Those states include Texas, Michigan and North Carolina. Sullivan, Kirk and other Texas jail officials say they would be in favor of raising the age. \n Efforts to raise the age failed in the last legislative session in Texas, but advocates plan to try again next year, said Elizabeth Henneke, policy attorney with the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Jails, prisons still trying to meet federal anti-rape rules"}

Clinton's campaign said the Democratic presidential nominee left the 9/11 anniversary ceremony in New York early after feeling \"overheated.\" \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, second from right, departs after attending a ceremony at the Sept. 11 memorial, in New York today on the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. \n NEW YORK \u00bb An ill Hillary Clinton abruptly left a 9/11 anniversary ceremony today and needed to be held up by three people before she appeared to stumble off a curb and was helped into a van. Several hours later, her campaign revealed she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday and advised to rest. \n Less than two months from Election Day, it was an unwanted visual for Clinton as she tries to project the strength and vigor needed for one of the world's most demanding jobs. Republican rival Donald Trump has spent months questioning Clinton's health, saying she lacks the stamina to be president. \n In a statement, Clinton's doctor said the former secretary of state had become overheated and dehydrated at the event in lower Manhattan. \"I have just examined her and she is now rehydrated and recovering nicely,\" Dr. Lisa R. Bardack said. \n The physician said Clinton has had an allergy-related cough, and that during a follow-up examination Friday, the candidate was diagnosed with pneumonia, put on antibiotics, advised to rest and modify her schedule. \n Clinton's departure from the event was not witnessed by the reporters who travel with her campaign and aides provided no information about why she left or her whereabouts for nearly two hours. Spokesman Nick Merrill eventually said Clinton had gone to her daughter's nearby apartment, but refused to say whether the former secretary of state had required medical attention. \n Clinton exited the apartment on her own shortly before noon. She waved to reporters and said, \"I'm feeling great. It's a beautiful day in New York.\" \n In the meantime, a video surfaced on Twitter that showed Clinton being held up by aides as a black van pulls up. She stumbles and appears to fall off the curb as she is helped inside. \n After leaving her daughter's, Clinton was driven to her home in Chappaqua, New York, and made no public appearances. She later called off plans to fly to California on Monday morning for two days of fundraising, campaign events and an appearance on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show. \n Trump, who attended the same event marking the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, was noticeably restrained. Asked by a reporter about Clinton's health incident, Trump said, \"I don't know anything.\" \n The incident compounds an already difficult stretch for Clinton as the presidential race enters its final stretch. Despite Trump's numerous missteps, the race remains close and many Americans view Clinton as dishonest and untrustworthy. \n On Friday, Clinton told donors that \"half\" of rival Donald Trump's supporters are in a \"basket of deplorables\" \u2014 a comment that drew sharp criticism from Republicans. Clinton later said she regretted applying that description to \"half\" of Trump's backers, but stuck by her assertion that the GOP nominee has given a platform to \"hateful views and voices.\" \n Now Clinton is sure to face new questions about whether she's physically fit for the presidency. Trump and his supporters have been hinting at potential health issues for months, questioning Clinton's stamina when she takes routine days off the campaign trail and reviving questions about a concussion she sustained in December 2012 after fainting. Her doctor attributed that episode to a stomach virus and dehydration. \n Clinton's doctor reported she is fully recovered from the concussion, which led to temporary double vision and discovery of a blood clot in a vein in the space between her brain and skull. Clinton also has experienced deep vein thrombosis, a clot usually in the leg, and takes the blood thinner Coumadin to prevent new clots. \n Clinton spent about 90 minutes at the 9/11 event Sunday, standing alongside numerous other dignitaries, including New York's Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer and Kirstin Gillibrand. The weather was warm and humid in New York on Sunday, and there was a breeze at the crowded memorial plaza during the ceremony. \n Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., said he spent time before the ceremony chatting with Clinton and watching her sign autographs and take pictures. He said he was standing behind her during the remembrance and \"she did not seem out of the ordinary at all.\" \n \"It was stiflingly hot. I was sweating through my shirt,\" Crowley said. \"I had to leave myself. I drank about a gallon of water.\" \n Schumer said he also spoke with Clinton during the event and saw her leave \"on her own accord.\"? \n Trump's personal physician has said the Republican presidential nominee is in excellent health both physically and mentally. But the 70-year-old has refused to release his own health records. \n Dr. Harold Bornstein's report last December remains the only medical information released so far by the Trump campaign.

Christian Siriano was inspired by the casual chic of Capri and earned applause for a few plus-size models who walked his runway, and Banana Republic presented looks influenced by India as New York Fashion Week continued Saturday. \n Some highlights: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n A SURPRISE FINALE \u2014 AND NEW PARTNERSHIP \u2014 AT ALEXANDER WANG \n Alexander Wang is, by his own description, a total sneakerhead. He once even designed a whole clothing collection around them, with dresses, tops and handbags emulating his favorite sneaks, like the classic white-and-green Adidas Stan Smith. \n Now, Wang has taken his sneaker love to a new level, partnering with adidas Originals for a line of apparel and footwear that seeks, in his words, to \"disrupt\" the famous Adidas look while still preserving its familiarity. One example: rotating the well-known trefoil logo upside down. Another: \"deconstructing\" the Adidas sneaker. Also, the entire collection is unisex: Tops, bottoms, shoes. \n Wang introduced the new line as a surprise finale to his Fashion Week runway show Saturday night, in a huge space on a Hudson River pier. After modeling creations from Wang's own label, models rushed backstage to change into new Adidas garb, while a one-and-a-half minute film teased the new collection. \n Then they marched onto the runway, more than 70 of them, all clad in black, as the crowd \u2014 which included Madonna and Nicki Minaj \u2014 craned their necks and snapped endless photos. It was, Wang said, \"the biggest show we've ever done.\" \n In designing the new line, the key challenge was to change up the Adidas look so it feels fresh \u2014 but not to the point that it's unrecognizable, Wang said in an interview. \n \"It was really about saying, how do we take something and shake it up a little, disrupt it, but at the same time not change it so much where it doesn't feel right.\" \n The 32-year-old designer is recognized as one of the most talented and busiest of his generation. He launched his own, eponymous label 11 years ago, at age 21. Last year, he ended a prestigious three-year stint as creative director at Balenciaga, a job that had him splitting his time between Paris and New York. Since then, he's been back fulltime at his own label, where he focuses heavily on streetwear \u2014 and is a favorite of the celebrity set. \n As for Adidas, it clearly wanted to capitalize on Wang's edgy and youthful vibe. \n \"I've been a fan for a long time, this connection he has with culture and New York and breaking down boundaries,\" said Nic Galway, vice president of design for adidas Originals. \n For Wang, it was a chance to work with a brand he often wore as a child, and especially to work with sneakers. \n \"I grew up on sneakers,\" he said. \"It's a very interesting time obviously for (all) sportswear, the whole market and how people utilize fitness, incorporate it into their daily uniform. So the sneaker is something that I've always been very close to. And it's always been something that's very hard for us to do in house, to be honest \u2014 obviously Adidas has the most innovative resources.\" \n Wang also showed his own label's spring collection on Saturday night, and it was a marked contrast to the all-black garb that came later: Colorful, whimsical warm-weather clothes that seemed destined for the beach. \n The designer said backstage that he was going for a \"liberating, free, surfer attitude and sensibility. Everything was put through the lens of water sports.\" \n Wang's after-parties are as famous as his shows. As guests left the runway, they walked into a cavernous space filled with colorful trucks, some dispensing snacks, Slurpees, or stronger beverages. Partiers could even take a can of spray paint and decorate a van, if they chose. \n \u2014Jocelyn Noveck \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n SIRIANO MAKES A STATEMENT ON SIZE \n Five models who were NOT sample size got a few cheers from the crowd as they walked the beachy, Capri-themed runway of Christian Siriano. \n Siriano's strong statement on size comes after 6-foot tall Leslie Jones complained in July that no designers wanted to dress her for the \"Ghostbusters\" premiere. Siriano made her a red gown, and he dressed the curvy Uzo Aduba in the same color Friday night at the Toronto Film Festival screening of her \"American Pastoral.\" \n On Thursday, \"Project Runway\" mentor Tim Gunn wrote a thought-provoking takedown of most top designers for ignoring plus-size women, considering \u2014 as he wrote in The Washington Post editorial \u2014 that research shows the average woman in the U.S. wears size 16 to 18. \n \"I've dressed so many different types of women and it's fun,\" said Siriano, who won the fourth season of \"Project Runway\" back in 2008. \"I grew up with a mom who was a 16 and a sister who was a zero. There should be normalcy, I think.\" \n Among those applauding the models of size was Ashley Graham, who made history as the first plus-size model to hit the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue this year. \n To be sure, plenty of Siriano's walkers were the usual model thin. \n It's been a big year in other ways for Siriano, who got hitched to longtime boyfriend Brad Walsh at their country home outside New York City over the summer. Soon after, on July 25, first lady Michelle Obama appeared in a royal blue Siriano dress that fell just below the knee as she addressed the Democratic National Convention. \n \"It was an amazing, amazing moment,\" Siriano said backstage before his show of ladylike, Capri-inspired looks. \"Every now and then it's nice to have someone like that just give you a little bit of a push that you need for the world to agree.\" \n \u2014Leanne Italie and Gina Abdy \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n BANANA REPUBLIC GOES TO INDIA \n Gap Inc.'s Banana Republic brand offered a presentation of 40 spring looks for men and women, inspired by its design team's trip to India early this year. \n \"We were loving the idea of the old meeting the new, like technology meeting the old handcrafted ideas,\" said Michael Anderson, senior vice president of design for the brand. \"Everybody does a lot of manufacturing in India, but we wanted to show a different side to India.\" \n In particular, the design team was inspired by the lattice work in that country, using a vendor in Portugal to do laser cutting of fabrics. \n For women, there were off-the-shoulder laser cut eyelet tops paired with matching skirts, shirt dresses styled with white trousers and pajama-styled striped shirts and matching pants. For men, there were plenty of fashions in madras plaid, including shirts, pants and vests. The collection highlighted colors that included oranges and cinnamons. \n For those who can't wait until next spring, Banana Republic offered 15 looks from the women's collection that can be purchased on its website now or at Banana Republic's store in New York's Flatiron district. That capsule included a one-shoulder asymmetric dress in red stripes and a cream-colored, laser-cut blouse. It's the second time the brand made some pieces available for purchase right away. \n \"We want to have a deeper relationship with our consumer,\" Anderson said. \"There is a customer who is on the edge. They want things before everybody else gets them. There's this heightened sense of urgency.\" \n \u2014Anne D'Innocenzio \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Alexander Wang presents adidas Originals unisex line"}

{"date": "September 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Brock Turner pictured at the Greene County Sheriff's Office in Xenia, Ohio, where he officially registered as a sex offender. \n COLUMBUS, Ohio >> A former Stanford University swimmer whose six-month jail sentence for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman sparked a national outcry has registered as a sex offender in Ohio, where he is living with his parents. \n Brock Turner, 23, registered at the Greene County sheriff's office four days after he was released from a California jail on Sept. 2 for good behavior after serving half his term. As a Tier III sex offender, the harshest of three levels in Ohio, Turner must register as a sex offender for life, checking in every three months. \n A look at Ohio's sex offender law and online database: \n OHIO'S ELECTRONIC SEX OFFENDER REGISTRATION AND NOTIFICATION (ESORN) \n Ohio's sex offender registry started in 1997 in response to public outcry nationally over high-profile child sex abuse cases, including the 1989 abduction of 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling from a rural Minnesota road by a masked gunman as he rode bikes with his brother and a friend near his home. The 1994 federal Jacob Wetterling Act required states to create a system of sex offender registration. Ohio's database was originally for law enforcement only. It became accessible to the public in 2004. Last year, the Ohio Supreme Court said the state's registry requirements were constitutional and didn't amount to cruel and unusual punishment. \n On Sept. 3, Wetterling's remains were finally located and three days later, Minnesota man Danny Heinrich confessed to abducting and killing Wetterling. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n HOW THE DATABASE WORKS \n Ohio's online database currently has about 17,500 offenders, with photos included, listed in a database searchable by name, addresses, offenders' emails and phone numbers, and whether offenders have violated registration rules. Offenders must register within five days of entering a new county or when changing their address. They must provide fingerprints, DNA, social security numbers and contact information. The Ohio Attorney General's Office maintains the database, but information is entered by local sheriffs, who handle registration and notification. Email alerts can be set up for notification when offenders move into specified areas. Violations for failing to register or update information depend on the seriousness of the original crime. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n OFFENSE LEVELS \n Ohio currently has a three-level registration system. Tier I offenders, convicted of crimes like sexual contact with minors, voyeurism or promoting prostitution, must register annually for 15 years. Tier II offenders, convicted of crimes like kidnapping with sexual motivation or use of a minor in nudity-oriented material like photos, must register every six months for 25 years. The most serious level, Tier III, for crimes such as rape, sexual battery and murder with a sexual motivation, requires lifetime registration every three months. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n EFFECTIVENESS \n Results are mixed on whether the registries reduce the rates at which sex offenders commit new crimes. A 2000 study found no significant difference in the rates between individuals in the databases and individuals before they were entered into a database. Last month, federal appeals court judge Alice Batchelder said there is \"scant\" evidence that Michigan's sex offender registry law accomplishes goals such as reducing recidivism. A 2005 study, however, found a nearly 70 percent reduction in the so-called recidivism rate of offenders forced to register and be subject to notification requirements. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ex-swimmer in rape case joins thousands in Ohio sex database"}

{"date": "September 11, 2016", "text": "CHARLESTON, S.C. >> U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, the first black U.S. senator from the deep South since Reconstruction, is proposing that the site where the Civil War began be raised in status to that of a national park. \n The Republican lawmaker has introduced a bill creating the Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie National Park as the nation's 60th national park and second in South Carolina. \n Fort Sumter, on Charleston Harbor, was bombarded by Confederate guns on April 12, 1861, in a fight that started four years of civil war. \n Moultrie, located on nearby Sullivans Island, is where American patriots turned back a British fleet trying to capture Charleston days before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. \n Both forts are part of the Fort Sumter National Monument, one of 84 national monuments among 413 sites administered by the National Park Service. \n Scott says a national park designation will give the forts a higher profile among the array of other national park properties and should mean more visitors to sites that now draw about 1 million visitors a year. \n \"What we hope to do is bring more attention,\" Scott said. \"People know the first shots of the Civil War but they don't necessarily know the history dating back to the first years of our country and the significance Fort Moultrie played.\" \n It's not the first effort to create a national park at the sites. Similar legislation was introduced by the late U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond, a fellow Republican but a one-time staunch segregationist, in 2002. That bill died in committee. \n Scott said he hasn't give much thought to the significance of a black man working to raise the status of an iconic Civil War site. \n \"South Carolina has a provocative history,\" the former congressman said. \"Perhaps part of that history is me representing in Congress the site where the Civil War began and now as a senator hopefully making it into a park.\" \n He said the bill \"resonates on both sides of the aisle and frankly I think it will resonate throughout the nation\" and hopes it can pass this year. \n Tim Stone, the superintendent of the Fort Sumter National Monument, said a national park designation won't expand the park or mean more budget money. \n \"It just raises the profile and stature,\" he said. \"It gives the importance of Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie and their role in American history their proper due.\" \n He said status as a national park is important because many people plan their travels around visiting national parks. If you search online for national parks in South Carolina, the only thing that comes up is Congaree National Park near Columbia, he said. \n Jim Thompson, director of Fort Sumter-Fort Moultrie Historic Trust, a nonprofit that helps support projects at the forts, is pleased a new park would have Moultrie in the name. \n The fort was only partially finished when troops under Col. William Moultrie turned back a British fleet on June 28, 1776, six days before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. \n \"Word got back to Philadelphia which gave courage to some of those who were on the fence to go ahead and sign the Declaration of Independence,\" Thompson said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Bill would make site where Civil War began a national park"}

{"date": "September 11, 2016", "text": "CINDY ELLEN RUSSELL / APRIL 2011 \n Students wait in line at the UH Financial Aid Services office at the Manoa campus. \n School may have just started but it's time to start thinking about next year if your child will be in college. \n That's because the date you can begin to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, is three months earlier this year \u2014 Oct. 1. The FAFSA is used by schools to determine eligibility for student financial aid and is considered the most important document in getting help paying for college. \n It's advantageous to file it as soon as possible because some funding is distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis. New federal rules also change which year's tax information to use in the application. \n A few things to know: \n Mark Kantrowitz, of the college information website Cappex.com, said that students who file the FAFSA during the first three months tend to get more than double the grants, on average, of students who file the FAFSA later. \n When the FAFSA application period opened on Jan. 1, many families rushed to apply but didn't have all the necessary tax information and had to estimate it. Now applicants will use tax returns from one year earlier. So those applying for aid for the 2017-2018 schoolyear will use their 2015 income information instead of 2016. \n He also notes that if 2016 income is lower than 2015, the family should appeal to the college financial aid administrator for a professional judgment review. \n Completing the FAFSA earlier means families can receive critical information like the Student Aid Report (SAR) sooner, says lender Sallie Mae. The SAR includes the Estimated Family Contribution, or EFC, which provides a clearer picture about eligibility for financial aid as families make decisions about colleges. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Filing for student financial aid starts Oct. 1"}

{"date": "September 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Mourners hold photos of their loved ones during the 15th anniversary of the attacks of the World Trade Center at the National September 11 Memorial on Sunday in New York. \n NEW YORK >> The U.S. marked the 15th anniversary of 9/11 on Sunday, with victims' relatives reading their names and reflecting on a loss that still felt as immediate to them as it was indelible for the nation. \n But despite a tradition of putting aside partisan politics for the day, the observance became part of the news of a combustible presidential campaign, when Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton left about 90 minutes into the ground zero ceremony after feeling \"overheated,\" her campaign said. \n Spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement that Clinton was feeling better after spending some time at her daughter's apartment but offered no additional details, including whether Clinton required medical attention. \n Republican rival Donald Trump, who was also at the ceremony for a time, didn't immediately comment on the developments. His supporters have repeatedly questioned Clinton's health. \n The 15th anniversary arrives in a country caught up in the campaign, keenly focused on political, economic and social fissures and still fighting terrorism. But for those who lost relatives, the fraught passage of 15 years feels \"like 15 seconds,\" said Dorothy Esposito, who lost her son, Frankie. \n Over 1,000 victims' family members, survivors and dignitaries at ground zero under an overcast sky. \n \"It doesn't get easier. The grief never goes away. You don't move forward \u2014 it always stays with you,\" Tom Acquaviva, who lost his son, Paul Acquaviva. \n James Johnson was there for the first time since he last worked on the rescue and recovery efforts in early 2002, when he was a New York City police officer. \n \"I've got mixed emotions, but I'm still kind of numb,\" said Johnson, now a police chief in Forest City, Pennsylvania. \"I think everyone needs closure, and this is my time to have closure.\" \n Nearly 3,000 people died when hijacked planes slammed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville on Sept. 11, 2001. It was the deadliest terror attack on American soil. \n Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Sunday news shows that the United States is safer now than it was in 2001 against another 9/11-style attack but continues to face the challenge of potential attacks by solo and homegrown violent extremists. \n President Barack Obama, speaking at the Pentagon memorial service, praised America's diversity and urged Americans not to let their enemies divide them. \n \"Our patchwork heritage is not a weakness \u2014 it is still and always will be one of our greatest strengths,\" Obama said. \"This is the America that was attacked that September morning. This is the America that we must remain true to.\" \n Some victims' relatives at ground zero pleaded for the nation to look past its differences. \n \"The things we think separate us really don't. We're all part of this one Earth in this vast universe,\" said Granvilette Kestenbaum, who lost her astrophysicist husband, Howard Kestenbaum. \n Others expressed hopes for peace or alluded to the presidential race: \"Guide America's next commander in chief and help make America safe again,\" said Nicholas Haros, who lost his mother, Frances Haros. \n Neither Clinton nor Trump made public remarks at the ceremony, where politicians haven't been invited to speak since 2011. The two candidates also followed a custom of halting television ads for the day. \n Meanwhile, hundreds of people gathered for a name-reading observance at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where one of the hijacked planes crashed 15 years ago. \n In New York, ceremony organizers included some additional music and readings Sunday to mark the milestone year. But they kept close to what are now traditions: moments of silence and tolling bells, an apolitical atmosphere and the hourslong reading of the names of the dead. \n Some speakers described how their loss had moved them to do something for others. \n Ryan Van Riper said he planned to honor his slain grandmother, Barbara Shaw, by serving the country. Jerry D'Amadeo, who was 10 when he lost his father, Vincent Gerard D'Amadeo, said he worked this summer with children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where 26 children and adults were massacred in 2012. \n \"Sometimes the bad things in our lives put us on the path to where we should be going \u2014 to help others as many have helped me,\" he said. \n Financial and other hurdles delayed the redevelopment of the Trade Center site early on, but now the 9/11 museum, three of four currently planned skyscrapers, an architecturally adventuresome transportation hub and shopping concourse and other features stand at the site. A design for a long-stalled, $250 million performing arts center was unveiled Thursday. \n The crowd has thinned somewhat at the anniversary ceremony in recent years. But some victims' family members, like Cathy Cava, have attended all 15 years. \n \"I will keep coming as long as I am walking and breathing,\" Cava said, wearing a T-shirt with a photo of her slain sister, Grace Susca Galante. \n \"I believe most of her spirit, or at least some of her spirit, is here.
