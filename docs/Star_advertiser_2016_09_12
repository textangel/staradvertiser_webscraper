{"date": "September 12, 2016", "text": "NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE \n This composite radar image taken at 4:55 a.m. shows rain over the windward side of Maui. \n COURTESY NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE \n Doppler radar indicated heavy rainfall over the island of Maui. A flash flood warning has been extended until 10 p.m. \n Update 4:30 a.m. \n Although Oahu is no longer under a flood advisory, Hawaii island was put under a new flood advisory early this morning. \n At about 4:10 a.m., radar showed heavy rain \u2014 falling at up to 2 inches an hour \u2014 near Hawaiian Paradise Park. The advisory is in effect through 7:15 a.m. \n Locations in the advisory include but are not limited to Hilo, Hawaiian Paradise Park, Mountain View, Keaau, Pahoa, Glenwood, Orchidland Estates, Hawaiian Acres, Volcano, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Leilani Estates and Ainaloa. \n Update 12:05 a.m. Wednesday \n Oahu's flash flood warning and advisory expired before midnight, but National Weather Service forecasters kept a flood watch in effect for much of the island chain. \n Oahu, Maui, Hawaii island, Molokai and Lanai are under flood watch through Thursday afternoon, owing to the threat of heavy rain and the potential for flash flooding. \n \"Deep tropical moisture and an upper level trough will result in a threat of heavy rainfall and flooding,\" the National Weather Service warned. \n Update 9:35 p.m. \n The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for Oahu until 12:15 a.m. Wednesday because of heavy rain falling over Honolulu and parts of the Koolau Mountains. \n Rain was falling at a rate of up to 2 inches an hour, and the Waikane and Manoa streams were above flood stage, the Weather Service said. The areas of heavy rainfall were nearly stationary. \n Locations in the warning included, but were not limited to Honolulu, Maunawili, Kailua, Waikane, Hawaii Kai, Kaneohe, Waiahole, Moanalua, Halawa, Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe, Waimanalo, and Kalihi. \n A flash flood warning means flooding is imminent or occurring in streams, roads, and low-lying areas. Move to higher ground immediately and do not cross fast-flowing water in your vehicle or on foot, the Weather Service warned. \n In addition, the Weather Service issued a flood advisory for Hawaii island and parts of Oahu. \n At 9:28 p.m., radar indicated heavy rain near Waikoloa Village, falling at a rate of one-and-a-half inches per hour. Locations in the advisory included Kailua-Kona, Waikoloa Village, Puuanahulu, Kalaoa, Puako, Kamuela, Pohakuloa Training Area, Kona International Airport, Waikoloa Beach, Waikii and Mauna Lani. \n The advisory was issued at 9:30 p.m. and remained in effect until 12:30 a.m. \n On Oahu, a flood advisory was issued about 9 p.m. for parts of the island until midnight. Heavy rain was falling over parts of Oahu, including downtown at about an inch an hour. \n The areas included in the advisory were Honolulu, Maunawili, Kailua, Waikane, Mililani, Hawaii Kai, Salt Lake, Kaneohe, Waiahole, Moanalua, Halawa, and Schofield Barracks. \n Stay away from streams, drainage ditches and low-lying areas that are prone to flooding, the Weather Service warned. \n Rainfall and runoff may also cause hazardous driving conditions because of ponding. \n An advisory means weather conditions are impacting the community and ignoring the conditions may lead to hazardous conditions, according to the Weather Service. \n Meanwhile, a flash flood warning was canceled for Maui. A flash flood watch, however, remained in effect for all islands east of Kauai through Thursday afternoon. \n A flash flood watch is issued when conditions may develop that can cause flash flooding. \n Update 8:25 p.m. \n The National Weather Service extended tonight a flash flood warning for Maui until 10 p.m. as heavy rain fell across the island and multiple streams were approaching flood stage. \n At 6:58 p.m., radar indicated heavy rain across windward Haleakala slopes and windward and southeast-facing slopes of the West Maui Mountains, the Weather Service said. \n Rainfall rates in excess of 2 inches per hour were observed in some of those areas. \n Jeff Powell, lead forecaster at the Weather Service, said a combination of conditions, including a low pressure area bringing deep tropical moisture over the eastern part of the state, is creating the humid, wet conditions. \n \"Maui unfortunately is in the sweet spot this evening, as it was last evening, and is just getting dumped on right now,\" he said. \"It's just coming down really hot and heavy.\" \n The flash flood warning took effect about 1:30 p.m. for Maui and has been extended several times. The Weather Service said it may extend the warning beyond 10 p.m. if heavy rains persist. \n A flash flood warning means that flooding is imminent or occurring in streams, roads, and low-lying areas. Residents should move to higher ground immediately, the Weather Service said. \n Meanwhile, all islands east of Kauai were under a flash flood watch until Thursday afternoon because the heavy rains over Maui could spread and affect other islands from Wednesday. \n Powell said the rainy weather is expected to dissipate towards the end of the week. \n Update 7:20 p.m. \n A flash flood warning for Maui remained in effect Tuesday night as \"pockets of extremely heavy rain\" and flooding occurred across the island, a county official said. \n \"Part of what is making this storm so unique is the impact is very widespread,\" said Andrea Finkelstein, the plans and operators officer at Maui Civil Defense Agency. She said heavy rain has been reported in Haiku, Hana Highway, Ulupalakua in Upcountry Maui, Makawao, Wailuku, and Wailea. \n \"It is raining extremely hard for short periods of time as it passes through and then raining lightly in between,\" she said. She urged residents to stay home and call police if they are in need of assistance. \n She said there have been reports of flooding on roadways across the island, some because the roads are in low-lying areas and some because of blocked drains. First responders, the county Department of Public Works, and state Department of Transportation have been responding to calls and clearing blockages. \n At 4:53 p.m., radar indicted heavy rain and thunderstorms over portions of the Hana coast with intense rainfall impacting Hana, Hamoa, and Haiku-Pauwela, the Civil Defense said. \n Another area of intense rainfall was over the southwestern slopes of Haleakala, upstream from Makena and Wailea, Civil Defense said. Runoff from the intense rainfall will likely lead to flash flooding in gulches in Wailea and Makena. Rainfall rates as high as 3 inches per hour can be expected. \n The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning for Maui until 8 p.m. The warning was initially about 1:30 p.m. and has been extended several times. \n Radar indicated slow-moving thunderstorms producing heavy rain across east Maui from Paia to Keanae to Kipahulu, the Weather Service said. Rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour will increase the chance of landslides, and rock slides have already been reported on Hana Highway with a lane blocked near mile marker 3, the Weather Service said. \n The Weather Service said humid conditions with occasional downpours will continue through the week. \n Update 5:30 p.m. \n The National Weather Service extended a flash flood warning for Maui until 8 p.m. \n Doppler radar at 4:53 p.m. showed heavy rain and thunderstorms over portions of the Hana coast, particularly affecting Hana, Hamoa and Haiku-Pauwela. \n Heavy rainfall also developed over the southwestern slopes of Haleakala and upstream from Makena and Wailea, forecasters said. \n Runoff from the rain will likely lead to flash flooding in gulches that periodically flood both Wailea and Makena. \n Locations of the warning now include Pauwela, Kipahulu, Ulupalakua, Wailea, Huelo, Nahiku, Kaiku-Pauwela and Paia. \n Update 4:30 p.m. \n The National Weather Service extended a flash flood warning for Maui until 7:15 p.m., and a flood advisory is in effect for Hawaii island until 5:15 p.m. \n Doppler radar at 4:15 p.m. showed heavy stationary rain over the Hana slopes and coast between Nahiku and Hamoa. The north shore of Maui between Huelo and Paia are also experiencing heavy rain, forecasters said. \n Locations covered by the warning include but aren't limited to Haiku-Pauwela, Pauwela, Huelo, Nahiku, Hana, Kipahulu, Kula, Wailua and Haleakala National Park. \n Weather officials are urging the public to stay clear of fast flowing water and move to higher ground immediately. \n On the Big Island, locations under advisory include Hilo, Hawaiian Paradise Park, Honomu, Keaau, Naalehu, Hawaiian Island View, Pahoa, Pepeekeo, Pahala, Glenwood, Hawaiian Acres and Kawa Flats. \n Previous coverage \n A flash flood warning has been issued for Maui until 4:15 p.m. \n At 1:10 p.m., Maui Civil Defense reported flooding in Pukalani which was threatening homes. \n Rain was falling between one to two-inches per hour, according to the National Weather Service. \n Heavy rain and ponding was also reported in Waiehu and Waihee near Waihee School. \n Locations in the warning include but are not limited to Honokohau, Pauwela, Huelo, Paia, Pukalani, Makawao, and Puunene. \n Windward Oahu and Maui are under a flash flood advisory. \n The advisory for Oahu is in effect until 3:45 p.m. after radar indicated heavy rainfall from Kaaawa to Waimanalo. Rain was falling at a rate of one to two-inches per hour, according to the National Weather Service. \n Locations in the advisory include but are not limited to Maunawili, Waimanalo, Kailua, Waikane, Kaneohe, Waiahole, Ahuimanu, and Kahaluu. \n The advisory for Maui, which has been extended through 2:30 p.m., includes but is not limited do Kahului, Haliimaile, Honokohau, Pauwela, Huelo, Kahakuloa, Haiku-Pauwela, Nahiku, Keanae, Waihee and Waiehu. \n Weather officials at the National Weather Service issued the advisory after radar showed moderate to heavy showers moving over the windward side of Maui. \n An earlier flash flood warning for Maui was canceled early this morning. \n However, a flash flood watch was issued at 3:21 a.m. that covers Maui, Molokai, Lanai, and Hawaii island, and is in effect through Wednesday afternoon. \n \"Deep tropical moisture and an upper level trough will result in a threat of heavy rainfall and flooding,\" weather officials said. \n Muggy weather and rain is expected on most islands through Thursday as an area of tropical moisture lingers over the state. \n In addition, a flash flood watch has been issued for Lanai, Maui, Molokai, and the Big Island through Thursday afternoon. \n ", "author": "By Star-Advertiser staff", "title": "Flood advisory in effect for Big Isle; flash flood watch for all but Kauai"}

{"date": "September 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton arrives to attend a ceremony at the National September 11 Memorial, in New York on Sunday on the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. \n WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. \u00bb Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said today that she's feeling better since falling ill at a 9/11 memorial ceremony, but she never lost consciousness and didn't think her pneumonia diagnosis was significant enough to disclose beforehand.  \n \"I just didn't think it was going to be that big a deal,\" she said of the pneumonia diagnosis she received Friday. She told CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\" that despite doctor's orders to rest for five days, she thought she could \"just keep going forward and power through it and that didn't work out so well.\" \n Clinton abruptly left the ceremony and appeared to stumble while she was waiting for her motorcade. Asked whether she fainted, Clinton replied: \"No, I didn't. I felt dizzy and I did lose my balance for a minute. But I got in, once I could sit down, once I could cool off, once I got some water, I immediately started feeling better.\" \n Clinton's evening interview, in which she promised to release more information at some point, came as her campaign scrambled to head off lasting damage from a difficult weekend. Aides are promising to release more of her medical records following her bout of pneumonia and conceding they were too slow in providing information about her condition. \n An outbreak of respiratory illness swept through Hillary Clinton's campaign in the weeks before she was diagnosed with pneumonia, campaign aides said Monday. \n The Democratic presidential candidate abruptly left Sunday's event after feeling \"overheated.\" A video later posted on Twitter showed her staggering and eventually slumping forward before being held up by three people as she was helped into a van. \n On Sunday, her campaign answered questions about Clinton's health and whereabouts with two short statements, both issued hours after she left the memorial in lower Manhattan. More than 20 hours later, her campaign gave a fuller accounting of the episode, which sparked a wave of bipartisan concern about her health and questions about her political transparency. \n Clinton's husband, former president Bill Clinton, said in an interview Monday with PBS' Charlie Rose that Hillary Clinton was \"doing fine\" after a good night's sleep. He added that if there are more health problems that caused her apparent weakness, \"then it's a mystery to me and all of her doctors.\" \n He said that \"on more than one occasion\" over the years \"the same sort of thing's happened to her when she got severely dehydrated.\" \n Clinton said in the live telephone interview with CNN that she started to feel hot at the event, which took place on a muggy day in New York. There was little shade where Clinton was standing alongside other dignitaries. \n As family members of 9/11 victims read the names of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks, she decided to leave and get a drink of water. She was wearing a wool suit and had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday, a fact her campaign had not made public. \n In fact, campaign aides said Monday, a number of staff members at her campaign headquarters had been ill in recent weeks, including campaign manager Robby Mook. \n At the apartment, she played with her grandchildren, even chasing them around the room, Fallon said. Clinton exited the building on her own, wearing sunglasses and carrying a handbag. \n She waved to reporters and said: \"I'm feeling great. It's a beautiful day in New York.\" She was then driven to her home in suburban Chappaqua, New York. \n The public was left in the dark about Clinton's whereabouts for about 90 minutes, sparking widespread speculation about her condition. That was a mistake, Fallon said. \n \"It's just the kind of thing that if it happens to you and you're a busy, active person, you keep moving forward,\" Clinton said on CNN. \n Clinton's doctor, Lisa R. Barback, later came to her home and conducted an examination. In a statement released by the campaign eight hours after the incident, Bardack said the 68-year-old Clinton \"became overheated and dehydrated\" at the 9/11 ceremony. By the end of the day, she was \"rehydrated and recovering nicely,\" the doctor said. \n Campaign aides said it was Clinton's decision to attend weekend fundraisers and the Sunday ceremony, despite Friday's diagnosis. Late Sunday evening, she canceled a California campaign swing scheduled for early this week. Her husband will headline some of her events, an aide announced late Monday. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Lisa Lerer on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n This story has been corrected to reflect Mook comment made on MSNBC, not CNN. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton feels good, says she didn't pass out during stumble"}

{"date": "September 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a rally today in Asheville, N.C. \n BALTIMORE \u00bb Donald Trump stood up for his supporters today against Hillary Clinton's remark that half of his supporters belonged in \"a basket of deplorables,\" denouncing the comment as \"an explicit attack on the American voter\" and suggesting that it makes her unfit for the presidency. \n But even as Trump defended his backers, one lashed out at protesters in the hall by appearing to punch and slap them. Trump talked through the scuffle. \n \"While my opponent calls you deplorable and irredeemable,\" he said in Asheville, North Carolina, \"I call you hard-working American patriots who love their country and want a better future for all our people.\" \n But his rally was interrupted several times by demonstrators and, at one moment, brief violence. As several protesters were being escorted out by security, a man in the crowd grabbed a male protester around the neck and then punched him. He then slapped at a woman being led out. The Trump supporter was not ejected by security. \n The celebrity businessman talked through the scuffle but cracked after the disturbance, \"Is there any place more fun than a Trump rally?\" \n No stranger to making his own sweeping negative characterizations of large groups of people, Trump nonetheless deployed Clinton's remark as the foundation for a new campaign theme. The message: Clinton is divisive, while Trump is the only candidate representing \"all Americans.\" \n \"You cannot run for president if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter,\" Trump said. \"You can't lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens.\" \n In a speech earlier today to the National Guard Association conference in Baltimore, Trump said Clinton's comments were aimed at those in uniform, whether in the military or in law enforcement. \n \"These were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized,\" said Trump, who demanded that Clinton issue a full apology. \"She divides people into baskets as though they were objects not human beings.\" \n Clinton has said she regrets using the term, \"half,\" to describe the proportion of Trump supporters she considers \"deplorables.\" But she didn't back down from describing his campaign as largely built on prejudice and paranoia. \n The comments, though, combined with Clinton's health scare Sunday at the 9/11 memorial \u2014 she was captured on video struggling to step into a waiting van and her doctor later announced that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia \u2014 could reshape the race, in which Clinton holds slim leads in several battleground states. Trump, who has long questioned Clinton's fitness for the presidency, was notably restrained on the health matter, saying he hopes Clinton feels better soon. \n A new ad, set to air in the battleground states of Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, is squarely aimed at the voters the Trump campaign says Clinton is vilifying. \n \"You know what's deplorable? Hillary Clinton viciously demonizing hard working people like you,\" concludes the ad. \n Clinton, who has said she is the candidate to unify a divided country, made the \"deplorables\" comment at a fundraiser Friday night in New York. She has made similar comments recently, including on an Israeli television station. \n \"To just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic \u2014 you name it,\" she said, before stressing that other Trump supporters are frustrated and need sympathy. \n Trump and his aides have predicted that Clinton's statement would be more damaging than the gaffe to which it has been frequently compared, when Mitt Romney four years ago suggested that \"47 percent\" of voters wouldn't back him because they were dependent on government. \n But Trump has also attacked Americans who don't intend to vote for him. \n When he trailed Dr. Ben Carson in the polls last December in Iowa, he mocked his opponent's claim that he had tried to stab a family member only to fail after the blade hit a belt buckle. \n \"How stupid are the people of Iowa?\" he asked. \"How stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap?\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump stands up for backers even as rally scuffle breaks out"}

The United States has flown nuclear-capable supersonic bombers over ally South Korea in a show of force meant to cow North Korea after its fifth nuclear test and also to settle rattled nerves in the South. \n OSAN AIR BASE, South Korea \u00bb The United States on Tuesday sent two supersonic bombers streaking over ally South Korea in a show of force meant to cow North Korea after its recent nuclear test, and also to settle rattled nerves in the South. \n The B-1B bombers, escorted by U.S. and South Korean jets, were seen by an Associated Press photographer as they flew over Osan Air Base, which is 75 miles from the border with North Korea, the world's most heavily armed. The bombers were likely to return to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam without landing in South Korea. \n Such flyovers are fairly common when animosity rises on the Korean Peninsula, which is technically in a state of war because there has never been a peace treaty to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War. \n South Korea does not have nuclear weapons and relies on the U.S. \"nuclear umbrella\" as a deterrent to North Korea. Washington also stations more than 28,000 troops in the South, and tens of thousands more in Japan. \n The B-1B doesn't currently carry nuclear weapons under a disarmament treaty. U.S. Forces Korea wouldn't comment on the bombers' capabilities, but South Korean military officials and analysts said that they could carry nuclear weapons if reconfigured. \n Hans Kristensen, a nuclear weapons expert with the Federation of American Scientists, wrote in a blog posted Tuesday that the last B-1B was stripped of all nuclear equipment in 2011 and he does not consider them \"nuclear capable\" in their current configuration. \n North Korea is keenly aware of the U.S. presence on the peninsula and of what it considers the U.S. nuclear threat. It uses such flyovers and the American military influence in the South in its propaganda as alleged proof of U.S. hostility that it says is the reason it needs a nuclear bomb program. \n Last week's nuclear test, the North's fifth, was its most powerful to date. Pyongyang's claim to have used \"standardized\" warheads in the detonation makes some outsiders worry that it is making headway in its push to develop small, sophisticated warheads that can be mounted on missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland. \n Nuclear expert Siegfried Hecker, who has regularly visited the North's nuclear facilities, estimates that the North may have enough nuclear fuel for about 20 bombs by the end of 2016 and the ability to add about seven new bombs a year. \n \"Left unchecked, Pyongyang will likely develop the capability to reach the continental United States with a nuclear tipped missile in a decade or so,\" Siegfried wrote on the North Korea-focused website 38 North. He said that more troubling was the recent test successes may give Pyongyang a false sense of confidence. \n Six-nation diplomatic talks aimed at ridding the North of its bombs have been stalled since the last round of meetings in late 2008. Since then, Pyongyang has ramped up both its ballistic missile and nuclear bomb development, despite an increasing raft of sanctions. \n After last week's test, the North's nuclear weapons institute said it would take unspecified measures to further boost its nuclear capability, which analysts said hinted at a possible sixth nuclear test. \n South Korea's Defense Ministry said Monday that South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities believe North Korea has the ability to detonate another atomic device at any time at one of its tunnels at its main Punggye-ri nuclear test site, where the five previous atomic explosions took place. Ministry officials refused to say what specific evidence pointed to another possible nuclear test. \n Seoul, Washington and their allies have vowed to apply more pressure and sanctions after the test, the second this year. \n \"The United States and (South Korea) are taking actions every day to strengthen our alliance and respond to North Korea's continued aggressive behavior,\" Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said in a statement. \n Sung Kim, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean policy, met South Korean officials in Seoul on Tuesday and said that Washington is working closely with other nations to work out new, stronger sanctions on North Korea. \n Also on Tuesday, South Korean President Park Geun-hye ordered her military to be ready to \"finish off\" North Korea if it fires a nuclear missile toward South Korea. Following the nuclear test last week, she said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's \"mental state is spiraling out of control\" and that his government shows \"fanatic recklessness.\" \n Associated Press writers Foster Klug, Hyung-jin Kim and Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. flies bombers over S.

General Assembly, and Yousafzai says because more children than ever are spending their schooling years as refugees, education is crucial. \n \"It's not just giving attendance, a bit of food that will protect these families in the future, it is also education. You give education to the children of these families and you guide them and you make their future,\" Yousfzai said, taking time off from her homework to talk to The Associated Press by telephone from Birmingham, Britain. \n Yousafzai, now 19, became the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate in 2014 when she was recognized for her advocacy of the right of all children to education. She went to Britain for medical treatment after she was severely wounded in a Taliban assassination attempt in northwestern Pakistan where she and her father had defied the Islamic militants by promoting education for girls. \n Yousafazi will miss this year's General Assembly because she is focusing on her education, taking exams and applying for college. \n But she is sending along a report from the Malala Fund, which she founded with her father, detailing the size of the problem and proposing a new framework enshrining the right to a secondary education much as the 1951 Refugee Convention guaranteed all children a right to a primary school education. \n \"We're not calling for secondary to the detriment of primary, we're calling for both. I think that one of the main things that has happened since the '51 Convention came into being is that the refugee situation has got much more protracted,\" said Philippa Lei, one of the report's authors. \n In 2015, there were 11 million refugees under the age of 18, accounting for 51 percent of the refugee population and up from 41 percent in 2009. \n Meanwhile, the average amount of time a refugee spends in exile is now nearly 20 years \u2014 more than double what it was in the 1980s \u2014 which has led to a situation where almost 80 percent of the adolescent refugees are out of school, according to the report. \n Yousafzai said the situation is especially precarious for young women refugees who are less likely to receive secondary schooling than their male counterparts. \n \"I'm in the last year of secondary school and when I imagine children who drop out after primary school and when I imagine girls who get married as teenagers when they should be in school, it worries me,\" Yousafzai said. \"Because when they drop out from that level they're not even able to go further in their lives and go to university and achieve their dreams.\" \n Education for refugee children, regardless of the level of schooling, remains woefully underfunded because refugee crises are generally still perceived as temporary arrangements. According to the report, donor nations have, so far, only come up with $111 million of the $536 million the U.N. says it needs for education programs in its 2016 humanitarian appeal. \n Compounding the problem, the 10 countries hosting 58 percent of the world's refugees, account for just 2 percent of global wealth, making it hard for them to provide education for their own citizens let alone a large influx of displaced people. \n To remedy the situation, Yousafzai is calling on the international community to provide $2.9 billion by 2019 to the Education Cannot Wait Fund to support more than 25 million of the world's most vulnerable children including refugees. \n \"Education is crucial. I understand that, you understand that, people understand that but when it comes to world leaders' decision making, they completely ignore it, as if they have no knowledge and are completely ignorant,\" Yousafzai said. \"They should understand this because they want their own children to go to universities and get a quality education.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Malala Yousafzai urges schooling for all refugee children"}

North Korea is mobilizing to deal with a disastrous flood that killed more than 130 people, destroyed tens of thousands of homes and crippled infrastructure in its northern-most province. \n TOKYO \u00bb North Korea is mobilizing to deal with a disastrous flood that killed more than 130 people, destroyed tens of thousands of homes and crippled infrastructure in its northern-most province.  \n Brigades of soldiers from around the country have been enlisted to help victims of the flooding, which began Aug. 29 and was caused by Typhoon Lionrock. \n According to a U.N. report issued by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the floods displaced tens of thousands of people and destroyed homes, buildings and critical infrastructure. North Korean media said it was the worst single case of downpours and high winds since 1945, though that claim couldn't be verified. \n The report said the government has confirmed 133 people were killed and another 395 missing. It said more than 35,500 houses, schools and public buildings were damaged, with 69 percent completely destroyed. It reported widespread inundation of farmland and at least 140,000 people in urgent need of assistance. \n The hardest-hit areas, parts of which remain inaccessible, are Musan and Yonsa counties near the Chinese border in the northern tip of the country. \n North Korea's state media reported Sunday that high winds and heavy rainfall swept over several cities and counties, causing buildings to collapse and leaving railways, roads, parts of the electric power system, factories and farmlands destroyed or submerged. \n It said a mass recovery effort has been launched. \n On Monday, North Korea reported construction units were arriving in the flood-hit areas from all over the country, including the capital, Pyongyang. \n \"The country's manpower and material and technical potentials are now concentrated on the flood damage rehabilitation,\" the Korean Central News Agency said. It said the ruling party has urged citizens to \"achieve the miraculous victory of converting misfortune into favorable conditions \u2026 with the tremendous might of single-minded unity!\" \n The North Korean media also said the focus of a 200-day \"loyalty campaign\" already underway to mobilize the nation behind leader Kim Jong Un in a mandatory show of devotion has been switched to a call for all citizens to support the recovery effort. \n The U.N. agency said humanitarian agencies have released relief materials from their stockpiles inside North Korea, including food, shelter and kitchen kits, water purification and sanitation supplies and emergency health supplies. \n The U.N. report said the government is \"urgently working\" to reopen roads, distributing relief goods and preparing to rebuild 20,000 houses by early October, before the onset of North Korea's bitterly cold winter. \n It added that the government had allowed U.N. agencies, the North Korean Red Cross and International Federation of the Red Crescent, along with private international aid groups to conduct a joint assessment of needs in the affected areas last week, but they were unable to access Musan and Yonsa. \n The flooding occurred around the Tumen River, which runs between North Korea and China. \n North Korea experiences frequent natural disasters which are more devastating because of its often problematic infrastructure and lack of civil engineering projects designed to mitigate damage. \n In August last year, major downpours followed by flash floods killed at least 40 people and devastated parts of the Rason area, near the Russian and Chinese borders where a key special economic zone is located. \n A series of floods and droughts were a contributing factor in the disastrous famine years of the 1990s \u2014 called the \"arduous march\" in North Korea \u2014 that nearly brought the country to economic ruin. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "North Korea mobilizes after floods kill at least 133"}

LUCIE SHERIFF'S OFFICE VIA AP \n In this photo provided by the St. Lucie Sheriff's Office, firefighters work at the scene of a fire at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce today in Fort Pierce, Fla. \n FORT PIERCE, Fla. \u00bb The mosque that Orlando nightclub gunman Omar Mateen attended was heavily damaged in an arson fire that Muslim leaders said was the latest incident in an escalating campaign of harassment and violence against the house of worship and its members.  \n Given the timing \u2014 Sunday's 15th anniversary of 9/11 and the start of the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha \u2014 investigators believe the blaze that broke out shortly before midnight Sunday at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce may have been a hate crime, St. Lucie County sheriff's spokesman Maj. David Thompson said. \n No one was injured. The fire burned a 10-by-10-foot (3-by-3-meter) hole in the roof at the back of the mosque's main building and blackened its eaves with soot. \n A surveillance video from the mosque showed a man on a motorcycle approaching the building with a bottle of liquid and some papers, then leaving when there was a flash and shaking his hand as though he may have burned it, Thompson said. \n The arsonist \"is terrorizing our community because we don't know where he is at and we don't know what he is capable of doing,\" said Wilfredo Amr Ruiz, a Florida spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \n Mateen was killed by police after opening fire at the Pulse nightclub June 12 in a rampage that left 49 victims dead and 53 wounded. He professed allegiance to the Islamic State group. His father is among roughly 100 people who attend the mosque. \n Ruiz said the mosque and its worshippers have been harassed since the massacre. \n \"First there were threating voicemails,\" he said. \"Then drivers would splash water on the parishioners leaving on Fridays, and then a member got beat up in the parking lot when he came to the mosque for early morning prayers, and now the mosque has been set on fire.\" \n The mosque has received more threats since the nightclub shooting than it did in its previous 20 years of existence, assistant imam Hamaad Rahman said. \n \"For this to happen to us on the morning of our biggest celebration of the year has made everyone saddened and scared, but our community is bigger than a building. We are stronger than that,\" he said. \"I feel we will be able to pull together from this, and as time goes by we will be able to rebuild.\" \n The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives joined the investigation into the fire. Sheriff's officials released the video and asked for the public's help in identifying the arsonist. \n Ariana Borras stopped by the mosque with her 2-year-old son to pay respects Monday morning. Borras said she is Hispanic and not a Muslim but is sometimes asked if she is Muslim because of the color of her skin. \n The fire \"makes me scared for my son. It makes me scared for my skin color,\" she said. \"There have been a lot of racial issues going on and there's so much hate in the world right now.\" \n Michael Parsons, 22, was standing outside his parents' home, directly across the street from the mosque. He said that since the Orlando shooting, \"a lot of people have been driving by hollering and yelling expletives at the church or mosque or whatever they call it.\" \n Parsons, a gutter installer with \"trust no one\" tattooed on his chest, said his mother's cancer doctor attends the mosque. \n \"America was founded so people can believe what they want to believe and do what they want to do,\" he said. \"These guys flying the American flag on their trucks don't really know what the freedom is they're fighting for.\" \n On July 2, a man was beaten outside the mosque. CAIR said the victim was a Muslim and the attacker hurled slurs. A suspect was arrested. CAIR said that earlier that day, a man in a truck stopped outside the mosque and said, \"You Muslims need to get back to your country.\" \n On Monday morning, a pickup truck with a \"Don't Tread on Me\" bumper sticker rolled past the mosque. The driver revved his engine and raised his index finger in the air as if making the gesture for No. 1. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mosque where Orlando gunman worshipped is set on fire"}

{"date": "September 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Granulated sugar is shown in Philadelphia today. A new study released today details how the sugar industry worked to downplay emerging science linking sugar and heart disease. It's the latest installment of an ongoing project by a former dentist to reveal the industry's decades-long attempt to influence science. \n NEW YORK \u00bb The sugar industry began funding research that cast doubt on sugar's role in heart disease \u2014 in part by pointing the finger at fat \u2014 as early as the 1960s, according to an analysis of newly uncovered documents.  \n The analysis published today is based on correspondence between a sugar trade group and researchers at Harvard University, and is the latest example showing how food and beverage makers attempt to shape public understanding of nutrition. \n In 1964, the group now known as the Sugar Association internally discussed a campaign to address \"negative attitudes toward sugar\" after studies began emerging linking sugar with heart disease, according to documents dug up from public archives. The following year the group approved \"Project 226,\" which entailed paying Harvard researchers today's equivalent of $48,900 for an article reviewing the scientific literature, supplying materials they wanted reviewed, and receiving drafts of the article. \n The resulting article published in 1967 concluded there was \"no doubt\" that reducing cholesterol and saturated fat was the only dietary intervention needed to prevent heart disease. The researchers overstated the consistency of the literature on fat and cholesterol, while downplaying studies on sugar, according to the analysis. \n \"Let me assure you this is quite what we had in mind and we look forward to its appearance in print,\" wrote an employee of the sugar industry group to one of the authors. \n The sugar industry's funding and role were not disclosed when the article was published by the New England Journal of Medicine. The journal did not begin requesting author disclosures until 1984. \n In an editorial published today that accompanied the sugar industry analysis, New York University professor of nutrition Marion Nestle noted that for decades following the study, scientists and health officials focused on reducing saturated fat, not sugar, to prevent heart disease. \n While scientists are still working to understand links between diet and heart disease, concern has shifted in recent years to sugars, and away from fat, Nestle said. \n A committee that advised the federal government on dietary guidelines said the available evidence shows \"no appreciable relationship\" between the dietary cholesterol and heart disease, although it still recommended limiting saturated fats. \n The American Heart Association cites a study published in 2014 in saying that too much added sugar can increase risk of heart disease, though the authors of that study say the biological reasons for the link are not completely understood. \n The findings published Monday are part of an ongoing project by a former dentist, Cristin Kearns, to reveal the sugar industry's decades-long efforts to counter science linking sugar with negative health effects, including diabetes. The latest work, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, is based primarily on 31 pages of correspondence between the sugar group and one of the Harvard researchers who authored the review. \n In a statement, the Sugar Association said it \"should have exercised greater transparency in all of its research activities,\" but that funding disclosures were not the norm when the review was published. The group also questioned Kearns' \"continued attempts to reframe historical occurrences\" to play into the current public sentiment against sugar. \n The Sugar Association said it was a \"disservice\" that industry-funded research in general is considered \"tainted.\" \n Companies including Coca-Cola Co. and Kellogg Co. as well as groups for agricultural products like beef and blueberries regularly fund studies that become a part of scientific literature, are cited by other researchers, and are touted in press releases. \n Companies say they adhere to scientific standards, and many researchers feel that industry funding is critical to advancing science given the growing competition for government funds. But critics say such studies are often thinly veiled marketing that undermine efforts to improve public health. \n \"Food company sponsorship, whether or not intentionally manipulative, undermines public trust in nutrition science,\" wrote Nestle, a longtime critic of industry funding of science. \n The authors of the analysis note they were unable to interview key actors quoted in the documents because they are no longer alive. They also note there is no direct evidence the sugar industry changed the manuscript, that the documents provide a limited window into the sugar industry group's activities and that the roles of other industries and nutrition leaders in shaping the discussion about heart disease were not studied. \n Nevertheless, they say the documents underscore why policy makers should consider giving less weight to industry-funded studies. Although funding disclosures are now common practice in the scientific community, the role sponsors play behind the scenes is still not always clear. \n In June, the Associated Press reported on a study funded by the candy industry's trade group that found children who eat candy tend to weigh less than those who don't. The National Confectioners Association, which touted the findings in a press release, provided feedback to the authors on a draft even though a disclosure said it had no role in the paper. The association said its suggestions didn't alter the findings. \n In November, the AP also reported on emails showing Coca-Cola was instrumental in creating a nonprofit that said its mission was to fight obesity, even though the group publicly said the soda maker had \"no input\" into its activities. A document circulated at Coke said the group would counter the \"shrill rhetoric\" of \"public health extremists.\" \n Coca-Cola subsequently conceded that it had not been transparent, and the group later disbanded. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Study details sugar industry attempt to shape science"}

{"date": "September 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gets into a van as she leaves an apartment building on Sunday in New York. Clinton's campaign said the Democratic presidential nominee left the 9/11 anniversary ceremony in New York early after feeling \"overheated.\" \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Anybody \u2014 no matter their age or how healthy they are \u2014 can develop pneumonia. And it's possible the campaign trail's grueling schedule, with its germy hand-shaking and selfie-taking, increased Hillary Clinton's risk.  \n Clinton's illness appears mild, but it is fueling the question of what else voters need to know about whether she and Donald Trump are fit enough to be president. Yet the reality: There's not much of a crystal ball to predict things like a common infection. \n Clinton so far has revealed more medical information than Trump but both promise to release additional details. Until then, some doctors say watching a candidate in action can reveal one key qualification \u2014 cognitive function. \n \"In an ideal world, both candidates would be more transparent so there wouldn't be questions about these problems that any of us could face,\" said Dr. Mark Gladwin of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. \"Normal healthy people get these pneumonias.\" \n But, \"the most important factor we want to know is cognitive performance, and we can assess that\" by, for example, how nimble candidates are during debates, he added. \n Releasing at least some health information is an election-year ritual but there's no rule about how much the public needs to know \u2014 candidates have rights to medical privacy, too. Then there's the question of whether health information really affects how people vote. \n Clinton, 68, and Trump, 70, each had their own doctor write a letter last year attesting they're in excellent health. Clinton's internist wrote nearly two pages and included standard lab test results showing good heart health and a fairly detailed discussion of some previous problems \u2014 a concussion after a fall in 2012, and some blood clots that have her taking a blood thinner as a precaution. \n Trump's letter was four paragraphs with few details beyond good blood pressure. His doctor, a gastroenterologist, said Trump \"has had no significant medical problems\" and would \"be the healthiest individual ever elected.\" \n Still, it's a far cry from 2008 when Republican Sen. John McCain, then 71, allowed reporters to briefly review more than a thousand pages of medical records to show he was cancer-free and fit to serve as president. \n Releasing more information up-front opened Clinton to more questions about her medical history than Trump. Still, \"women live longer than men,\" Gladwin noted. \"In general women tend to be healthier.\" \n Clinton's campaign hasn't revealed many details of her pneumonia, which was diagnosed Friday. She didn't immediately cancel campaign events; her illness came to light Sunday after she abruptly left a 9/11 memorial event and was seen stumbling while getting into a van. She emerged later to wave to supporters and was at home Monday, all signs that it's not a severe case. \n While Clinton is taking antibiotics, both viruses and bacteria can cause pneumonia \u2014 it just takes the bad luck of the wrong bug lodging in someone's lung. Certain kinds are deadly for the frail. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says at least 2 million people a year get mild \"walking pneumonia\" that easily clears up, often without treatment. Clinton had attributed an earlier coughing fit to allergies; it's not clear if that really was an early pneumonia symptom. \n \"Candidates are constantly out in enclosed spaces, face to face with myriads of people,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. \"It's an ideal opportunity for the transmission of a respiratory virus.\" \n While getting an infection isn't predictable, the public doesn't need every little detail about a candidate's health history, said Dr. G. Kevin Donovan, a physician and bioethicist at Georgetown University Medical Center. \n Certainly, \"we cannot trust their egos to discern when something would overly impair them,\" he added. \"It comes down to not so much do we trust the candidates but can we still trust the medical professional?\" \n So what should voters look for in these disclosures? Any condition that could limit a candidate's life expectancy or lead to disability, such as heart health, Gladwin said. \n \"I think voters want transparency about their current physical function with the idea that they potentially have to remain healthy for four to eight years,\" he said. \n One comparison might be whether the candidates release the same information as President Barack Obama after his last physical: \n \u2014Vital statistics, including blood pressure, resting heart rate and height and weight. Clinton has released almost all of this, except for height and weight. Trump has released his blood pressure, and said he lost \"at least 15 pounds\" but didn't list his actual weight. \n \u2014Lab results, including cholesterol, glucose levels and, for men, a prostate screening called a PSA. Clinton has released all her cholesterol levels; Trump has released his PSA. \n \u2014Physical exam results. Clinton has released that she had a full cardiac evaluation including EKG that found no problems, and a normal colonoscopy, mammogram and gynecologic exam. Trump's doctor said only that he has suffered no cancer and undergone no surgery since a childhood appendectomy. \n \"I don't see in this sniping back and forth about medical issues anything that sends up red flags,\" Donovan concluded. \"It serves more as a distraction than as a real issue.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton's pneumonia fuels debate about candidate health data"}

Republicans say tougher regulation would only hurt U.S. businesses \u2014 costing Americans jobs \u2014 while new taxpayer programs would drive up the deficit. \n Democrats say it's still too easy for employers to hide or deny wage disparities because workers rarely perform identical jobs. And with paid leave scarce and expensive, women and their families are losing out on wages that could be reinvested back into the economy and keep struggling families off government aid. \n WHERE THEY STAND \n Hillary Clinton calls for 12 weeks of government-paid family leave to care for a new child or seriously ill family member, which she says would be paid with higher taxes on the rich. She also backs legislation that would force private businesses to disclose gender pay data to the government for analysis; the bill would allow women to seek punitive damages for discrimination. \n Donald Trump has said he thinks the pay gap isn't an issue. He's called for allowing parents to deduct the \"average\" cost of child care from their taxable income if the parents earn under a certain, unspecified amount. But what about the 40 percent of Americans who don't earn enough to pay federal income taxes? Trump's campaign says lower-income workers would be able to exclude childcare expenses from half of their payroll taxes. \n WHY IT MATTERS \n This issue isn't going away. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women are about 57 percent of the labor force and many are mothers of young children. More than half of mothers with an infant under age 1 have paid jobs, for example. And that number climbs to 74 percent among moms with children under age 17. \n Yet the bureau says women in 2014 working full time earned 83 cents on average for every dollar a man makes. Why? The Pew Research Center says women are much more likely than men to take time off work or reduce hours to care for family members. \n But remove those factors and the pay gap persists. The American Association of University Women found that female engineering majors earned 88 percent of what male graduates did one year after school. Another study, by the University of California, San Francisco, found that male nurses out-earned female nurses by as much as $5,000 a year, even when taking into account years of experience, location and specialty. \n Aggravating wage disparities is the steep cost of child care. Families in 2011 paid on average $143 per week for child care \u2014 up from $84 a week in 1985 (in constant 2011 dollars). According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, child care costs for two kids are higher than the median rent payment in every state. And only 12 percent of private industry workers last year had access to paid family leave, despite strong public support for it and concerns in some states that struggling parents are turning to low-quality, unlicensed daycares because they are cheaper. \n For Clinton's anti-discrimination proposals to work, she'll need Congress and state legislatures to jump on board \u2014 no easy task politically. U.S. businesses have already staved off legislation by warning that a new law would expose them to frivolous lawsuits. \n Meanwhile, Trump's child care proposal does nothing to address the pay gap. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Why it matters: Child care and pay equity"}

However, the official Xinhua News Agency said the Russian ships arrived early today in the Guangdong province port of Zhanjiang and the exercises would be held off the Guangdong coast, apparently in waters that are not in dispute. \n Joint Chinese-Russian drills have become increasingly common in recent years \u2014 this week's exercises are the fifth between the two navies since 2012 \u2014 with the countries joined in their mutual suspicion of the U.S. and its allies. \n Russia has been the only major country to speak out on China's behalf in its demand that the U.S. and other countries stay out of such arguments. That came as an arbitration panel in The Hague, Netherlands, issued a ruling invalidating China's claims to virtually the entire South China Sea, a result that Beijing angrily rejected as null and void. \n Following the ruling, China vowed to continue developing man-made islands in the disputed Spratly island group and said it would conduct regular aerial patrols over the strategically vital sea through which passes an estimated $5 trillion in trade each year. \n While China says the drills do not envision specific enemies or target any third parties, their location in the South China Sea has drawn criticism. \n During a visit to China last month, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Adm.

Today's earthquake happened in the upper southwest rift zone of Mauna Loa, about 3 miles from a magnitude 4.1 earthquake near the summit caldera on Sept. 6, Shiro said. There was a swarm of earthquakes in the southwest rift zone in July. \n The earthquakes are likely not related to recent earthquakes near Kilauea, Shiro said. \n Two other earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or higher struck this weekend in the upper East Rift Zone of Kilauea. \n On Sunday, a magnitude 3.0 earthquake struck at about 5:08 a.m. and a magnitude 3.2 earthquake struck in the same area at about 3:50 p.m. Saturday. \n Earthquakes in the East Rift Zone are likely related to the movement of magma. \n In addition, a series of small earthquakes near the summit of Kilauea Saturday are believed to be related to pressure at the summit because of the the high lava lake level at Halemaumau Crater. \n Mauna Loa last erupted in 1984. \n ", "author": "By Craig Gima cgima@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Magnitude 3.4 earthquake strikes near Mauna Loa"}

He also says the alleged purchases made on his card weren't reimbursed until media requests seeking copies of the mayor's card records were filed. \n A grand jury indicted Kenoi in March on charges of theft, tampering with public records and making a false statement under oath.

As many as 1,300 U.S. special forces troops have been present on the island since 2002. \n \"These special forces, they have to go,\" Duterte said. \"They have to, in Mindanao \u2014 there are many white men there.\" \n \"I just couldn't say it before out of respect,\" he added. \"I don't want a rift with America but they have to go.\" \n Duterte's comments follow a spat with President Barack Obama that prompted the U.S. leader to cancel a meeting last week on the sidelines of a summit in Laos. In the past few weeks, Duterte has lashed out at the U.S. for criticizing his war on drugs that has led to thousands of extra-judicial killings, and denounced military killings that took place over a century ago when the Philippines was an American colony. \n U.S. Troops \n Prior to Duterte's election this year, U.S.-Philippine relations had been strengthening. The Supreme Court in January upheld the validity of a defense cooperation pact that gives the U.S. military the right to increase troops deployed to the Philippines for war games, as well as bringing equipment into military areas including Subic Bay, the former site of a U.S. naval facility. \n The U.S. has also been a strong supporter of the Philippines as it pushes back against China's assertiveness in the disputed South China Sea. Manila's military forces are dwarfed by China's navy and coastguard. \n \"This could just be fallout from the Laos brouhaha,\" said Richard Bitzinger, who studies the military as a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \"It is interesting that he hasn't mentioned the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement. Maybe he wants the U.S. to say it really values its relationship with the Philippines.\" \n Duterte put the entire country under a so-called state of \"lawlessness\" following a bombing in his home city of Davao on Mindanao at the start of the month. The measure allows him to use the military to assist the police to fight crime and violence. \n Duterte said Monday the presence of U.S. forces could inflame the situation and suggested that they may be kidnap targets or killed by local terrorist groups. \n The U.S. hadn't apologized for alleged atrocities committed by Americans on Filipinos in the 1900s, Duterte said, also criticizing the U.S. over its role in conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Vietnam.

Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on March 1. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb President Barack Obama is meeting with the top four leaders of Congress ahead of a month's-end deadline to fund the government or face a shutdown, and with money all but gone to address the worsening Zika crisis. \n The White House meeting this afternoon is likely to focus on an emerging legislative compromise to address both issues. Long-sought provisions to provide money to deal with Zika look likely to be added to a must-pass spending bill to fund the government through Dec. 9. \n Conservative opposition remains but negotiators worked through the weekend on the details. The Zika money has stalled since Obama first requested $1.9 billion in February, but congressional Republican leaders seem likely to jettison provisions opposed by Democrats restricting any of the money from going to affiliates of Planned Parenthood in Puerto Rico. \n It comes as government scientists step up their warnings about the spread of the virus, which can cause devastating birth defects. More than 670 pregnant women in the states and Washington, D.C., have the virus, leading to the birth of at least 17 babies with microcephaly so far. \n On Friday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden said that \"we are now essentially out of money\" and warned that the country is \"about to see a bunch of kids born with microcephaly\" in the coming months. \n Obama, just back from a trip to Asia, invited the GOP leaders, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and their counterparts, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. \n The lawmakers have been back from a seven-week summer recess for only a week but already are eager to depart again so that vulnerable lawmakers of both parties can campaign for re-election. The government funding bill is the only must-pass piece of legislation ahead of the election and thus has become the vehicle for the Zika provisions. \n Obama's priorities for a lame-duck post-election session of Congress may also be on the table at the White House this afternoon. Chief among these is Obama's one major remaining foreign policy priority, the 12-nation Asia free-trade deal Trans-Pacific Partnership. During his recent trip to Asia, Obama repeatedly called on Congress to pass what the White House considers a legacy-burnishing deal. \n Despite longstanding support for free trade among Capitol Hill Republicans, including Ryan and McConnell, there is now bipartisan opposition to the deal in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail, where Donald Trump has railed against it and Democrat Hillary Clinton reversed herself under pressure from the Democratic base and now opposes it. \n Ryan has offered assurances to rank-and-file GOP lawmakers that the TPP deal will not move in the lame-duck session, and McConnell has also indicated chances are slim in the Senate. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama, Hill leaders meet ahead of federal funding deadline"}

Maggie Hassan vetoed a bill that would have prohibited the state from disclosing lottery winners' names without consent. \n But New Hampshire, like a handful of other states, lets winners claim the prize through trusts. By disclosing the name of the trust only, they can shield their identities.
