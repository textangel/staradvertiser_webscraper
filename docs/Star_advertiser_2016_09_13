{"date": "September 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Most Americans are willing to pay a little more each month to fight global warming, but only a tiny bit, according to a new poll. \n WASHINGTON >> Most Americans are willing to pay a little more each month to fight global warming \u2014 but only a tiny bit, according to a new poll. Still, environmental policy experts hail that as a hopeful sign. \n Seventy-one percent want the federal government to do something about global warming, including 6 percent who think the government should act even though they are not sure that climate change is happening, according to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. \n And those polled said they'd be willing to foot a little of that cost in higher electric bills. \n If the cost of fighting climate change is only an additional $1 a month, 57 percent of Americans said they would support that. But as that fee goes up, support for it plummets. At $10 a month, 39 percent were in favor and 61 percent opposed. At $20 a month, the public is more than 2-to-1 against it. And only 1-in-5 would support $50 a month. \n \"I feel we need to make small sacrifices \u2014 and money is a small sacrifice \u2014 to make life better for future generations, \" said Sarah Griffin, a 63-year-old retired teacher in central Pennsylvania. \"Surely I have enough money to spend on something that's worthwhile.\" \n Greg Davis, a 27-year-old post-graduate student in Columbus, Ohio, agreed: \"It's far more important to protect the environment than to save money. I think that's true for businesses as well as individuals.\" \n That a majority is willing to pay more is a new phenomenon, said Tom Dietz, professor of sociology and environmental science and policy at Michigan State University. \n \"While the amounts may seem small, the willingness to take action, even if there are some out-of-pocket costs, is encouraging,\" Dietz said in an email. \n Dana Fisher, director of the Program for Society and the Environment at the University of Maryland, said it's noteworthy that a majority was \"willing to pay at all,\" and added that the levels of support for $10 a month and $20 a month are significant. \n But so was the opposition to higher costs. \n James Osadzinski, 52 of Rockford, Illinois, said simply: \"I have a set budget. I don't have the money,\" while for 26-year-old nurse Marina Shertzer of Pensacola, Florida, it doesn't make sense because she doesn't see climate change as a threat, but something cyclical and normal. \n Of those polled, 77 percent said climate change is happening, 13 percent weren't sure, and only 10 percent said it wasn't happening. \n There remains a partisan divide in how Americans view climate change. While 84 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of independents view global warming as a fact and a problem that the government needs to address, only 43 percent for Republicans agree. And 18 percent of Republicans said they think climate change is happening but don't think the government should address the issue. \n Slightly more than half of Americans \u2014 54 percent \u2014 said they approved of Obama administration rules to cut pollution from coal power plants, the biggest emitter of heat-trapping carbon dioxide. When the question also mentions that thousands of jobs may be eliminated while reducing coal use by one-third, only 45 percent favor the policy; 29 percent are opposed. \n Last December, 190 nations in the world signed an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Two-thirds of those polled were at least moderately confident that the United States could meet its obligations. But about the same number of Americans weren't that sure that China \u2014 the No. 1 polluter \u2014 and India could meet their goals. \n Davis, the Ohio student, wasn't very optimistic about the future \n \"I think as the younger generation starts displacing the older people, I think we'll get somewhere,\" he said. \"But I'm afraid that may be too late.\" \n The AP-NORC poll of 1,096 adults was conducted Aug. 11-14 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. \n The survey was paid for by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. \n Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Poll: Americans favor slightly higher bills to fight warming"}

{"date": "September 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks at a rally at University of South Florida in Tampa, Fla. \n MIAMI >> For Donald Trump, the fight for Florida begins and ends with mass appeal: signature rallies and direct social media contact with voters who believe he can \"make America great again.\" \n Add some 30 Florida Trump employees to about 80 Republican Party field workers deployed around the state and that pretty much covers the GOP nominee's conventional ground game operation in the largest battleground state. \n Then there's Hillary Clinton: 51 offices, with more on the way, and 500 employees combing Florida, and an overall ground game that rivals that of the previous Democratic nominee, President Barack Obama. \n Trump loyalists say they have a deliberate strategy and far-reaching footprint to counter the Clinton behemoth, even if his apparatus doesn't measure up in campaign offices, staff and paid advertising. But the organizational disparity leaves more than a few Republicans scratching their heads. All agree Trump has no path to the required 270 electoral votes without claiming Florida's 29. \n \"Everyone keeps saying you're not doing this in a traditional way, why?\" says Trump adviser Karen Giorno. \"Well, we don't have a traditional candidate.\" She oversaw Trump's Florida operation from the primary season until last week, when she moved to national duties. \n Giorno points to thousands of volunteers led by unpaid chairmen in each of Florida's 67 counties. The Republican National Committee says it has 1,000 trained volunteers to go with its employees. \n Yet only after Labor Day did the Trump campaign open outposts other than the nominee's state headquarters in Sarasota. Giorno's replacement by Susie Wiles came just two months before Election Day. \n Giorno and Wiles say their candidate is in good shape. Either Trump or his running mate Mike Pence will be in the state at least weekly until the election, Giorno said. Between visits, she added, a volunteer network, led by people in each of Florida's 67 counties, will use more conventional methods to build the Trump coalition. \n Wiles, in an interview on her first day as the new Florida boss, said judging the campaign by offices and staff \"isn't the right measure we should use,\" because \"you don't meet voters sitting in an office.\" \n Prior to her job change, Giorno described a two-track strategy she developed with Trump's blessing. \n \"Ten thousand people in an arena and thousands of people on social media are just as good as (Democrats) knocking on 10,000 doors \u2014 and we're doing that, too,\" Giorno said. \"I don't see how people say we have no ground game just because they don't see something that operates just like they think it should.\" \n Scott Arceneaux, senior strategist for Clinton's Florida campaign, calls that \"ridiculous spin\" in a state where marginal shifts in a diverse electorate can tilt the statewide result. Obama won Florida by fewer than 3 percentage points in 2008 and less than a percentage point four years later, with turnout exceeding 8.3 million both times. Polls for months have suggested another tight race. \n Trump's Orange County chairman, Randy Ross, said Arceneaux discounts people like him. \n Ross, whose territory includes Orlando, shepherds other volunteers who run phone banks and knock on doors using voter lists produced by the Republican National Committee's data operation, expanded after Obama's two victories. \"We happen to be using things Republicans learned\" from Obama, Ross added, \"but we are really a movement, just like Mr. Trump calls it.\" \n Brian Ballard, a Trump fundraiser and top lobbyist in the state capital of Tallahassee, said, \"Counting campaign offices just doesn't matter these days.\" \n Florida is slightly less white than the national electorate, but still roughly a microcosm. If the electorate largely reflects 2012, Clinton would capitalize on her standing among African-Americans and Hispanics wary of Trump. Even among Cuban-Americans, a population that has historically leaned Republican, Trump appears to be underperforming \u2014 a circumstance that would pad Clinton's advantage. \n Yet even if Clinton maintains her advantage among minorities, turnout could drop in places like Orlando and south Florida's Broward County, yielding her fewer overall votes. That could give Trump an opening if he's able to goose turnout among whites, particularly in Pensacola, Jacksonville and other GOP strongholds in north Florida. \n Even so, said Arceneaux, \"This is a 1 percent state, so if we win by 2 percent, that's a landslide.\" \n Facing such a landscape, Giorno conceded Trump is late building his paid campaign infrastructure. But other Florida Republicans point to strong local parties that already were using the national party's data and support, while running their own outreach programs. \n Michael Barnett, chairman of the Palm Beach County GOP, for example, says his party has for several years built relationships within the Haitian-American community. That pocket \u2014 numbering in the tens of thousands \u2014 shows up as black voters on paper, Barnett notes, \"but doesn't have the historical connection with the Democratic Party\" that American-born blacks do. \n Arceneaux, the Clinton strategist, questions whether the overall Republican effort can identify and mobilize voters beyond those who identify themselves as eager supporters, given fewer employees and Trump's late effort. \n He joked: \"We like to say that Mr. Trump gives us many avenues to victory.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "In Florida, Trump faces a Clinton campaign behemoth"}

{"date": "September 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Voters cast their ballots in the Illinois primary in Hinsdale, Ill. Republicans have gained ground on Democrats' strength in registering voters in three battleground states and kept their razor-thin advantage in Iowa. \n WASHINGTON >> Republicans have gained ground on Democrats in registering voters in three battleground states and kept their razor-thin advantage in Iowa \u2014 encouraging news for Donald Trump eight weeks before Election Day. \n Republicans added hundreds of thousands of voters to the rolls since 2012 in states including Florida and Arizona, and narrowed the gap in North Carolina, according to data compiled by The Associated Press. In Iowa, Republicans prevented Democrats from surpassing them, aided by a court ruling upholding a ban on voting by ex-felons, who often register as Democrats. \n As Election Day approaches, voter registration drives are in full swing. \n Hillary Clinton's campaign is staging registration rallies and appealing in particular to non-whites and young people, who are more likely to vote early \u2014 if they vote at all. Trump is relying mostly on a base of white voters, urging supporters to be vigilant for voter fraud and \"rigging.\" \n \"The Clinton campaign cannot come close to our output,\" said Sean Spicer, the Republican National Committee's chief strategist, in a campaign memorandum Monday. \n The latest registration numbers aren't an assurance of new voters for Trump. Some changes reflect those who have died and been removed from the list, while others are inactive, not having voted in recent elections. In Florida, newly registered Hispanics are turning against the Republican nominee, stung by his anti-immigrant rhetoric. And Democrats historically have done well in signing up new voters in the final stretch. \n But the figures, when available, offer important clues as to how each party stands. \n Iowa is a bright spot for Trump among battleground states, with Republicans now holding an edge of 19,000 total registered voters over Democrats, 691,000 to 672,000. While independents are the most numerous at 755,000, much of the state's Republican establishment has rallied around Trump. A state court in June upheld a ban on voting for an estimated 20,000 ex-felons, many of them African-American. \n The race is \"about even\" and \"very close,\" said Gov. Terry Branstad in a recent AP interview. In the run-up to the state's early voting, which begins Sept. 29, the Trump campaign struggled initially in its ground game, leading Branstad to offer advice to the New York billionaire on how to get a leg up: TV advertising, appealing to the state's farmers. \n Branstad's son, Eric, is running Trump's campaign in Iowa. \n Both campaigns have heavily targeted Florida, but Democrats have seen their advantage shrink to 258,000 active voters \u2014 down from 535,000 in 2012. Overall, Democrats declined to 4.69 million compared to a 4 percent rise for Republicans to 4.4 million, driven by Republican gains among white voters. Registered \"no party\" independents jumped 13 percent to 2.9 million. \n The state imposed voter restrictions in 2011, including cuts to voter registration and early voting, that have since been softened. \n But the picture remains murky. \n The Republican advantage is primarily due to declines among previous Democratic voters \u2014 deaths, moves out of state and voters removed after being inactive for long periods, as well as switches to the Republican Party. \n Democrats are registering more new voters than Republicans. Nearly half of all first-time voters registered since 2013 were non-white, many of them Hispanic. \n Since January, of the 121,000 newly registered Hispanics, 42 percent are Democrats and 41 percent are \"no party,\" compared to 16 percent for Republicans. It's a shift from the Jan. 1, 2013 to Aug. 1, 2016 period, when newly registered Hispanics were most likely to pick \"no party.\" Before 2013, Hispanics had more frequently opted to register as Republican, with 39.5 percent of them Democrats, 30.5 percent \"no party\" and 28.4 percent Republicans. \n \"There's little question that the rise in Democratic registration of Hispanics in Florida is a reaction to the rise of Donald Trump,\" said Daniel Smith, a University of Florida professor who analyzes trends. \n NORTH CAROLINA  \n Democrats hold a clear registration advantage in North Carolina, but the gap has narrowed. \n A Republican-controlled legislature in 2013 imposed a voter ID law and curtailed early voting and registration. But a federal appeals court in July invalidated the law as discriminatory against blacks, who are more likely to vote before Election Day. \n Democrats hold a lead of about 645,000 voters. That's down from an advantage of 818,000 in 2012. \n Despite a registration deficit, Republicans have been successful with voter turnout, currently holding the governorship and both Senate seats. Obama lost the state by 92,000 votes to Mitt Romney. \n Election officials predict high overall turnout, spurring an appearance by Clinton in Charlotte last week. \n WEST \n In the diversifying West, Democrats regained their edge in Colorado, but face challenges in Nevada and Arizona. \n Boosted by rapid Latino growth, Colorado saw an increase in registered Democrats since 2012, compared to a 1.5 percent decline for Republicans. That allowed Colorado Democrats to surpass Republicans earlier this year for the first time in more than 20 years. For 2016, the state will conduct all-mail balloting, believed to slightly favor Democrats. \n In Nevada, where Trump is competing hard, Democrats maintained their advantage, but Republicans have narrowed the gap. \n And in Arizona, traditionally a Republican state, the picture was mixed. Republicans grew at a faster pace, but the biggest jump was among independents, to 1.4 million. Republicans hold a registration edge of about 159,000, although an influx of Hispanic voters and third-party interest have given Democrats hope. \n The state has been receiving national attention with a recent hack of voter registration records. \n The Homeland Security Department has suggested federal involvement to protect election integrity. But some conservatives oppose that, citing a risk of Democratic \"rigging.\" For 2016, Arizona placed new limits on mail-in ballot collection, which Democrats are challenging in court as restrictive. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n AP writers Catherine Lucey in Charlotte, N.C., Scott Bauer in Des Moines, Iowa, and AP's Election Research and Quality Control Group contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n On Twitter follow Hope Yen at https://twitter.com/hopeyen1 \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "GOP gains ground on Dems in voter registration in key states"}

The trial of The Bundy brothers, Ammon and Ryan, and five others are on trial nine months after the armed occupation of a wildlife refuge in Oregon as government prosecutors begin opening statements today in Portland. \n PORTLAND, Ore. >> The leaders of an armed standoff at a rural wildlife refuge say they came to Oregon's high desert country to help locals deal with an overreaching federal government that has abused people's land rights for decades. \n \"I felt we were not there to break the law but to enforce the law,\" said occupier Ryan Bundy, referring to the U.S. Constitution. Bundy, who acted as his own attorney Tuesday as a trial began for him and six others accused in the standoff, told the court he wasn't anti-government, \"as long as it's done correctly.\" \n But in opening statements prosecutors said Bundy and the other protesters broke the law when they threatened and intimidated federal employees during the 41-day takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. \n \"Everyone in this great nation has a right to his or her beliefs. We are not prosecuting the defendants because we don't like what they think or said,\" federal prosecutor Geoffrey Barrow told jurors. \"We are prosecuting them because of what they did.\" \n Barrow dismissed claims by group leader Ammon Bundy, Ryan Bundy's brother, and others that the takeover was a legitimate protest of federal land management. The Bundy brothers are part of a Nevada ranching family embroiled in a long-running dispute over land use. \n The standoff began as a protest against the imprisonment of two Oregon ranchers convicted of setting fires and quickly grew into demands for the U.S. government to turn public lands over to locals. The issue traces back to the 1970s and the Sagebrush Rebellion, a move by Western states to win more control of vast federal land holdings. \n The seven on trial are charged with conspiring to impede Interior Department employees from doing their jobs through intimidation or threats. Five are also charged with possession of a firearm in a federal facility. \n Barrow said he will detail how the occupiers were divided into squads and drilled in hand-to-hand combat. He also said one of the participants in the standoff will testify against his former allies. \n Marcus Mumford, the defense attorney for Ammon Bundy, said in his opening statement that the occupation had nothing to do with impeding federal employees. \n Ammon Bundy \"did what he did to demand accountability from the federal government,\" Mumford said. \"He demanded the federal government obey the law \u2014 the nerve.\" \n Bundy grew up the son of a rancher, Mumford said, and became a \"reluctant activist.\" \n Mumford repeatedly asserted that Bundy was trying to take the refuge land legally by a practice known as adverse possession, which is a way to gain title to land by occupying it for a period of time. \n Mumford ended his statement by noting that Bundy and his followers never aimed a gun at anyone. \n Referencing the fatal shooting by police of occupation spokesman Robert \"Lavoy\" Finicum, he said only one side of the standoff shot someone. \"And it wasn't Mr. Bundy.\" \n At the refuge near Burns, Oregon, protesters mostly came and went as they pleased. They changed the signs to \"Harney County Resource Center\" and said they would give the land to local officials to administer. \n The occupation roiled the surrounding area, with some locals supporting the movement and others denouncing the occupiers as unwanted outsiders. \n Counterprotesters, including environmentalists, traveled to eastern Oregon and urged the federal government to administer public lands for the widest possible uses, for everyone from ranchers to bird watchers. \n The Bundys were arrested in a Jan. 26 traffic stop that included the fatal shooting of Finicum, an occupation spokesman. Four holdouts stayed at the refuge for another 16 days. \n On Tuesday about a dozen protesters showed up outside the federal courthouse in downtown Portland. They waved an upside-down American flag and marched around the building during the trial's lunch break. \n \"We're slowly losing our rights, whether it's our rights to farm, our rights to fish, our rights to have ponds on our property, water,\" said John Lamb, a protester from Bozeman, Montana. \"I just see that we're losing them all, slowly but surely \u2014 and we don't even have a say-so in it.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Helpers or law breakers?

{"date": "September 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump walks in the rain with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as they arrive at a campaign rally in Tampa, Fla. \n WASHINGTON >> House Democrats called Tuesday for a federal criminal investigation into an improper $25,000 donation Donald Trump's charity made to a political group supporting Florida's attorney general after her office said it was weighing legal action against Trump University. \n The call for a federal investigation came the same day that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed that his office has been investigating Trump's charity to determine whether it has abided by state laws governing nonprofits. \n Documents obtained by The Associated Press show Schneiderman's scrutiny of The Donald J. Trump Foundation dates back to at least June, when his office formally questioned the donation made by the charity to a group supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. \n The AP first reported in June that Bondi personally solicited the money during a 2013 phone call that came after her office received complaints from former students claiming they were scammed by Trump's namesake get-rich-quick real estate seminars. \n The Trump Foundation check arrived just days after Bondi's office told a newspaper it was reviewing a lawsuit against Trump University filed by Schneiderman. Bondi's office never sued Trump, though she denies his donation played any role in that decision. \n The Republican presidential nominee later paid a $2,500 fine over the check from his foundation because it violated federal law barring charities from making political contributions. \n In a letter that all 16 Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee sent Tuesday to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, ranking member John Conyers of Michigan said federal investigators should determine whether the 2013 donation and Bondi's decision not to join the New York lawsuit violated federal bribery or tax laws. \n \"This fact pattern indicates that these payments may have influenced Mrs. Bondi's official decision not to participate in litigation against Mr. Trump,\" Conyers wrote, specifically citing the reporting of AP and others. \"A number of criminal statutes would appear to be implicated by this course of conduct.\" \n Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr confirmed receipt of the letter Tuesday, but declined to comment on it. \n Bondi has endorsed Trump's presidential bid and has appeared with him this year on the campaign trail. \n She has said the timing of Trump's donation was coincidental and that she wasn't personally aware of the consumer complaints her office had received about Trump University and the Trump Institute, a separate Florida business that licensed the Trump name and curriculum. \n Neither company was still offering seminars by the time Bondi took office in 2011, though dissatisfied former customers were still seeking promised refunds. \n Trump's spokeswoman Hope Hicks confirmed to AP that Trump and Bondi spoke before his charity donated to a group supporting her candidacy, but says they didn't discuss any potential lawsuit. Neither Trump's or Bondi's spokespeople has responded to questions about what the two did discuss, or provided the exact date of the call. \n Trump has boasted in the past that he expects and receives favors from politicians to whom he gives money. \n \"When I want something I get it,\" Trump said at an Iowa rally in January. \"When I call, they kiss my ass. It's true.\" \n In an interview Tuesday on CNN, Schneiderman, a Democrat who has endorsed Hillary Clinton, said his office has been looking into the Trump Foundation to determine whether it has complied with New York laws governing nonprofits. \n \"We have been concerned that the Trump Foundation may have engaged in some impropriety from that point of view,\" Schneiderman told CNN's Jake Tapper. \n \"And we've inquired into it, and we've had correspondence with them. I didn't make a big deal out of it or hold a press conference, but we have been looking into the Trump Foundation to make sure it's complying with the laws that govern charities in New York,\" Schneiderman said. \n Late Tuesday, Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller dismissed Schneiderman's inquiry as politically motivated. \n \"Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is a partisan hack who has turned a blind eye to the Clinton Foundation for years and has endorsed Hillary Clinton for President,\" Miller said in a written statement. \n Trump's campaign has said the improper foundation check to support Bondi's re-election was the result of a series of clerical errors, and that the billionaire businessman had intended to support Bondi with personal funds. \n The Trump Foundation on its 2013 tax return then incorrectly reported that the $25,000 was paid not to the pro-Bondi political group, but to a similarly named charity in Kansas that got no Trump money. \n The Washington Post first reported that Trump's charity paid an IRS penalty of $2,500 earlier this year, following media reports about the impermissible 2013 donation. \n Trump's foundation, which for years has been funded by money the billionaire businessman raises from others rather than his own cash, has come under increasing scrutiny following reports by the Post, AP and others. \n In May, the Post reported that most of the $6 million Trump said he raised for veterans groups at a highly publicized January event wasn't distributed until the newspaper began asking questions. After his campaign released a list of groups receiving about $5.6 million, about half of the 30 reached by AP said they'd received checks around the time of Trump's May 24 Post interview. \n In an extensive review earlier this month, the Post found four charities that said they never received money even though the Trump Foundation reported making donations to them. \n A New Yorker, Trump owns a Florida home as well as resorts and golf courses in the state. Records show he has made $253,500 in political donations there since 1999, most of it going to Republican candidates, the state party or GOP committees. \n His daughter, Ivanka Trump, gave a $500 personal check to Bondi a week before her father's charity money came in, as well as another $25,000 to the Republican Party of Florida the following year. \n Donald Trump also hosted a March 2014 fundraiser for Bondi on the lawn of his palatial Mar-a-Lago Club. Attendees were asked to give the $3,000 maximum individual donation allowed under state law. \n Records show that Bondi's re-election campaign received 24 checks totaling $57,000 on the date of the Trump fundraiser.

{"date": "September 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama speaks at campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2016, at Eakins Oval in Philadelphia. \n PHILADELPHIA >> Accusing Republicans of fanning hate, President Barack Obama on Tuesday stepped in to defend a bruised and temporarily benched Hillary Clinton, hoping to reassure Democrats nervous both about their presidential candidate's health and her handling of fresh trouble on her campaign. \n Speaking at an outdoor rally in a Democratic stronghold, Obama praised Clinton as the most qualified candidate ever to seek the office and mocked her opponent Donald Trump as \"not fit in any way\" to lead. He suggested Clinton was again the victim of unfair treatment and a scandal machine that has dogged her throughout her long political career. \n \"What sets Hillary apart is that through it all she just keeps on going and she doesn't stop caring and she doesn't stop trying and she never stops fighting for us even if we haven't always appreciated it,\" Obama said. \"I understand, we're a young country, we are a restless country. We always like the new shiny thing. I benefited from that when I was a candidate, and we take for granted sometimes what is steady and true. And Hillary Clinton is steady and she is true.\" \n The remarks were the closest Obama came to mentioning Clinton's rough weekend, during which she disparaged \"half\" of Trump supporters and then backtracked somewhat on her remarks. She also was forced to abruptly leave an event because of an illness she had not disclosed. Clinton was caught on video struggling to stay on her feet. Her campaign later said she been diagnosed with pneumonia. Clinton canceled campaign events this week to recover, but is due back on the trail Thursday. \n Her campaign said she spent Tuesday reading briefing material, making calls and watching Obama's speech on television. \n The incident and the campaign's attempt to keep the diagnosis secret revived long-held concerns about Clinton's tendency to hunker down during a crisis, making matters worse. \n To an audience of roughly 6,000 supporters in downtown Philadelphia, Obama argued that Clinton has been more transparent in providing health and financial records than her rival, as well as releasing her past tax returns while Trump refuses to release his. \n Obama said the Clinton Foundation has \"saved countless lives around the world,\" while Trump used his charity to buy \"a six-foot-tall painting of himself,\" Obama said, referencing a Washington Post investigation of Trump's charity. \n \"I mean, you know, he had the taste not to go for the 10-foot version,\" he said. \n Obama is seeking to generate momentum \u2014 and some passion \u2014 for Clinton in a race that has become uncomfortably close for many Democratic supporters. The latest poll by Quinnipiac University found her with a 5 percentage-point edge over Trump in Pennsylvania. \n Obama's event at an outdoor plaza in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art was his third for Clinton, including his speech at the Democratic National Convention, also in Philadelphia. The president, who remains broadly popular among the Democratic base, is viewed as a key asset in pushing die-hard Democrats to the polls, especially in battleground state urban centers such as Philadelphia. \n Greeted with chants of \"thank you!,\" the president sought to trade on that popularity. He told the crowd that he's enthusiastically behind Clinton \u2014 and they should be, too \u2014 a sort of acknowledgement of lack of enthusiasm among the ranks about Clinton's bid. \n \"Look, can I just say I am really into electing Hillary Clinton. Like this not me going through the motions here,\" he said. \"I really, really, really want to elect Hillary Clinton.\" \n Obama also appealed to Trump supporters. He tried to undermine the Republican businessman's claim as a working-class hero. He accused Trump of being unprepared, unserious and \"not a facts guy.\" He seized on Trump's praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Obama cast as an authoritarian strongman who controls the media and crushes dissent. \n \"Can you imagine Ronald Reagan idolizing somebody like that?\" Obama said, invoking the Republican icon. \n Branding Republicans as promoting \"a dark vision,\" the president said, \"They're not offering serious solutions \u2014 they're just fanning resentment, and blame, and anger, and hate.\" \n Obama reserved part of his speech to \"vent\" about the media, arguing news organizations have treated Clinton unfairly and applied what he described as a false equivalence when covering the campaigns' troubles. \n \"You don't grade the presidency on a curve,\" he said. \"This is serious business.\" \n Trump's campaign met Obama with a statement suggesting he was shirking his duties. \n \"Shouldn't you be at work?\" it read. \"President Obama would rather campaign for Hillary Clinton than solve major problems facing the country.\" \n Trump was scheduled to campaign later Tuesday in a Philadelphia suburb. Pennsylvania, which was carried by a Democratic nominee in the past six elections, is viewed as essential for Trump's chances of achieving the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency. \n Obama built some fundraising into this campaign day. In Philadelphia, he attended a closed fundraiser for the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. About 25 attendees, who contributed $33,400 each, were expected to attend. The event hosts gave $100,000. \n He then flew to New York City for a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee fundraiser at the home of hedge-fund founder Jim Chanos. \n Obama extended his critique of Trump to his Republican allies in the House. The president said Republicans are so disorganized and fragmented they can't even agree on the \"cockamamie legislation\" they want to pass. \n Obama pointed to a push to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen as an example. The effort is backed by some House conservatives but faces resistance from within the party. Obama on Tuesday called the effort \"crazy.\" \n \"No wonder people end up being discouraged and dispirited,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama: Clinton 'steady,' Trump 'not fit in any way' to lead"}

{"date": "September 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally, Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2016, in Clive, Iowa. A war of words over Donald Trump's \"deplorables\" is intensifying as Republicans and Democrats fight to score political points over Hillary Clinton's charge that millions of the New York billionaire's supporters are racist, sexist and homophobic. \n ASTON, Pa. >> Donald Trump rolled out a plan Tuesday aimed at making child care more affordable, guaranteeing new mothers six weeks of paid maternity leave and suggesting new incentives for employees to provide their workers childcare. Spurred on by his daughter, Ivanka, Trump waded into topics more often discussed by Democrats. \n Trump unveiled the proposals in a speech in a politically critical Philadelphia suburb as he tries to build his appeal with more moderate, independent voters \u2014 especially women. Child care is one of the biggest expenses many American families face, surpassing the cost of college and even housing in many states. \n \"We need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work, and to have access to affordable, quality child care for their kids,\" Trump said in Aston, Pennsylvania. \"These solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force.\" \n Trump proposed guaranteeing six weeks of paid maternity leave to employees whose employers don't offer leave already. The campaign says the payments would be provided through existing unemployment insurance \u2014 though it has yet to spell out how the system would cover those costs. \n Trump's Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, has called for 12 weeks parental leave for both mothers and fathers paid for by taxes on the wealthy. \n Trump previously proposed reducing child care costs by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes. On Tuesday, he expanded that proposal to allow families with a stay-at-home parent to qualify for the deduction and to include costs associated with caring for elderly dependent relatives. \n The deduction would apply only to individuals earning $250,000 or less, or $500,000 or less if filing jointly. But because Trump's proposal is a tax deduction rather than credit, its greatest benefits would go to affluent households. More than 40 percent of U.S. taxpayers don't make enough money to owe taxes to the federal government, meaning they would not benefit from a deduction. Lower-income earners would receive child-care spending rebates through expanding the existing Earned Income Tax Credit, the campaign said. \n Trump also proposed incentives for employers to provide child-care options at work. But some of his proposals to prod businesses and communities into providing childcare and other services are anathema to conservative orthodoxy. \n At one point, Trump was interrupted briefly by a crying baby \u2014 but, unlike at a rally in August, he did not suggest he wanted the child ejected. \n The timing, location and subject matter are no coincidence. Democratic presidential candidates have won Pennsylvania since 1992, but Trump hopes to flip the battleground to win the White House in November. And Trump has been trying to soften his image among college-educated women who have been reluctant to support a candidate who has made many derogatory remarks toward women. \n Ivanka Trump introduced Trump in Pennsylvania and, earlier in the day in Iowa, the candidate credited his daughter for his action on the issue. \"She is the one who has been pushing for it so hard: 'Daddy, Daddy we have to do this.' She's very smart, and she's right,\" the candidate said. \n The timing raised some eyebrows among skeptics. \n \"Given the late-breaking nature of this policy proposal it's hard not to feel like it's a pretty naked attempt to speak to women voters less than 60 days before the election,\" said Vivien Labaton of Make It Work Action, which pushes for increased child care access. \n Trump laid out plans to create \"Dependent Care Savings Accounts\" that would allow families to set aside money to look after children or elderly parents. The accounts would allow tax-deductible contributions and tax-free appreciation and could be used to pay for child care, after-school programs and school tuition. To help lower-income parents, the government would match half of the first $1,000 deposited per year. \n For elderly dependents, the accounts could be used to help pay for services including in-home nursing and long-term care. \n Currently, families can set aside up to $5000 annually for child care expenses or elder care but not for school tuition and cannot carry over the amount in the account. \n Trump did not lay out how much the proposals would cost, but insisted the extra spending would be offset by economic growth and other cuts. \n Clinton, meanwhile, proposes that no family should spend more than 10 percent of its income on child care. To achieve this, Clinton would seek to boost federal spending on child-care subsidies and provide \"tax relief for the cost of child care to working families.\" Those benefits would be offered on a sliding scale based on need, though Clinton has offered few other details since introducing the plan in May. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump child care plan breaks with conservative orthodoxy"}

The scallops are produced by De Oro Resources. \n Andres Bojos, director of the agriculture bureau in the Central Visayas region, said officials required the company to test workers, including those who shuck scallops and those who work in their plant.

He said those who were tested include around 100 personnel of De Oro in its plant in central Cebu province and 29 people who work in De Oro's pre-processing plant in Masbate in the eastern Philippines, where the company gets some of its scallops. \n But Bojos said a water sample from Masbate was found to have a high level of coliform bacteria, and scallops are not being sourced from that area for the meantime. He said there is also a possibility that the scallops were contaminated during the handling of the food in Hawaii. There are no known cases in the region of hepatitis A from scallops consumption, he added. \n Four other companies in the region export scallops aside from De Oro Resources, said Grace Paguinang, a Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources inspector in Central Visayas.

{"date": "September 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Barmak Heshmat posed Monday with his prototype scanning device in a lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass. \n Leave it to the great minds at MIT and Georgia Tech to figure out a way to read the pages of a book without actually opening it. \n A team of researchers from the two institutions pulled it off with a system they developed that looks like a cross between a camera and a microscope. \n They said it could someday be used by museums to scan the contents of old books too fragile to handle or to examine paintings to confirm their authenticity or understand the artist's creative process. \n Writing in the latest issue of the journal Nature Communications, the scientists explained how they used terahertz waves \u2014 a type of radiation situated on the electromagnetic spectrum between microwaves and infrared light \u2014 to read a stack of papers with a single letter handwritten on each page. \n The device, called a terahertz spectrometer, managed to clearly read only nine pages, though it could see writing on up to 20. \n \"We were very excited because we didn't think we would be able to see as deep as we did,\" said Barmak Heshmat, a research scientist at the MIT Media Lab. \n While the device is still a long way from actually scanning an entire book, Heshmat said the team is already talking with the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York about using it to inspect some of its artworks and antique volumes. The museum did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n He said it could also be used in industry \u2014 for example, to see whether there are cracks or other defects beneath the paint on an aircraft part. \n Heshmat said that for now, broader uses would be limited by the cost of the device, which runs about $100,000. \n The device works by directing ultrashort bursts of terahertz radiation at stacks of paper. Some of it is absorbed by the paper, and the remainder is reflected back. The signals that bounce back are then analyzed with algorithms that can discern individual letters. \n In the study, the stack of paper had no cover, but Heshmat said he is confident the system could see through one. \n Heshmat said the system works much better than X-rays, which are currently used to scan documents and paintings but entail harmful levels of radiation. \n With X-rays, \"you won't be able to read the pages unless the ink is written by some metal like silver or gold,\" he said. \"But with our system, because it uses a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum, it can identify many other chemicals, so it can contrast between the blank paper and the part that has ink.\" \n He said the project was inspired by the work 10 years ago of a group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that showed you could look through a closed envelope with terahertz waves. With the new system, he said, \"you can actually look deeper into multiple pages.\" \n Researchers not involved in the project said the technology has great potential. \n \"I think it is almost inevitable that terahertz imaging will be an important technology in numerous future applications and that sophisticated signal processing will be an important component for extracting information from the images,\" Brown University engineering professor Daniel Mittleman said in an email. \n He said the researchers achieved \"something the field has discussed for years but never demonstrated as nicely as in this work.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New device can read pages of book without opening it"}

It's also a largely secular nation with relaxed attitudes about nudity. \n Several members of the Norwegian government followed Solberg's lead and posted the photo on their Facebook pages.
