{"date": "September 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Passengers in an inflatable raft move away from an Airbus 320 US Airways aircraft that has gone down in the Hudson River in New York. \n WASHINGTON >> More than seven years after an airline captain saved 155 lives by ditching his crippled airliner in the Hudson River, now the basis of a new movie, most of the safety recommendations stemming from the accident haven't been carried out. \n Of the 35 recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board in response to the incident involving US Airways Flight 1549, only six have been successfully completed, according to an Associated Press review of board records. Fourteen of the recommendations issued to the Federal Aviation Administration and its European counterpart, EASA, are marked by the NTSB as \"closed-unacceptable.\" One has been withdrawn, and the rest remain unresolved. \n The movie \"Sully,\" which opened in theaters last week, celebrates how veteran pilot Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger, played by Tom Hanks, along with his co-pilot, flight attendants, air traffic controllers, ferry boat operators and first responders did their jobs with professionalism and competence, averting a potential tragedy. The plane lost thrust in both engines after colliding with a flock of Canada geese shortly after takeoff from LaGuardia Airport in New York. No one died, and only five people were seriously injured. \n \"The FAA was very upset back then that we made any recommendations at all,\" recalled Tom Haueter, who was the NTSB's head of major accident investigations at the time. \"They thought this was a success story.\" \n But to investigators, the event turned up problems. \"This could happen again and we want to make sure that if it does, there are some better safety measures in place,\" Haueter said. \n Recommendations that got an \"unacceptable\" response deal with pilot training, directions for pilots facing the loss of power in both engines, equipping planes with life rafts and vests and making it easier for passengers to use them, among other issues. \n The untold story of the \"Miracle on the Hudson\" was the part luck played in preventing catastrophe on that freezing afternoon in January 2009. The wind chill was 2 degrees and the water temperature was 41 degrees, raising the risk of \"cold shock,\" a condition in which people lose the use of their arms and legs, usually drowning within 5 minutes. \n It was sheer chance that the plane, an Airbus A320, was equipped with rafts, life vests and seat cushions that can be used for flotation. The equipment is only required on \"extended overwater\" flights, and not on Flight 1549's New York to Charlotte, North Carolina, route. \n The NTSB recommended requiring life vests and flotation cushions on all planes, regardless of the route. But the FAA responded that it was leaving that up to the airlines. \n The board also recommended that all passenger safety briefings by flight attendants include life-vest demonstrations, and that vest storage be redesigned for easier retrieval. Demonstrations are still only required on extended overwater flights, although many airlines include them on all flights. \n The board's investigation found that only 10 passengers retrieved their life vests and not all of them put them on correctly. Despite some changes by the FAA, the board says it still takes more than a few seconds to retrieve vests, which is all the time passengers will take to get them when exiting a plane filling with water. \n Because Flight 1549's descent was faster than the plane is designed to handle for a ditching, the underside of the aircraft was damaged when it hit the water. The two rear slides-rafts were submerged and unusable. That left only the two forward life rafts, which are designed to hold a maximum of 110 people \u2014 well short of the 155 on board. Many of the passengers wound up standing on the wings as the plane gradually sank into the river. \n The NTSB recommended changing the location of rafts and slides that double as rafts to ensure capacity for all passengers, since it's unlikely the rear rafts would be available. The FAA rejected that, saying that if Sullenberger had followed Airbus' directions on descent speeds for ditching, the rear rafts would have been usable. The NTSB replied that the ability of pilots to achieve those descent speeds has never been tested and can't be relied on. \n Some passengers wound up using the inflated ramps as rafts even though they're not designed for that. But passengers weren't able to release the ramps from the plane, running the risk that the ramps would be pulled underwater along with it. The NTSB recommended requiring quick-release attachments for the ramps. The FAA rejected the advice, saying its analysis showed that the attachments were likely to be fully or partially underwater. NTSB said its investigation showed that wasn't the case. \n In the movie, immediately after Flight 1549's engines quit, first officer Jeff Skiles, played by Aaron Eckhart, began going through a checklist of procedures for restarting the engines. Pilots are trained to do that in an emergency when they don't know how to fix a problem, but Skiles was only able to get through a fraction of the checklist items before the plane landed in the river. \n The NTSB's investigation showed the procedures were designed for a dual-engine failure at a cruising altitude above 20,000 feet, high enough for pilots to complete the list while descending and still have time to regain altitude. But Flight 1549 collided with the geese at an altitude of only 2,818 feet. Among NTSB's closed-unacceptable recommendations are that the FAA require airlines to include procedures for a low-altitude, dual-engine failure in checklists and pilot training. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Safety recommendations unfulfilled 7 years after Flight 1549"}

Patterson was ordered held without bond in Oklahoma. \n Patterson said he intends to waive extradition back to California to face charges in the deaths. The girls' mothers first reported them missing as runaways on Nov. 12, 1973, after they failed to return home overnight from a shopping trip to a mall in nearby Linda. \n The Yuba County Sheriff's Department was notified a few hours later that their bodies had been found along a dirt road in a wooded area near Marysville, north of Sacramento, where they had been shot at close range. \n The case went cold decades ago, Yuba County authorities said, until a state forensics lab matched DNA from the two suspects to semen found on Derryberry. \n \"It's just like it reopened \u2014 it's like it just happened again. And it's really, really hard,\" Margrette Hasting, the mother of Valerie Janice Lane, said after the arraignment. \n The six charges \u2014 three for each of the victims \u2014 include one count each of premeditated murder, one count of murder committed during a rape or attempted rape, and one count of murder committed while molesting a child. \n But the defendants won't face the possibility of execution if convicted, District Attorney Patrick McGrath told The Associated Press. \n The case must be tried under the law as it existed in California in 1973, he said in an email: \"During that time, the death penalty was not available in California, so the death penalty is not under consideration.\" \n The most the men could face is a life sentence, and the law then provided that they could be considered for parole after serving seven years, McGrath said. The death penalty wasn't reinstated in California until 1977. \n Vacek said the girls' families had little reaction when they were told Tuesday that the death penalty wasn't an option. \"I think they were just kind of overwhelmed with the information they were being provided, so that was just a piece of it,\" he said. \n Harbour was set for his next court appearance on Oct. 19, when Vacek said prosecutors hope to have both men back in Yuba County. Public Defender Brian Davis was appointed Wednesday to represent Harbour and declined comment. \n Investigators in the 1970s carefully noted each of the more than 60 people they interviewed, Vacek said, and the suspects' names never came up. \n They later considered Patterson after he was charged in 1976 with raping two women in nearby Chico, Vacek said, but found no link to the killing of the two girls until the DNA match decades later. \n Detectives at the time \"had done pretty much a bang-up job in doing a thorough investigation,\" Vacek said. \"To not have run across these guys is a little surprising, I guess \u2026 We're reasonably confident there was nothing to connect them to the crimes at the time.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Tim Talley contributed from Oklahoma City. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "1973 killings of 2 California girls won't lead to executions"}

{"date": "September 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / APRIL 2014 \n An e-cigarette is demonstrated in Chicago. \n The more that vaping takes hold in England, the better the odds that smokers there will succeed in their attempts to stop using regular cigarettes.  \n These parallel trends, reported today in the BMJ medical journal, don't prove that electronic cigarettes help smokers kick the habit. But that possibility is looking more and more likely, experts said. \n Smoking prevalence in the United Kingdom fell significantly from 2014 to 2015, and that's a sign that something over there is working, according to an editorial that accompanies the study. \n \"Successful quitting through substitution with e-cigarettes is one likely major contributor,\" wrote John Britton, director of the UK Center for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at the University of Nottingham. \"The challenge for public health is to embrace the potential of this new technology and put it to full use.\" \n Health experts in England have been contemplating the smoking-cessation benefits of e-cigarettes for several years. A previous study of English smokers found that would-be quitters who vaped were about 60 percent more likely to succeed compared with smokers who tried to go cold turkey or used nicotine replacement products, like patches or gum. \n This time, researchers from University College London wanted to see whether the prevalence of e-cigarette use among active smokers \u2014 and especially among those trying to quit \u2014 had anything to do with a smoker's likelihood of kicking the habit. \n The researchers examined data on nearly 80,000 smokers who took part in England's Smoking Toolkit Study from 2006 to 2015. In the last quarter of 2006, 10.6 percent of quit attempts succeeded. By the first quarter of 2015, the success rate had climbed to 18.6 percent, according to the study. \n Meanwhile, the proportion of smokers who also vaped increased from virtually zero to 21.3 percent during the same period, the researchers found. \n Vaping was even more popular among smokers who were trying to quit, with 35 percent of them using the electronic devices in 2015. That embrace of e-cigarettes coincided with a drop in use of more conventional nicotine replacement products. \n The researchers found no conclusive link between vaping and attempts to quit smoking. But their calculations showed that \"for every 1 percent increase in e-cigarette use, the success of quit attempts increased by 0.098 percent,\" according to the study. In addition, for every 1 percent increase in vaping among smokers trying to quit, the success rate of quit attempts rose by 0.058 percent, the study said. \n If e-cigarette use really is helping smokers quit, that means 54,288 people in England who were able to stop smoking in 2015 can thank vaping for their success. Although roughly two-thirds of them can be expected to fall off the wagon, that still leaves about 18,000 \"long term ex-smokers\" as a result of e-cigarette use, the study authors wrote. \n It may not sound like much of an improvement, but it's \"clinically significant because of the huge health gains from stopping smoking,\" the researchers wrote. \"A 40-year-old smoker who quits permanently can expect to gain nine life years compared with a continuing smoker.\" \n In the early days of vaping, health experts worried that e-cigarettes would encourage smokers to keep on smoking by providing a socially acceptable substitute in venues where regular cigarettes were banned. But the new study suggests that the opposite is true, Britton wrote in the editorial. \n (One of the study authors, health psychologist Robert West, has served as a consultant to companies that make smoking cessation products but doesn't accept money from tobacco or e-cigarette companies.

{"date": "September 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former Filipino militiaman Edgar Matobato answered questions as he testified before the Philippine Senate in Pasay, south of Manila on Thursday. \n MANILA \u00bb A former Filipino militiaman testified before the country's Senate on Thursday that President Rodrigo Duterte, when he was still a city mayor, ordered him and other members of a liquidation squad to kill criminals and opponents in gangland-style assaults that left about 1,000 dead. \n Edgar Matobato, 57, told the nationally televised Senate committee hearing that he heard Duterte order some of the killings, and acknowledged that he himself carried out about 50 deadly assaults as an assassin, including a suspected kidnapper fed to a crocodile in 2007 in southern Davao del Sur province. \n Rights groups have long accused Duterte of involvement in death squads, claims he has denied, even while engaging in tough talk in which he stated his approach to criminals was to \"kill them all.\" Matobato is the first person to admit any role in such killings, and to directly implicate Duterte under oath in a public hearing. \n The Senate committee inquiry was led by Sen. Leila de Lima, a staunch critic of Duterte's anti-drug campaign that has left more than 3,000 suspected drug users and dealers dead since he assumed the presidency in June. Duterte has accused de Lima of involvement in illegal drugs, alleging that she used to have a driver who took money from detained drug lords. She has denied the allegations. \n Matobato said Duterte had once even issued an order to kill de Lima, when she chaired the Commission on Human Rights and was investigating the mayor's possible role in extrajudicial killings in 2009 in Davao. He said he and others were waiting to ambush de Lima but she did not go to a part of a hilly area \u2014 a suspected mass grave \u2014 where they were waiting to open fire. \n \"If you went inside the upper portion, we were already in ambush position,\" Matobato told de Lima. \"It's good that you left.\" \n The recent killings of suspected drug dealers have sparked concerns in the Philippines and among U.N. and U.S. officials, including President Barack Obama, who have urged Duterte's government to take steps to rapidly stop the killings and ensure his anti-drug war complies with human rights laws and the rule of law. \n Duterte has rejected the criticisms, questioning the right of the U.N., the U.S. and Obama to raise human rights issues, when U.S. forces, for example, had massacred Muslims in the country's south in the early 1900s as part of a pacification campaign. \n Matobato said under oath that the killings went on from 1988, when Duterte first became Davao city mayor, to 2013, when Matobato said he expressed his desire to leave the death squad. He said that prompted his colleagues to implicate him criminally in one killing to silence him. \n \"Our job was to kill criminals like drug pushers, rapists, snatchers. These are the kind we killed every day,\" Matobato said. But he said their targets were not only criminals but also opponents of Duterte and one of his sons, Paolo Duterte, who is now the vice mayor of Davao. \n Presidential spokesman Martin Andanar rejected the allegations, saying government investigations into Duterte's time as mayor of Davao had already gone nowhere because of a lack of evidence and witnesses. \n Philippine human rights officials and advocates have previously said potential witnesses refused to testify against Duterte when he was still mayor out of fear of being killed. \n There was no immediate reaction from Duterte. Another Duterte spokesman, Ernesto Abella, said at a news conference that while Matobato \"may sound credible, it is imperative that each and every one of us properly weigh whatever he said and respond right.\" \n Matobato said the victims in Davao allegedly ranged from petty criminals to a wealthy businessman from central Cebu province who was killed in 2014 in his office in Davao city, allegedly because of a feud with Paolo Duterte over a woman. The president's son said the allegations were without proof and \"are mere hearsay,\" telling reporters he would \"not dignify the accusations of a mad man.\" \n Other victims were a suspected foreign militant whom Matobato said he strangled, then chopped into pieces and buried in a quarry in 2002. Another was a radio commentator, Jun Pala, who was critical of Duterte and was killed by motorcycle-riding gunmen while walking home in 2003. \n After a 1993 bombing of a Roman Catholic cathedral in Davao city, Matobato said Duterte ordered him and his colleagues to launch attacks on mosques in an apparent retaliation. He testified he hurled a grenade at one mosque but there were no casualties because the attacks were carried out when no one was praying. \n Matobato said some of the squad's victims were shot and dumped on Davao streets or buried in three secret pits, while others were disposed of at sea with their stomachs cut open and their bodies tied to concrete blocks. \n \"They were killed like chickens,\" said Matobato, who added he that backed away from the killings after feeling guilty and entered a government witness-protection program. \n He left the protection program when Duterte became president, fearing he would be killed, and said he decided to surface now \"so the killings will stop.\" \n Matobato's testimony set off a tense exchange between pro-Duterte and opposition senators. \n Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano accused Matobato of being part of a plot to unseat Duterte. \"I'm testing to see if you were brought here to bring down this government,\" he said. \n De Lima eventually declared Cayetano \"out of order\" and ordered Senate security personnel to restrain him. \n Another senator, former national police chief Panfilo Lacson, warned Matobato that his admissions that he was involved in killings could land him in jail. \n \"You can be jailed with your revelations,\" Lacson said. \"You have no immunity.\" \n Duterte has immunity from lawsuits as a president, but de Lima said that principle may have to be revisited now. \"What if a leader is elected and turns out to be a mass murderer?\" de Lima asked in a news conference after the tense Senate hearing. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Witness says Philippine president ordered killings of 1,000"}

{"date": "September 14, 2016", "text": "What happens when you remove all the biggest animals from the ocean? Stick around for the next few thousand years and you might find out.  \n A new study finds that in our modern era, large marine animals are significantly more likely to go extinct than small ones. \n It's a disturbing pattern that has the potential to wipe out many of the top predators in our oceans, and the researchers say it has never been seen before in the history of our planet. \n After analyzing marine fossil records that go as far back as 445 million years, the authors report that in the past extinction rates have been fairly egalitarian, affecting ocean animals of all sizes equally. \n \"The Earth is experiencing something it has never experienced before,\" said Jonathan Payne, a paleobiologist at Stanford University and the first author on the paper. \"Biologically, we are going into uncharted territory.\" \n He and his colleagues add that losing our biggest marine animals could have unexpected effects on the ocean ecology. \n \"We might be skimming off the top of the food web, or changing the distribution of temperature and energy,\" said Noel Heim, a postdoctoral researcher in Payne's lab and a co-author on the study. \"A blue whale diving down to feed might mix a whole lot of ocean water. A larger clam will mix more sediments than a smaller one.\" \n Stuart Pimm, a professor of conservation ecology at Duke University who was not involved in the research, agreed. \n \"Big animals are important in themselves, but removing them could also dramatically change marine ecology and the way oceans work,\" he said. \n In the paper published today in the journal Science, the authors compare the traits of 2,497 marine vertebrates and mollusks including those that have already gone extinct and those in danger of going extinct in the near future. The list of modern at risk animals was taken from the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. \n The researchers considered four traits in particular \u2014 size (the animal's length), habitat zone (whether it lived in open water or on the seafloor), motility (if it swims around or stays in one spot) and feeding (whether it is a predator or not). \n Next they looked at how these traits were correlated with extinction rates during five mass extinction events over the last 455 million years, as well as what they call the background extinction rates of the last 66 million years. \n \"Background extinction is in contrast to these five intervals of mass extinction,\" Heim said. \"Things are always going extinct and are always being replaced with new species. We consider this the normal rate of extinction.\" \n The authors found that during the mass extinction events, smaller animals were a tad more likely than larger animals to go extinct. In addition, stationary animals were more likely to survive all but the last mass extinction event compared with those that can swim, and marine animals that live in the open water were more likely to die off than those that live on the ocean floor. \n Over the last 66 million years, however, different patterns have emerged. \n During most of this period, predators were slightly more likely to die off than non-predators. Mobile animals were more likely to go extinct than those that could not swim around, and up until recently, small animals were a little more likely than large animals to face extinction. \n However, in the last 500 years, the pattern has shifted dramatically, and now, size has overtaken all other factors as the biggest predictor of likely extinction, and by a lot. \n The authors report that for modern marine vertebrates and mollusks the risk of extinction goes up by a factor of 13 for every tenfold increase in the animal's size. \n That means that compared with a small marine animal, one that's 10 times bigger is 13 times more likely to become extinct. \n \"I was surprised by how strong and consistent the body size signal was,\" Payne said. \"It shows up every way we treat the data.\" \n Although the study does not directly address the cause of this change in extinction risk, the researchers are pretty sure they know what's behind it: us. \n \"After looking at the fossil record and then looking at fisheries studies, we can't think of anything but human hunting that might be the cause of this very strange size selectivity,\" Heim said. \n The authors also note that the pressures on large-bodied marine animals are similar to those experienced by large-bodied terrestrial animals that were hunted to extinction earlier in human history like mammoths. \n \"It's easier to pick off the biggest animals whether it's on land or at sea,\" Heim said. \"It takes less energy to catch a big whale or a single elephant or mastodon than catching an equal mass of smaller fish or the equivalent number of deer.\" \n The good news is that there is still time to reverse this trend. Payne and Heim pointed to the history of the elephant seal, which was hunted almost to extinction in the early 1900s but has since rebounded after it was protected by national law. \n \"There were somewhere around 100 left at the turn of the 20th century, but now there are 200,000 individuals,\" Heim said. \"We have the capacity to degrade the system, but there are hopeful examples that suggest if we change what we are doing, we can have a positive impact.\" \n Pimm said the study is a useful piece of work that combines what we know about the current extinction crisis in the ocean with what happened in the past.  \n However, he notes that the modern extinctions mentioned in the study are projected ones, which means humans still have time to scale back hunting of the largest marine animals. \n \"A paper like this is a warning of what will happen if we don't get our act together,\" he said. \"We have brought gray whales back from the brink of extinction and blue whales are coming back too.

{"date": "September 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Douglas Collett, a retired construction worker from Cromhall, England, speaks about his prostate cancer diagnosis. The 73-year-old says, \"My initial reaction was to get rid of it.\" But after reading up on the risks and benefits of surgery and radiation, he feels more men should be fully informed about the various strategies. \n LONDON >> Men with early prostate cancer who choose to closely monitor their disease are just as likely to survive at least 10 years as those who have surgery or radiation, finds a major study that directly tested and compared these options. \n Survival from prostate cancer was so high \u2014 99 percent, regardless of which approach men had \u2014 that the results call into question not only what treatment is best but also whether any treatment at all is needed for early-stage cases. And that in turn adds to concern about screening with PSA blood tests, because screening is worthwhile only if finding cancer earlier saves lives. \n \"There's been no hard evidence that treating early disease makes a difference,\" said Dr. Freddie Hamdy of the University of Oxford, the study's leader. \n \"Because we cannot determine very well which is aggressive cancer and which is not, men and clinicians can both be anxious about whether the disease will progress,\" he said. \"And that pushes them toward treatment.\" \n Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, welcomed the results but said it would be a struggle to convince men diagnosed with early prostate cancer in the U.S. to skip surgery or radiation. He said he often suggests monitoring but \"it's a challenging process to explain to people that certain cancers just don't need to be treated.\" \n \"Our aggressive approach to screening and treating has resulted in more than 1 million American men getting needless treatment,\" said Brawley, who had no role in the study. \n The research was published online Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine . It was paid for by Britain's National Institute for Health Research. \n The study involved more than 82,000 men in the United Kingdom, aged 50 to 69, who had tests for PSA, or prostate specific antigen. High levels can signal prostate cancer but also may signal more harmless conditions, including natural enlargement that occurs with age. \n Researchers focused on the men diagnosed with early prostate cancer, where the disease is small and confined to the prostate. Of those men, 1,643 agreed to be randomly assigned to get surgery, radiation or active monitoring. That involves blood tests every three to six months, counseling, and consideration of treatment only if signs suggested worsening disease. \n A decade later, researchers found no difference among the groups in rates of death from prostate cancer or other causes. More men being monitored saw their cancers worsen \u2014 112 versus 46 given surgery and 46 given radiation. But radiation and surgery brought more side effects, especially urinary, bowel or sexual problems. \n PSA testing remains popular in the U.S. even after a government task force recommended against it, saying it does more harm than good by leading to false alarms and overtreatment of many cancers that would never threaten a man's life. In Europe, prostate cancer screening is far less common. \n Other experts said scientists should focus on how to figure out which cancers are so slow growing they don't need treatment and those that do. \n \"We need something to allow us to identify men with aggressive disease earlier,\" said Dr. Malcolm Mason, a prostate cancer expert at the charity Cancer Research U.K. He said the study confirmed that for men in the early stages of the disease, there is no wrong treatment decision. \n Some participants who had surgery or radiation said they didn't regret it despite learning now that they probably could have done just as well without it. \n Tony Hancock, 60, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer eight years ago in Newcastle, said he originally wanted to have his disease monitored but the study assigned him to have surgery. \n \"Within about 24 hours, I persuaded myself that it was the best option,\" he said. \"I started to think, 'how could you live like that, knowing there's a cancer growing inside you and you're not doing anything about it?'\" \n Although he suffered side effects including some incontinence and pain, Hancock was glad he had the surgery. \n \"Psychologically, I know the cancer has been removed because my prostate is gone and I've never looked back since then.\" \n Douglas Collett, a retired construction worker from Cromhall, said he was horrified when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. \n \"It hit me like a sledgehammer,\" the 73-year-old said. \"My initial reaction was to get rid of it.\" \n But after reading up on the risks and benefits of surgery and radiation, Collett said he was relieved to have been assigned to the monitoring group, and feels more men should be fully informed about the various strategies. \n \"Maybe the first option shouldn't be surgery or radiotherapy,\" he said. \"I'm quite happy to have avoided any of those side effects. I feel just fine now so maybe I never needed anything else.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Treat or monitor early prostate cancer? 10-yr survival same"}

{"date": "September 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A visitor tries out a PlayStation VR headgear device at the Tokyo Game Show in Makuhari, near Tokyo. Virtual reality has arrived for real at the Tokyo Game Show, one of the world's biggest exhibitions for the latest in fun and games. \n CHIBA, Japan >> Virtual reality has arrived for real at the Tokyo Game Show, one of the world's biggest exhibitions for the latest in fun and games. \n That's evident everywhere. Players at the booths are donning chunky headgear covering their eyes and ears, immersed in their own worlds, shooting imaginary monsters or dancing with virtual partners, at Makuhari Messe hall in the Tokyo suburb of Chiba. \n The show, which gave a preview to reporters Thursday ahead of its opening to the public over the weekend, features 614 companies demonstrating more than 1,500 game software titles. \n It's still anyone's guess how VR will play out as a business in years ahead. But most everyone agrees that's the way of the future. And Yasuo Takahashi, director at Sony Interactive Entertainment, the game division of Japanese electronics and entertainment giant Sony Corp., believes 2016 will mark VR's debut year, helping revive an industry that has languished with the advent of smart phones. \n \"Up to now games were played on a TV set. With VR, players can enter the worlds portrayed in games. It's a totally new experience,\" he said at Sony's booth at the show, stressing that VR can't really be played on a cell phone. That also meant VR's impact will be widespread, in genres such as movies and virtual travel, he added. \n One reason for Sony's high hopes for VR: Tokyo-based Sony's PlayStation VR headgear device, going on sale next month for about $400, is the first that might put VR within reach for many regular homes, according to some analysts. Rival VR headsets cost more: Oculus Rift goes for about $600, and HTC Vive $800. \n Although VR's applications vary from job training and real-estate previews to news reporting and education, it's expected to take off in games first. \n A recent survey of 635 industry experts including startup executives and investors, carried out jointly by legal company Perkins Cole and Upload, cited \"lack of compelling content\" as the biggest challenge for VR's future. \n Respondents were most focused on games. They also cited obstacles to VR's popularity, such as cost, bulky hardware and technical glitches. But most respondents were planning to invest in VR, if cautiously at first. \n Tetsuya Mizuguchi, founder and president of the game software maker Enhance, believes VR is exactly the kind of technology his game \"Rez Infinite\" has been waiting for. The game's original version went on sale in 2001 for an earlier console called Sega Dreamcast. \n The new VR version of the game, one of the highlights of the Tokyo Game Show, delivers an immersive, dreamlike experience. \n Once players put on the headgear and earphones, they find themselves virtually flying through an abyss-like universe resembling outer space or the bottom of the ocean, a black that seems to spread in all directions. \n Then colorful geometric designs pop up, bursting in flashes of light with the aim of the cursor or a shift of a VR player's vision. Electronic music, synchronized to the player's moves and virtual explosions, adds to the thrill. \n \"This is about a new way of storytelling. It's a new journey. And so this is not confined to just realism, but it can provoke the creative imagination,\" Mizuguchi told The Associated Press this week at his Tokyo office. \n \"I want to move people in new ways. As a concept, it's about appealing to the senses. But it's actually also very emotional. VR can liberate one's experience from the film frame, which has existed over the 130 years of movies.\" \n The visual abstractness and musical focus of Mizuguchi's game contrast with other VR games that seek to more literally approximate reality, using VR's ability to convey an illusion of 3-D depth and 360-degree surroundings. \n Mizuguchi stressed that his designers, and Sony, were careful to make sure VR didn't make players nauseous. \n \"If someone's first experience with VR turns out to be negative, there might never be a second experience,\" he said. \n Hisakazu Hirabayashi, game analyst and president of game industry consulting firm Interact, says VR is so powerful that creators are still choosing to tone it down to minimize potential risks, including venturing into untested territory such as VR pornography. \n \"VR is a fabulous technology, but it can be even used for torture,\" he said. \"So game creators are still trying to play it safe.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \n Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "VR arrives at Tokyo Game Show, counted on to revive industry"}

{"date": "September 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his wife Melania meet with family members of Phyllis Schlafly before the start of a funeral Mass for Schlafly, Saturday, Sept. 10, 2016, in St. Louis. \n WASHINGTON >> Melania Trump released a letter Wednesday from an immigration attorney that provided more detail on what she said was her legal pathway to U.S. citizenship. But the Slovenian-born wife of the GOP presidential nominee did not publish any part of her immigration file\u2014 official documents that would put to rest questions about whether she followed immigration law. \n The two-page letter from New York attorney Michael J. Wildes, who has represented Donald Trump's companies, also advanced an alternate timeline for a nude photo shoot that had been cited in news reports as possible evidence of Mrs. Trump working as a model in New York City without authorization. At issue is whether the photo shoot occurred in 1995\u2014 before Mrs. Trump has said she began legally working in the U.S. \u2014 or in 1996, as Mrs. Trump and Wildes assert. \n The letter, posted on Mrs. Trump's Twitter account, marks the first time that she has publicly identified the type of visas she held and gave specifics about her entry into the U.S. Mrs. Trump has often said she came to the U.S. legally and used her story to defend Donald Trump's hard line on illegal immigration, an issue that he has made a signature part of his campaign. \n In the letter from Wildes, it's unclear whether Mrs. Trump provided him access to her full immigration file during his review. Wildes wrote that he had reviewed a series of news reports and \"documents regarding the U.S. immigration history of Mrs. Melania Trump.\" But the letter did not indicate which documents. \n Wednesday night Wildes said in an interview with MSNBC that he did review Mrs. Trump's entire immigration file. \n \"Not only did I see the stamps, I wanted to see all approval notices,\" Wildes said of stamps in Mrs. Trump's passport and documents detailing approval of her visas. \n Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung did not immediately respond to detailed questions from The Associated Press about the review and whether Mrs. Trump planned to release her immigration file for public examination. The immigration file is one of several documents that the Trumps have refused to make public including Donald Trump's tax returns. \n Wildes said he did not anticipate that Mrs. Trump would release her immigration files, saying \"there's no issue here.\" \n \"If there was an issue here, I don't know that I would be here in all honesty,\" said Wildes, who described himself as a Democrat and a Hillary Clinton supporter. \n In his letter, Wildes dismissed news reports that Mrs. Trump had been professionally photographed posing nude in New York City in 1995. He said Wednesday night that the photos were taken in 1996, after Mrs. Trump had a legal work visa. \n Last month, the New York Post published the photos along with an article saying they were taken during a two-day photo shoot in Manhattan in 1995. The Post reported that the photos were then published in the January 1996 issue of the French magazine Max. But Wildes said that then-Melania Knauss was not in the country in 1995. \n \"The allegation that she participated in a photo shoot in 1995 is not only untrue, it is impossible,\" Wildes wrote. He said he interviewed Mrs. Trump and \"we ascertained that the photo shoot in question did not occur until after she was admitted to the United States in H-1B visa status in October 1996.\" The letter does not give more detail on when Mrs. Trump said the photo shoot occurred. \n Wildes wrote that Mrs. Trump first entered the U.S. on Aug. 27, 1996, using a B-1/B-2 visitor visa. About two months later, on Oct. 18, 1996, Wildes said the U.S. Embassy in Slovenia issued Mrs. Trump her first worker visa, an H-1B visa, which she used to work as a model. Wildes said she was issued five such visas between October 1996 and 2001, at which point she became a lawful permanent resident. Wildes said he did not represent Mrs. Trump during the process. \n Wildes wrote that Mrs. Trump did not receive her green card through marriage. Instead, she applied in 2000 by self-sponsoring herself as a model of \"extraordinary ability,\" he said. She received her green card on March 19, 2001, and became eligible for citizenship in 2006, the year Mrs. Trump has said she became a citizen. \n Simon Rosenberg, an immigration policy analyst who supports Hillary Clinton, said he's skeptical about Mrs. Trump's ability to qualify for self-sponsorship as described in Wildes' letter. Rosenberg, the president of NDN/New Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, said, \"The letter resolves nothing.\" \n \"If they have all the documents, then release them. It is the only way we can answer the fundamental question here which is whether Melania Trump followed immigration law,\" he said. \n William Stock, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said Wildes' description of Mrs. Trump's immigration history \"is consistent with immigration law, as I know it,\" though he noted the date of the photo shoot is an outstanding question. \n The qualification to self-sponsor to receive a green card is that a person must show extraordinary ability and national or international renown. Stock said an immigrant seeking this type of green card \"can be extraordinary in anything,\" including modeling, and that the strength of a person's reputation can be part of that proof. \n Stock said Mrs. Trump or any other immigrant in the same situation would have been measured by the standards in their chosen field. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Alicia A.

It's hoping that live video of sports and other events will help stimulate more interest in its service. \n It's a crucial time for the faltering company that is trying to improve stagnating user growth, not to mention boost its appeal to advertisers. \n The apps, which are free, will have all the live-streaming video available on Twitter. Besides the football games, this includes content from the NBA and Bloomberg News. It will also have other Twitter content, such as top tweets and Periscopes (video from Twitter's live-streaming app). \n Users won't need a Twitter account or a pay-TV subscription to watch the content. But they will be exposed to advertising from Twitter \u2014 and ideally might be lured into signing up for an account. \n In July, Twitter announced live-streaming partnerships with Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League to show out-of-market games. These are games that are not shown on local TV channels. As part of the deal, the once-a-week live streams of the games are available to logged-in and logged-out Twitter users in the United States, Twitter said.

Last year, Yahoo Inc. won the rights to broadcast for the first time a regular season NFL game across all devices \u2014 including phones, computers and tablets. It showed the game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars played in London. Such broadcasts, which make games available to people without pay-TV accounts, can also serve to expand the international audience of the sports events. \n Twitter Inc. has never made a profit, and in the most recent quarter posted a 20 percent revenue increase, compared with 59 percent growth at Facebook.

{"date": "September 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / NOV. 2013 \n In this Nov. 19, 2013, file photo, George Zimmerman, acquitted in the high-profile killing of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, listens in court, in Sanford, Fla., during his hearing. \n ORLANDO, Fla. \u00bb In a lengthy and heated exchange with a defense attorney today, George Zimmerman called members of the Black Lives Matter movement \"terrorists\" and said he sold the gun he used to kill unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin for $250,000.  \n Zimmerman, 32, returned to the Seminole County courthouse for a second day to testify against a man accused of trying to kill him by shooting into his truck last year. The defense attorney for shooter Matthew Apperson, who maintains he fired in self-defense, peppered his questions with blatant and brutal references to Martin's killing. \n \"You didn't shoot at Apperson because he had a pistol and not a bag of Skittles?\" Michael LaFay asked. \n Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer, in 2012 fatally shot Martin, a black 17-year-old, who had a bag of Skittles in his pocket when he died. A jury in 2013 acquitted Zimmerman of murder, spurring protests across the country and giving birth to the Black Lives Matter movement. \n Apperson, 37, admits to shooting a single bullet through the window of Zimmerman's Honda Ridgeline as the two drove on Lake Mary Boulevard on May 11, 2015, but he argues he acted in self-defense after Zimmerman threatened him. The Winter Springs man faces charges of attempted second-degree murder with a firearm, shooting into an occupied vehicle and aggravated assault with a firearm. Apperson told investigators Zimmerman pulled a gun first. \n LaFay asked Zimmerman whether he associated Apperson with the Black Lives Matter movement. Zimmerman said no, saying the attorney was giving its members \"credence.\" \n \"They are terrorists,\" he said. \"I see them as terrorists.\" \n In May, Zimmerman made multiple attempts to auction the gun used in Martin's death, a Kel-Tec 9mm PF-9 pistol, through online auctions. \n In a post advertising the sale, Zimmerman referred to Apperson as a \"BLM sympathizer.\" \n \"I spent $2.5 million defending myself from the prosecution, so if I sold the gun for $250,000 that's really not making any money,\" he said on the stand. \n Zimmerman testified for a total of about seven hours Tuesday and Wednesday. \n Seminole-Brevard Circuit Judge Debra Nelson, who also presided over Zimmerman's murder trial, admonished Zimmerman for being a hostile witness, interrupting LaFay and asking questions. \n Zimmerman left the courtroom trailed by his attorney and a private security detail of three men. \n Zimmerman and Apperson's first interaction on Sept. 9, 2014, was an argument over Martin's shooting death. Apperson told Zimmerman he \"shouldn't have shot that little black boy,\" according to testimony, and Zimmerman responded that Apperson \"didn't know what he's done for the African-American community.\" \n That exchange also started as they drove next to each other. \n Apperson declined to press charges, but he called Lake Mary police two days later to report he thought Zimmerman was tracking his movements. \n Zimmerman's doctor is near Apperson's workplace off Lake Mary Boulevard on Waymont Court, which could help explain why the two have bumped into each other at least three times in less than a year. \n During the shooting investigation, law officers said they found two guns in Apperson's Infiniti sedan and two guns in Zimmerman's truck, plus one in his backpack. Officers testified it was impossible to see inside the windows of Zimmerman's truck because of illegal tinting, casting doubts on Apperson's statements that he saw Zimmerman draw a gun. \n A police investigator said Apperson appeared to be \"fixated\" with Zimmerman, according to a report. During the investigation, an officer wrote that Apperson, a paralegal, had been admitted to a mental hospital at one point. \n The trial resumes Thursday, when Zimmerman is expected to be recalled as a witness. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Fla.)  \n ", "author": "By Elyssa Cherney Orlando Sentinel", "title": "George Zimmerman testimony: Black Lives Matter is 'terrorist' group"}

We're going to at least keep it going tonight and see what happens.\" \n There continue to be several, isolated thunderstorms on Hawaii island this afternoon, Foster said. \n In addition to the flood watch, the weather service issued a flood advisory for parts of Hawaii island until 7:30 p.m. Rain was falling at a rate of 2 to 3 inches per hour near Honokaa, and the advisory also covered Honomu, Kukuihaele, Papaikou, Waimanu valley, Waipio valley, Ookala, Laupahoehoe, Pepeekeo, Paauilo, Ninole and Hakalau. \n The system is traveling toward the southwest from the northeast, he said. \"It's expected to linger over us tomorrow and then eventually move off to the west on Friday.\" \n On Tuesday night, the rain wreaked havoc on Maui, flooding highways, causing landslides and forcing some evacuations. \n On Oahu, a house on Maunalaha Road in Makiki Heights sustained flood damage when a boulder and other debris clogged a culvert in a stream next to the house in the middle of the night, causing water to rush onto the property's backyard, city officials said. Mud and debris also came down, city officials said. \n The family received assistance from the American Red Cross. \n Meanwhile, the Hawaii State Archives building was forced to shut down today after a leak to a section of the roof of the building caused rain to enter through a vent in the second-floor stacks area. \n \"The rain was limited to one small row of records, all of which were housed in archival quality cardboard boxes,\" state Archivist Adam Jensen said, in a statement. The cardboard acted to \"wick the water away from the records\" contained within the boxes and, while some records were damp, they did not appear to sustain lasting damage, he said. The agency is expected to reopen to the public Thursday. \n The city shut down West Loch Golf Course in Ewa this afternoon, and traffic was unusually heavy westbound on H-1 freeway earlier than standard afternoon rush-hour. \n Meanwhile, Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam placed itself under a Thunderstorm Condition 2 from 1 to 10 p.m. today, urging military personnel to \"take precautions for a state or readiness on short notice.\" \n Windward and mauka sections of Oahu are expected to experience occasional showers with a slight chance of thunderstorms this afternoon and through the evening. The Leeward area is anticipated to have scattered showers also with a slight chance of thunderstorms this afternoon and through the evening with a slight chance of thunderstorms and isolated showers after midnight. \n Locally heavy rainfall is possible, NWS said. \n ", "author": "By Gordon Y.K.

Hillary Clinton's doctor says she is recovering from her pneumonia and remains \"healthy and fit to serve as President of the United States.\" \n WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. \u00bb Hoping to put the issue of her health behind her as she gets ready to return to the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton today released an updated review of her physical fitness and details about a recent bout of pneumonia.  \n \"She is recovering well with antibiotics and rest,\" said her doctor, Lisa Bardack, in a letter released by her campaign. \"She continues to remain healthy and fit to serve as President of the United States.\" \n The details made public by the Democratic presidential nominee included a description of the pneumonia diagnosis she received last week. Her illness became public after she left Sunday's 9/11 memorial service in New York early and was seen on video staggering while getting into a van. \n The health episode fueled long-simmering conservative conspiracy theories about Clinton's health and provided a fresh line of attack for rival Donald Trump, who has frequently questioned whether Clinton has the stamina to serve as commander in chief. \n At rally in Canton, Ohio, this evening, Trump noted the room filled with 5,000 people was hot. \n \"You think Hillary would be able to stand up here for an hour and do this?\" he asked. \"I don't think so.\" \n Trump later added at the same rally, \"We want her better, we want her back on the trail.\" \n The Republican nominee, meanwhile, handed over a one-page summary of a recent physical exam to the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz while taping an episode of Oz's talk show. But voters will have to wait another day for details: the show does not air until Thursday. \n The letter from Bardack, the chair of internal medicine at CareMount Medical in Mount Kisco, New York, said a chest scan revealed the candidate had \"mild, non-contagious bacterial pneumonia.\" She was treated with a 10-day course of Levaquin, an antibiotic used to treat infections. \n The letter says the illness stemmed from a bout of seasonal allergies that developed into an upper respiratory tract infection and cough. Clinton's pneumonia symptoms began around the start of this month, and she saw Bardack on Sept. 2 for a low-grade fever, congestion and fatigue. \n The letter also notes that in January, during the run-up to the Iowa caucuses, Clinton received treatment for a sinus and ear infection that included placing a drainage tube in her left ear. A CT scan of her brain and sinuses showed no abnormalities and mild chronic sinus inflammation. \n Clinton, 68, has blood pressure of 100 over 70 \u2014 within healthy levels and not signaling the need for any medications. She has also had a normal mammogram and breast ultrasound, according to the letter. \n The letter from Clinton's doctor made no mention of her weight, a key part of any medical exam, nor did a similar letter released last year. \n \"These numbers suggest she's a healthy 68-year-old woman with a very favorable cardiovascular risk profile,\" said Dr. Mark Creager, director of the Dartmouth-Hitchkock heart and vascular center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, and a past president of the American Heart Association. \n Testing that shows no evidence of plaque building up in her arteries \"is all very reassuring,\" he said. \n Bardack, who also wrote the letter about Clinton's health released in July 2015, said her patient takes thyroid and allergy medicines and the blood thinner Coumadin, prescribed as a preventative after she suffered a blood clot resulting from a 2012 concussion that led her to spend a few days in New York-Presbyterian Hospital and take a month-long absence from the State Department. \n Clinton has spent the past three days out of the public eye, recuperating at her suburban New York home. She'll return to the campaign trail Thursday. \n \"She's feeling great and I think she'll be back out there tomorrow,\" former President Bill Clinton said today, when he stepped in for his wife at a previous scheduled campaign event in Las Vegas. \"It's a crazy time we live in, you know, when people think there's something unusual about getting the flu.\" \n Vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine is in \"overall excellent health,\" according to a letter the campaign also released Wednesday from his doctor, Brian Monahan, the attending physician of Congress. The letter said Kaine has never smoked and his alcohol use is \"modest.\" He's 5-foot-9 and weighed more than 208 pounds during his last physical in February. \n Clinton's campaign used the letters to argue that she's gone far beyond Trump in disclosing details about her personal life. Beyond health records, Clinton has released nearly four decades of tax returns; Trump has refused to make his filings public. \n \"It's fair to say the public now knows more about Hillary Clinton than nearly anyone in public life,\" said campaign manager Robby Mook in a statement. \"Donald Trump is hands down the least transparent presidential nominee in memory.\" \n Mook added: \"It begs the question: what is he trying to hide?\" \n Trump has said he plans to release the details of a recent physical this week. Trump's Thursday appearance on \"The Dr. Oz Show\" was billed by the campaign as a discussion about his general well-being and his family's medical history. \n But ever the showman, he pulled an outline of results of an exam, conducted by his longtime physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein, from his jacket pocket for Oz to review during Wednesday's taping. \"Those were all the tests that were just done last week,\" Trump said in an excerpt released by the show. \n Bornstein had previously written a note declaring the 70-year-old Trump, if elected, would be the healthiest president in history. He later said he had written the letter in five minutes as a limousine sent by the candidate idled outside. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Update from Clinton's doctor: Democrat is 'fit to serve'"}

{"date": "September 14, 2016", "text": "FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS VIA AP \n This undated booking photo released by the Florida Department of Corrections shows Joseph Michael Schreiber, 32, who was arrested today in Fort Pierce, Fla., and is facing a charge of arson with a hate crime enhancement in connection with a fire that heavily damaged the Florida mosque Orlando nightclub gunman Omar Mateen occasionally attended, authorities announced. \n FORT PIERCE, Fla. \u00bb About two months before Joseph Michael Schreiber allegedly tried to burn down a mosque sometimes attended by Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen, he posted on Facebook that \"All Islam is radical\" and that all Muslims should be treated as terrorists and criminals. \n Schreiber, 32, was arrested without incident Wednesday afternoon and was being interrogated by investigators looking into the fire set late Sunday at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, said Maj. David Thompson of the St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office. \n A July post placed on Facebook by Schreiber, who is Jewish, stated that, \"IF AMERICA truly wants peace and safety and pursuit of happiness they should consider all forms of ISLAM as radical. \u2026 ALL ISLAM IS RADICAL, and should be considered TERRORIST AND CRIMANALS (sic) and all hoo (sic) participate in such activity should be found guilty of WAR CRIM (sic) until law and order is restored in this beautiful free country.\" \n Thompson told a news conference that Schreiber, who has a criminal record, was taken into custody on a street in Fort Pierce by authorities acting on tips from members of the community and aided by surveillance video taken from the mosque and elsewhere. He said the arson charge, coupled with a hate crime enhancement under Florida law, carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. Thompson said detectives were still questioning Schreiber on Wednesday evening, and he didn't say if Schreiber had a lawyer. \n The fire was set late Sunday on the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The blaze also coincided with the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha. No one was injured in the fire, which burned a 10-by-10-foot hole in the roof at the back of the mosque's main building and blackened its eaves with soot. \n Thompson said a search warrant was executed at Schreiber's home, where investigators reported finding evidence linked to the arson, as well as anti-Islamic social media posts. \n Wilfredo Amr Ruiz, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations-Florida, said Schreiber \"obviously doesn't know about the efforts our community is engaged in with our cousins, the Jews, not only in Florida but throughout the nation.\" \n Omar Saleh, an attorney for CAIR, described both Schreiber and Mateen as \"degenerates\" and \"punks.\" \n \"Just like on June 12, when I was stressing that Mateen's actions do not speak on behalf of Islam, I know that whatever religion Mr. Schreiber is, his actions do not speak on behalf of his religion,\" Saleh said. \n Mateen was killed by police after opening fire at the Pulse nightclub on June 12 in a rampage that left 49 victims dead and 53 wounded, making it the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Mateen professed allegiance to the Islamic State group. His father is among roughly 100 people who attend the mosque. \n Schreiber was previously sentenced twice to state prison for theft, according to records from the Florida Department of Corrections. The records show he served his first sentence from March 2008 to July 2009 and his second from June 2010 to August 2014. \n A weekend surveillance video from the mosque showed a man on a motorcycle approaching the building with a bottle of liquid and some papers, then leaving when there was a flash and shaking his hand as though he may have burned it, Thompson said. The first 911 calls were made about 45 minutes later after the fire had spread to the attic. It took about four-and-a-half hours for firefighters to extinguish the blaze. \n The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives joined the investigation into the fire. Sheriff's officials had released the video and asked for the public's help in identifying the arsonist. \n Rabbi Bruce Benson, a chaplain with the Port St. Lucie Police Department, was outside Schreiber's home Wednesday night. He said Schreiber attended his synagogue for about a month last spring to study the Torah, but left little impression, and gave no indication he might act violently in the future. \n Benson said Schreiber's father showed up at his office Wednesday afternoon after his son was arrested, even though he wasn't a member of his synagogue. \n \"I guess he didn't know where else to go,\" Benson said, adding that Schreiber's parents are \"shocked, just like any of us would be if it were our child.\" \n Benson said his reform synagogue, Temple Beth El Israel, has tried unsuccessfully in the past to reach out to the mosque. \n \"We would welcome the opportunity,\" Benson said. \"They're a community feeling under attack. If we could all talk a bit, maybe things like this wouldn't have to happen.\" \n The fire was part of an escalating series of threats and violence perpetuated against the mosque and its members, Ruiz said. He said the mosque began receiving threatening phone calls shortly after the Pulse massacre. And in July, he said, a member was punched in the face as he arrived for morning prayers. \n Sunday's fire has left the mosque's members \"saddened and scared,\" said assistant imam Hamaad Rahman. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Suspect in mosque fire had made anti-Islamic Facebook posts"}

Genki Sushi restaurants on Oahu were shut down for more than three weeks after being linked to the outbreak, but are now reopen after being cleared last week as safe for customers. \n Hepatitis A is usually spread when a person ingests even microscopic amounts of human fecal matter through food, drink or other objects.

Mike Pence's appeal of a ruling that blocked his order to bar state agencies from helping Syrian refugees resettle in Indiana. \n The appeals court is considering the case Wednesday, about two months before voters decide if Pence will be the nation's next vice president. \n After the November Paris attacks, Pence said he didn't believe the federal government was adequately screening refugees from war-torn Syria. In February, a federal judge found Pence's order discriminatory against refugees. \n Pence administration attorneys say the directive is \"narrowly tailored\" in the interest of public safety. But the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana argues refugees are extensively vetted and the state's argument is \"built on fear.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Court to weigh appeal on Indiana's block on Syrian refugees"}

{"date": "September 14, 2016", "text": "UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN CHICAGO VIA AP \n This undated photo in a court filing provided by the United States Attorney's office in Chicago, shows Paris Poe's back tattoo that reads 'The Earth Is Our Turf, and Hobo. Poe is one of six defendants on trial for racketeering and other charges are purported leaders of the widely feared Hobos, a South Side gang that federal prosecutors say murdered, maimed and tortured their way into control of some of Chicago's most lucrative drug markets. Their federal trial begins Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2016 with opening statements in Chicago. \n CHICAGO \u00bb The biggest street-gang trial in recent Chicago history starts in earnest Wednesday, with months of testimony expected to provide a rare look inside the gangland activity fueling deadly gun violence in the nation's third-largest city. \n On trial for federal racketeering charges are six purported leaders of the Hobos gang who prosecutors say murdered, maimed and tortured their way into controlling the most lucrative drug markets on the city's South Side. \n Among the defendants is alleged Hobos hit man Paris Poe, who prosecutors say killed a government witness in 2013, shooting the man 25 times at close range while his horrified step-kids, aged 4 and 6 at the time, screamed in the back seat of a car. The 4-year-old later told investigators the \"Boogie Man\" had attacked them, according to court filings. \n Prosecutors will seek to prove that the defendants' criminal conspiracy involved at least nine murders, including the killing of semi-pro basketball player, Eddie Moss Jr., in a case of mistaken identity and the fatal drive-by shooting of two rival gang members outside a funeral home. \n Security is heavy at federal court in downtown Chicago, with a walk-through metal detector and bomb-sniffing dog at the courtroom entrance. The judge ordered jurors' names be kept secret to ensure they aren't subject to intimidation. U.S. marshals have already said they're investigating reported threats against several likely witnesses. \n The 36-year-old Poe, alleged Hobos boss Gregory \"Bowlegs\" Chester and four other co-defendants have all pleaded not guilty. If convicted, they each face maximum life prison sentences. \n Prosecutors say the Hobos formed from several fractured gangs with home bases in Chicago public housing complexes that have since been demolished. \n Government filings cite one co-defendant, William Ford, as explaining in a secretly recorded conversation how the gang got its name from an early emphasis by its founders in 2003 on jewelry and other heists. \"After they kept robbin' \u2026 they like, 'Man, we Hobo,'\" Ford said, according to court filings. \"And Hobos, all they do is, is sleep and rob.\" \n But the Hobos apparent willingness to resort to violence meant those goals changed over a decade to the point where they became one of the city's dominant gangs. Another Hobos motto, which Poe has tattooed to his back, reflected that greater ambition \u2014 \"The Earth Is Our Turf.\" \n While narcotics promised huge profits, robbery remained an aspect of their criminal enterprise, prosecutors say. They allegedly held up then-NBA basketball player Bobby Simmons at gunpoint outside a nightclub in 2006, getting away with the athlete's $200,000 white gold necklace. Prosecutors say they also robbed other drug traffickers. \n The violence wasn't all one way. Court filings describe a gun battle between Hobos and rival Black Disciples during a summer picnic in 2007, when Chester was shot 18 times. The Hobos spent weeks retaliating, shooting one Black Disciple in face during a drive-by shooting and hitting another as he walked into a daycare center. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Openings set in major Chicago gang trial focused on killings"}
