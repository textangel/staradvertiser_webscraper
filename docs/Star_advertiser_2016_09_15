Braun is preparing to attempt to jump the Snake River Canyon in a steam-powered replica of Evel Knievel's rocket. \n TWIN FALLS, Idaho \u00bb Professional stuntman Eddie Braun successfully jumped over the Snake River Canyon this afternoon in an ode to his boyhood idol, Evel Knievel. \n Braun soared over the southern Idaho canyon in a custom-built rocket dubbed \"Evel Spirit.\" \n It launched off a steep ramp on the edge of the canyon rim just before 4 p.m. as hundreds of onlookers watched. \n The rocket reached an estimated 400 mph before its parachute deployed, allowing Braun and the ship to land safely in fields on the other side of the 1,400 foot-wide canyon. \n \"I feel like the no name third string quarterback of a junior varsity team that just won the Super Bowl. My team got me there. I ran it into the end zone. We scored and won,\" Braun said in a statement after the jump. \n Scott Truax, the designer of the rocket, told the Idaho Statesman that after Braun got the OK to launch he didn't hesitate. \n \"He was gone in a cloud of steam and I couldn't see anything until just before he pulled his chutes,\" Traux said. \n Braun has said the rocket was identical to the model Knievel used for his failed canyon attempt on Sept. 8, 1974. Knievel landed at the bottom of the canyon when his parachute prematurely deployed partway across the canyon, but walked away with only minor injuries. The spot where Knievel jumped was 1,600 feet wide. \n Braun hoped his effort would prove that Knievel could have made it across the canyon if his parachute had deployed at the correct time. \n Before the jump, the 54-year-old Braun said he was optimistic he would make it across the canyon. \n \"I wouldn't be doing this if I thought it couldn't be done,\" he said. \n Still, he had prepared for the worst in the days before the stunt, asking his young son to one day walk his sisters down the aisle at their wedding if Braun died in his attempt. \n Months of testing was performed on the rocket designed by Scott Truax, whose father constructed the original \"X2 Skycycle\" for Knievel. \n Truax followed his father's blueprints down to the last bolt and deviated only by updating the parachute system. \n Braun had trouble finding corporate sponsors for the stunt, and said he spent about $1.5 million of his own money on the jump. \n He looked at the stunt as a way to pay homage to Knievel, who inspired him to become a stuntman. \n \"I like to say I'm not doing something that Evel Knievel couldn't do,\" he told the Statesman before making the jump. \"I'm simply finishing out his dream. How many people get to finish the dream of their hero?\" \n Not all in the southern Idaho town of Twin Falls have such fond memories of Knievel. Many residents remember Knievel's promise of a weeklong festival complete with celebrities and a golf tournament. \n Knievel's attempt drew plenty of spectators, and the resultant partying, fighting and mischief upset locals. The daredevil was later accused of leaving town without paying debts to area businesses. \n But the mystique of Knievel's failed stunt has lived on, with would-be daredevils showing up every decade or so to propose similar jumps. Knievel's son Robbie visited Twin Falls in the 1990s and in 2010 to float the idea of a possible jump, though it never came to fruition. \n Braun appears to have been the first to actually try the stunt since Knievel's attempt. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Daredevil successfully powers rocket over Snake River Canyon"}

Takeshi Onaga's revocation of a reclamation permit for a U.S. military base on the southern island was illegal, supporting the central government plan to go ahead with the reclamation despite protests by local residents. \n The decision is the latest development in a legal battle between Okinawa and Tokyo over the relocation plan that has stalled for 20 years. \n Okinawa said it will appeal the Fukuoka High Court ruling to the Supreme Court. \n Onaga revoked approval for the permit last October. The reclamation is needed so the U.S. can relocate Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to a less populated area on the island. The work involves filling in part of a bay to create off-coast runways for the air station, which is now in a crowded neighborhood. \n The relocation is based on a 1996 bilateral agreement to reduce the burden of the U.S. military presence on Okinawa. \n Opponents say relocation doesn't really reduce their burden, and want the base moved off Okinawa entirely, but a prospect for a compromise is still unclear. \n Okinawa, under the Japan-U.S. security treaty, hosts half of 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan.

A House intelligence committee report on NSA leaker Edward Snowden says he's not a whistleblower and that the vast majority of the documents he stole were military and defense secrets that had nothing to do with Americans' privacy. \n WASHINGTON >> A House intelligence committee report is calling National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden a \"serial exaggerator and fabricator\" who doesn't fit the profile of a whistleblower. \n Snowden's attorney denounced the committee's report and called him a \"genuine American hero.\" \n Separately, all members of the committee sent a bipartisan letter to President Barack Obama on Thursday urging him not to pardon Snowden. \n Snowden's revelations about the agency's bulk collection of millions of Americans' phone records set off a fierce debate that pit civil libertarians concerned about privacy against more hawkish lawmakers fearful about losing tools to combat terrorism. Democrats and libertarian-leaning Republicans pushed through a reauthorization of the USA Patriot Act last year that ended the program. \n \"Mr. Snowden's claim that he stole this information and disclosed it to protect Americans, privacy and civil liberties is undercut by his actions,\" the letter said. \"Rather than avail himself of the many lawful avenues to express legal, moral, or ethical qualms with U.S. intelligence activities, Mr. Snowden stole 1.5 million classified documents from National Security Agency networks.\" \n The Republican-led committee released a three-page unclassified summary of its two-year bipartisan examination of how Snowden was able to remove the documents from secure NSA networks, what the documents contained and the damage their removal caused to U.S. national security. \n Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the probe revealed that the vast majority of what Snowden took had nothing to do with American privacy. \n \"The majority of what he took has to do with military secrets and defense secrets,\" Schiff said in an interview Thursday for C-SPAN's \"Newsmakers.\" \"I think that's very much at odds with the narrative that he wants to tell that he is a whistleblower.\" \n Snowden was an NSA contract employee when he took the documents and leaked them to journalists who revealed massive domestic surveillance programs begun in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The programs collected the telephone metadata records of millions of Americans and examined emails from overseas. \n Snowden fled to Hong Kong, then Russia, to avoid prosecution and now wants a presidential pardon because he says he helped his country by revealing secret domestic surveillance programs. \n The Obama administration has urged Snowden to return to the U.S. and face trial. Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi has said \"there is no question his actions have inflicted serious harms on our national security.\" \n Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the House intelligence committee, said Snowden betrayed his colleagues and his country. \n \"He put our service members and the American people at risk after perceived slights by his superiors,\" Nunes said in a statement. \"In light of his long list of exaggerations and outright fabrications detailed in this report, no one should take him at his word. I look forward to his eventual return to the United States, where he will face justice for his damaging crimes.\" \n Snowden insists he has not shared the full cache of 1.5 million classified documents with anyone. However, the report notes that in June, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament's defense and security committee publicly conceded that \"Snowden did share intelligence\" with his government. \n Ben Wizner, Snowden's attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the committee' report was an attempt to discredit a \"genuine American hero.\" \n \"After years of investigation, the committee still can't point to any remotely credible evidence that Snowden's disclosures caused harm,\" Wizner said. \"In a more candid moment, the NSA's former deputy director, who was directly involved in the government's investigation, explicitly said he didn't believe Snowden had cooperated with either China or Russia.\" \n The committee, on the other hand, called Snowden a \"disgruntled employee who had frequent conflicts with his managers.\" \n According to the committee, Snowden began mass downloads of classified material two weeks after he was reprimanded for engaging in a spat with NSA managers. The committee also described Snowden as a \"serial exaggerator and fabricator.\" \n \"A close review of Snowden's official employment records and submissions reveals a pattern of intentional lying,\" the report said. \"He claimed to have left Army basic training because of broken legs when in fact he washed out because of shin splints. He claimed to have obtained a high school degree equivalent when in fact he never did. \" \n The report said Snowden claimed to have worked for the CIA as a senior adviser, when he was a computer technician. \n \"He also doctored his performance evaluations and obtained new positions at NSA by exaggerating his resume and stealing the answers to an employment test,\" the report said. \n Speaking by video link from Moscow, Snowden said Wednesday that whistleblowing \"is democracy's safeguard of last resort, the one on which we rely when all other checks and balances have failed and the public has no idea what's going on behind closed doors.\" \n The 33-year-old addressed a New York City news conference where advocates from the ACLU, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International announced an online petition drive to urge Obama to pardon Snowden before he leaves office. \n The report was released one day ahead of Friday's opening of director Oliver Stone's film \"Snowden.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lawmakers say Snowden is no whistleblower"}

{"date": "September 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A deep sea shark and several eels are attracted to bait placed at the summit of the Cook seamount, seen from the Pisces V submersible during a dive to the previously unexplored seamount off the coast of Hawaii's Big Island. \n GEOLOGIST SEAMOUNTS, Hawaii >> The turquoise waters became darker and darker, and squiggly glow-in-dark marine creatures began to glide past in the inky depths like ghosts. \n The three-man submarine went down, down, down into the abyss and drew within sight of something no human had ever laid eyes on: Cook seamount, a 13,000-foot extinct volcano at the bottom of the sea. \n Scientists aboard the vessel Pisces V visited the volcano earlier this month to examine its geological features and its rich variety of marine life, and an Associated Press reporter was given exclusive access to the dive. It was the first-ever expedition to the Cook seamount by a manned submersible. \n Among other things, the researchers from the University of Hawaii and the nonprofit group Conservation International spotted such wonders as a rare type of octopus with big fins that look like Dumbo's ears, and a potentially new species of violet-hued coral they dubbed Purple Haze. \n Conservation International hopes to study 50 seamounts, or undersea volcanoes, over the next five years. \n \"We don't know anything about the ocean floor,\" said Peter Seligmann, chairman, CEO and co-founder of Conservation International. \"What we know is that each one of those seamounts is a refuge for new species, but we don't know what they are. We don't know how they've evolved. We don't know what lessons they have for us.\" \n During the Sept. 6 dive, the submarine splashed into the water, and as it dove, the only sounds were radio communications from the surface, the hum of an air scrubber that removes carbon monoxide from the passenger chamber, and the voices of the crew. The thick, hot tropical air inside the steel sphere became cooler and drier as the submarine descended. \n \"We don't know what we're going to find,\" said Conservation International's Greg Stone, a marine biologist on board. \"There will always be the unexpected when you go into the deep ocean.\" \n Halfway to the volcano's summit, which is 3,000 feet below the surface of the Pacific, no sunlight penetrated. The only light that could be seen from the submarine's face-sized windows was the bluish glow of the vessel's own bright lights. Occasionally, bioluminescent creatures drifted past in the darkness. \n Stone and subpilot Terry Kerby, who helps run the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory at the University of Hawaii, watched as the volcano and its rugged basalt walls hundreds of yards high came into view. \n Seamounts are either active or dormant volcanoes that rise dramatically from the bottom of the ocean and never reach the surface. They are hotspots for marine life because they carry nutrient-rich water upward from the sea floor. Seamounts are believed to cover about 18 million square miles of the planet. \n Cook, situated over 100 miles southwest of Hawaii's Big Island, is part of a group of undersea volcanoes known as the Geologist Seamounts that are about 80 million years old and could hold many new animal species, as well as elements such as nickel and cobalt that mining companies could extract. \n \"My goal today is to \u2026 find out what's living on them, find out how they support ocean life, what their effect is from ocean currents and essentially what drives the ocean, what makes the ocean what it is,\" Stone said. \"Seamounts are a key part of that, and something which humanity knows very little about.\" \n Within minutes of the vessel's arrival at the summit, life began to appear \u2014 a starfish clinging to a rock, joined shortly after by eels, sharks, chimaera (also known as \"ghost sharks\"), shrimp, crabs and two rare Dumbo octopuses. One of the octopuses changed color from white to pink to reddish brown as it swam by. \n Several types of deep-sea corals were found along the seamount's cliffs, including a vibrant purple one. \n \"I need to go home, look through the literature \u2026 and also go and run some genetic analyses,\" said Sonia Rowley, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Hawaii who is taking part in the project. \"But as this is a new seamount \u2026 that no one had dived on before, it won't be any surprise to me whether this is going to be a new species.\" \n Two other seamounts were studied over three days of expeditions: McCall, home to a large number of small deep-sea sharks, and Lo'ihi, an active volcano. \n Lo'Ihi has been extensively surveyed by manned submersibles over the past 30 years. The past few times Kerby was there, he saw a large Pacific sleeper shark lurking about the volcano's crater. \n As hot vents shot out volcanic gases around them, the team released bait in the water and the 7-foot shark appeared in front of the submarine. Kerby was delighted to see his \"old friend.\" \n The team also saw 6-foot eels and a number of new geological formations around the crater. Scientists say Lo'ihi is likely to someday become the newest island in the Hawaii chain as volcanic activity pushes the summit upward. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Deep-sea volcano a hotspot for mysterious life"}

{"date": "September 15, 2016", "text": "KANSAS CITY STAR / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n Stem cell transplant recipient Artesha Singleton was in good spirits on Sept. 9, at the University of Kansas Hospital. The 27-year-old Kansas City resident is fighting leukemia. With her was her aunt, Regina Roberson. \n KANSAS CITY STAR / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n Cancer survivor Rebecca Hertzog Burns, left, of Fayetteville, Ark., gets a hug from one of her former nurses, Joyce Atchley, during a checkup visit at the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Care Pavilion in Westwood, Kan. \n KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u00bb Last Friday was Rebecca Hertzog Burns' birthday. She turned 2. She says that's her age, though she's really 27. After a relapse in her fight with acute myelogenous leukemia, Burns received a stem cell transplant on Sept. 9, 2014, through an infusion of umbilical cord blood from a baby boy.  \n By her way of thinking, she and her immune system were reborn that day. \"My new birthday,\" says Burns, who has been in remission since. \n The treatment she received at the University of Kansas Hospital falls within a broad spectrum of care called immunotherapy. It is the hot topic, the \"it\" word, in addressing cancer. While doctors report success combating several types of cancer through different versions of immunotherapy, KU clinicians say some of the most remarkable stories arise in the treatment of blood cancers. \n Deadly forms of leukemia and lymphoma, which commonly strike young adults such as Burns, are now managed, and in many cases vanquished, using treatments unavailable just a few years ago. \n \"In 26 years of practice, this is absolutely the most optimistic I've ever been,\" said Joseph McGuirk, medical director of KU's blood and marrow transplant program. Patients from around the world travel here to take part in experimental trials. \n \"It's not hyperbole at all to say we're in the middle of a revolution in cancer therapy,\" he added. \n The idea behind immunotherapy is to coax a patient's own body to attack cancer cells. The way of doing that \u2014 in short, by harnessing the immune system to do the work that cancers don't let it do \u2014 differs from patient to patient, from cancer to cancer. \n For former President Jimmy Carter, suffering from an advanced melanoma that many thought would kill him, the key may have been a \"checkpoint inhibitor\" drug with the brand name Keytruda. \n Carter last year stunned the globe when he announced that his immunotherapy treatment, combined with radiation and surgery, eradicated tumors that had developed in his brain and liver. \n Immunotherapy isn't new, but it's getting a lot of attention now for a reason, said McGuirk, a soft-spoken physician reluctant to trumpet medical breakthroughs before they've been proven to work. \n \"We've reached this critical mass where, kaboom, all of sudden (immunotherapy) has taken off like a rocket,\" he said. \n National news media are jumping aboard, largely because of Carter's success. The U.S. government and drug companies pour billions of dollars into research, and clinical trials underway at KU and hundreds of other facilities have produced strong data. \n By itself or in combination with other treatments, immunotherapy is being credited for putting some terminal cancer patients \u2014 but far from all \u2014 in remissions that can last for years. \n Some of the drugs being developed block a mechanism, the immune checkpoint, that cancer exploits to keep the immune system at bay. Other treatments remove from patients millions of disease-fighting cells, reconfigure them in a lab and infuse them back into their sick owners. \n The hope is for these so-called T-cells to do the job they're meant to do. \n KU clinicians credit immunotherapy as one of the treatment paths that has allowed more blood-cancer patients to enjoy extensive remissions than ever seen before. The final blow to their disease is often an allogeneic stem cell transplant, which can rebuild the immune system from scratch. \n Still, many patients don't respond to these treatments. \n For them, conventional steps such as chemotherapy and radiation remain potential lifesavers. But in those treatments' quest to attack all cells they can get, and not only cancer cells, their side effects usually are much harsher than immunotherapy's. \n Others warn that too much hype around immunotherapy could steal attention and funding from those more traditional strategies and other promising treatments. \n \"Through the history of oncology, there are periods in which something gets really hot and everyone gets excited that it's the answer,\" said Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. \n \"The immunotherapy treatments being developed are here to stay. But I worry about research and money shifting away from other approaches.\" \n The Kansas City Star chose to look at immunotherapy \u2014 and tell a story of hope \u2014 through the lives that converge on the third floor of the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Care Pavilion in Westwood.  \n It's where McGuirk works with blood-cancer outpatients. Many of them, running out of options, have joined clinical trials that made them immunotherapy test cases. \n None of the patients in this story is out of the woods. But at least their bodies are fighting. \n \u2014\u2014  \n In the spring, a dying Artesha Singleton of Kansas City traveled to a St. Louis hospital to see if she might qualify for an experimental trial. \n No, you're too sick, a physician told the leukemia patient. Return to Kansas City and find a hospice program. You've got a few months. \n She's only 27. That she relies on Missouri Medicaid for coverage doesn't help. \n \"I think the way they treated her was pretty monstrous,\" said Haylie Colby, a social worker at KU's Westwood clinic. \n Singleton was diagnosed at Truman Medical Center just last summer. She has a 2-year-old son. When she returned from St. Louis, she spent three days crying in her bedroom. \n All of the approved therapies for Singleton were exhausted. Rounds of chemotherapy had no effect. \"What do we do next?\" asked Shaun De-Jarnette, the quality management coordinator at KU's blood and marrow transplant unit, or BMT. \n The team overseeing Singleton's case knew that the drug manufacturer Pfizer was testing a product not yet on the market: inotuzumab ozogamicin. Though not an immunotherapy drug, it might reverse Singleton's deathly slide enough for her later to benefit from a stem cell transplant. \n \"We were desperate and asked Pfizer to give it to us,\" said physician Leyla Shune. \"For free.\" \n Under a provision that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls \"compassionate use,\" Pfizer agreed. \n Inotuzumab ozogamicin saved her. And with her cancer in remission, Singleton became a candidate for a transplant that would turn her immune system into that of a newborn baby's. (As of Sept. 9, her immune system was just a week old.) \n Resting in her hospital bed before the procedure, which took less than an hour, Singleton said, \"I feel wonderful.\" \n Her aunt Regina Roberson was at her side. \"It's been a bumpy, bumpy ride,\" Roberson said. \"But the treatment we found here is working. She's living proof.\" \n In June, the New England Journal of Medicine reported encouraging findings on Pfizer's investigative drug. The treatment led to \"complete remission\" in 80 percent of trial patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. \n Chemotherapy alone produced that result in only about 30 percent of patients. \n KU's McGuirk said similar success is being found in an immunotherapy drug called Blincyto, which put patient Emily Fox's leukemia in remission. \n Fox, who has worked with cancer patients as a nurse, was diagnosed in February with cancer of her own. At the BMT unit, \"from the first day they were telling me, 'We're going to get rid of that cancer,' \" said Fox, 28. \"I believed them.\" \n But McGuirk cautions against overconfidence. False hope helps nobody dealing with cancer, whether it's a patient or members of the clinical team who still see too many lives lost. \n \"Immunotherapy is hit or miss,\" McGuirk said. \"We've got a long, long way to go.\" \n And it's expensive. Patients whose insurance requires that they pay 20 to 25 percent out of pocket could spend $25,000 or more for a year of treatment on drugs such as Opdivo, approved for both melanoma and lung cancer. \n Leonard Saltz of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York last year told a meeting of oncologists: \"As someone who worries about making cancer care available to everyone and minimizing disparities, I have a major problem with this. These drugs cost too much.\"  \n \u2014\u2014  \n \"There are so many kinds of immunotherapy,\" said Mitch Schwarz, 24, of Blue Springs. \"I've done two.\" \n The first didn't work. Relapsing in 2014 in his bout with blood cancer, Schwarz for a month wore a backpack that contained immunotherapy medicine. The solution traveled through a tube to his chest. \n But the treatment wasn't achieving the desired result. Schwarz's immune system wasn't recognizing the cancer cells as a threat to be devoured. When the treatments succeed, it's \"like Pac-Man,\" said McGuirk. \n KU doctors ultimately directed Schwarz to a clinical trial in Seattle, where he underwent a brand of treatment called CAR T-cell therapy. \"It was either this or certain death for me,\" he said. \n Unlike chemotherapy and radiation, which kill cells both good and bad, Schwarz's treatment in Seattle was customized to get his body to target just the bad cells. \n His blood was drawn and disease-fighting T-cells were taken to a lab for \"gene editing.\" The re-engineered cells were returned to his body and, if the therapy worked, they would attach to malignant cells and start punching. \n The treatment has put Schwarz's cancer in remission and, like the others, he became ready for a stem cell transplant. \n \"I'm 115 days out of that transplant, so my immune system is that many days old,\" he said last week at the Westwood clinic. He visits weekly to have blood work done. \n The results so far look encouraging, his doctors said. \n \"It's exciting,\" Schwarz said. \"My cells are working. I hope they fight like hell.\" \n \u2014\u2014  \n A former Kansas City area resident now living in Fayetteville, Ark., Burns returned to the KU Cancer Center in late August for her two-year checkup. \n Everything looked good. \n For lunch that day, Burns spoke to a group of three dozen hospital directors and benefactors about the leukemia that developed when she was 20. \n She thought she had it licked once but relapsed in 2014, right after boyfriend Tanner Burns told her father about plans to marry her. \n She told her boyfriend he couldn't propose until she was well. Her voice trembled recalling that story. \"It really broke my heart,\" she said. \n Introducing Rebecca Burns to the group, McGuirk called her story \"absolutely miraculous.\" \n Slides of her recovery after her transplant showed her clowning with the BMT staff. \"Some of these nurses are my closest friends,\" she said. \n She continues to post her progress in a journal on the website Caring-Bridge.org, where sick persons can keep their loved ones updated. \n In a recent entry she noted: \"Pray for my overall health and wellness \u2026 This battle is far from over!\" \n She's only 2, after all. \n As for her and Tanner, they married in July. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 The Kansas City Star (Kansas City, Mo.)  \n ", "author": "By Rick Montgomery The Kansas City Star", "title": "Immunotherapy a hot topic in treating cancers"}

While speaking with reporters, Kaye appeared to blast Samsung for not coordinating with his agency. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> U.S. safety regulators announced a formal recall of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 smartphone Thursday after a spate of fires led to injuries and property damage \u2014 along with a global marketing headache for the South Korean tech giant. \n \"Because this product presents such a serious fire hazard, I am urging all consumers \u2026 to take advantage of this recall right away,\" said Elliot Kaye, chairman of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. \n Samsung had already initiated a voluntary recall, but the company has been criticized for not offering clear information about the problem or how it would be resolved. While speaking with reporters, Kaye appeared to blast Samsung for not coordinating with his agency. \n \"As a general matter it's not a recipe for a successful recall for a company to go out on its own,\" he said, adding that anyone who believes a unilateral effort would be sufficient \"needs to have more than their phone checked.\" \n Samsung has said the problem involves about 2.5 million smartphones worldwide; authorities say that includes about 1 million in the United States. While the company was previously offering to replace the phones, it will now offer consumers the choice of a replacement or a full refund. \n The recall comes as Samsung is locked in a fierce battle with Apple for the attentions of high-end smartphone buyers. Apple just introduced the latest versions of its iPhone, which go on sale Friday. \n Samsung had beaten Apple to market with the Note 7 by several weeks. It was drawing favorable reviews for the phone, which started at $850 in the U.S., before consumers began reporting problems with the battery overheating, sometimes causing fires or explosions. \n One family in St. Petersburg, Florida, said a Galaxy Note 7 left charging in their Jeep had caught fire, destroying the vehicle. \n Samsung has received 92 reports of the batteries overheating in the U.S., including 26 reports of burns and 55 of property damage, according to the U.S. commission's website. It said property damage included fires in cars and a garage. \n Meanwhile, U.S. aviation safety officials have taken the unusual step of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge the phone during flights, and not to put them in checked bags. \n A top Samsung executive in the United States on Thursday apologized to customers and pledged to expedite the recall. \n \"We did not meet the standard of excellence that you expect and deserve,\" said Tim Baxter, president of Samsung Electronics America, in a video released by the company. \n Critics say Samsung didn't follow commission rules that call for companies to coordinate the handling of recalls with the commission, including the use of joint public announcements, although Baxter said Thursday that his company notified the commission before it announced it would stop selling the Note 7 on Sept. 2. \n Samsung announced then that it would replace any Note 7 phones it had sold, with replacements available within a week. But its press releases didn't tell consumers to stop using the device. \n A week later, the company and the commission issued separate statements that urged consumers to stop using the Note 7. At that point, Samsung said it would offer replacement Note 7 devices once the commission had approved them. \n Samsung's statements left many customers confused, said Tuong Nguyen, a tech industry analyst with Gartner, \"and that might have an impact on overall consumer confidence, especially since we're talking about a high-end device, their flagship phone.\" \n People who bought the phone did so to get the best possible quality and service, he said, adding that the handling of the recall \"kind of seems like a strike on both counts.\" \n Some purchasers of the Note 7 say they're willing to try another Samsung device. \n \"I think I would,\" said Robert Lerner, a 64-year-old financial consultant who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. \"But I'm not going to go get it the first week,\" he added, because he wants to make sure there aren't more problems with the Note 7 replacements. \n Brooklyn office worker Joe Franco said he was frustrated, especially after getting conflicting information from his cellphone carrier, Sprint, about how to get a replacement. \n \"I love the phone.

{"date": "September 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at luncheon for the Economic Club of New York in New York today. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Donald Trump's campaign spokesman says the Republican presidential candidate now believes President Barack Obama was born in the United States, despite the candidate's repeated refusal to say so himself. \n In a statement released late tonight, campaign spokesman Jason Miller claims Trump \"did a great service to the country\" by bringing closure to an \"ugly incident\" that Trump, in fact, fueled. \n \"In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate,\" Miller said. \n \"Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure\" to the issue, he added. \"Inarguably, Donald J. Trump is a closer. Having successfully obtained President Obama's birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States.\" \n Trump was, for many years, the most prominent proponent of the \"birther\" movement, which claimed Obama was born outside the U.S. and thus ineligible to be president \u2014 despite the fact that he was born in Hawaii. Trump's comments were seen by many as an attempt to delegitimize the nation's first black president and have turned off many of the African American voters he is now courting in his bid for the White House. \n The statement came after an interview published by The Washington Post in which Trump again declined to say whether he believed Obama was born on U.S. soil. \n \"I'll answer that question at the right time,\" Trump told the paper. \"I just don't want to answer it yet.\" \n Asked by the paper whether his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, was accurate when she said in a recent television interview that her boss now believes the president was born in the U.S., Trump responded: \"It's okay. She's allowed to speak what she thinks. I want to focus on jobs. I want to focus on other things.\" \n Clinton seized on Trump's refusal during a speech Thursday night before the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. \n \"He was asked one more time where was President Obama born and he still wouldn't say Hawaii. He still wouldn't say America,\" Clinton said. \"This man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?\" \n While Miller's statement suggests that Trump has believed the president was born in the U.S. since seeing his birth certificate, the candidate has repeatedly stoked the issue in the years since. \n In August 2012 \u2014 more than a year after the president released the document in April 2011 \u2014 Trump was pushing the issue on Twitter. \n \"An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud,\" he wrote. \n Trump has said repeatedly during the campaign that he no longer talks about the \"birther\" issue, but has refused to retract his previous comments, despite numerous opportunities. Instead, he has described the issue as an inconvenience. \n \"I don't talk about it because if I talk about that, your whole thing will be about that,\" he told reporters in his plane last week. \"So I don't talk about it.\" \n The statement from Trump's spokesman also makes the unsubstantiated claim that Clinton launched the birther movement during her unsuccessful primary run against Obama in 2008. \n \"Hillary Clinton's campaign first raised this issue to smear then-candidate Barack Obama in her very nasty, failed 2008 campaign for President,\" the statement claims. \"This type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the Clinton Playbook. As usual, however, Hillary Clinton was too weak to get an answer.\" \n Clinton has long denied the claim. \n On Twitter, her spokesman Brian Fallon did not address that allegation, but said Trump's acceptance that Obama was born in the U.S. needed to come from the candidate himself. \n \"Trump needs to say it himself. On camera. And admit he was wrong for trying to delegitimize the country's first African American President,\" Fallon wrote. \n Indeed, Trump himself has said that his aides shouldn't be trusted to speak on his behalf. \n \"Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign,\" he tweeted in May. \"The only quote that matters is a quote from me!\" \n Obama had released a standard short form of his birth certificate before the 2008 presidential election. Anyone who wants a copy of the more detailed, long-form document must submit a waiver request, and have that request approved by Hawaii's health department. \n In 2011, amid persistent questions from Trump about his birthplace, Obama submitted a waiver request. He dispatched his personal lawyer to Hawaii to pick up copies and carry the documents back to Washington on a plane. \n The form said Obama was born at 7:24 p.m. on Aug. 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu. It is signed by the delivery doctor, Obama's mother and the local registrar. \n On the day he released the document, Obama jabbed at Trump. \"We're not going to be able to solve our problems if we get distracted by sideshows and carnival barkers,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Spokesman: Trump now believes President Obama was born in U.S."}

Rapinoe did not start the game against Thailand at Mapfre stadium. She knelt from a spot near the bench while the fellow reserves around her stood. \n COLUMBUS, Ohio \u00bb Megan Rapinoe knelt during the national anthem before a U.S. women's national team match against Thailand tonight. \n Rapinoe first knelt during the anthem Sept. 4 before a game with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Seattle Reign. She said she wanted to express solidarity with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who is not standing during the anthem to bring attention to racial inequality. \n After Thursday night's game, which the United States won 9-0, U.S. Soccer issued a statement to ESPN that said representing the country is a \"privilege and honor\" for any player or coach associated with the national teams. \n \"Therefore, our national anthem has particular significance for U.S. Soccer. In front of national and often global audiences, the playing of our national anthem is an opportunity for our Men's and Women's National Team players and coaches to reflect upon the liberties and freedom we all appreciate in this country. \n \"As part of the privilege to represent your country, we have an expectation that our players and coaches will stand and honor our flag while the national anthem is played.\" \n It was unclear whether Rapinoe would face any sanctions from the federation. \n \"I'm very proud to pull on this shirt and play for this country, and also represent my country in a different way in speaking out for people that are oppressed,\" she told the network, which broadcast the game. \n Rapinoe did not start the game at Mapfre stadium. She knelt from a spot near the bench while the fellow reserves around her stood for the anthem. \n The 31-year-old, who helped the U.S. win the World Cup last year and played in the Rio Olympics, came into the match at the start of the second half. \n At a game Sunday night in Seattle, the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, she stood and linked arms with her Reign teammates. \n Last week before a Reign match against the Washington Spirit in Maryland, the anthem was played before the teams took the field rather than \"subject our fans and friends to the disrespect we feel such an act would represent,\" said a Spirit statement that cited the personal beliefs of the team owner. \n There was speculation that Rapinoe might refrain from kneeling before Thursday night's game because she was playing for the United States and not her club team. It was also the final game for midfielder Heather O'Reilly, who was retiring after 15 years with the national team. \n Kaepernick's refusal to stand for the anthem first came to public notice when he remained seated on the bench before an NFL preseason game against Green Bay. Since then numerous players have joined the protest, taking a knee or raising a fist. \n \"Being a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties. It was something small that I could do and something that I plan to keep doing in the future and hopefully spark some meaningful conversation around it,\" Rapinoe told American Soccer Now about her motivation for the protest. \n Since coming out in 2012, Rapinoe has been devoted advocate for LGBT rights and has worked with the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) and other organizations. \n Rapinoe also has been vocal about pay equity, and was among five national team players who lent their names to a complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging wage discrimination. The players claim that members of the team make in some cases up to four times less than their male national team counterparts. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Rapinoe kneels during anthem before U.S. match vs. Thailand"}

If you had pocket change, boiling water and three minutes to spare, you could eat Japanese ramen \u2014 or at least an approximation of it \u2014 out of a handy foam cup.  \n But in the 45 years since Cup Noodles first appeared on supermarket shelves, Americans have become increasingly inclined to read nutritional labels even in the snack aisle. Now food companies are scrambling to catch up to changing tastes, introducing organic Gatorade and unsalted Kettle potato chips to appeal to health-conscious diners. \n On Thursday, Nissin Foods USA \u2014 the Gardena-based arm of the Japanese instant noodle giant Nissin Foods Group \u2014 said it, too, is changing with the times. For the first time, Cup Noodles is getting a recipe overhaul. All eight flavors \u2014 which contain fried noodles, seasoning and dried ingredients such as vegetables \u2014 have been retooled by reducing sodium and stripping out MSG and artificial flavors. The new versions will be available only in the U.S. \n A first-ever national advertising campaign will launch in coming months to introduce the changes to Cup Noodles, which helped the company rack up $3.6 billion in global sales in its 2015 fiscal year. \n Before the change, Cup Noodles' most popular flavor, chicken, contained 1,430 mg of sodium \u2014 about 60 percent of the daily recommended intake. The new version, which has started hitting store shelves, contains 1,070 mg of sodium \u2014 about 45 percent of the daily recommended intake. Hydrolized vegetable protein has replaced artificial MSG. Green cabbage juice was added to boost the taste. \n Al Multari, chief executive of Nissin Foods USA, said the recipe changes were in direct response to feedback from customers, who wanted the same taste but with an improved nutritional profile. \n \"They were saying, 'We love your product, but we'd really like to see these changes made,'\" Multari said. \n The Cup Noodles tweaks come as long-standing food brands are racing to keep up with a rapidly evolving American palate that's starting to favor grab-and-go salads over burgers and fries. \n Fast food chains such as McDonald's, which have been struggling, are touting changes intended to appeal to a new generation of diners, such as cage-free Egg McMuffins. Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and candy-maker Nestle USA have said they are axing artificial ingredients. Kraft has rolled out a less lurid version of its classic macaroni and cheese without synthetic colors. \n Other noodle makers have already made similar tweaks. Toyo Suisan Kaisha, which makes a popular brand called Maruchan and racked up $3.2 billion of global sales in the 2015 fiscal year, has rolled out products that contain 35 percent less sodium. Its Instant Lunch chicken flavor, which comes in a cup, clocks in at 660 mg, or about 28 percent of daily intake. Nongshim's Shin brand also offers noodles without added MSG. \n Multari, who last year became the first non-Japanese or Japanese-American head of the company, said Nissin hoped such changes will help boost Cup Noodles sales, which have been flat in recent years (there was a slight uptick during the Great Recession, and then sales fell and eventually plateaued as the economy improved, he said). \n That same sluggish performance can be seen in the overall industry. U.S. sales of instant noodles were $1.06 billion last year, up just 4.1 percent from $1.02 billion in 2010, according to research firm Euromonitor. \n Americans rank fifth worldwide in demand, out-slurped only by China, Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam, according to the World Instant Noodles Association. However, U.S. consumption has fallen slightly. Last year, Americans chowed down on 4.2 billion servings of instant noodles, down from 4.4 billion in 2013, the association said. \n The slowdown for instant noodles comes as ramen is enjoying a moment in the U.S. After chef and restaurateur David Chang opened Momofuku Noodle Bar in New York, more ramen restaurants have popped up around the country. In Los Angeles, well-known ramen shop Tsujita is opening an outpost in the Americana at Brand; in downtown L.A., several are opening up including Tokyo Strike and Ramen Hood. \n \"This is a growing category,\" said Jim Prevor, a food analyst at the Perishable Pundit. \"Everyone is looking at it and trying to hook onto it.\" \n That's in part due to Asian transplants, who are the fastest-growing immigrant group in the U.S., Prevor said. Many dishes once foreign to Americans, such as sushi and pizza, have now become commonplace foods. \n At Nissin, executives say they hope the new recipes will expand the demographic of Cup Noodles buyers, who fall heavily into two camps: millennials, such as college students, and lower-income folks who rely on Cup Noodle's affordability. The price \u2014 45 cents or less per cup \u2014 is also staying the same despite the added cost of the new ingredients, they said. \n \"We have a lot of light and medium users that are kind of managing how much they eat because they know it is high in sodium,\" said Leslie Mohr, vice president of marketing. By addressing those concerns, she said, the company believes those customers will be encouraged to buy Cup Noodles more frequently, and even lure \"lapsed users\" to try it again. \n Cup Noodles is Nissin's second bestselling brand in the U.S. Top Ramen, the No. 1 brand, isn't packaged as a single serving and doesn't come with its own cup. \n In 1958, Nissin founder Momofuku Ando introduced Japan to instant ramen, a concoction he invented in a backyard shed. But the idea of selling noodles in their own cup \u2014 Nissin's claim to fame \u2014 was inspired Ando's 1966 trip to America. There he witnessed office workers divvy up a package of ramen, place the pieces into paper cups and add hot water, according to company lore. \n The new recipes were developed in the sprawling facility, which opened in 1970, about 13 miles southwest of Los Angeles. It spans 17 acres with office space, a warehouse and a factory that churns out \"hundreds of millions\" of Cup Noodles a year, Multari said. A second manufacturing plant is located in Lancaster, Pa. The company employs about 400 workers nationwide. \n Inside the test kitchen, about 10 employees equipped with four microwaves and three fridges have been working for a year to recraft the Cup Noodles recipe. \n Monique Au-Yeung, a senior research and development specialist, acknowledged the process was sometimes frustrating. It took 13 tries, for instance, just to revamp the chicken variety alone. \"It's a balance of all materials for the flavor,\" she said. The trickiness often came \"towards the end, where you have to fine-tune the flavors.\" \n Rachel Scherr, an assistant research scientist at the University of California, Davis' department of nutrition, said any nutritional improvement was a step in the right direction. But Cup Noodles still contains a high level of sodium, she said, and the sodium replacement, potassium chloride, is not necessarily healthier than salt, she said. \n \"I would say it's a sometime food, not an everyday food,\" she said. \n Some analysts questioned whether Nissin could really makeover Cup Noodles' reputation.  \n \"It's very hard to change people's perceptions of brands,\" food analyst Prevor said. \"It usually fails, and it fails because to the extent you attract new people, you get push back too from people\" used to the old version. \n Prevor said that recipe changes are touted by companies as revolutionary, but often \"smells of marketing more than it does of a brilliant new product.\" \n \"I'm surprised they changed the formulation of their current product as opposed to coming out with another line that is higher-priced and healthier,\" he said. \n Considering the new ingredients cost more (a \"significant\" increase according to Multari), Nissin may very well raise prices after the new Cup Noodles is firmly launched into the market, Prevor said. \n Multari said the Cup Noodles overhaul is just the first step. He said the company will quiz customers on other Nissin products, which could be tweaked as well.  \n \"It's a challenge for all brands to always remain relevant,\" he said. \"That's what we're trying to do.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times  \n ", "author": "By Shan Li Los Angeles Times", "title": "Diners today want healthier foods; even Cup Noodles is trying to please them"}

Trump, who helped fuel the rise of the so-called \"birther movement,\" told The Washington Post in an interview that he would \"answer that question at the right time. I just don't want to answer it yet.\" \n \"He was asked one more time where was President Obama born and he still wouldn't say Hawaii. He still wouldn't say America,\" Clinton said. \"This man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?\" \n The Trump campaign released a statement late today saying Trump \"believes that President Obama was born in the United States.\" It also made an unsubstantiated accusation that Clinton launched the birther movement during her unsuccessful primary run against Obama in 2008. \n Obama and Clinton made successive appeals to 3,000 Hispanic leaders and supporters, pointing to a large turnout of Latino voters as the antidote to Trump. Both noted the Republican's hard-line position on immigration, referencing his opposition to a comprehensive overhaul of the system and his vows to build a wall along the Mexican border. \n Obama said the political season's discussion of immigration \"has cut deeper than in years past. It's a little more personal, a little meaner, a little uglier.\" He said Latinos need to \"decide who the real America is\" and push back against the notion that the nation \"only includes a few of us.\" \n \"We can't let that brand of politics win. And if we band together and organize our communities, if we deliver enough votes, then the better angels of our nature will carry the day,\" Obama said. \n Clinton vowed again to complete Obama's unsuccessful push to achieve comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally. She reiterated her intention to release a plan to overhaul the immigration system during her first 100 days in office and expand programs that have protected some groups of immigrants from deportation, including those who arrived in the U.S. as children and the parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. \n Pointing to the benefits of a diverse nation, Clinton seized upon Trump's unwillingness to say Obama was born in the United States and his past support for the \"birther\" movement questioning Obama's citizenship. \n \"We need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric,\" Clinton said. \"We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a message that even he can hear.\" \n While the president and his potential successor did not appear onstage together, they did chat for about 15 minutes backstage. The event represented a passing of the torch before a key Democratic constituency. \n Obama captured 71 percent of Latino voters against Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, a lopsided outcome that Clinton hopes to replicate with about eight weeks remaining before Election Day. Facing tightening polls against Trump, Clinton's ability to garner big margins from Hispanics could be critical in battleground states such as Florida, Nevada and Colorado. \n The president made no mention of Trump by name but alluded to his candidacy, saying if the nation is going to fix the immigration system, \"then we're going to have to push back against bluster and falsehoods and promises of higher walls. We need a comprehensive solution.\" \n Obama's attempt to shield parents from deportation is in limbo after the Supreme Court deadlocked on a decision in a case challenging the president's authority to expand the deportation protection program. \n The president is ramping up his campaign activities on behalf of Clinton. Obama headlined his first solo event for his former secretary of state earlier this week in Philadelphia, and will appear alongside her at a dinner for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton rips Trump on 'birtherism' before Hispanic group"}

New York City police say a man attacked a police officer with a meat cleaver in midtown Manhattan and was shot at least twice during a struggle with officers trying to subdue him. \n NEW YORK \u00bb Police chased a man wielding a meat cleaver through midtown Manhattan today, then shot him on a crowded street after he hacked the face of an off-duty police detective who tried to tackle him, authorities said.  \n The man with the knife was shot at least twice and was hospitalized in critical but stable condition, police said. The detective, who had been heading home in street clothes when he intervened in the chase, was being treated at the hospital for a six-inch gash from his temple to his jaw. \n \"I want to commend them on their bravery,\" Police Commissioner William Bratton said of the officers involved. \n Police fired 18 shots at the man, but Bratton, who is retiring Friday, said he believed officers acted appropriately. \n \"We have a character running down the street, waving a cleaver,\" he said. \n The chase began on Broadway and ended about a block from Macy's department store and Madison Square Garden, just as rush hour was getting underway. \n The confrontation started, police said, when two uniformed officers encountered the man trying to remove an immobilizing boot from a parked vehicle. \n Police said the suspect, Akram Joudeh, 32, had a previous address in Queens but appeared to have been living in the car. \n After the officers approached, Joudeh pulled an 11-inch knife and ran, police said. A growing group of officers chased him, and at one point shot him with a Taser, with no apparent effect. \n A bystander, Jonathan Schneier, said when he left work to get coffee he saw a balding man holding a cleaver, surrounded by a small group of officers yelling at him to drop the knife. \n \"I give credit to the police officers.

{"date": "September 15, 2016", "text": "U.S. NAVY VIA TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n Malaysian Chief of Defence Forces, Gen. Zulkifeli Mohd Zin, left, talks with Adm. Harry Harris Jr., commander of U.S. Pacific Command on April 21 above the Strait of Malacca. The two senior defense leaders conducted a familiarization flight on the P-8A Poseidon, the U.S. Navy's newest maritime patrol aircraft. \n SAN DIEGO \u00bb Is the Islamic State's next frontier in the Pacific and Asia?  \n The commander of American military forces across Asia, Adm. Harry Harris, said the jihadist group is seeking new territory as it gets squeezed out of Iraq and Syria. \n \"It's clear to me that (the Islamic State) is also 'rebalancing' to the Indo-Asia-Pacific,\" said Harris, speaking during a meeting of the San Diego Military Advisory Council today in Point Loma. \n Using a cancer analogy, the four-star leader of U.S. Pacific Command added: \"Through multinational cooperation, we can eradicate this (the Islamic State) disease before it metastasizes.\" \n But the U.S. alliance with the Philippines hit choppy waters recently after comments by President Rodrigo Duterte \u2014 something that Harris also addressed today with lightly veiled criticism of Duterte's statements. \n \"We have been allied with the Philippines for a long time. We have shed our blood with them. \u2026 We fought side by side during World War II. I consider our alliance with the Philippines to be iron-clad,\" Harris said. He also mentioned U.S. aid to the Philippines, budgeted at $120 million this year, and the dispatch of American troops to help after Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. \n \"So when the leader said, 'Only China supports us,' I don't know what he means,\" Harris said, answering a reporter's question toward the end of his presentation. \n Duterte started making headlines last week when, speaking in Tagalog, he called President Barack Obama a son of a whore. \n Since then the Filipino president has said his government would shop for weapons in China and Russia and would halt joint U.S.-Philippines patrols in the South China Sea to avoid appearing hostile to China. \n He also called for the departure of U.S. special-operations troops from the southern Philippines, saying their presence could complicate the fight against the Islamic State-linked terrorist group Abu Sayyaf. \n One analyst said it appears that nationalism and a desire for \"outsider\" status are driving the Filipino president's current tone. \n \"I don't really think this is as much about the U.S. as it is about domestic politics \u2014 and just his personality. We are a very useful whipping boy,\" said Thomas Sanderson, director of the transnational threats project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. \"I think this is largely about someone who is a rebel \u2026 he's an outsider and he's broken through into an area that outsiders typically didn't get to.\" \n Sanderson said the Philippines would do an about-face if Islamic terrorism becomes a more widespread problem for Filipinos.  \n \"(Duterte) comes right back to us, there's no doubt about it,\" he said. \"Because the center of gravity for counter-terrorism knowledge and skill is the United States.\" \n Harris outlined the signposts of the Islamic State advance on new turf in the Pacific Command theater, an area that's home to 700 million Muslims. That means more Muslims live in the Asia-Pacific region than in the Middle East.  \n \"Population numbers alone have forced (Pacific Command) to think ahead about what's next in the fight against (the Islamic State),\" Harris said. \"The vast majority of these people are peaceful citizens who seek to live lives free from the scourge of terrorism, but we know that a small band of fanatics can produce deadly results.\" \n He pointed to the Islamic State-inspired terrorism in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines so far in 2016. Those events include the July 2 attack on a Bangladeshi restaurant by Islamic State-aligned militants. In May and June, Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines released video showing the beheadings of two Canadians after their families didn't pay ransoms. \n Hundreds of jihadists have traveled from Asia to the main Islamic State battlegrounds of Iraq and Syria to join in the group's violent vision of creating an Islamic caliphate, according to published accounts. \n The tally is about 700 from Indonesia, 100 from Malaysia, 100 from the Philippines, 200 from the Maldives, 300 from China and 120 from Australia, according to a December report by the Soufan Group. These recruits make up a small portion of the estimated 30,000 to 40,000 fighters the Islamic State can claim or has been credited with over time. \n But as they tire of warfare, the danger is that they may return home and try to continue the fight \u2014 and recruit others. \n Sanderson said Indonesia has the highest vulnerability to the Islamic State despite its strong security forces, because of the number of its fighters already hailing from there and because of Indonesia being a string of islands with lots of places to hide. \n All of this comes as the United States is finishing its own \"rebalance,\" with the Navy shifting 60 percent of its fleet to the Pacific by 2020. That move, announced late in Obama's first term, was seen as a hedge against North Korean saber-rattling and the growing economic and military might of China. \n Academics differ on how big the Islamic State threat is becoming in the Pacific and Asia.  \n Eli Berman, a University of California, San Diego economics professor, said he thinks \"rebalancing\" is too strong a term for the jihadist group's foothold in Asia. The Islamic State isn't on the verge of controlling territory anywhere in the Pacific Rim, said Berman, who is a research director at the university's Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation. \n Asia expert Denny Roy at the East-West Center in Honolulu agrees with Harris that the basic ideas represented by the Islamic State won't die if the terror group is geographically erased. \n \"The purveyors of those ideas are already trying to transplant them into other regions and are finding some interest,\" Roy said. \n But several observers pointed out that Asia has major differences that may hinder the Islamic State if it tries to expand there. \n Governments there are generally more intact than in the Middle East. \n \"What's missing is the ultra-weak states in which locals are ready and chomping at the bit to sign up for something to do,\" said Sanderson at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"There are far fewer people who would want to sign up for a battle inside of Indonesia, as opposed to those who would want to sign up to battle inside Libya, Tunisia, Yemen or Syria \u2014 where the majority of young men would say, 'Give me a gun and let's go.' They have nothing to lose.\" \n Roy sees South Asia, which includes Bangladesh, as fertile ground for extremism. \n \"Southeast Asia is less so, because the sense of grievance and the (routine practice) of mass political violence are less strong than in the Middle East or South Asia,\" he said. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 The San Diego Union-Tribune  \n ", "author": "By Jeanette Steele The San Diego Union-Tribune", "title": "U.S. admiral: Islamic State coming to Pacific"}

{"date": "September 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton waves as she arrives at a rally at University of North Carolina, in Greensboro, N.C., today. Clinton returned to the campaign trail after a bout of pneumonia that sidelined her for three days and revived questions about both Donald Trump's and her openness regarding their health. \n GREENSBORO, N.C. \u00bb A seemingly humbled but healthier Hillary Clinton returned to the campaign trail with new urgency today and sought to reframe the presidential election on her terms, vowing to deliver results for American families. \n With just more than 50 days until Election Day and votes already being cast in many states, the most precious resource a candidate has is time. And Clinton, who has been sidelined with pneumonia since Sunday, returned to the campaign trail in North Carolina knowing she had some catching up to do. \n \"Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be,\" she told a modest crowd here after arriving on stage to James Brown's \"I Feel Good.\" \n But she cast her time off as an unexpected blessing, giving her time for reflection that allowed her to \"really reconnect with what this campaign is all about.\" \n Throughout her remarks, the former secretary of state returned to the themes of a successful Democratic convention and even to her own announcement speech more than a year ago, detailing the causes she has fought for throughout her career and issues driving her to seek the nation's highest office. \n \"I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career,\" she said, \"focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families.\" \n The choice of North Carolina for her return campaign appearance was intentional, campaign officials said, designed to send the message that they still believe they are on offense in a race that has tightened in recent days. President Barack Obama carried the state in 2008 but narrowly lost it to Mitt Romney in 2012. \n The campaign owns up to the challenge before it. But just as it argued that her post-convention high point was never quite as high as it seemed in polls, her camp views the turbulence of the last week as not quite as dire as those on the outside \u2014 even some vocal Democrats \u2014 might make it seem. \n And so in the coming weeks, Clinton said she intends to make an affirmative case about her vision, starting Monday with an address in Philadelphia focused on the challenges of the millennial generation, followed by an economic speech in Florida. \n Meanwhile, she encouraged supporters to \"tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that often doesn't have much to do with what the next president has to do.\" \n It's a message that has filtered throughout Clinton's sprawling campaign, which is gearing up for the start of a massive voter-turnout operation as early and absentee voting begins across the country. \n \"One of the challenges of this cycle has been at times trying to get back to what the campaign is really supposed to be about \u2014 a vision the candidate has for the future,\" campaign manager Robby Mook said in an interview Wednesday at the campaign's Brooklyn, N.Y., headquarters. \"So I think what you're going to see from us over the next few weeks is trying to showcase why she's running, what she wants to get done, the people she wants to help.\" \n Mook also predicted that Donald Trump is going to have to confront his liabilities in a more significant way, citing a Newsweek report about the \"troubling web of business connections\" he maintains. \n \"He's going to be backed into a corner, both disclosing more so that we can have a better picture, but also explaining how in the world is he actually going to govern in the midst of all that,\" Mook said. \n In her remarks here, Clinton acknowledged that over years in the public eye, she has \"built up some defenses\" to deal with the charges of her opponents. \n \"When it comes to public service, I'm better at the service part than the public part,\" she said. \n But she defended the initial decision not to disclose her illness until after she appeared to collapse as she left a 9/11 memorial service in New York. \n \"My senior staff knew and information was provided to a number of people,\" she said when asked whether her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, was informed. \"This was an ailment that many people just power through, and that's what I thought I would do as well.\" \n Clinton also criticized Trump for a thin policy platform and for statements she labeled outrageous, such as his recent suggestion that he would order the nation into armed conflict if an opposing force simply taunted American troops. \n \"I'll never be the showman my opponent is,\" she said, citing his appearance on \"The Dr. Oz Show\" to release personal health information. \"And that's OK with me. \u2026 But I am going to deliver for you and your family.\" \n She noted she has been accused of a lot throughout her career, but \"nobody ever accuses me of quitting.\"  \n \"I will never give up,\" she said. \"I'm actually asking Americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his.\" \n Clinton acknowledged to reporters that polls have tightened but that she was confident she was in a strong position to win. \n \"What matters is who registers to vote and who is motivated and mobilized to turn out to vote,\" she said. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Tribune Co. \n ", "author": "By Michael A.

Some carried signs calling for justice for Tyre, while candles spelled out \"RIP Tyre King.\" \n The boy's family called for an investigation conducted \"in a manner that ensures fairness and truth,\" and said people shouldn't rush to judgment about Tyre's activities that night. \n Police and city authorities also promised a full investigation, while rejecting comparisons to the 2014 killing of 12-year-old Tamir in Cleveland. \n Officers investigating the robbery report east of downtown Columbus spotted three males who matched the description of the suspects, authorities said. Two of the males ran away when officers tried to speak with them. \n The police chased the pair into an alley and tried to take them into custody. Tyre pulled out a gun with a laser sight, and an officer fired, hitting the boy multiple times, police said. Tyre later died at a hospital. \n The officer was identified as Bryan Mason, a nine-year veteran of the force. Police records show that in 2012 he shot and killed a man who was holding another person at gunpoint. The Columbus Dispatch said investigators cleared him. \n In keeping with department policy, Mason has been placed on leave while Tyre's shooting is investigated. A call to the head of the police union representing him was not immediately returned. \n An attorney for Tyre's family, Sean Walton, called for an independent investigation. Walton would not discuss any previous dealings Tyre had with police but said the boy had no violent criminal history. He said the family believes Tyre's involvement in an armed robbery would be \"out of character.\" \n Tyre played several sports, including football, and was in the young scholars program at school, Walton said. He had a slight build and, if anything, was on the small side for his age, the attorney said. \n In Tamir's case, a 911 caller reported someone pointing a gun at people near a recreation center. A rookie officer shot the boy almost immediately after pulling up in his cruiser. The officer and his partner were cleared of wrongdoing. \n The 911 caller had said the person with the gun was probably a juvenile and the weapon was probably fake, but that information was never passed on to the officers. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "13-year-old with BB gun killed by police in Ohio"}

{"date": "September 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke at a luncheon for the Economic Club of New York today. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb A fact sheet issued by Donald Trump's campaign today said he would roll back food safety regulations if the billionaire businessman is elected president, arguing they are burdensome to farmers and \"overkill.\" \n The campaign later deleted the fact sheet from its website and issued a new release that did not include the food safety language. The fact sheet was sent out to supplement a speech Trump gave to the New York Economic Club on boosting economic growth. Trump did not mention food safety in the speech. \n In the original fact sheet, the campaign said that Trump would eliminate several regulations, including the \"food police\" at the Food and Drug Administration. \n The handout said the FDA food safety rules \"govern the soil farmers use, farm and food production hygiene, food packaging, food temperatures\" and other ways farmers and food companies do business. It also criticizes increased inspections of food manufacturing facilities as \"inspection overkill.\" \n The description matches new food safety regulations passed by Congress in 2010 in response to an outbreak of salmonella linked to a Georgia peanut company that killed nine and sickened more than 700 people in 46 states. A 2011 outbreak of listeria linked to cantaloupes killed 33 people, and other large scale outbreaks in fresh spinach, cucumbers and eggs have sickened hundreds. \n Last year, an outbreak of listeria linked to Blue Bell ice cream was linked to three deaths. FDA inspectors found many violations at a company plant, including dirty equipment, inadequate food storage, food held at improper temperatures and employees not washing hands appropriately. \n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 48 million people \u2014 or 1 in 6 in the United States \u2014 are sickened each year from foodborne diseases, and an estimated 3,000 people die. \n The final food safety rules for produce issued last year and supported by the food industry require farmers to test irrigation water quality, regularly train workers on the best health and hygiene practices and monitor wildlife that may intrude on growing fields, among other measures. The rules are designed to focus on the riskiest foods, and there are also standards for keeping equipment and facilities clean. \n Michael Taylor, the former FDA deputy commissioner for foods who led the effort to put the rules in place, says it is one area of agreement in the country, since both the food industry and consumers want safe food. \n \"Eliminating FDA's food safety role would make more consumers sick, destroy consumer confidence at home, and damage American competitiveness in global food markets,\" he says. \n The language in the Trump campaign fact sheet mirrors, almost word for word, parts of a May report from The Heritage Foundation that criticizes increased regulation under President Barack Obama. That report said the FDA rules cast an \"exceedingly broad regulatory net.\" \n While some Republicans in Congress have made similar arguments about overly burdensome regulations, the FDA worked to tweak the rules to appease farmers and companies that voiced concern about the rules. Since then, congressional opposition has died down and the Republican House and Senate have given the FDA an increased amount of money to put the rules in place. \n Sen. Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican who has been Trump's biggest supporter in the Senate, said today that he hadn't yet seen the nominee's proposal on food safety, but he said farmers feel like there are too many federal rules and all regulation needs to be evaluated. \n \"In Washington, if you propose to pull back any regulation that has a good title, like food safety, then somebody says you want to poison the American people, and so forth,\" Sessions said. \"But if it can be established that they are not really beneficial, often times the regulations can actually make things more unsafe.\" \n Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, the top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, also said she had not seen the proposal, but criticized the idea of rolling back the rules. \n \"I think the public certainly wants basic food safety standards,\" she said. \n Despite the campaign's apparent desire to roll back the standards, Trump himself has expressed a personal interest in the topic. Trump is a self-professed germaphobe who has said he prefers eating at fast-food restaurants because he believes they have higher food safety standards. \n Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump campaign pushes food safety rollbacks, then backtracks"}

The women's bizarre behavior before the killings included writing extensively in a shared journal about demons and imagined spirit boyfriends. The women, who believed they were \"demon warriors,\" at one point lived in a car for nine days in order to avoid demons in their house; they did not bathe or eat for several days during that time. \n The judge noted that Avery had previously been treated for mental health issues at several facilities and had been prescribed medication but threw it away because she believed \"God had delivered her from her mental illness.\" Despite the fact that she had a surgical procedure to prevent pregnancy, Avery said God had reversed the procedure and she was pregnant with twins. The judge found that during the murders Avery was suffering from bipolar disorder with \"psychotic features\" and \"borderline personality disorder.\" \n \"I find that Miss Avery's ritualistic, albeit barbaric, attempt to rid her children of demons is powerful evidence of the lack of rational thinking,\" the judge said. \n After the judge's ruling, Avery's attorney, Brian Shefferman, called the case \"tragic\" and said he believed the judge had reached the correct decision. He said it will be years before Avery might be considered for release. \n Avery was in court to hear the judge read his ruling but showed no visible reaction to the decision, looking over at her attorney shortly after the judge said he found her not criminally responsible. \n Avery's cousin, Kaliha Brooks, said after the hearing that Avery was a \"very loving mother\" and called it \"mind-boggling\" that Avery killed her children. \n \"I can honestly say that my cousin absolutely adored and loved her children,\" Brooks said. \n Avery's housemate and friend, Monifa Sanford, who participated in the killings, previously took a plea deal in the case and was also committed to a psychiatric hospital. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mom sent to mental hospital for killing 2 kids in Maryland exorcism"}

It's the 27th time that Obama has created or enlarged a national monument. \n \"If we're going to leave our children with oceans like the ones that were left to us, then we're going to have to act and we're going to have to act boldly,\" Obama said at a State Department conference. More than 20 countries represented at the meeting were also announcing the creation of their own marine protected areas. \n Monument designations come with restrictions on certain activities. The White House said the designation will lead to a ban on commercial fishing, mining and drilling, though a seven-year exception will occur for the lobster and red crab industries. Recreational fishing will be allowed within the monument. \n Supporters of the new monument say protecting large swaths of ocean from human stresses can sustain important species and reduce the toll of climate change. Fishermen worry it will become harder for them to earn a living as a result of Obama's move. \n \"We've been fishing out there for 35 years. It's a big blow to us,\" said Jon Williams, president of the Atlantic Red Crab Company in New Bedford, Massachusetts. \n White House officials said the administration listened to industry's concerns, and noted the monument is smaller than originally proposed and contains a transition period for companies like Williams'. \n Williams said his company will survive, but the changes designed to address some of his concerns don't sway him about the merits of the monument. \n \"I think the entire New England fishery is upside down over this,\" Williams said. \n Obama said the world was asking too much of its oceans. He said the investments the U.S. and other nations were taking with new marine protected areas were vital for their economy and national security, but \"also vital to our spirit.\" \n \"We cannot truly protect our planet without protecting our oceans,\" Obama said. \n In all, the Atlantic Ocean monument will include three underwater canyons deeper than the Grand Canyon and four underwater mountains. It is home to such protected species as the sperm, fin and sei whales, and Kemp's ridley turtles. Expeditions also have found species of coral found nowhere else on earth. \n Environmental groups pushed the effort to designate the new monument and sought to make the case it was as important to be good stewards of the ocean as it was the land and air. \n \"Just as wild lands around the globe are beleaguered by human development and climate change, our oceans are under duress today more than ever before,\" said Jamie Williams, president of The Wilderness Society. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama: Oceans key to protecting planet from climate change"}

He shot 13-year-old Tyree King in a Wednesday night confrontation after Tyree ran from officers investigating a reported armed robbery. \n The head of the local police union that represents Mason didn't immediately respond to a message today. \n In the December 2012 case, Mason shot a man who was holding another man at gunpoint. Officers said the armed man refused orders to drop his weapon and was shot. \n The Columbus Dispatch reported that investigators concluded Mason acted within policy in that case. \n Police said today that they couldn't immediately provide other information from Mason's personnel record. \n 1:40 p.m. \n An attorney for the family of a 13-year-old Ohio boy fatally shot by police is calling for a fair and independent investigation into his death. \n Sean Walton today declined to discuss any previous interaction Tyree King had with police, but he emphasized that Tyree didn't have any violent criminal history. \n Tyree was shot Wednesday night after running from officers investigating a reported armed robbery. Police say Tyree pulled a BB gun that looked real out of his waistband. \n Walton says the family believes Tyree being involved in an armed robbery would be \"so out of character\" for him. Walton says the eighth-grader played football and was in the young scholars program at school. \n Walton says Tyree had a slight build and was perhaps even on the small side for his age. \n 12:35 p.m. \n Police in Ohio are investigating another case in which a white policeman fatally shot a black boy who had a pellet gun, but Columbus' police chief says it's too soon to draw comparisons to the Cleveland death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice. \n Chief Kim Jacobs said today that investigators don't yet have enough facts about the Wednesday night death of 13-year-old Tyree King to know how it relates to other cases. \n Police say his weapon looked real. Police say Tyree was shot in a confrontation in a Columbus alley after running from officers investigating a reported armed robbery. \n There was no chase in Tamir's case. A caller reported someone pointing a gun at people near a recreation center. A rookie officer shot Tamir almost immediately after his police cruiser stopped nearby. \n 11:45 a.m. \n Police say a 13-year-old boy who was fatally shot by an Ohio officer after a chase had a pellet gun that looks like a real police firearm. \n He was shot in a Columbus alley around nightfall Wednesday. Police responded to the area on a report of an armed robbery and spotted three males that matched descriptions of the alleged robbers. Police say two of them fled and were chased into the alley, where the boy pulled the weapon from his waistband and was repeatedly shot by one officer. \n The boy, Tyree King, died at a hospital. No one else was hurt. \n Tyree was black. The officer is white and a nine-year veteran of the force. \n Police Chief Kim Jacobs says after the shooting is investigated, a grand jury will consider whether charges are merited. \n 2:35 a.m. \n Police in Ohio responding to a report of an armed robbery shot and killed a 13-year-old boy who they say pulled a gun from his waistband that was later determined to be a BB gun. \n It happened Wednesday night in Columbus. \n Police say when officers arrived on the scene, the victim told them that a group of males had approached him and demanded money. One of them reportedly had a gun. \n Police say the officers saw three males matching the descriptions of the suspects and tried to speak with them, when two of them ran off. The officers followed them to an alley when police say a suspect pulled a gun from his waistband, and an officer shot him. \n The suspect, later identified as Tyree King, was taken to a hospital, where he died. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ohio officer who shot boy had killed a man in 2012"}

{"date": "September 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Angela Caddell smiles during a \"Jesus & Beer\" event at a Waukesha, Wis., pub, organized by CollectiveMKE church, which doesn't have a traditional building. \n WAUKESHA, Wis. >> Angela Caddell started struggling with her Christianity 14 years ago when she came out as gay. But a gathering at a bar to talk faith over a cold beer once a month is helping her feel more connected to her religion. \n \"If you're an atheist you are welcome. \u2026. I'm a lesbian, I'm totally welcome,\" said the 32-year-old from nearby Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, at a recent gathering. \n \"Tonight we're talking about scapegoating. There is no scapegoating that happens here.\" \n This event is called \"Jesus & Beer\" and it's part of an effort by some Christian groups throughout the country to recruit parishioners, connect with people struggling with faith or provide a relaxed outlet to talk religion. \n Caddell heard about the event through Brandon Brown, pastor at CollectiveMKE. He started the gatherings once a month at area bars about 1\u00bd years ago. He doesn't have a stand-alone church and knew that his non-traditional gatherings wouldn't attract social conservatives. About two dozen people attend. \n \"I think it also completely unsettles everyone's expectations in that they know what it is to talk about their faith in a church but most people have never done it in a bar so it's a totally new environment and maybe fresh,\" Brown said. \"In addition to that, I'll be honest: a beer or two doesn't hurt the conversation at all.\" \n While bringing people together to throw one back and talk religion isn't a new idea, groups have been turning to the non-traditional pub setting to attract younger people such as millennials. According to a Pew Research Center study, the number of U.S. adults who are affiliated with an organized religion dropped from 83 percent in 2007 to 77 percent in 2014, a trend particularly striking in the millennial generation. \n That younger group is the focus of a monthly bar event organized by the Basilica of St. Josaphat in Milwaukee, said Emily Burds, the Catholic church's Director of Evangelization. Besides a free beer, there's usually a meet and greet, a speaker and discussion. \n About 60 to 70 people come each month to the \"Brewing the Faith\" gatherings, which Burds sees as a \"means to an end.\" \n \"Obviously the end is like greater faith and a relationship with God but also to be connected to a parish community somewhere where they are living,\" Burds said. \n During the summer they also organize \"Theology on Tap,\" a lecture series that has spread worldwide after starting with the Archdioceses of Chicago in 1981. It involves bars or restaurants and targets younger people. \n Burds said they trained some young adults in mingling skills to make sure everyone feels welcome and a sense of belonging \u2014 \"what every millennial really is searching for,\" Burds said. \n It worked for James Wronski, 22, a new Milwaukee resident who attended a beer garden event. \n \"I think this kind of relaxed social atmosphere where you come, you meet people, you drink, you relax and you kind of learn and educate yourself, that's a big draw to millennials.\" \n But alcohol certainly isn't new to Catholicism, with wine being an integral part of the sacrament of Holy Communion, said Rev. John Laurance, associate professor of theology at Marquette University. \n \"You know one of the Psalms says, 'God gave wine to cheer up people's hearts,' so even the prayer book of the Old Testament sees that this is a gift from God,\" Laurance said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Jesus and beer: Religious groups combine faith, cold brews"}
