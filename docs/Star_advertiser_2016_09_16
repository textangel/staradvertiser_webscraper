Italian prosecutors in Naples have opened an investigation into possible charges of instigation to suicide after a 31-year-old woman killed herself after failing in a long legal battle to get a pornographic video removed from the Internet. \n MILAN \u00bb Italian prosecutors in Naples have opened a criminal investigation of the suicide of a 31-year-old woman who had fought unsuccessfully to have a video showing her having sex expunged from the internet. \n Chief prosecutor Francesco Greco said Friday that the investigation into possible charges of instigating suicide was being coordinated with another probe based on a defamation complaint the woman brought against four individuals last year. \n The woman, identified as Tiziana Cantone, killed herself on Tuesday. She was buried on Thursday, with her family launching an appeal \"that Tiziana's death not be in vain, but serve to stop this kind of mass violence.\" \n The suicide, along with other high-profile instances of cyberbullying, has provoked a debate in Italy about how to protect individuals, not just minors, from having material circulated on the internet without their consent. The parliament is debating legislation that would make it easier to remove unauthorized or offensive material, while also making stalking on the internet an aggravating circumstance. \n According to media reports, Cantone sent the video privately to a small group of people, but it quickly went viral, with her name attached, and she became the target of insults and jokes. Her attempts to have the video removed from a series of platforms failed. \n Besides the defamation complaint, Cantone also went to a civil court seeking to have the video removed for violation of privacy, but she won only a partial victory and was ordered to pay court costs of 20,000 euros ($22,300). \n Italian media reported that prosecutors refused a request to act to have the video removed from websites where it appeared, saying that the video had been downloaded more than 200,000 times and would therefore be impossible to withdraw from circulation, and that there was no evidence she had asked for its removal. \n The head of Italy's privacy agency, Antonello Soro, told Sky News TG that the prosecutor had erred, because under Italian law sensitive material can be circulated only with explicit consent. Soro said this case and others illustrate that people must be educated about the dangers of circulating personal material on the web. \n \"The real point is why do kids, and adults, put in the web, in such an irresponsible way, their own data?\" he said. \"There is the conviction that the immaterial piazza is only virtual.

It would be very dangerous.\"  \n Trump's comment, which the Clinton campaign called an invitation to commit violence against the Democratic presidential nominee, came at a Miami rally thick with racial politics on the day he finally conceded that President Barack Obama was born in the United States. \n After falsely accusing Clinton of opposing the Second Amendment (she supports the right to own firearms, but supports tighter gun controls), the Republican nominee said his rival \"goes around with armed bodyguards like you have never seen before.\" He suggested that that her Secret Service agents \"drop all weapons.\" \n \"I think they should disarm immediately,\" Trump, who also travels with a large Secret Service detail, told a crowd of several thousand at an arena in downtown Miami. \n \"What do you think, yes? Take their guns away. She doesn't want guns. Let's see what happens to her,\" he said. \"Take their guns away, OK? It would be very dangerous.\" \n Critics called Trump reckless and dangerous last month for telling a North Carolina crowd there was nothing they could do about Clinton naming judges if she's elected, \"although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know.\" \n Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said Trump's comments tonight, in view of past remarks, fit \"a pattern of inciting people to violence.\" \n \"This kind of talk should be out of bounds for a presidential candidate, just like it should be out of bounds for a presidential candidate to peddle a conspiracy theory about the president of the United States for five years,\" Mook said in a written statement. \n Trump, whose conspiracy theories about Obama's birth helped make him deeply unpopular among blacks, made no reference to the matter at his Miami rally. \n But he faulted Clinton and other Democrats for questioning his devotion to the cause of improving the lives of black residents of urban areas with \"no jobs,\" \"the worst education\" and streets so dangerous it's impossible to walk around without \"getting shot.\" \n \"They talk all the time about racist, racist \u2014 the only word they know,\" he said. \n Trump told the crowd he employed many people at his resorts in the Miami area \u2014 \"a lot of African-American employees, a lot of Hispanic employees.\" \n He added, \"And they're very happy. They like Donald Trump.\" \n Trump's derogatory remarks about Mexicans, Muslims, women and other groups have led critics in both parties to call him a racist and misogynist. Over the last month, he has tried to remake his image by casting himself as a champion of poor blacks and Latinos, whom he says Democrats have neglected. \n \"I just left Little Haiti,\" Trump said at the Miami rally, alluding to a quick meeting with supporters who, with no evidence, accused President Bill Clinton of plundering Haitian earthquake relief programs. \n \"The love is unbelievable. It's unbelievable. There's no racist \u2014 there's no nothing. It's love,\" he said. \n But Trump pressed forward today with his portrayal of Obama as a president who is treated with less respect than his predecessors, saying leaders of Cuba, Saudi Arabia and China had failed to greet him properly on trips abroad. \n \"Air Force One has never been treated so badly in its long and incredible history,\" Trump said. \"Air Force One used to land, and people would respect the people inside, and they'd come out and there would be all sorts of hoopla. Not anymore.\" \n Many in Trump's audience were Cuban Americans, a cornerstone of Republican support in Florida. They cheered enthusiastically as Trump faulted Obama for the thaw in U.S. relations with Cuba. \n \"All of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro regime were done through executive order, which means the next president can reverse them,\" he said. \"And that I will do, unless the Castro regime meets our demands.\" \n Among them, he told the cheering crowd, would be \"religious and political freedom for the Cuban people and the freeing of political prisoners.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times \n ", "author": "By Michael Finnegan Los Angeles Times", "title": "Trump says Clinton bodyguards should disarm and 'let's see what happens to her'"}

The Winter Springs man faces a minimum of 20 years in prison because the crimes involved a gun. His wife and mother, who attended the five-day trial, walked out crying and would not comment. \n Apperson, a paralegal, sought to convince jurors he acted in self defense when he shot a single bullet from his .357 Magnum into Zimmerman's car on May 11, 2015. Apperson testified that Zimmerman threatened to shoot him and flashed a gun first. The bullet missed Zimmerman's face, lodging itself in the truck's metal frame. \n Assistant State Attorney Stewart Stone told jurors that Apperson instigated the confrontation and chased Zimmerman in a car, which was caught on video surveillance from a nearby post office. \n \"George Zimmerman is no boy scout \u2014 I get that, and you get that,\" Stone said. \"But no matter how you feel about George Zimmerman, he he can still be a victim of a crime, and he was in this case.\" \n Zimmerman, 32, is the former neighborhood watch volunteer acquitted in the 2012 death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, a case that spurred protests across the country. In the Apperson trial, Zimmerman testified for about seven hours and returned Friday with an attorney to listen to closing arguments. He left immediately after, and did not return for the verdict. \n Defense attorney Michael LaFay, in his closing argument, attacked Zimmerman's credibility as a major witness in the case. He repeatedly referenced the Trayvon Martin case, questioning Zimmerman about his first encounter with the 17-year-old. LaFay also called Zimmerman's ex-girlfriend to testify about a fight between her and an armed Zimmerman, which prompted her to call 911. \n \"He is a belligerent, obnoxious liar, and I don't say that lightly,\" LaFay told jurors. \"(Zimmerman) is a bully with a lot of guns and a lot of ammunition.\" \n Attorneys clashed in closing arguments when Stone accused the defense of trying to put Zimmerman back on trial. LaFay objected, saying the comments stirred sympathy in the jury for the victim, which would be an attorney violation. Seminole-Brevard Circuit Judge Debra Nelson cautioned Stone to \"stop walking the line.\" \n Zimmerman and Apperson have a history dating back to Sept. 9, 2014. That day both were driving next to each other on Lake Mary Boulevard and started arguing. According to testimony, Zimmerman thought Apperson was gesturing at him and they began shouting over the Trayvon Martin case. Apperson said he told Zimmerman he was wrong to kill Trayvon, which is when Zimmerman began threatening and following him. \n Stone said Apperson \"retaliated\" against Zimmerman during their encounter in May because of this earlier dispute. To discredit Apperson's testimony that he felt in fear of his life when he saw Zimmerman flash a gun first, Stone relied on two pieces of evidence: Zimmerman's window was rolled up when the shot was fired and his windows were too darkly tinted for anyone to see inside. Police officers and crime scene analysts verified that information during the trial. \n Apperson has awaited his trial in jail because he violated his bond committing another crime \u2014 urinating on his neighbor's front door. \n Apperson's sentencing is set for Oct. 17. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Fla.)  \n ", "author": "By Elyssa Cherney Orlando Sentinel", "title": "Jury finds man who shot at George Zimmerman guilty on all counts"}

Kinsella, who blended magical realism and baseball in the book that became the smash hit film \"Field of Dreams,\" has died. He was 81. \n His literary agent Carolyn Swayze said in a statement that Kinsella's death on Friday in Hope, British Columbia was doctor-assisted. Details about his health were not disclosed. Assisted deaths became legal in Canada in June. \n In the 1982 novel \"Shoeless Joe,\" a farmer hears a voice telling him to build a baseball diamond in his corn fields. When he does, Shoeless Joe Jackson and other baseball players of yesteryear come to play. It became the blueprint for the 1989 Oscar-nominated movie, which starred Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones and Ray Liotta. \n Key turns of phrases in Kinsella's book \u2014 \"If you build it, they will come\" and \"Go the distance\" \u2014 have taken their place in literature's lexicon and among Hollywood's most memorable movie lines. \n Kinsella, a bona fide baseball junkie, loved the movie and said he had tears in his eyes when he first saw it. \n In 2011 the Canadian baseball Hall of Fame awarded him the Jack Graney Award for a significant contribution to the game of baseball in Canada. \n \"I wrote it 30 years ago, and the fact that people are still discovering it makes me proud. It looks like it will stand the test of time,\" Kinsella said at the time. \n Scott Crawford, director of operations at the Canadian hall, said he was saddened to learn of the author's death. \n \"His work has touched the lives of thousands of baseball fans across Canada and around the world,\" Crawford said in a statement. \"His most famous book was the classic 'Shoeless Joe,' which inspired one of my favorite movies, 'Field of Dreams'.\" \n Kinsella brought back to life Moonlight Graham, who played one major league baseball game but never got to bat. The author noticed Graham's name while thumbing through the Baseball Encyclopedia he had received as a Christmas gift from his father-in-law. \n \"I found this entry for Moonlight Graham. How could anyone come up with that nickname? He played one game but did not get to bat. I was intrigued, and I made a note that I intended to write something about him,\" Kinsella told The Associated Press in 2005 on the 100th anniversary of the only game Graham played in the majors. \n Much of Kinsella's work touched on baseball. He published almost 30 books of fiction, non-fiction and poetry and won the Order of Canada, one of the country's highest honors. \n William Patrick Kinsella was born in Edmonton, Alberta. His father John had played minor league baseball, and the young Kinsella fell for the game playing with friends on sandlots in Edmonton. \n He began writing as a child, winning a YMCA contest at age 14. \n Kinsella took writing courses at the University of Victoria in 1970, receiving his bachelor of arts in creative writing in 1974. In 1978 he earned a master of fine arts in English through the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa. \n He had been an English professor at the University of Calgary. \n Vancouver Writer's Festival founder Alma Lee said Kinsella was a private man with a passion for baseball. \n \"He was a dedicated story-teller, performer, curmudgeon, an irascible and difficult man,\" Swayze said in a statement. \"His fiction has made people laugh, cry, and think for decades and will do so for decades to come.\" \n Kinsella was married three times.

Lindell was also convicted of four counts of money laundering. \n Both defendants were ordered to pay $8.9 million to the victims of the scheme. \n According to evidence presented in court, the two built an investment scheme in connection with their business, \"The Mortgage Store,\" promising to pay a guaranteed rate of return of 7 percent. \n Prosecutors said the defendants used radio ads, magazines and a weekly radio show to lure potential investors to attend their weekly workshops, where they taught seminars on how to use the equity in their homes for investment purposes. Lindell and Hoaeae would then used their status as mortgage brokers to refinance investor residences in order to extract the equity in investor homes for the purposes of investment. \n Lindell and Hoaeae would then urge investors to invest money in their investment scheme, known as \"The Parking Lot,\" where investors could \"park\" their money and earn guaranteed rates of interest, prosecutors said.

By comparison, the FAA says there are 260,165 manned aircraft registered in the U.S. \n The FAA began issuing drone pilot licenses to commercial operators less than a month ago. Already, 13,710 people have applied to take the pilot exam, and 5,080 have passed it, Lawrence said. It's clear the agency's estimate of 15,000 licensed drone pilots by the end of 2016 will easily be exceeded, he said. \n The FAA now forecasts there will be more than 1.3 million licensed drone pilots by 2020. \n Lawrence asked the 35 committee members and dozens of attendees at the meeting: Will there eventually be hundreds of thousands of drones in the nation's skies? Or will there be millions? \n Hobbyists and commercial operators alike are required by the FAA to register their aircraft, but agency officials acknowledged that they have no way of measuring how many unregistered drones are in use. \n U.S. drone sales are expected to top 2.4 million aircraft this year, more than double last year's sales, according to the Consumer Technology Association, whose members include drone manufacturers. \n NASA is working with industry and the FAA to create a new low-altitude air traffic control system specifically for drones.

The three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright has died in suburban New York City at age 88. \n NEW YORK >> Three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Edward Albee, who challenged theatrical convention in masterworks such as \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" and \"A Delicate Balance,\" died Friday, his personal assistant said. He was 88. \n He died at his home in Montauk, east of New York, assistant Jackob Holder said. No cause of death was immediately given, although he had suffered from diabetes. With the deaths of Arthur Miller and August Wilson in 2005, he was arguably America's greatest living playwright. \n Several years ago, before undergoing extensive surgery, Albee penned a note to be issued at the time of his death: \"To all of you who have made my being alive so wonderful, so exciting and so full, my thanks and all my love.\" \n Albee was proclaimed the playwright of his generation after his blistering \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" opened on Broadway in 1962. The Tony-winning play, still widely considered Albee's finest, was made into an award-winning 1966 film starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. \n The play's sharp-tongued humor and dark themes were the hallmarks of Albee's style. In more than 30 plays, Albee skewered such mainstays of American culture as marriage, child-rearing, religion and upper-class comforts. \n \"If you have no wounds, how can you know you're alive?\" a character asks in Albee's 1996 \"The Play About the Baby.\" \n \"It's just a quirk of the brain that makes one a playwright,\" Albee said in 2008. \"I have the same experiences that everybody else does, but\u2026 I feel the need to translate a lot of what happens to me, a lot of what I think, into a play.\" \n Albee challenged audiences to question their assumptions about society and about theater itself. He did it with humor and a sense of linguistic delight, using withering barbs and word play to hint at deeper meaning. \n Praise for the playwright came from far and wide on Twitter after his death. Mia Farrow, who was in a staged reading of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" called Albee \"one of the great\" playwrights \"of our time.\" Michael McKean wrote: \"There was only one Edward Albee. #Irreplaceable.\" Playwright Lynn Nottage wrote: \"I will miss his wit, irreverence & wisdom. He enlivened the theatre landscape.\" \n Albee's unconventional style won him great acclaim but also led to a nearly 20-year drought of critical and commercial recognition before his 1994 play, \"Three Tall Women,\" garnered his third Pulitzer Prize. His other Pulitzers were for \"A Delicate Balance\" (1967) and \"Seascape\" (1975). \n Many of his productions in the years after \"Seascape\" were savaged by the press as inconsequential trickery, a shadow of his former works. But after \"Three Tall Women,\" a play he called an \"exorcising of demons,\" he had several major productions, including \"The Play About the Baby\" and \"The Goat or Who Is Sylvia?\" which won him his second Tony for best play in 2002. \n Many of his works had similar things in common: domestic rancor inflamed by booze, a sense of unknown anxiety, a lost child who creates a marital friction and precise but flailing language that alternates between comic and profound. \n In interviews, Albee recoiled at the idea of drawing parallels between his works or between his cynical outlook and his unhappy childhood. \n \"Each play of mine has a distinctive story to tell,\" he told The Santa Fe New Mexican in 2001. \n Albee was born in 1928 and was adopted by a wealthy suburban New York couple. His father, Reed Albee, ran the Keith-Albee chain of vaudeville theaters; his mother, Frances Albee, was a socialite and a commanding presence who kept a hold on him for much of his life. \n Estranged from his parents, Albee moved to New York and worked as a messenger for Western Union before gaining notice with \"The Zoo Story,\" a one-act play written in 1958 about two strangers meeting on a bench in Central Park. \n With \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" and 1964's \"Tiny Alice,\" Albee shook up a Broadway that had been dominated by Tennessee Williams, Miller and their intellectual disciples. \n \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" presents an all-night drinking bout in which a middle-age professor and his wife verbally spar and unravel their illusions during a visit by a younger couple. It won five Tonys including best play, actor (Arthur Hill) and actress (Uta Hagen), and the film version won five Oscars including best actress (Taylor) and supporting actress (Sandy Dennis). \n Albee also directed the American premieres of many of his plays, starting with \"Seascape\" in 1975. \"Seascape\" and \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" were revived on Broadway in 2005, and \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" was revived on Broadway again in 2013. \"A Delicate Balance\" was revived a year later, starring Glenn Close. \n Albee brought back \"The Zoo Story\" to startling effect in 2007 with \"Edward Albee's Peter and Jerry.\" The shattering encounter between two strangers in a park that is \"The Zoo Story\" became the second act of the new work. The first act was based on Albee's much later \"Homelife.\" \n It was one of a number of fruitful productions around the time Albee turned 80 in 2008. \n That year saw the world premiere of his play about identical twins, \"Me, Myself and I,\" in Princeton, New Jersey; a New York revival of two of his early one-act classics, \"The American Dream\" and \"The Sandbox\"; and the premiere of \"Edward Albee's Occupant,\" about sculptor Louise Nevelson and the cult of celebrity. \n Albee was honored by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1996 for his lifetime contributions. Then-President Bill Clinton praised Albee as a man who inspired a generation of American dramatists. Clinton also awarded Albee a National Medal of the Arts that year. \n Into his 70s, Albee continued to write provocative and unconventional plays.

Authorities say the fatal police shooting of King, a 13-year-old Columbus, Ohio boy who officers said pulled a BB gun from his waistband that looked like a real weapon will be investigated thoroughly to determine if charges are warranted. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS / DEC. 2014 \n In this file photo, Tomiko Shine holds up a picture of Tamir Rice during a protest in Washington, D.C. The gazebo where the 12-year-old boy, Rice, was fatally shot by a Cleveland police officer is scheduled to be disassembled. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Members of Tyre King's family console each other during a vigil for 13-year-old Tyre King today in Columbus, Ohio. King was shot and killed by Columbus police Wednesday evening. \n CLEVELAND \u00bb The fatal police shooting of 13-year-old Tyre King by a Columbus police officer Wednesday has drawn comparisons to the police killing of 12-year-old Tamir Rice by a Cleveland police officer in November 2014. Both boys were black and both had replica firearms tucked in their waistbands when they were shot. The officers who shot them are white. There also are differences surrounding the two shootings, the children, and the officers. Here are some highlights:  \n THE BOYS:  \n Details are just beginning to emerge about Tyre's life. Family members and others have described him as a well-liked and thoughtful child who loved sports. They say he spent a great deal of time at a neighborhood recreation center playing basketball. They also describe Tyre as a teen who was small for his age. And relatives say he was a good student in the eighth grade at a middle school in Columbus that emphasizes science and technology. He had recently moved in with his father after living with his grandmother, according to attorneys for the boy's family. \n At 5 feet 7 and nearly 200 pounds, Tamir was much bigger than an average 12-year-old but was described as a carefree child who sometimes acted younger than his age. Police officers who responded to the shooting were surprised to learn he was only 12. Tamir was in the sixth grade. He lived with his mother and teenage sister. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE REPLICA GUNS  \n Columbus police say Tyre was carrying a BB gun that is difficult to distinguish from a .40-caliber Ruger handgun carried by police. Tamir had an Airsoft gun that was a replica of the .45-caliber Colt 1911 sidearm used by the military for decades. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE CALLS  \n In Tyre's case, a caller reported he'd been robbed of $10 by a group of people and that someone in the group had a gun. In Tamir's case, a caller told a 911 operator that he was scared because a \"guy\" was waiving a gun and pointing it at people. The caller also said that the person might be a juvenile and the gun might not be real, but that information was never passed on to the officers. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE SHOOTINGS  \n Columbus police chased after Tyre and two other males after responding to the report. The chase continued into an alley, where officer Bryan Mason said he shot Tyre when the teen began pulling a gun from his waistband. There's no known video of the shooting. Columbus police don't yet have body cameras. \n The killing of Tamir is one of the most documented and scrutinized police shootings in U.S. history. Grainy footage from a surveillance video shows Tamir standing up from a concrete picnic table beneath a now iconic gazebo and being shot by rookie patrolman Timothy Loehmann within two seconds of a cruiser skidding to a stop on a slippery sidewalk less than 5 feet away. The video shows Tamir putting a hand on the Airsoft gun tucked in his waistband when he is shot. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE OFFICERS  \n Mason is a nine-year veteran of the Columbus police department who's been described by a union official as well-liked and respected. Mason fatally shot a man in 2012 who police say was pointing a gun at someone and refused to drop the weapon. Mason was cleared in that shooting, as well as non-fatal shootings in 2010 and 2013. He has been placed on administrative leave in Tyre's shooting, a standard practice after police shootings. \n Numerous people raised questions about why Loehmann was a police officer, especially in a violence-prone city like Cleveland. He was dismissed by a suburban department at the end of his six-month probationary period after a supervisor concluded he was unfit to serve. In Tamir's shooting, a grand jury declined to indict Loehmann and training officer Frank Garmback on criminal charges. Both remain on desk duty. City officials haven't said whether the officers will be disciplined administratively. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police shootings of Tyre King, Tamir Rice draw comparisons"}

Sanders was charged with two counts of capital murder in the slayings of Sisters Margaret Held and Paula Merrill, both 68. \n DURANT, Miss. \u00bb A man charged with killing two nuns confessed to investigators that he went into their home, struggled with them, stabbed them to death and stole their car, a state law enforcement agent testified today. \n Rodney Earl Sanders, 46, of Kosciusko, Mississippi, is charged with capital murder in the slayings of Sisters Margaret Held and Paula Merrill, both 68. Their bodies were found Aug. 25 after they failed to show up at the health clinic where they worked as nurse practitioners in one of the poorest counties in the nation. \n Sanders was arrested Aug. 26. Dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, he sat quietly by his defense attorney today as Mississippi Bureau of Investigation agent LeCarus Oliver testified just a few feet away. \n Oliver said Sanders had been staying in a shed across the street from the sisters' home for three days before the slayings. He testified that he was not in the room when Sanders confessed, but Sanders' questioning by other investigators was captured on an audio recording. \n \"He did acknowledge killing Paula Merrill and Margaret Held,\" Oliver testified. \n Sanders told investigators that he went through the back door of the sisters' home, uninvited. Sanders said Merrill saw him first before a struggle took place with both women, Oliver testified. \n Oliver also said Sanders told officers that after stabbing the women, \"He washed himself up because his hands were sticky.\" \n One of Sanders' defense attorneys, Richard Carter III of Kosciusko, asked Oliver if Sanders had revealed a motive for the alleged crime. Oliver said he had not. \n Today's hearing was to determine whether there is enough evidence against Sanders to send the case to a grand jury, which will consider indictment. Durant Municipal Judge Jim Arnold ruled there is, and he denied Carter's request that bond be set. Sanders has been jailed since his arrest on two counts of capital murder, one count of burglary and one count of grand larceny. Arnold also denied bond for Sanders on Aug. 29. \n Oliver testified that a knife was recovered from the shed where Sanders had been staying, and it is among items being tested at the state Crime Lab. He also testified that the nuns' partially clothed bodies were found in the hallway of the home. He said the crime could have occurred late Aug. 24 or early Aug. 25. \n Rape kits are pending at the Crime Lab, Oliver said. Sanders has not been charged with rape, however. \n The nuns' relatives and colleagues have said they oppose the death penalty, including for Sanders. Holmes County District Attorney Akillie Malone-Oliver said outside court today that she had not decided whether to pursue it. \n Under Mississippi law, capital murder is a killing that occurs with at least one other felony, and it is punishable by lethal injection or life in prison. \n The nuns' funerals were Sept. 2. Merrill was buried in Kentucky, where she belonged to the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth. Held was buried in Wisconsin, where she was a member of the School Sisters of St. Francis in Milwaukee. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Investigator: Suspect confessed to killing 2 nuns"}

An additional 10 percent were due to bone and articular cartilage cancers, 9 percent to thyroid and other endocrine gland cancers, and 8 percent to mesothelial and soft tissue cancers. \n Combined, these five cancers accounted for more than four out of five cancer deaths among children and adolescents. \n The good news is that the rate of childhood cancer deaths declined over the past 15 years, part of a trend that began in the mid-1970s. The 2014 death rate \u2014 2.28 deaths per 100,000 kids and teens \u2014 was 20 percent lower than it was in 1999. \n Boys were more vulnerable to cancer than girls, with death rates that were 10 percent to 30 percent higher throughout the 15-year period. In 2014, 2.57 out of every 100,000 boys and young men died of cancer, compared with 1.98 out of every 100,000 girls and young women, according to the report. \n The cancer death rate was higher for older teens \u2014 2.9 deaths per 100,000 adolescents between the ages of 15 and 19 \u2014 than for any other age group. The death rates for all other age groups ranged between 2.01 and 2.12 deaths per 100,000 kids, though those differences weren't large enough to be statistically significant. \n The cancer death rate declined for all age groups between 1999 and 2014, the report said. \n It also fell for black and white children and teens. In 1999, 3.01 out of every 100,000 black kids and 2.85 of every 100,000 white kids died of some kind of cancer; in 2014, those figures were 2.32 and 2.36, respectively.

{"date": "September 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n First lady Michelle Obama waved during a campaign rally in support of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and vice presidential candidate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., today, at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. \n FAIRFAX, Va. \u00bb Stepping deeper into the political fray, Michelle Obama today warned young voters against being \"tired or turned off\" in the 2016 election. She urged them to rally behind Hillary Clinton, \"particularly given the alternative.\" \n Mrs. Obama is emerging as one of Clinton's most effective advocates, especially with voters who backed President Barack Obama but are less enthusiastic about his potential Democratic successor. The Clinton team's biggest challenge regarding Mrs. Obama is getting the reluctant campaigner to commit to more events. \n Today's rally in Virginia was Mrs. Obama's first solo campaign event for Clinton and comes nearly two months after her star turn at the Democratic convention. Speaking to mostly students at George Mason University, she repeatedly jabbed Trump without mentioning him by name, declaring that being president \"isn't anything like reality TV.\" \n The first lady pointedly called out those who continue to question the president's citizenship \"up to this very day.\" Drawing on a frequently quoted line from her convention speech, Mrs. Obama said her husband had responded to those questions by \"\"going high when they go low.\" \n Hours earlier, Trump stated for the first time that the president was born in the United States, though he did not apologize for devoting years to promoting false allegations that Obama was not an American citizen. \n Beyond her ability to take on Trump with a smile, Mrs. Obama's real value to Clinton is her wild popularity with Democratic voters, particularly young people and blacks. She vouched repeatedly for Clinton's resume and character, urging voters motivated by her husband's history-making campaigns to feel the same way about the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. party. \n \"When I hear folks saying that they don't feel inspired in this election, well let me tell you, I disagree\u2014 I am inspired,\" Mrs. Obama said. \n Clinton aides want Mrs. Obama in battleground states as much as possible between now and Election Day. Today's rally in northern Virginia, less than an hour drive from the White House, is the only event she's publicly committed to, though the Clinton campaign expects her to make additional appearances. \n Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director and a former Obama adviser, called the first lady \"an advocate without peer.\" \n \"There is no other surrogate with the reach, credibility and respect she has,\" Palmieri said. \n Clinton herself has started referencing Mrs. Obama in her campaign remarks, using her convention address as a guidepost for what she promises will be a more aspirational finish to her campaign. \n \"As Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic Convention, when we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn't between Democrat or Republican. It's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives,\" Clinton said Thursday during a campaign stop in Greensboro, North Carolina. \n That convention address ran just about 10 minutes, yet it was perhaps the most powerful of the four-day gathering. In the midst of a heated campaign, with two candidates who are viewed negatively by so many Americans, the first lady provided a striking contrast by speaking as a mother hopeful about her daughters' future. \n \"Part of what makes her so appealing and effective as a surrogate is that she's relentlessly positive, even when things on the campaign trail get negative,\" said Olivia Alair Dalton, Mrs. Obama's former spokeswoman. \n Mrs. Obama has carefully cultivated her image as a devoted mother who prefers to stay out of the political fray. She sets limits on how often she's willing to campaign, even for her husband's White House races, and largely steers clear of controversial topics. And she's embraced her role as a pop culture fixture far more willingly than her role as one of the most popular figures in Democratic politics. \n Unlike her husband, who forged a strong bond with Clinton during her four years as his secretary of state, Mrs. Obama does not have a particularly close relationship with the Democratic nominee, though the two are said to be friendly. \n Yet the first lady is fiercely protective of her husband's legacy and has been a major player in discussions about his presidential library and other post-White House projects. And there's perhaps nothing more crucial to preserving Obama's legacy than a Clinton victory. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Michelle Obama makes campaign trail debut for Clinton"}

Reginald Neal, far left, commander of the 48th Infantry Brigade of the Georgia National Guard, stood with an Army color guard today during a ceremony at Fort Stewart, Ga., to mark the brigade's new alignment with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division. \n FORT STEWART, Ga. \u00bb Before citizen-soldiers of the 48th Infantry Brigade deployed to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Georgia National Guard troops spent months training away from their families and day jobs before they were prepared for war. Now a shrinking Army wants them able to get ready for combat sooner. \n The brigade's 4,200 soldiers are the first of a dozen National Guard and Army Reserve units nationwide chosen to test a new role that pairs them with commanders on active-duty who will oversee their training. \n The Pentagon hopes the change will make the Guard and Reserve troops better prepared to fight overseas at a time when the Army has roughly 100,000 fewer full-time soldiers than it did at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n \"We're still a National Guard unit, but we're hopefully maintaining a high level of training,\" said Col. Reginald Neal, the 48th Brigade's commander and a former school teacher and administrator. \n A few hundred of the brigade's citizen-soldiers \u2014 who work as police officers and engineers, attorneys and truck drivers in their day jobs \u2014 attended a ceremony today at Fort Stewart in which the Guard soldiers stripped the brigade's lightning bolt insignia from their left shoulders and replaced it with the diagonally striped square patch of their new active-duty partner, the 3rd Infantry Division. \n Though they still typically train one weekend each month \u2014 a schedule not expected to change in their new role \u2014 the 48th Brigade's soldiers long ago shed the National Guard's old weekend warrior stereotype. \n The brigade deployed alongside 3rd Infantry units to spend a year fighting in Iraq in 2005, followed by a yearlong tour in Afghanistan in 2009. The citizen-soldiers paid their dues in blood. In all, 34 Georgia guardsmen were killed during the two deployments. \n \"This isn't that crazy of a thing we're doing here,\" said Maj. Gen. Jim Rainey, commander of the 3rd Infantry, who noted the shared history between his division and the Georgia Guard unit. \"We've trained together, we've fought together, and sadly we've bled together.\" \n Rainey said his job is to make sure the 48th Brigade is \"ready to go to war\" more quickly than in the past. The brigade spent nearly five months training at Fort Stewart and at the Army's National Training Center in California before it was ready to deploy to Iraq in 2005. \n The Army is forging similar active-duty partnerships for nine additional National Guard units based in Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and Texas, which has three units participating. Joining them are two Army Reserve units based in North Carolina and Hawaii. \n The number of soldiers serving on active-duty in the Army has dropped from 570,000 during the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to 473,844 in July. Despite post-war cutbacks, the U.S. military remains a premier force with Congress debating a proposed authorization of $602 billion for the next fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. \n Any National Guard units being paired with active-duty commands will remain available for their states' governors to mobilize in response to natural disasters and other emergencies. \n Meanwhile, leaders of the 48th Brigade have already been sharing training reports and planning meetings with the 3rd Infantry. A few additional days may need to be added to the brigade's training schedule, Neal said, but otherwise he expects few major changes. \n \"It solidifies the relationships that we've already established,\" Neal said. \"In other words, we're getting credit for what we've already been doing.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "A shrinking Army aims to keep citizen-soldiers combat ready"}

But Turkey's tense relationship with the Kurds and the U.S. since July's failed coup stalled the efforts. \n The remains of Keith Broomfield of Massachusetts, believed to be the first American to die alongside Kurds fighting Islamic State, were returned to the U.S. through Turkey last year. \n But officials determined it would be too dangerous to repatriate the bodies of Shirley, MacTaggart and Savage through Turkey and instead shipped them hundreds of miles east to Iraq. The bodies were then flown to Amman, Jordan, and on to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in a process that took weeks. \n Susan Shirley said her friends had contacted Perlmutter to help navigate the bewildering terrain. He enlisted aid from people at the White House. \n \"These were good young men who for one reason or another didn't qualify for our military but felt the need to serve in another way,\" Perlmutter said. \n As he handed MacTaggart's parents a folded flag, he told them quietly, \"He was trying to do something more for all of us in his fight against ISIS.\" \n Shirley, of Arvada, Colorado, was killed by a land mine July 14. MacTaggart, of Castle Rock, Colorado, died Aug. 3 while fighting in a squad that included two Americans and a Swede in Manbij, Syria. \n Savage, of St. Mary's County, Maryland, also died in Manbij on Aug. 10. \n Dozens of other Westerners are now fighting with the Kurds, spurred by social media campaigners and a sense of duty rooted in the U.S.-led military intervention in Iraq. The U.S. discourages but so far hasn't banned Americans from fighting with militias against terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State group. \n On the train platform in Denver, workers loaded the plain, wooden boxes from a baggage cart into hearses. Russell Shirley gave his son a final salute. \n Unlike fallen members of the armed forces, the young men had no military escorts to accompany their caskets and no 21-gun salute. \n Still, the families said they appreciated the quiet homecoming. \n \"He had no interest in ceremony,\" Robert MacTaggart said of his son. \"Any of this would have been a shock to him.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "American men who died fighting Islamic State come home"}

{"date": "September 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke during a campaign event at Trump International Hotel, today, in Washington. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb After five years as the chief promoter of the false idea that Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States, Donald Trump reversed course and admitted today that the president was \u2014 and then claimed credit for putting the issue to rest. \n \"President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,\" Trump said in a brief statement read at the end of a campaign appearance. \"Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.\" \n But as Trump sought to put that false conspiracy theory to rest, he stoked another, claiming that the \"birther movement\" was started by rival Hillary Clinton. There is no evidence that that is true. \n \"Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it,\" Trump said. \"I finished it, you know what I mean.\" \n While the birther theory was pushed by some bloggers who backed Clinton's primary campaign against Obama eight years ago, Clinton has long denounced what she's called a \"racist lie\" that sought to \"delegitimize America's first black president.\" \n \"Leading the birther movement is deplorable,\" Clinton tweeted after his event today. \"Attempting to say it 'did a great service' to the president who Trump attacked is asinine.\" \n Trump's statement, in a sprawling ballroom at his new Washington hotel, lasted only a few seconds following a lengthy campaign event featuring military officers and award winners who have endorsed him. Trump did not address the issue until the end, turning the event into a de facto commercial for his campaign, as the major cable TV networks aired the full event live in anticipation of comments Trump had hyped hours before. \n \"I'm going to be making a major statement on this whole thing and what Hillary did,\" he told the Fox Business Network. \"We have to keep the suspense going, OK?\" \n For years, Trump has been the most prominent proponent of the \"birther\" idea. He used the issue to build his political profile and define his status as an \"outsider\" willing to challenge conventions. \n He generally avoided the issue during the GOP primary, and today marked the first time he said in no uncertain terms he was mistaken. \n As late as Wednesday, Trump refused to acknowledge Obama was born in Hawaii, declining to address the matter in a Washington Post interview published late Thursday night. \n \"I'll answer that question at the right time,\" Trump said. \"I just don't want to answer it yet.\" \n Clinton seized on Trump's refusal during a speech Thursday night. \n \"This man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?\" she asked. \n Hours later, Trump's campaign spokesman Jason Miller issued a statement that suggested the question had been settled five years ago \u2014 by Trump. \n \"In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate,\" Miller said. \n \"Mr. Trump did a great service to the president and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised,\" he added. \n The facts of Trump's actions do not match Miller's description. Trump repeatedly questioned Obama's birth in the years after Obama released his birth certificate. In August 2012, for example, he was pushing the issue on Twitter. \n \"An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud,\" he wrote. \n Even in January of this year, Trump sounded skeptical when asked whether he now believed the president was a natural-born citizen. \n \"Who knows? Who cares right now? We're talking about something else, OK?\" Trump said in a CNN interview. \"I mean, I have my own theory on Obama. Someday I'll write a book.\" \n Trump's reversal comes as he works to win over African-American voters \u2014 many of whom have been turned off by his attempt to delegitimize the nation's first black president. \n Obama took the unprecedented step of releasing his long form birth certificate in 2011, amid persistent questions from Trump. \n On the day he released the document, Obama jabbed at Trump, saying, \"We're not going to be able to solve our problems if we get distracted by sideshows and carnival barkers.\" \n The president today added that he hoped the election would focus on more serious issues, and that he \"was pretty confident about where I was born.\" \n After Trump's event, the GOP nominee invited photographers and a camera on a tour of his new hotel property, without reporters present. \n Meanwhile, the backdrop of blue curtains that Trump had spoken in front of collapsed, toppling a row of American flags like dominoes. \n Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Josh Lederman contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "After promoting conspiracy theory, Trump concedes that President Obama was born in U.S."}

All of the committee members separately sent Obama a letter urging him not to pardon Snowden, who revealed the NSA's collection of millions' of Americans phone records. \n The American Civil Liberties Union, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are behind the campaign to pardon him. \n Kenneth Roth, HRW's executive director, was on the panel of the Athens conference, and described the effort as \"an uphill battle.\" \n \"What we're hoping is that after the election when Obama is in his final months in office \u2014 at that stage he can begin to do something that are appropriate as a matter of conscience but politically difficult,\" Roth told the AP. \n \"One of them we would be is to pardon Snowden,\" he said. \"There's been broad recognition that Edward Snowden has done an enormous public service by disclosing the degree to which all of our privacy has been invaded needlessly.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Snowden says will vote in U.S. presidential election"}

But this is being billed as the official list for any fan's animation \"pilgrimage,\" as the places are known as \"seichi,\" or \"sacred spots.\" \n People around the world can vote on the landmarks through a website set up in several languages, including English and Chinese. \n \"Japanese pop culture has grown to rival American Hollywood,\" Tsugihiko Kadokawa, chairman of Kadokawa Corp. publisher and film studio, one of the officials behind the effort, said Friday at a Tokyo news conference. \"Animation can change the times.\" \n The project highlights Japan's recent push to make tourism a valuable boon for a stagnant economy, as dynamic as the export of the long-hailed Toyota cars and Sony video-game machines. \n Tourists from abroad have grown, under a \"Cool Japan\" initiative, reaching 20 million people last year \u2014 five years ahead of a goal set by the government, prompting officials to raise its 2020 target to 40 million tourists. \n Kadokawa and other officials behind the newly formed Japan Anime Tourism Association said they would compile a travel route of 88 animation spots by December, including where manga and animation works took place, as well as the homes of manga artists and museums dedicated to their works. \n Votes from fans will be taken into consideration in compiling the list. \"Vote for the special spot you want to share with everyone,\" the site says. \n One shoo-in for the list, according to organizers, is Washinomiya Jinja, a picturesque shrine in Saitama prefecture on the outskirts of Tokyo, a familiar scene in comics by Kagami Yoshimizu, which later became a TV animation series, \"Lucky Star\" or \"Raki Suta.\" \n The shrine is not as grand or famous as others in the country, such as Meiji Shrine in central Tokyo, but it's still the one to visit for those who love the manga series, which depicts friendship among schoolgirls, all illustrated with the huge eyes and colorful hair characteristic of manga. \n The shrine shows up in the opening sequence to the TV show, whose typical episode will feature a heated discussion in cute, cooing voices on the correct way to eat a pastry. \n Hopes are high at Washinomiya Jinja to be picked for the honors. \n \"I'm all for it,\"said Teruko Masaki, owner of a restaurant near the shrine, which sells noodles and other products with the manga characters splashed on the packaging. \n The pieces of wood on which visitors write their wishes, such as getting accepted at a college or having a healthy baby, are, at Washinomiya, covered with drawings of the \"Lucky Star\" girls. \n Other possible animation spots include the \"Gundam\" giant robot statue on Odaiba, an artificial island in Tokyo Bay, and the Ghibli Studio of Hayao Miyazaki, the Oscar-winning animator who made \"Spirited Away.\" \n Louis Lee, an editor from Hong Kong, who was at the Tokyo launch of the Japan Anime Tourism Association, said he was an avid manga fan, especially of \"Slam Dunk,\" a story about a high school basketball team. \n \"It teaches you not to give up until the end,\" he said. \n Manga fans like Lee say manga has proven useful for studying the Japanese language and culture. They say animation spots should have manga character costumes that visitors can wear in photos, as well as manga-related products for sale. \n The government's Japan Tourism Agency has recently begun to study not only the numbers of tourists coming to Japan, but what was the emotional driver behind their visits. The agency's survey of French and Thai people found that, although the two groups varied on what they hoped to do, they both said they became interested in Japan through movies and other entertainment content. \n \"But we are still not taking full advantage of such resources,\" said agency Commissioner Akihiko Tamura. \"A lot of work still needs to be done.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Online vote for the animation spot: http://animetourism88.com/en/ \n \u2014\u2014 AP videographer Koji Ueda contributed to this report. \n Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama \n Her work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Japan choosing 88 animation travel spots to boost tourism"}
