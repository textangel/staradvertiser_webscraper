{"date": "September 17, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People stood near the entrance on the north side of Crossroads Center mall between Macy's and Target as officials investigated a reported multiple stabbing incident. \n ST. CLOUD, Minn. \u00bb A man in a private security uniform stabbed eight people at a Minnesota shopping mall, reportedly mentioning Allah and asking at least one victim if they were Muslim before an off-duty police officer shot and killed him, authorities said. \n All nine victims were treated at hospitals for wounds that weren't life-threatening, St. Cloud police Chief Blair Anderson said at a news conference today. Three remained hospitalized. The others were released. \n The attack happened at around 8 p.m. Saturday at the Crossroads Center in St. Cloud, a city of about 65,000 people 60 miles northwest of Minneapolis. \n A man in a security uniform and armed with a knife entered the mall and stabbed people in several locations, including corridors, businesses and common areas, the chief said. \n Five minutes after authorities received the first 911 call, Jason Falconer, a part-time officer in the city of Avon, shot and killed the attacker, whose name hasn't been released. Anderson said Falconer fired as the attacker was lunging at him with the knife, and continued to engage him as the attacker got up three times. \n \"He clearly prevented additional injuries and potential loss of life,\" Anderson said. \n \"Officer Falconer was there at the right time and right place,\" he said. \n Anderson earlier said the man reportedly made at least one reference to Allah and asked a victim if they were Muslim before attacking them. \n FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Rick Thornton said the attack was being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, but that agents were still digging into the attacker's background and possible motives. \n An Islamic State-run news agency, Rasd, claimed today that the attacker was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" who had heeded the group's calls for attacks in countries that are part of a U.S.-led anti-IS coalition. \n It was not immediately clear if the extremist group had planned the attack or even knew about it beforehand. IS has encouraged so-called \"lone wolf\" attacks. It has also claimed past attacks that are not believed to have been planned by its central leadership. \n Authorities didn't identify the attacker, but Anderson earlier said police had had three previous encounters with him, mostly for minor traffic violations. He said authorities have no reason to believe anyone else was involved in the attack. The FBI is helping with the investigation. \n The attack began shortly after an explosion in a crowded New York City neighborhood injured 29 people. A suspicious device was found a few blocks away and safely removed. Hours before that, a pipe bomb exploded in Seaside Park, New Jersey, shortly before thousands of runners were due to participate in a charity 5K race. There was no indication that any of the incidents were linked. \n The St. Cloud mall remained on lockdown following the attack, and authorities eventually released those inside. It was closed today. \n Photos and video of the mall taken hours after the incident showed groups of shoppers waiting to be released, including some huddled together near a food court entrance. \n Harley and Tama Exsted, of Isle, were in St. Cloud to watch their son play in a college golf tournament and were in the mall when the attack happened. \n \"All of a sudden I heard pop, pop, pop,\" Harley Exsted told the St. Cloud Times. \"I thought someone tipped over a shelf. All of a sudden these people started running. I just saw everybody running our way.\" \n The couple were unharmed and said they helped another woman who was running from the scene to her car. \n Adonis Samuels, 42, of St. Cloud, was outside the mall where his wife Roxanne works as a manager at Clinique at Macy's. \n \"She called me on the phone and told me she was hiding under the counter with a customer,\" Samuels said. She later called and said she was safe in a secured area. \n Samuels remained outside, watching for her. He said he'd seen her through the glass doors at one point so he knew she was safe. \n Associated Press writer Bassem Mroue in Beirut, Lebanon, and Amy Forliti in Minneapolis contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Man stabs 9 at Minnesota mall before cop kills him"}

{"date": "September 17, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a event with The Remembrance Project. \n HOUSTON >> Donald Trump, who has made a hard-line stance on immigration a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, asserted Saturday that \"not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders.\" \n \"All across this country, dining room tables have an empty seat because the government abandoned its duty and has not enforced its basic laws,\" the Republican presidential nominee told a gathering of the Remembrance Project, a group founded to remember those killed by people living illegally in the U.S. and to press for tougher laws. \"This has to end. This will end if I become president.\" \n Two dozen members of the organization sat behind Trump as he spoke, and several told their stories, often gruesome, of how their loved ones lost their lives. Trump has appeared with members of the group several times, including during the speech to lay out his immigration policy in Arizona last month. He vowed to continue to \"shine a national spotlight\" on their work. \n \"Politicians ignore your cries, but I never will,\" Trump said. \n Maria Espinoza, founder of the group and daughter of a Mexican immigrant, praised Trump's advocacy. But the Houston-based group has come under scrutiny for some of its pronouncements, including Espinoza's false assertion that immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally kill 25 Americans a day. \n Trump has long talked tough on immigration, deriding Mexico as a source of rapists and criminals in his campaign kick-off speech last year and vowing to build an impenetrable wall on the nation's southern border. He is not proposing a pathway to legal status for people living in the country illegally but has backed away from his call for the mass deportation of millions of people who have not committed crimes beyond their immigration offenses. But he also ruled out what he dismissed as \"amnesty,\" saying those who want to live legally in the U.S. will need to leave and head to the back of the line in their home countries. \n Later Saturday, Trump hit back at the former defense secretary who called the Republican nominee \"beyond repair\" when it comes to national security. \n Robert Gates, who served under presidents of both parties, wrote in The Wall Street Journal Saturday that Trump is \"stubbornly uninformed\" about the world. Trump, at a rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado, called Gates \"an absolute clown,\" insinuated that \"probably has a problem we don't know about\" and then claimed that he would be \"so much better at what he's doing\" than the former Cabinet member. \n But Trump made no mention Saturday of either controversy that dominated the political world a day earlier: he did not address his decision to finally acknowledge that President Barack Obama was born in the United States or his call for Hillary Clinton's Secret Service agents to drop their guns and then \"let's see what happens.\" \n Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, released a two-page letter from his doctor Saturday vouching for his \"excellent\" health, summarizing his medical history and results of a July physical exam. Pence, 57, released the letter after Trump, Democrat Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, also provided some details of their medical history. The health of the candidates has become an issue since Clinton stumbled at a 9/11 memorial event and revealed afterward that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia. \n Pence's doctor disclosed that Pence had basal cell carcinomas \u2014 skin cancer \u2014 removed from his face in 2002 and 2010. He also had surgery in August 2015 to repair a hernia. The doctor said the only medication Pence takes is Claritin for seasonal allergies, he does not smoke or drink alcohol, has diet-controlled heartburn and exercises four times a week. \n Pence campaigned Saturday in The Villages, a sprawling retirement community northwest of Orlando, before tailgating with Florida Gators fans before their game against North Texas. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump says 'open borders' cost lives and 'this will end'"}

{"date": "September 17, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Heavily armed police guard the area as they search for an explosive device on West 27th Street and 7th Avenue in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. \n NEW YORK \u00bb Gov. Andrew Cuomo said today a blast that injured 29 people in Manhattan was caused by some kind of bomb, but the attack didn't appear to be linked to international terrorism. \n Cuomo, speaking near the scene of the Saturday night blast, told reporters a second device found blocks away from the first explosion appeared \"similar in design\" to the first, though investigators are still testing its remnants after it was removed by a bomb squad robot and blown up at a police facility in the Bronx. \n The bombing rocked the city's Chelsea neighborhood, a mostly residential part of Manhattan's west side known for its art galleries and large gay population. Witnesses described hearing a deafening blast, and surveillance video footage captured images of nearby windows being blown out by the explosion as people sprinted away from the scene. \n \"We will find whoever planted these explosives and they will be punished,\" said Cuomo, a Democrat. He said all 29 people who were injured have been treated and released from a hospital. \n Members of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force are investigating the blast along with New York Police Department detectives, fire marshals and other federal investigators. As a precaution, Cuomo said he was deploying an additional 1,000 state troopers and members of the National Guard throughout New York City. \n The first device, which exploded on West 23rd Street at about 8:30 p.m., appeared to have been caused by an improvised explosive device placed inside a toolbox in front of a building undergoing construction, according to a law enforcement official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation. \n The second device, found later inside a plastic bag on West 27th Street, appeared to be a pressure cooker with wiring and a cellphone attached to it, the official said. A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in New York said investigators are examining the remnants of the device to determine how it was comprised, including whether it was real or fake. \n Investigators were also probing whether the Manhattan blast was in any way related to a pipe bomb explosion in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors earlier Saturday. The race was canceled and no one was injured. \n Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at the scene of the explosion Saturday night, said that there didn't appear to be a connection between the two incidents. He called the explosion an \"intentional act\" but said there was no known \"specific and credible threat against New York City.\" \n \"Now, I want to be clear: Whatever the cause, whatever the intention here, New Yorkers will not be intimidated,\" he said. \n Chris Gonzalez, visiting from Dallas, was having dinner with friends at a restaurant in the area. \n \"We felt it. We heard it,\" Gonzalez said. \"It wasn't like jolting or anything. Everyone just went quiet.\" \n Rudy Alcide, a bouncer at Vanity Nightclub at 21st Street and 6th Avenue, said he, at first, thought something large had fallen. \n \"It was an extremely loud noise. Everything was shaking, the windows were shaking,\" he said. \"It was extremely loud, almost like thunder but louder.\" \n Associated Press writers Karen Matthews, Ezra Kaplan and Maria Sanminiatelli in New York and Eric Tucker and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Governor: No apparent link between NYC blast, overseas terror"}

{"date": "September 17, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A bag covers a pump handle at a gas station that has no fuel to sell Saturday. Fuel supplies in at least five states are threatened by a gasoline pipeline spill in Alabama, and the U.S. Department of Transportation has ordered the company responsible to take corrective action before the fuel starts flowing again. \n ATLANTA >> Lines formed at gas stations across the South on Saturday and drivers who were able to find fuel had to pay more for it in some cases, as prices edged up following a pipeline spill in Alabama. \n Fuel supplies in at least five states \u2014 Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and the Carolinas \u2014 were threatened by the spill, and the U.S. Department of Transportation ordered the company responsible to take corrective action before the fuel starts flowing again. \n Colonial Pipeline Co. must conduct testing and analysis on the failed section of the pipeline, according to the U.S. Transportation Department, which is investigating the spill in rural Alabama. \n The company has acknowledged that between 252,000 gallons and 336,000 gallons of gasoline leaked from a pipeline near Helena, Alabama, since the spill was first detected Sept. 9. It's unclear when the spill actually started. \n Drivers in Atlanta found some pumps completely dry or they had to pay 20 cents more because, according to a sign on the pump, the gas had to be pulled from Savannah. \n \"I just came in to town so this is shocking to me,\" said Gina Dorman, as she filled up her nearly empty tank. She said she tried to get gas at several pumps at the service station before finding one that had gas flowing. \n At a Kroger gas station a couple of miles away, orange cones were set up where cars usually park to get fuel. The pumps were completely dry and attendants were not sure when they would get more gas. Many drivers said they didn't know about the spill. \n Rob Gomes said his wife called him and told him to fill up after hearing about the shortage. \n \"We were out, so we said, let's gas up,\" he said. \n Colonial Pipeline announced Saturday it is beginning construction of a temporary pipeline that will bypass a leaking section of its main gasoline pipeline in Shelby County, Alabama, according to AL.com (http://bit.ly/2cvk9ZU). \n Colonial gave no timetable as to when that bypass line would be completed or what path it would take. \n Tennessee Emergency Management Director Patrick Sheehan tried to reassure drivers. \n \"Tennessee's consumers need to maintain their normal driving and fuel buying habits. If consumers fill up unnecessarily, top off their tanks when they aren't close to empty, and fill multiple containers at the pumps, then our petroleum retailers will not be able to keep up with the demand of the fuel supply,\" he said. \n Quik Trip spokesman Mike Thornbrugh said several stations in South Carolina were seeing outages. \n \"When you have a pipeline of that magnitude go down, it just shows everybody unfortunately how fragile the system is and it doesn't take much to cause some hiccups,\" he told WYFF (http://bit.ly/2cy6o1H). \n In a statement Saturday, the Alpharetta, Georgia-based company said that repair work had begun in an effort to return the pipeline to service \"as rapidly and safely as possible.\" \n The company said it is shipping as much gasoline as possible on its distillate mainline, Line 2, in order to mitigate the impact of the pipeline that has been shut down. Colonial earlier said most of the leaked gasoline is contained in a retention pond near the city of Helena and there's no public safety concern. \n Motorists could pay even more for gasoline in coming days, although experts say that any spike in service-station prices should only be temporary. \n In response to the shutdown, the governors in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee announced they would lift restrictions on the number of hours that truck drivers delivering fuel can work, in hopes of preventing fuel shortages. Governors can suspend federal transportation regulations during emergencies. \n The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency waived requirements this week that metro areas with air quality issues in Georgia and Tennessee use a cleaner-burning type of gasoline during the summer months. That requirement of the Clean Air Act expired at midnight Thursday. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Gas prices up, stations running out after pipeline spill"}

{"date": "September 17, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Syrian President Bashar Assad, addressed a speech to the newly-elected parliament at the parliament building, in Damascus, Syria, in June 2016. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Russian President Vladimir Putin listened to a journalist's question during a news conference after a CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States, former Soviet republics) summit in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan today. \n BEIRUT \u00bb The U.S. military said it may have unintentionally struck Syrian troops while carrying out a raid against the Islamic State group today, threatening an already fragile U.S. and Russian-brokered cease-fire that has largely held despite dozens of alleged violations on both sides. \n It marks the first known direct American strike on Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces. The United Nations Security Council scheduled a closed emergency meeting for tonight at Russia's request to discuss the airstrike. \n U.S. Central Command said the strike was immediately halted \"when coalition officials were informed by Russian officials that it was possible the personnel and vehicles targeted were part of the Syrian military.\" \n The Syrian military said the deadly airstrike hit a base in the eastern city of Deir el-Zour that is surrounded by IS, allowing the extremists to advance and overrun Syrian army positions in the area. Russia's military said it was told by the Syrian army that at least 62 soldiers were killed in the air raid and more than 100 wounded. \n The apparently errant strike could deal a crushing blow to the fragile cease-fire that has largely held for five days despite dozens of alleged violations on both sides. The cease-fire, which does not apply to attacks on IS, has already been the subject of disputes between Moscow and Washington, with each accusing the other of failing to fully implement it. \n \"Coalition forces would not intentionally strike a known Syrian military unit,\" the U.S. military statement said. \n The Syrian military said the airstrikes enabled an IS advance on a hill overlooking the air base. It called the strike a \"serious and blatant attack on Syria and its military,\" and \"firm proof of the U.S. support of Daesh,\" using the Arabic acronym for IS. \n A Syrian military spokesman told a briefing early Sunday that the U.S. airstrike destroyed three tanks, three infantry fighting vehicles, four mortars and an anti-aircraft gun, Russia's TASS news agency reported. The unnamed spokesman said the IS advance on the base was stopped after Russian warplanes were called in to hit IS positions. \n Russia called for an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council and demanded \"full and detailed explanations about whether this was deliberate support of the Islamic State or another mistake.\" \n Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was quoted by the state news agency TASS as saying that \"after today's attack on the Syrian army, we come to the terrible conclusion that the White House is defending the Islamic State.\" \n The Syrian Foreign Ministry said it sent an urgent message asking the Security Council to \"condemn the U.S. aggression,\" TASS reported, citing a statement released by Syria's SANA news. The statement claimed five U.S. aircraft took part in the airstrike. \n A senior Obama administration official said the United States has \"relayed our regret\" for the unintentional loss of life of Syrian forces fighting the IS. \n The official says the notification was sent through Russia. The official also saids the U.S. will continue to pursue compliance with the cessation of hostilities as it continues military action against IS and an al-Qaida-affiliated group. The official was not authorized to discuss the notification by name and requested anonymity. \n A Russian Defense Ministry official said Syria has informed them that 62 of its soldiers were killed in the airstrike. Russia has been waging a year-old air campaign on behalf of Assad's forces and closely coordinates with them. \n Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the airstrike near Deir el-Zour airport, held by the government, was conducted by two F-16s and two A-10s. He did not identify the planes' country affiliation, but said they were part of the international coalition. Konashenkov said the planes came from the direction of the Iraqi border, he added. \n He added that if the coalition attack was launched by mistake, the reason for it was a \"stubborn reluctance by the American side to coordinate its action against terrorist groups in Syria with Russia.\" \n IS has repeatedly attacked the government-held air base, which is an isolated enclave deep in extremist-held territory. The government controls the air base and parts of Deir el-Zour city, while IS controls the entire province by the same name. An IS advance in Deir el-Zour would endanger the lives of tens of thousands of civilians living in government-held areas. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Syrian army later recaptured most of the positions it lost to IS. \n The U.S.-led coalition has carried out thousands of airstrikes against IS in Syria and Iraq over the past two years, allowing allied forces on the ground to liberate several towns and cities from the extremist group. Russia also carries out attacks against IS targets, in Deir el-Zour and other parts of Syria. \n \"The coalition will review this strike and the circumstances surrounding it to see if any lessons can be learned,\" the U.S Central Command statement said. \n The cease-fire took effect on Monday, and despite reports of violations, it has largely held. However, aid convoys have been unable to enter rebel-held parts of the northern city of Aleppo \u2014 a key component of the deal. \n Earlier today, Russian President Vladimir Putin questioned the U.S. commitment to cease-fire, suggesting that Washington wasn't prepared to break with \"terrorist elements\" battling Assad's forces. \n Russia has accused Washington of failing to rein in the rebels, and today Putin asked why the United States has insisted on not releasing a written copy of the agreement. \n \"This comes from the problems the U.S. is facing on the Syrian track \u2014 they still cannot separate the so-called healthy part of the opposition from the half-criminal and terrorist elements,\" Putin said during a trip to Kyrgyzstan. \n \"In my opinion, this comes from the desire to keep the combat potential in fighting the legitimate government of Bashar Assad. But this is a very dangerous route.\" \n He appeared to be referring to the Fatah al-Sham Front, an al-Qaida-linked group previously known as the Nusra Front, which is deeply embedded in rebel-held areas and fights alongside more moderate groups. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of the group, condemned the cease-fire agreement in an interview with Al-Jazeera TV aired today. \n Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov echoed Putin's remarks during a phone call with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. Lavrov noted the \"refusal by an array of illegal armed groups to join the cease-fire,\" and Washington's obligation to \"separate units of the moderate opposition from terrorist groupings,\" according to a Foreign Ministry statement. \n Under the cease-fire agreement, the U.S. and Russia would work together to target the Fatah al-Sham Front, as well as IS, while Assad's forces refrain from striking opposition-held areas. \n But Washington has warned Russia that unless aid is delivered to Aleppo, it will not move ahead with the formation of the joint coordination center. \n The U.N. has accused Assad's government of obstructing aid access to the contested city. The Russian military says insurgents have held up the delivery by firing on government positions along the main route leading into besieged, rebel-held districts, in violation of the cease-fire. \n The Syrian government said it has done all that is necessary to facilitate the entry of aid convoys to Aleppo, but that armed groups have failed to withdraw from the supply routes and are committing \"dangerous, provocative acts.\" \n Russia's military said Syrian rebels violated the cease-fire dozens of times over the past day, including with strikes on military and civilian targets in Aleppo. Syrian activists said government forces killed five civilians in separate attacks today. \n Syria's conflict has killed more than 300,000 people and displaced half the country's population since March 2011. \n Associated Press writer Jim Heintz in Moscow and Joseph Krauss in Cairo contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. says it may have struck Syrian troops while targeting IS"}

Sylvia Young, a 19-year police veteran, was ambushed while sitting in her patrol car in west Philadelphia; she was shot a number of times in the arm and protective vest, Ross said. \n \"She didn't hear him say a word, just walked up on her and started firing,\" Ross said. \"She did hear about 15 shots or so, and that's consistent with the scene, where we believe she was struck at least eight times.\" \n Officers hearing the shots pursued the gunman, who then fired into a nearby bar, hitting a security guard in the leg, then grabbed a woman and used her as a shield before shooting her in the leg, Ross said. Moments later, the suspect shot into in a car, hitting a man and a woman in the chest. The woman, who was hit seven times, was pronounced dead just before 2 a.m. today, police said. \n Ross said two police officers and University of Pennsylvania police officer Ed Miller chased the man into an alley, where the suspect was shot and killed.

Duterte suggested in a news conference last month that $1 million had been paid to the militants, but that they continued to hold on to him. The military said today that relentless assaults forced the extremists to release the hostage. \n Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende confirmed Sekkingstad's release and said he was in contact with Dureza. Borge said he was told that Sekkingstad would be likely handed over to the Philippine authorities on Sunday. \n \"We are following the situation closely and are now working together with the Philippine authorities to bring Sekkingstad to safety,\" Brende said in a statement. \"We continue to work on it and we will not rejoice before Sekkingstad is safe and sound with the Philippine authorities.\" \n Sekkingstad fell ill while in captivity, according to a Philippine army officer who helped monitor the kidnapping. \n \"Under the intense pressure of focused military operations, the terrorist kidnap-for-ransom Abu Sayyaf group was constrained to release Sekkingstad, as holding him under custody slows down their continued movement,\" said military spokesman Col.

Ricardo Visaya warned the militants to release their other captives, including a Dutch birdwatcher and Indonesian and Malaysian tugboat crewmen, \"or suffer annihilation.\" \n While Duterte has pursued peace talks with Misuari's group and the larger Moro Islamic Liberation Front, he has ordered the military to destroy the Abu Sayyaf, a smaller but more brutal band that the president says aims to establish an Islamic state or caliphate. \n \"They are no longer hungry for autonomy. They are hungry for a fight to establish a caliphate in Southeast Asia,\" Duterte told troops today, although his predecessors have regarded the militants as a loose collective of bandits. \n Sekkingstad was kidnapped from a marina on southern Samal Island on Sept. 21, 2015, with Canadians John Ridsdel and Robert Hall and Hall's Filipino girlfriend, Marites Flor, sparking a massive land and sea search by Philippine forces. \n The Abu Sayyaf demanded a huge ransom for the release of the foreigners, and released videos in which they threatened the captives in a lush jungle clearing where they displayed Islamic State group-style black flags. \n Ridsdel was beheaded in April and Hall was decapitated in June after ransom deadlines lapsed. When Flor was freed in June, she recounted in horror how the militants rejoiced while watching the beheadings. \n \"It's so painful because I saw them moments before they got beheaded,\" Flor told reporters in June in Davao, where she was flown to meet then President-elect Duterte. \n \"They were watching it and they were happy,\" she said of the militants, adding that she did not witness the killings. \n Government forces launched a major offensive against the Abu Sayyaf after the beheadings of the Canadians sparked condemnations from then-Philippine President Benigno Aquino III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who called on other nations not to pay ransoms if their citizens are abducted to discourage the brutal militants from carrying out more kidnappings. \n The Abu Sayyaf has been blacklisted as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the Philippines for deadly bombings, kidnappings and beheadings. Without any known foreign funding, the extremists have relied on ransom kidnappings, extortion and other acts of banditry, and some commanders have pledged loyalty to the Islamic State group partly in the hope of obtaining funds. \n Associated Press writer Jan M.

{"date": "September 17, 2016", "text": "WPIX NEW YORK \n A screenshot showed the remains of a rubbish bin in which a pipe bomb exploded this morning in Seaside Park, New Jersey. \n SEASIDE PARK, N.J. \u00bb A pipe bomb exploded in a New Jersey shore town today shortly before thousands of runners were to participate in a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors, authorities said. \n No injuries were reported in the blast in Seaside Park around 9:30 a.m. today, said Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutor's office. He said no surrounding structures were damaged. \n The FBI has taken over as the lead agency in the investigation. But officials would not say whether they believe the incident was terror-related or if they suspected participants in the third annual Semper Five run were targeted. \n Brad Cohen, the acting special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Newark, declined to discuss the matter at length during a brief news conference staged this evening. He also declined to take questions from reporters, citing the \"active, ongoing\" investigation. \n The race had been scheduled to start shortly before the blast occurred, but it was delayed due to the large numbers of people registering for the race and reports of an unattended backpack being found. Della Fave noted that if the race had started on time, a \"good number of people\" would have been running past the area where the explosion occurred. \n The race was canceled, and the immediate area was put on lockdown. Several homes near the scene were evacuated as a precaution, though those residents were allowed to return home early tonight. However, authorities said several beaches in the area would remain closed until further notice. \n The pipe bomb was in a plastic garbage can when it exploded, Della Fave said, but the immediate area where the blast occurred was mostly empty at the time. Authorities immediately cleared the boardwalk and beach area, and bomb-sniffing dogs were used to search the area. \n Shortly after the blast occurred, Della Fave told reporters at the scene that preliminary reports said there may have been other devices connected to the pipe bomb, but those devices apparently had not gone off. \n New Jersey State Police said later in the day that bomb technicians \"rendered safe\" items located in a plastic trash can where the explosion occurred; they did not specify what those items were or provide further details, citing the ongoing investigation. They also said there was nothing to reports of another explosive device near the site of the explosion. \n Chad Ruedin, who happened to be walking along the boardwalk when the blast occurred, told News12 New Jersey that when he heard the explosion, he initially thought it was the start of the charity race. But after thinking about it for a minute, Ruedin said he thought to himself \"that was one hell of a start to a race.\" \n Ruedin said he soon saw smoke coming from the garbage can and saw other debris in the area, though he didn't know if those items were parts of the can and/or trash that had been in the receptacle. \n Numerous state and federal law enforcement agencies were involved in the investigation. Attorney General Christopher Porrino and Col. Rick Fuentes, superintendent of the state police, briefed Gov. Chris Christie on the investigation. \n \"Working with the FBI and ATF, we are taking every step to ensure the safety of the public and to determine who was responsible for this explosion, which occurred at a time when runners in this charity race could have been in harm's way,\" Porrino said in a statement. \"We are grateful that nobody was injured, but this is a serious act of violence against the people of New Jersey. We will not rest until we find the person or persons responsible.\" \n It wasn't clear when the boardwalk and beach would reopen. Some other community events went on as planned in nearby towns tonight, though officials said security at those sites had been stepped up in the wake of the blast. \n It wasn't immediately clear if the charity race would be rescheduled. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pipe bomb explodes before Marines charity run in New Jersey; no injuries"}

My team got me there. I ran it into the end zone. We scored and won,\" Braun said in a statement after the jump. \n Scott Truax, the designer of the rocket, told the Idaho Statesman that after Braun got the OK to launch he didn't hesitate. \n \"He was gone in a cloud of steam and I couldn't see anything until just before he pulled his chutes,\" Truax said. \n Braun has said the rocket was identical to the model Knievel used for his failed canyon attempt on Sept. 8, 1974. Knievel landed at the bottom of the canyon when his parachute prematurely deployed partway across the canyon, but walked away with only minor injuries. The spot where Knievel jumped was 1,600 feet wide. \n Braun hoped his effort would prove that Knievel could have made it across the canyon if his parachute had deployed at the correct time. \n Before the jump, the 54-year-old Braun said he was optimistic he would make it across the canyon. \n \"I wouldn't be doing this if I thought it couldn't be done,\" he said. \n Still, he had prepared for the worst in the days before the stunt, asking his young son to one day walk his sisters down the aisle at their wedding if Braun died in his attempt. \n Months of testing was performed on the rocket designed by Scott Truax, whose father constructed the original \"X2 Skycycle\" for Knievel. \n Truax followed his father's blueprints down to the last bolt and deviated only by updating the parachute system. \n Braun had trouble finding corporate sponsors for the stunt, and said he spent about $1.5 million of his own money on the jump. \n He looked at the stunt as a way to pay homage to Knievel, who inspired him to become a stuntman. \n \"I like to say I'm not doing something that Evel Knievel couldn't do,\" he told the Statesman before making the jump. \"I'm simply finishing out his dream. How many people get to finish the dream of their hero?\" \n Not all in the southern Idaho town of Twin Falls have such fond memories of Knievel. Many residents remember Knievel's promise of a weeklong festival complete with celebrities and a golf tournament. \n Knievel's attempt drew plenty of spectators, and the resultant partying, fighting and mischief upset locals. The daredevil was later accused of leaving town without paying debts to area businesses. \n But the mystique of Knievel's failed stunt has lived on, with would-be daredevils showing up every decade or so to propose similar jumps. Knievel's son Robbie visited Twin Falls in the 1990s and in 2010 to float the idea of a possible jump, though it never came to fruition. \n Braun appears to have been the first to actually try the stunt since Knievel's attempt. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Daredevil pilots rocket over Idaho canyon in Evel Knievel redo"}

{"date": "September 17, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n ZSun-nee Miller-Matema posed for a portrait at Mount Vernon, the plantation home of former U.S. President George Washington, in Alexandria, Va., on July 18. Miller-Matema is a descendent of Caroline Branham, one of George Washington's slaves who served as former first lady Martha Washington's personal maid. \n ARLINGTON, Va. \u00bb George Washington's adopted son was a bit of a ne'er-do-well by most accounts, including those of Washington himself, who wrote about his frustrations with the boy they called \"Wash.\" \n \"From his infancy, I have discovered an almost unconquerable disposition to indolence in everything that did not tend to his amusements,\" the founding father wrote. \n At the time, George Washington Parke Custis was 16 and attending Princeton, one of several schools he bounced in and out of. Before long, he was back home at Mount Vernon, where he would be accused of fathering children with slaves. \n Two centuries later, the National Park Service and the nonprofit that runs Washington's Mount Vernon estate are concluding that the rumors were true: In separate exhibits, they show that the first family's family tree has been biracial from its earliest branches. \n \"There is no more pushing this history to the side,\" said Matthew Penrod, a National Park Service ranger and programs manager at Arlington House, where the lives of the Washingtons, their slaves and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee all converged. \n President George Washington had no direct descendants, and his wife Martha Custis was a widow when they married, but he adopted Martha's grandchildren \u2014 \"Wash\" and his sister \"Nellie\" \u2014 and raised them on his Mount Vernon estate. \n Parke Custis married Mary Fitzhugh in 1804, and they had one daughter who survived into adulthood, Mary Anna Randolph Custis. In 1831, she married her third cousin \u2014 Lee, who then served as a U.S. Army lieutenant. \n Outside the marriage, Parke Custis likely fathered children with two of his stepfather's slaves: Arianna Carter, and Caroline Branham, according to the exhibits at Arlington House and Mount Vernon. \n The first official acknowledgment came in June when the Park Service re-enacted the 1821 wedding of Maria Carter to Charles Syphax at Arlington House, the hilltop mansion overlooking the capital that Custis built (and Lee later managed) as a shrine to his adoptive stepfather. A new family tree, unveiled at the re-enactment, lists the bride's parents as Parke Custis and Arianna Carter. \n \"We fully recognize that the first family of this country was much more than what it appeared on the surface,\" Penrod said at the ceremony. \n The privately run Mount Vernon estate explores this slave history in \"Lives Bound Together,\" an exhibition opening this year that acknowledges that Parke Custis also likely fathered a girl named Lucy with slave Caroline Branham. \n Tour guides were hardly this frank when Penrod started at Arlington House 26 years ago. Staffers were told to describe slave dwellings as \"servants' quarters,\" and \"the focus was on Lee, to honor him and show him in the most positive light,\" Penrod said. \n He said no new, definitive evidence has surfaced to prove Parke Custis fathered girls with slaves; rather, the recognition reflects a growing sense that African-American history cannot be disregarded and that Arlington House represents more than Lee's legacy, he said. \n Scientific proof would require matching the DNA of Carter and Branham descendants to the progeny of his daughter and the Confederate general, because the Parke Custis line runs exclusively through the offspring of his daughter and Robert E. Lee. \n Stephen Hammond of Reston, a Syphax descendant, has researched his family tree extensively. He said the Park Service's recognition of the Custis' paternity is gratifying. \"It's become a passion of mine, figuring out where we fit in American history,\" Hammond said. \n Hammond said he and his cousins have yet to approach the Lee descendants to gauge their interest in genetic tests, and it's not clear how they feel about the official recognition \u2014 several didn't respond to Associated Press requests for comment. \n Some family records are kept at Robert E. Lee's birthplace, Stratford Hall, but research director Judy Hynson said she knows of none that acknowledge Parke Custis fathered slaves. \n \"That's not something you would write down in your family Bible,\" Hynson said. \n The circumstantial evidence includes the Carter-Syphax wedding in Arlington House \u2014 an unusual honor for slaves \u2014 and the fact that Parke Custis not only freed Maria Syphax and her sons before the Civil War, but set aside 17 acres on the estate for her. \n Indeed, after Mount Vernon was seized by Union forces, an act of Congress ensured that land was returned to Maria Syphax's family. New York Sen. Ira Harris said then that Washington's adopted son had a special interest in her \u2014 \"something perhaps akin to a paternal instinct.\" \n Oral histories also argue for shared bloodlines. \n Maria Carter's descendants know, for example, that her name was pronounced \"Ma-RYE-eh,\" not \"Ma-REE-uh,\" said Donna Kunkel of Los Angeles, who portrayed her ancestor at the re-enactment. \n \"As a kid I would always tell people I was related to George Washington, but no one would believe me,\" she said. \n Branham descendants include ZSun-nee Miller-Matema of Hagerstown, Md., who said \"my aunt old me that if the truth of our family was known, it would topple the first families of Virginia.\" \n She said she discovered her truth by happenstance in the 1990s, when she spotted a portrait with a family resemblance while researching at the Alexandria Black History Museum for a stage production. A museum staffer soon sat her down with records. Eventually, she traced her ancestry to Caroline Branham, who appears in documents written in the first president's own hand. \n \"I just couldn't believe it,\" she said. \"Gen. Washington was taking notes on my Caroline?\" \n As slaves, the women could not consent to the sexual advances of the plantation owner's adopted son, but Kunkel said she tries not to think of the acts as rape. \n \"I try to focus on the outcome. He treated Maria with respect after the fact,\" she said. \n Incorporating these family histories into the nation's shared story is particularly important at a time of renewed racial tension, Miller-Matema said. \n \"We're all so much a part of each other,\" she said. \"It just makes no sense any more to be a house divided.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Historic recognition: George Washington's family tree is biracial"}

{"date": "September 17, 2016", "text": "AP PHOTO/CHARLES DHARAPAK, FILE \n In this Nov. 21, 2013 file photo reviewed by the U.S. military, dawn arrives at the now closed Camp X-Ray, which was used as the first detention facility for al-Qaida and Taliban militants who were captured after the Sept. 11 attacks, at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. \n MIAMI \u00bb An accused al-Qaida bomb-maker who went to college in Arizona told military officials at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that he believed an unnamed member of the Saudi royal family was part of an effort to recruit him for violent extremist acts before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to a newly released transcript. \n Ghassan Abdallah al-Sharbi said a religious figure in Saudi Arabia used the term \"your highness\" during a telephone conversation with a man, just before urging al-Sharbi to return to the U.S. and take part in a plot against the U.S. that would involve learning to fly a plane. \n The Sept. 11 commission found there was no evidence to indicate that the Saudi government as an institution or Saudi senior officials individually had supported the attacks, and the kingdom's government has consistently denied it had any role in the plot. \n It was early 2001, and al-Sharbi had only recently returned from the United States, where he had taken some flight school courses in Phoenix with two men who would become hijackers in the 9/11 attacks. \n Al-Sharbi described the conversation in June to the Periodic Review Board, which assesses whether Guantanamo prisoners can be released. The Pentagon on Thursday posted a transcript, with parts blacked out, on the website of the board, which includes representatives from six U.S. agencies and departments. \n The statement is convoluted and lacks important details, such as whether the \"religious figure\" might be close to any Saudi officials. It does not indicate who the Saudi royal might be. The term can be used for thousands of members of the Saudi royal family; al-Sharbi did not say he met the man. \n Al-Sharbi also appears to be struggling with illness. He tells the board he had just come from the detainee hospital, is \"really exhausted, and nauseous and lethargic,\" and uses what is described as a \"manual breathing device.\" \n His statement adds to a list of suggestive but hardly definitive clues about possible involvement by members of the Saudi establishment in the Sept. 11 attacks, in which 17 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi. \n The Saudi Embassy in Washington declined to comment on the al-Sharbi transcript. In the past, the Saudis have pointed to the 9/11 Commission, FBI investigations and other probes that found no Saudi government or royal family involvement in the attacks. \n Those denials have not ended speculation about possible Saudi involvement. Congress recently approved legislation that would allow 9/11 families to sue the kingdom for any role in the plot. \n Al-Sharbi says he listened as the \"religious figure\" spoke to the man \u2014 whom al-Sharbi believes was a royal \u2014 as they discussed al-Sharbi's qualifications for returning to the U.S. for jihad. \"I remember, 'yes, your highness, yes your highness,' and he was talking to him about me,\" al-Sharbi said. \n Saudi Arabia has battled with al-Qaida over the years, but there have been consistent allegations, including by Guantanamo prisoners, of financial and other support by officials and members of the royal family for al-Qaida-linked charities, said terrorism consultant Evan Kohlmann, who reviewed the 28-page transcript at the request of The Associated Press. \n \"The Saudi royal family is quite large and diverse, and it is no secret that various members were once reputed for their patronage of Islamist causes and charities,\" Kohlmann said. \"In that light, it is hardly ridiculous that al-Sharbi would have encountered a Saudi royal who sympathized with al-Qaida and Osama Bin Laden.\" Bin Laden was a Saudi citizen. \n The prisoner's candor about his health also may add to what is otherwise a plausible allegation, said Max Abrahms, an assistant political science professor at Northeastern University who studies terrorism. Abrahms also reviewed the transcript. \n \"He is very open that he is really struggling physically, that he's exhausted, that he has been under serious medication,\" Abrahms said. \"But on the other hand it lends additional credibility to his statement because it's not very deliberate and not memorized.\" \n A Guantanamo spokesman, Navy Capt. John Filostrat, said the military does not disclose details about detainees' health. \"Overall, the general health of detainees is good,\" he said. \n Al-Sharbi attended Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona, from 1999-2000, according to the review board website. \n In the transcript, the prisoner described living with various Americans, including a Phoenix police officer, in Arizona and California before returning to Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2000. \n After telling the \"religious figure\" that he had some practice on a flight simulator and could learn to fly more easily than others, al-Sharbi says he agreed to return to the U.S and they began to discuss details. But al-Sharbi never went, for reasons that are unclear in the transcript. \n The review board profile says al-Sharbi went to Afghanistan in the summer of 2001, trained with al-Qaida and then went to Pakistan, where he learned how to make remote-controlled explosive devices and teach the skill to others. He was captured there in a house with Abu Zubaydah, whom the U.S. has called an al-Qaida \"facilitator.\" He, too, is confined at Guantanamo. \n When captured, the FBI found a buried a cache of documents nearby, including an envelope from the Saudi Embassy in Washington that contained al-Sharbi's flight certificate, according to a document known as File 17, which was declassified earlier this year and names people the hijackers were in contact with in the United States before the attacks, including diplomats of the kingdom. \n In July, the review board declined to approve his release from Guantanamo, where he is among 61 prisoners still held. \n ___ \n Associated Press writer Deb Riechmann in Washington contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Guantanamo prisoner says Saudi 'royal' involved in terrorism"}
