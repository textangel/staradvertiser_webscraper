Jeffrey Tambor's trophy as top comedy actor for \"Transparent\" also was his second. \n But the top drama acting trophies were far from predictable: Rami Malek of \"Mr. Robot\" and Tatiana Maslany of \"Orphan Black\" were the winners, both overcoming heavyweight competition. \n \"Oh, my God. Please tell me you're seeing this too,\" said a stunned Malek, who plays an emotionally troubled engineer caught up in a dangerous hacking conspiracy. \n \"Games of Thrones,\" the fantasy saga based on George R.R. Martin's novels, received a total of 12 awards Sunday and at last weekend's technical arts ceremony for a cumulative 38, besting \"Frasier\" by one to claim most prime-time series awards ever. \n The Emmys proved more adroit than the Oscars at recognizing and honoring diversity in Hollywood's top ranks, with trophies going to minority actors and behind-the-scenes artists including writers Aziz Ansari and Alan Yang of \"Master of None.\" \n But Viola Davis of \"How to Get Away with Murder\" failed to repeat her 2015 best drama actress win, the first for a woman of color. \n Tambor, who plays a transgender character on \"Transparent,\" called on Hollywood to make him the last non-transgender actor to get such a role. \n A shaking Louis-Dreyfus ended her speech by dedicating the trophy to her father, who she said died Friday. Before that, she honed in on GOP contender Donald Trump's campaign. \n \"I'd also like to take this opportunity to personally apologize for the current political climate,\" she said. \"I think that 'Veep' has torn down the wall between comedy and politics. Our show started out as a political satire but it now feels more like a sobering documentary.\" \n She promised to \"rebuild that wall and make Mexico pay for it.\" \n Her victory gave her six best comedy wins \u2014 five for \"Veep,\" one for \"The New Adventures of Old Christine\" \u2014 and broke her tie with Candice Bergen and Mary Tyler Moore. \n Maggie Smith was honored as best supporting actress in a drama series for the final season of \"Downton Abbey.\" It was her third win for playing the formidable dowager. As has become her custom, she didn't attend the ceremony. After Smith's win, Kimmel said her Emmy would not be mailed to her but would be kept in the Microsoft Theater's Lost and Found until she shows up to claim it. \n Ben Mendelsohn of \"Bloodline\" won as best supporting drama actor and also was a no-show. \n John Oliver captured the top variety talk series award for \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,\" besting competitors including Jerry Seinfeld and host Jimmy Kimmel \u2014 who received barbed consolation on stage from Matt Damon, his longtime faux nemesis. The loss \"makes a lot of sense,\" Damon said. \n \"The People v. O.J. Simpson,\" which earned the second-highest number of nominations, converted five to trophies Sunday. \n The dramatic retelling of the football star's murder trial was honored as best limited series and writing, and earned awards for stars Courtney B. Vance, Sterling K. Brown and Sarah Paulson. \n Paulson, who played prosecutor Marcia Clark, brought her as a guest and singled her out from the stage. \n Clark was not the \"the two-dimensional cardboard cutout that I saw on the news\" but a \"whip-smart\" woman dedicated to justice for the case's victims, Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman. \n Regina King claimed the award for supporting actress in a limited series for \"American Crime,\" her second trophy for the program. \n Louie Anderson was honored as best supporting actor in a comedy series for his portrayal of a loving but tough mom in \"Baskets.\" \n \"Mom, we did it!,\" Anderson shouted, hoisting his trophy and dedicating the award to his late mother, Ora Zella Anderson. \"I have not always been a good man but I play one hell of a woman.\" \n \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Kate McKinnon won the trophy for best supporting actress in a comedy for, officially, playing various characters. But she knew who to credit. \n \"Thank you, Ellen DeGeneres, thank you, Hillary Clinton,\" she said, naming two of the famous people she's caricatured on the show. \n The Democratic presidential contender responded quickly with a tweet: \"Congratulations on your Emmy, Kate! Big fan of yours, too.\" \n The ceremony started out with a political edge. In a video bit, Jimmy Kimmel was shown trying to get to the ceremony and encountering former GOP presidential contender Jeb Bush as a limo driver. \n \"Did you know you could make $12 an hour working for Uber?\" a game Bush said, smiling. He advised Kimmel that \"if you run a positive campaign, the voters will ultimately make the right choice\"\u2014 then told Kimmel curtly it was a joke. \n In his opening monologue, the host said he was holding \"Celebrity Apprentice\" producer Mark Burnett responsible for the \"Donald Trump phenomenon.\" \n In an attempt at comedy that fell flat, the ceremony announcer indicated that Bill Cosby would be taking the stage. After an awkward silence, Kimmel said it was a joke \u2014 the TV star embroiled in decades-old accusations of sexual assault wasn't invited. \n A pair of key changes made by the TV academy may have affected the outcomes in Sunday's 27 categories. It revised how votes are cast and counted, switching from a ranking and points system to letting voters simply check off their top choice. That sharpened the selection process and might have affected past winners who managed to collect enough second-place votes to overcome the competition. \n In another revision, this one implemented last year, voting was expanded from blue-ribbon panels to \u2014 depending on the award \u2014 giving substantially more or all of the academy's 20,000-plus members the chance to vote for finalists. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'Game of Thrones,' 'Veep' take top honors at Emmys"}

State and federal lawmakers promised to improve conditions for hundreds of foreign workers confined to boats in Hawaii's commercial fishing fleet for years without basic labor protections. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Fishermen stand on a boat at Pier 38 on Wednesday. State and federal lawmakers promised to improve conditions for hundreds of foreign workers confined to boats in Hawaii's commercial fishing fleet for years without basic labor protections. \n State and federal lawmakers are promising to improve conditions for hundreds of foreign fishermen working in Hawaii's commercial fleet, and at least one company has already stopped buying fish from the boats following an Associated Press investigation that found the men have been confined to vessels for years without basic labor protections. \n Whole Foods has halted buying seafood caught by foreign crew until it's clear the men are treated fairly. Today, the Hawaii Seafood Council said that starting Oct. 1, the Honolulu Fish Auction will sell fish only from boats that have adopted a new, standardized contract aimed at assuring no forced labor exists on board. \n The AP report found commercial fishing boats in Honolulu were crewed by men from impoverished Southeast Asia and Pacific Island nations who catch prized swordfish, ahi tuna and other seafood sold at markets and upscale restaurants across the country. A legal loophole allows them to work on the American-owned, American-flagged boats without visas as long as they don't set foot on shore. The system is facilitated by the U.S. Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection. \n While many men appreciate the jobs, which pay better than they could get back home, the report revealed instances of human trafficking, tuberculosis and food shortages. It also found some fishermen being forced to defecate in buckets, suffering running sores from bed bugs and being paid as little as 70 cents an hour. \n On Capitol Hill, Hawaii's congressional delegation \u2014 U.S. Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz along with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, all Democrats \u2014 said they were exploring legislative solutions after being startled by the findings about the state's $110 million industry, which ranks fifth among the country's highest-grossing fisheries. \n \"It is completely unacceptable that the inhumane treatment of any workers, foreign or not, is legal under U.S. federal law,\" Hirono said in a statement. \n In Honolulu, state Rep. Kaniela Ing, chair of the Ocean, Marine Resources and Hawaiian Affairs committee, asked state Attorney General Doug Chin to weigh in on whether boat owners should be regulated under Hawaii rules. If so, Ing said there would likely be an injunction ordered to halt labor or business violations. If not, he said he would introduce legislation to protect the workers, who labor up to 22 hours a day. \n \"That loophole doesn't mean it's OK to treat them like slaves,\" Ing said. \n Chin said he was reviewing the request. \n The Hawaii report is part of the AP's ongoing investigation into human trafficking and labor abuse in the global seafood industry. Last year, reporters found some fishermen locked in a cage on the remote Indonesian island of Benjina . Others were buried under fake names. Their catch was traced to the United States, and the reporting led to more than 2,000 slaves being freed. \n Federal law requires that U.S. citizens make up 75 percent of the crew on most commercial fishing vessels in America; the Hawaiian fleet has an exemption carved out years ago, largely by lawmakers no longer in office. \n \"We always would want workers to have decent working conditions,\" said Gov. David Ige. He added that the AP report \"highlighted how sometimes people fall in a loophole and they don't get the full protections of labor laws that most of us enjoy.\" \n After the story was published, Hawaiian boat owners and seafood sellers quickly formed a task force which they said was creating a universal contract. They said they are working with buyers and government officials. \n \"I am confident that through this process we will ferret out any vessel from the fleet that is involved in forced labor, labor abuse or substandard working conditions and treatment of the crew,\" said John Kaneko of the Hawaii Seafood Council. \n The investigation found the fishermen are paid as little as $350 a month, but many also get small bonuses, lifting their monthly pay to $500 or $600. A lucky few earn a percentage of the catch, making it possible to triple their wages. \n Most of the approximately 700 crewmembers in the Hawaii fleet are from the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam and the tiny Pacific island nation of Kiribati. Because they have no visas, they aren't allowed to fly into the country, and are instead picked up at foreign ports and brought to Honolulu by boat. \n Some crewmembers are from Micronesia and the Marshall Islands and carry green cards because of a special relationship with the U.S. A few are locals from Hawaii as well. They are allowed to leave the docks when they come in after their three-week fishing trips, but the rest are detained on board by captains who are legally required to keep their passports. Neither U.S. Customs nor the boat association could provide a detailed breakdown of crew nationalities. \n The boats dock occasionally at ports along the West Coast, including San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, but mainly at Piers 17 and 38 in Honolulu. Their catch ends up at eateries and seafood counters across the country, from Roy's restaurants to markets like Whole Foods and Costco. Companies that responded condemned labor abuse and said they would investigate. \n Whole Foods is suspending sales from boats with foreign crew, but will continue to buy seafood from \"local, day-boat fishermen with proven fair labor practices,\" such as vessels with just one or two workers, often friends or relatives, said spokeswoman McKinzey Crossland. \n Environmental, labor and anti-trafficking advocates called for reform. \n Kris Coffield, executive director of the Honolulu-based anti-trafficking group IMUAlliance, said he's been receiving complaints from foreign fishermen for the past three or four years. \n \"Among the fishermen we've worked with, there are questions about whether there's debt bondage going on,\" he said. To get their jobs, some workers have to pay exorbitant fees to agencies that they will never be able to pay back, Coffield said. \n Debt bondage is a form of modern-day slavery by the State Department's definition. \n In a statement, the Washington, D.C.-based Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking called for the gaps in law and policy to be closed. \n \"Until the United States puts its own house in order,\" it said, \"it will be difficult to convince other governments to seriously combat modern slavery in their own countries.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hawaii lawmakers promise reform for confined fishermen"}

{"date": "September 18, 2016", "text": "CHICAGO \u00bb The American Academy of Pediatrics has strengthened its warnings about prescribing codeine for children because of reports of deaths and risks for dangerous side effects including breathing problems.  \n The academy's advice, published in a report Monday in its medical journal, Pediatrics , mirrors warnings from the Food and Drug Administration about using codeine for kids' coughs or pain. \n Studies suggest it is still commonly prescribed by doctors and dentists despite the risks and lack of evidence that it works to relieve coughs. \n Doctors and parents should choose another remedy when possible, including acetaminophen and ibuprofen for pain and simple remedies such as ice or popsicles after tonsillectomies, said Dr. Charles Cote, a Boston anesthesiologist and co-author of the report. \n \"Maybe a little pain is better than the alternative,\" he said. \n THE DRUG  \n Codeine is an opiate drug once commonly used in over-the-counter cough syrups and as a painkiller, particularly after surgery. But the report notes that a rare genetic variation makes some people metabolize it too quickly, potentially resulting in excessive sleepiness and difficulty breathing. A different genetic variation makes the drug ineffective for pain relief in as many as a third of patients. \n It is available by prescription, including in cough syrup sold in pharmacies in 28 states, Cote said. \n THE RISKS  \n Codeine has often been prescribed for pain relief after tonsillectomies but the FDA has advised against this use. These operations are sometimes recommended to treat enlarged tonsils that cause sleep apnea \u2014 a common condition involving breathing pauses while sleeping. The condition has been linked with obesity and Cote said children with sleep apnea are particularly vulnerable to codeine-related breathing difficulties. \n The academy report cites an FDA review that found 21 codeine-related deaths in children younger than 12 and 64 cases of severe breathing problems over five decades. \n THE ADVICE  \n Better education of parents and doctors is needed, along with additional research on risks and benefits of codeine and non-opioid painkillers for children, the report says. \n A previous academy report highlighted codeine's risks and lack of benefit in treating coughs. The new report is more comprehensive, adding concerns about using codeine for pain along with information on deaths. \n Opioid drug safety issues and the need for better opioid research in children were among topics raised last week at a two-day FDA advisory committee meeting. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "MDs strengthen advice against codeine for kids' coughs, pain"}

Her father, Bruce Fortner, is a black pastor, and her mother, Florencia Velasco Fortner, is a Mexican immigrant who heads a nonprofit. \n DALLAS \u00bb When Gloria Fortner was a little girl, a classmate of black and white parentage claimed to be a \"better mix\" than her. It was a jarring experience \u2014 one that has stayed lodged in her mind over the years. \n But now, Gloria, the daughter of a black pastor and a Mexican immigrant who heads a nonprofit, said she's forgiven if not forgotten. \n \"It's OK,\" the lanky violinist said on a recent afternoon. \"We follow each other on Instagram now, so it's fine.\" \n Gloria is 13. \n And she doesn't see herself as \"mixed up\" or \"half\" anything. Rather, the eighth-grader views herself as equally of two cultures \u2014 both of which she values deeply. \n \"I consider myself as African-American and also Mexican and also a little Native American?\" she said, looking toward her mother for a nod. \"Nothing more, nothing less.\" \n The Lancaster teen is one of a growing number of Americans who are navigating a shifting racial middle ground as the country's white population ages and interracial coupling becomes more common. Since 1980, for instance, the percentage of marriages between spouses of different races has almost quadrupled. \n Those changing demographics \u2014 which are even more marked in rapidly diversifying Texas \u2014 demand a more nuanced understanding of race and ethnicity. \n Discussions have taken on a heightened sense of urgency as disproportionate police violence against black people has brought racial tensions to the foreground \u2014 tensions long simmering underneath broader debates about poverty and stubborn housing segregation. \n The idea of race as a single box you check on a form is disappearing, said Carolyn Liebler, who has done extensive work with census data as a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota's Minnesota population center. \n \"I'm a white person, and all of my ancestors are white, from northwest Europe,\" she said. \"People like me founded the system, and we don't imagine that there could be a complication because it's outside the realm of experience.\" \n But that complexity can be a good thing. \n \"It's better to have a more complicated view because the world is complicated,\" Liebler said, \"and what we're trying to do is understand the world.\" \n Race, according to sociologists and demographers, isn't so much a scientifically fixed trait as it is a set of experiences: a complicated, evolving puzzle that fits together the way you see yourself and the way others see you, all set against the backdrop of your place within a fraught history. \n U.S. Census Bureau officials say the country's increasing diversity has prompted the agency's most significant review yet of the way it asks Americans about their race and ethnicity. \n \"The Census Bureau is continually researching methods to improve our data on race and ethnicity so that we can provide our country with important information that reflects our growing racial and ethnic diversity and the complexity of our myriad of American experiences,\" a Census Bureau official said in a statement. \n Recommendations from that research will shape the wording on the 2020 survey, which officials hope will lead more people to an accurate description of their ethnicity \u2014 not just \"some other race.\" \n Rachel Marks, a senior analyst for the agency's ethnicity and ancestry branch, put it another way: \"Does this (wording) help people find themselves better?\" \n In particular, Marks said, people of Middle Eastern or North African descent haven't been well-represented in government data. Currently, she said, the federal government considers them white. The agency has also researched whether it makes sense to have two separate questions about ethnicity and Hispanic origin. \n \u2014\u2014 \n In 1790, the first census grouped people into three racial categories: free white males and females, all other free persons and slaves. \n Since then, changes to the race and ethnicity question have coincided with various waves of immigration. \n \"Chinese\" made its first appearance as a racial category on the 1860 survey, but only in California. \n \"Hindu\" was listed as a racial category in 1920, 1930 and 1940, before it was removed. It was the only time a religion has appeared as an option in the race and ethnicity question. \n The Census Bureau first allowed people to pick more than one race to describe themselves in 2000. \n All those changes highlight the fuzziness of race as a concept. Liebler's research shows that it may be more accurate to track racial identity as fluid and shifting. \n \"Demographers already have crazy complicated (statistical) models: You have everyone's life story, of being single, dating or cohabitating, getting married and getting divorced, and then you take those life stories and look for patterns,\" she said. \"Is it a problem to have a fluctuating identity?\" \n The Pew Research Center reported that as many as 6.2 percent of census respondents picked \"some other race\" in the 2010 census, which means millions of people are essentially unaccounted for in America's ethnic tableau. \n And more than 10 million Americans changed which race or ethnicity boxes they picked between their 2000 and 2010 census forms, according to an analysis of 168 million census forms that Liebler worked on with the Census Bureau. \n Jenifer Bratter, a sociologist at Rice University, said watching how Latinos identify themselves in Texas as they become the majority can serve as a microcosm for the rest of the country's demographic trends. \n \"Understanding mixed identity will only enhance our understanding of that group \u2014 how the expansion of (the Hispanic origin group) is blurring as opposed to competing with the non-Hispanic white population,\" she said. \n Still \u2014 speaking days after a peaceful Black Lives Matter march in Dallas was transformed into a killing ground by a black military veteran who targeted white police officers \u2014 Bratter said she doesn't have high hopes for some kind of utopian color-blind, post-racial society. \n \"If (that) is any indication, no,\" she said. \"The relevance of these categories occurs against the backdrop of the relevance of race in daily life, and as long as it continues to be \u2026 experienced as a divide, with different access to resources, these categories are always going to have meaning.\" \n Florencia Velasco Fortner and Bruce Fortner, Gloria's parents, are far from wide-eyed idealists when it comes to racial inequality, though they both said they have hope things will improve.  \n They met as community organizers in Dallas, and both have continued to work as community advocates. \n She was born in Mexico and moved to Texas from El Monte, Calif., a heavily Latino enclave outside of Los Angeles. He grew up in New Orleans. \n When Florencia first met Bruce's mother, she had two questions: \n \"She said, 'Boy, have you checked her ID?' because I looked really young,\" Florencia recalled. \"And the second question \u2026 \" \n \"Is she white?\" Bruce finished the story. His mother just hadn't met many Latinos. \n When they were married, a minister told Bruce that by marrying Florencia, \"you'll turn your back on the black church.\" \n Florencia said that gave her pause. \n \"I knew how passionate he was about the black church and his ministry,\" she said. \n \"He was wrong, so we just moved on,\" Bruce said. \n He said that \"inevitably\" those points of community friction will lessen, just as they have in his own life. \n He and his mother-in-law now end their conversations by joking: \"Florencia loca.\" And his wife has settled into her role as \"first lady\" of a Baptist church in South Dallas, even though she's often the only non-African-American in the room. \n \"That's the question \u2026 How have we been able to make this work?\" Bruce said, sitting across from his wife and daughter in their sunlit living room. \"I think foremost, we came in with an open mind to each other's culture and allowed ourselves to be transformed by that.\" \n Gloria fidgeted a little on the couch, stifling giggles while her parents reminisced about their relationship. She'd heard a lot of the stories before. \n For the most part, Gloria said, she's proud of her background and it's made her more aware of other people's struggles. When her family visited New Orleans, her dad recalled, she wanted to give money to everyone who asked. \n At Gloria's largely Latino school, though, conversations about ethnicity often get rolled in with the everyday anxieties that come with being a teenage girl. \n Her classmates, Gloria said, \"have a strict way of how they see beauty: you're lighter skinned, and you're thick \u2014 if you're not like that you're not hot; you're just kind of there.\" \n \"You can be not hot for a little while longer. I'm OK with that,\" her dad cut in with a chuckle. \n Gloria said she hopes that someday, no one will think it's \"weird\" that her dad is black and her mom is Latina. \n \"Because they fell in love and they had me, and that's basically all you need to know about me.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 The Dallas Morning News  \n ", "author": "By Jill Cowan The Dallas Morning News", "title": "Census racial categories aren't so black and white"}

Indonesian forest fires that choked a swath of Southeast Asia with a smoky haze for weeks in 2015 may have caused more than 100,000 premature deaths, according to new research that will add to pressure on Indonesia's government to tackle the annual crisis. \n JAKARTA, Indonesia \u00bb Indonesian forest fires that choked a swath of Southeast Asia with a smoky haze for weeks last year may have caused more than 100,000 premature deaths, according to new research that will add to pressure on Indonesia's government to tackle the annual crisis. \n The study by scientists from Harvard University and Columbia University to be published in the journal Environmental Research Letters is being welcomed by other researchers and Indonesia's medical profession as an advance in quantifying the suspected serious public health effects of the fires, which are mostly set to clear land for farming. The number of deaths is an estimate derived from a complex analysis that has not yet been validated by analysis of official data on mortality. \n The research has implications for land-use practices and Indonesia's vast pulp and paper industry. The researchers showed that peatlands within timber concessions, and peatlands overall, were a much bigger proportion of the fires observed by satellite than in 2006, which was another particularly bad year for haze. The researchers surmise that draining of the peatlands to prepare them for pulpwood plantations and other uses made them more vulnerable to fires. \n The estimate of premature deaths linked to respiratory illness that covers Indonesia and its neighbors Singapore and Malaysia dwarves Indonesia's official toll of 19 that included deaths from illness and the deaths of firefighters. However, the possible scale of serious heath consequences was indicated by a statement from the country's disaster management agency in October that said more than 43 million Indonesians were exposed to smoke from the fires and half a million suffered acute respiratory infections. \n The study considered only the health impact on adults and restricts itself to the effects of health-threatening fine particulate matter, often referred to as PM2.5, rather than all toxins that would be in the smoke from burning peatlands and forests. The bulk of the estimated deaths are in Indonesia, by far the most populous of the three countries and the country with the biggest land area affected by haze. \n The fires from July to October last year in southern Sumatra and the Indonesian part of Borneo were the worst since 1997 and exacerbated by El Nino dry conditions. About 261,000 hectares of land burned. Some of the fires started accidently but many were deliberately set by companies and villagers to clear land for plantations and agriculture. \n Rajasekhar Bala, an environmental engineering expert at the National University of Singapore, one of five experts who reviewed the paper for The Associated Press and were not involved in the research, said the study is preliminary and involved a \"very challenging\" task of analyzing the sources and spread of fine particulate matter over several countries and a lengthy time frame. \n Even with caveats, it should serve as a \"wake-up call\" for firm action in Indonesia to curb peatland and forest fires and for regional cooperation to deal with the fallout on public health, he said. \n \"Air pollution, especially that caused by atmospheric fine particles, has grave implications for human health,\" he said. \n Frank Murray, an associate professor of environment science at Australia's Murdoch University, said the death estimates are not \"precise health outcomes\" but their overall scale should trigger intensified efforts to deal with the crisis. The study is a major contribution to addressing an international problem, he said. \n The study finds there is a high statistical probability that premature deaths ranged between 26,300 and 174,300. Its main estimate of 100,300 deaths is the average of those two figures. It predicts 91,600 deaths in Indonesia, another 6,500 in Malaysia and 2,200 in Singapore. \n The researchers involved in the study say the model they developed can be combined with satellite observations to analyze the haze in close to real time. That gives it the potential to be used to direct fire-fighting efforts in a way that reduces the amount of illness caused, they say. \n The annual fires have strained relations between Indonesia and its wealthier neighbors Singapore and Malaysia, who are at the mercy of winds that carry the haze into their territory from Sumatra. \n But the brunt of the crisis is faced by millions of Indonesians in Sumatra and Kalimantan, many of them poor and with little or no means to protect themselves from the blanket of smoke. \n \"Particles penetrate indoors, and housing in Indonesia is very well ventilated, so I don't think there is any avertive behavior that people there could have taken that would have been effective,\" said Joel Schwartz, an air pollution epidemiologist at Harvard who co-authored the study. \"In Singapore, if you close all the windows and turn on the air conditioning you get some protection, which may have happened.\" \n The Indonesian Medial Association's West Kalimantan chapter said Indonesia faces an overall decline in the health of future generations with social and economic consequences if the situation is not tackled. \n \"We are the doctors who care for the vulnerable groups exposed to toxic smoke,\" said Nursyam Ibrahim, deputy head of the West Kalimantan chapter of the association. \"And we know how awful it is to see the disease symptoms experienced by babies and children in our care.\" \n Howard Frumpkin, dean of the School of Public Health at the University of Washington, said it is possible the health consequences are greater than indicated by the study because higher incidence of certain health problems in developing countries could make populations more susceptible to the effects of fine particulate matter. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Study estimates 100,000 premature deaths from Indonesia haze"}

A tally by the national Asahi newspaper found 319 such places serving free or low-cost meals across Japan as of May, up from 21 in 2013. \n Over the past 70 years, Japan's rising affluence has banished most of the penury of the lean years during and after World War II, when children sometimes starved and many families went hungry. But despite its ultra-modern conveniences, Japan had the 10th-highest child poverty rate among 31 relatively well-off countries in a 2013 UNICEF report. \n Poverty in Japan is largely hidden, as it can lead to public shame and discrimination.

Such children might have smartphones but not the money to buy a 100-yen ($1) box of juice or participate in a school field trip, said Setsuko Ito, who heads the child-rearing-support division in Tokyo's working-class Arakawa district. \n Omura started her weekly dinner in Arakawa in 2014 to create a space to welcome area children who might not get enough support from their families, schools and communities. Her initiative, supported by donations and a grant from the district office, is meant to counter a void left as communities hollow out and family ties unravel, leaving many parents and children isolated and struggling to cope. The kids and volunteers pay 300 yen ($3) for dinner. \n \"I hope everyone can develop a sense that each child is our child and understand that we are raising the children who will be supporting us as the next generation,\" she said. \n Omura emphasized that the children who come to her weekly dinners are not necessarily living in poverty. In some cases, they just have to dine alone because their parents are working late. She asked the Associated Press not to interview the children, out of concern that public exposure might lead to harassment at school and in their neighborhood, or even when applying for jobs in the future. \n Just over half of all Japanese single-parent households are considered to be under the poverty line. Single mothers, who make on average 150,000 yen ($1,490) a month, get limited support from welfare programs. \n Though a 2013 law aims to coordinate national and local government efforts to provide educational, living and economic support, many local officials are struggling with the issue, said Kaori Suetomi, a professor specializing in education administration and finance at Nihon University in Tokyo. \n \"Until now, Japan hasn't really dealt with child poverty, and officials are not sure what to do,\" said Suetomi, co-author of a recent report on policies devised by local governments across Japan to address the issue. \n The problem, she said, is budgets for those programs are not guaranteed, so some local governments have had to abandon programs. In addition, Suetomi said that child poverty issues overlap between the education and welfare ministries. That makes securing funds difficult as the ministries shuffle the responsibility of which should bear the cost, she said. \n The \"children's cafeterias\" are an attempt to fill that void. \n Kazuma Omoto, a former participant and aspiring teacher who volunteers at Omura's dinners, said he attends to find himself and learn how to interact with younger children. \n \"It's a wonderful place for that,\" the high school junior said. \"I come here every week. Going forward I hope I can study and learn many different things myself.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'Children's cafeterias' combat poverty, neglect in Japan"}

{"date": "September 18, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Columbus, Ohio, Police Chief Kim Jacobs displays a photo of the type of BB gun police say Tyre King pulled from his waistband before he was shot and killed by a police officer investigating an armed robbery report, during a news conference in Columbus, Ohio on Thursday. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This April 28 file photo shows a semi-automatic handgun, left, next to a Powerline 340 BB gun, right, similar to a BB gun authorities say a teenager carried when he was shot and wounded by a Baltimore police officer, displayed during a news conference in Baltimore. \n Whether they shoot BBs, pellets, paintballs or nothing at all, imitation guns can be indistinguishable from the real thing \u2014 it's one reason why some criminals gravitate toward them. Plus they're cheap and easy to get. \n As Ohio authorities investigate the fatal police shooting of a 13-year-old boy who officers said pulled a realistic-looking BB gun from his waistband, law enforcement agencies are grappling with the use of fake guns to commit very real crimes. \n \"If I can't go get a real gun, it's easier for me to waltz into Wal-Mart or whatever store sells these things and go get a replica. Because if I go to a store to hold it up, the guy behind the counter isn't going to know it's not real,\" said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminal justice professor at the University of South Carolina. \n While the federal government does not track criminals' use of toy or replica guns, some individual police departments say they've noticed an uptick. \n In Edmonton, Canada, police said imitation guns were involved in 1,598 incidents in 2015 \u2014 up 38 percent from a year earlier. \n In Arlington, Texas, suspects are increasingly using lookalike guns, including an incident earlier this year in which a man carjacked a woman using an air gun that resembled a real pistol, and another case involving a teen who threatened an officer with a replica gun. The officer managed to knock it out of the teen's hand and tackle him. \n Arlington police Lt. Christopher Cook said that between March and August, nearly 20 percent of the weapons seized by police after they were used in crimes turned out to be lookalikes. \n So far, police haven't had to use deadly force. But Cook said that could change in an instant. \n \"There's no training in the world that we know of where an officer can readily distinguish a real gun from a fake gun,\" he said. \"That's not realistic, because officers have to make split-second decisions to ascertain whether it's a firearm or not.\" \n A lookalike weapon is at the center of last week's fatal police shooting of Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio. \n An officer responding to a report of a $10 armed robbery shot the teen after he pulled out a BB gun that looked \"practically identical\" to the weapon that police officers use, Columbus police said. \n A 19-year-old who said he was the boy's friend told a newspaper that Tyre had a real-looking BB gun, was out to rob someone and ran from police. But an attorney for Tyre's family has called for an independent investigation, saying the family believes the boy's involvement in an armed robbery would be \"out of character\" and the police version of events \"might not be true.\" \n However the facts shake loose in Columbus, the use of replica guns in crime has long vexed law enforcement. \n In the late 1980s, after a rash of high-profile police shootings of suspects carrying toy or lookalike guns, Congress authorized a study that found thousands of robberies and assaults to have been committed with imitation weapons between 1985 and 1989. The study also identified more than 250 cases in which an officer used force \u2014 deadly or otherwise \u2014 on a suspect brandishing an imitation gun. \n More recently, Associated Press research found at least 25 deaths involving lookalike guns mistaken by police for actual firearms across the country in the last two decades, dating to the 1994 slaying by a housing police officer of a 13-year-old New York City boy. \n \"It's horrible, it's horrible, when these kids are displaying these firearms and a life is lost, and after the fact it turns out it's not real,\" said Allentown, Pennsylvania, police Capt. Richard London. \n But he added it can be nearly impossible to tell an imitation gun from a firearm that shoots real bullets. \n \"It's human nature to defend yourself in the face of that,\" he said. \n At least 12 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have laws restricting the sale or use of imitation firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while many cities and towns have their own ordinances on lookalike guns. \n Federal law requires imitation guns to have orange plugs in the barrel to distinguish them from real firearms, but the tips are easily removed and experts question their effectiveness. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fake gun, real crime: Police notice uptick in replicas"}

He won the May 9 election on an ambitious promise to end corruption and crime, especially illegal drugs, in three to six months. \n More than 3,000 suspected drug dealers and traffickers have been killed in Duterte's campaign against drugs since he assumed the presidency in June, and 600,000 others, mostly drug users, have surrendered to authorities for fear they may be killed. \n A law enforcement investigation, however, has turned up more names of people who are involved in the illegal drug trade, including many village leaders and mayors, Duterte said at the news conference. Duterte first built a name for his deadly crime-fighting style while serving as Davao's longtime mayor before becoming president. \n \"I didn't realize how severe and how serious the problem of drug menace in this republic (was) until I became president,\" Duterte said. \n \"Even if I wanted to, I cannot kill them all because the last report would be this thick,\" Duterte said, laughing. \n President Barack Obama, U.N. officials and human rights watchdogs have raised concerns over the widespread killings, but Duterte has lashed back at them and other critics. He said that critics were impeding his battle against a problem that has worsened into a national security threat. \n A former Filipino militiaman recently testified before a Senate committee hearing that Duterte, while he was still Davao's mayor, ordered him and other members of a liquidation squad to kill criminals and opponents in gangland-style assaults that left about 1,000 dead starting in the late 1980s. \n While his key officials have played down the allegations and questioned the credibility of the witness, Duterte himself has not directly reacted to the statements made by Edgar Matobato in the nationally televised Senate inquiry. \n Matobato testified that he heard Duterte order some of the killings, and acknowledged that he himself carried out about 50 deadly assaults as an assassin, including a suspected kidnapper fed to a crocodile in 2007 in the southern province of Davao del Sur. \n Rights groups have long accused Duterte of involvement in death squads. He has denied the claims, even while engaging in tough talk in which he stated his approach to criminals was to \"kill them all.\" Matobato is the first person to admit any role in such killings, and to directly implicate Duterte under oath in a public hearing. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philippine president seeks extension of bloody war on drugs"}

Officials in New York and New Jersey said today they were still investigating who was behind the explosions and what the motivation was, while the Minnesota attack was being investigated as a possible act of terrorism. \n Clinton stressed that investigations were still underway, saying: \"Law enforcement officials are working to identify who was behind the attacks in New York and New Jersey and we should give them the support they need to finish the job and bring those responsible to justice \u2014 we will not rest until that happens.\" \n On the attack in St. Cloud, Minnesota, the former secretary of state noted that the Islamic State group had claimed responsibility and added, \"This should steel our resolve to protect our country and defeat ISIS and other terrorist groups.\" \n Clinton noted her plans to take on the Islamic State group, which include increased intelligence and efforts to better combat propaganda and recruitment online. \n Both presidential candidates have been quick to weigh in on the attacks.

{"date": "September 18, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People stood near the entrance on the north side of Crossroads Center mall between Macy's and Target as officials investigated a reported multiple stabbing incident, Saturday, in St. Cloud, Minn. \n ST. CLOUD, Minn. \u00bb A man in a private security uniform stabbed nine people at a Minnesota shopping mall, reportedly asking one victim if he or she was Muslim before an off-duty police officer shot and killed him in an attack the Islamic State group claimed as its own. \n None of the nine people who were stabbed in Saturday night's attack received life-threatening wounds, St. Cloud police Chief Blair Anderson said. He said it doesn't appear that anyone else was involved in the attack at the Crossroads Center in St. Cloud, which began at around 8 p.m. and was over within minutes. \n At a news conference Sunday, FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Rick Thornton said the attack was being investigated as a possible act of terrorism and that agents were still digging into the attacker's background and possible motives. Authorities were looking at social media accounts and the attacker's electronic devices and talking to his associates, Thornton said. \n An Islamic State-run news agency, Rasd, claimed Sunday that the attacker was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" who had heeded the group's calls for attacks in countries that are part of a U.S.-led anti-IS coalition. \n It was not immediately clear if the extremist group had planned the attack or even knew about it beforehand. IS has encouraged so-called \"lone wolf\" attacks. It has also claimed past attacks that are not believed to have been planned by its central leadership. \n Authorities didn't identify the attacker, but the Star Tribune of Minneapolis said the man's father identified him as Dahir A. Adan, 22. Speaking to the newspaper through an interpreter, Ahmed Adan, whose family is Somali, said his son was born in Africa and had lived in the U.S. for 15 years. \n A spokesman for St. Cloud State University confirmed that Adan was a student there, but has not been enrolled since the spring semester. Spokesman Adam Hammer said Adan's intended major was information systems, which is a computer-related field. \n Ahmed Adan said police told him around 9 p.m. Saturday that his son had died at the mall, and that police had raided the family's apartment, seizing photos and other materials. He said police said nothing to him about the mall attack, and that he had \"no suspicion\" that his son had been involved in terrorist activity, the newspaper reported. \n Anderson said police had had three previous encounters with the attacker, mostly for minor traffic violations. \n According to Anderson, the attacker, dressed in a security uniform and wielding what appeared to be a kitchen knife, began attacking people right after entering the mall, stabbing people in several spots inside the building, including corridors, businesses and common areas. \n Five minutes after authorities received the first 911 call, Jason Falconer, a part-time officer in the city of Avon, shot and killed the attacker. Anderson said Falconer fired as the attacker was lunging at him with the knife, and continued to engage him as the attacker got up three times. \n \"He clearly prevented additional injuries and potential loss of life,\" Anderson said. \"Officer Falconer was there at the right time and the right place,\" he said. \n Anderson earlier said the man reportedly made at least one reference to Allah and asked a victim if he or she was Muslim before attacking them. \n Leaders of the Somali community in central Minnesota united to condemn the stabbings. They said the suspect does not represent the larger Somali community, and they expressed fear about backlash over the attack. \n Minnesota has the nation's largest Somali community, with census numbers placing the population at about 40,000. But community activists say the population \u2014 most of it in the Minneapolis area \u2014 is much higher. The immigrant community has been a target for terror recruiters in recent years. More than 20 young men have left the state since 2007 to join al-Shabab in Somalia, and roughly a dozen people have left in recent years to join militants in Syria. In addition, nine Minnesota men face sentencing on terror charges for plotting to join the Islamic State group. \n For years, law enforcement officials have worried that young Somalis who embrace radical messages might carry out violence in the U.S. While the motive in Saturday's stabbings isn't yet known, if it turns out to be a terrorist attack, it would be the first carried out by a Somali on U.S. soil, said Karen Greenburg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University School of Law. \n The attack in St. Cloud, a city of about 65,000 people 60 miles (95 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis, began shortly after an explosion in a crowded New York City neighborhood injured 29 people. A suspicious device was found a few blocks away and safely removed. Hours before that, a pipe bomb exploded in Seaside Park, New Jersey, shortly before thousands of runners were due to participate in a charity 5K race. There was no immediate indication that the incidents were linked. \n The mall remained closed Sunday. Of the nine victims \u2014 seven men, a woman and a 15-year-old girl \u2014 three remained hospitalized, officials said. \n Photos and video of the mall taken hours after the incident showed groups of shoppers waiting to be released, including some huddled together near a food court entrance. \n Harley and Tama Exsted, of Isle, were in St. Cloud to watch their son play in a college golf tournament and were in the mall when the attack happened. \n \"All of a sudden I heard pop, pop, pop,\" Harley Exsted told the St. Cloud Times. \"I thought someone tipped over a shelf. All of a sudden these people started running. I just saw everybody running our way.\" \n The couple were unharmed and said they helped another woman who was running from the scene to her car. \n Falconer, who was shopping when he confronted the attacker, is the former police chief in Albany, which is about 15 miles northwest of St. Cloud, and the president and owner of a firing range and firearms training facility, according to his LinkedIn profile. His profile says he focuses on firearms and permit-to-carry training, and also teaches \"decision shooting\" to law enforcement students at St. Cloud State University. \n No one answered the door late Sunday at a home address listed for Falconer, and a voicemail box for a telephone listing was full and not accepting new messages. In a brief interview with the Star Tribune, Falconer said he had \"been trying to stay away from it all, for the time being.\" \n He told the newspaper he wasn't hurt and declined to talk further, citing the ongoing investigation for not saying more. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "FBI investigates Minnesota stabbings as possible terror act"}

Andrew Cuomo, touring the site of Saturday's blast that injured 29 people in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, said there didn't appear to be any link to international terrorism. He said the second device appeared \"similar in design\" to the first, but did not provide details. \n On Sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. The discovery of Tannerite may be important as authorities probe whether the three incidents are connected. \n Cell phones were discovered at the site of both bombings, but no Tannerite residue was identified in the New Jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to comment on an ongoing investigation. \n Authorities said the Manhattan bombing and New Jersey pipe bomb didn't appear to be connected, though they weren't ruling anything out. The New Jersey race was cancelled and no one was injured. \n Late Sunday, more suspicious devices were found near a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage said the devices were found in a bag in a trash can by two men who reported seeing wires and a pipe coming out of the package. There turned out to be five devices in the bag. One of the devices exploded as a bomb squad used a robot to try to disarm it. No injuries were reported. \n There was no immediate word on whether the devices were similar to those in nearby Seaside Park or New York City. \n Officials haven't revealed any details about the makeup of the pressure-cooker device, except to say it had wires and a cellphone attached to it. On Sunday night, police blew up the device, rendering it safe. A forensic examination of the device will be sent to the FBI Laboratory at Quantico, Virginia, police said. \n Homemade pressure cooker bombs were used in the Boston Marathon attacks in 2013 that killed three people and injured more than 260. \n On Sunday, a team of five FBI agents searched an Uber driver's vehicle that had been damaged in the Manhattan blast, ripping off the door panels inside as they examined it for evidence. The driver, MD Alam, of Brooklyn, had just picked up three passengers and was driving along 23rd Street when the explosion occurred, shattering the car's windows and leaving gaping holes in the rear passenger-side door. \n The Chelsea explosion left many rattled in a city that had marked the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks only a week earlier and where a United Nations meeting to address the refugee crisis in Syria was scheduled on Monday. \n Witnesses described a deafening blast that shattered storefront windows and injured bystanders with shrapnel in the mostly residential neighborhood on the city's west side. \n As authorities tried to unravel who planted the device and why, one New Yorker, Anthony Stanhope, 40, knew exactly what had just happened. \n \"I was sitting in my apartment, and all of a sudden I heard a big boom, and I thought to myself wait a minute, it can't be thundering and lightning at this hour, and then all of a sudden car horns went off, and I thought oh my god this isn't lightning, this is too loud \u2013 this is a bomb,\" said Stanhope. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Authorities probe ties between blasts, devices in two states"}

The test was North Korea's fifth and, along with recent ballistic missile launches, has been widely criticized as destabilizing to regional and international security. \n Kerry said the U.S. remained deeply committed to its mutual defense obligations with Japan and South Korea and would not shirk in \"rolling back the provocative, reckless behavior of\" North Korea. \n He said the U.S., Japan, South Korea and others would \"make it clear to a reckless dictator that all he is doing through his actions is isolating his country, isolating his people and depriving his people of genuine economic opportunity.\" \n \"The global community will not be intimidated and will not pull back from our obligations,\" Kerry said. He called for North Korea and its leader Kim Jong-un to freeze Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs immediately and return to denuclearization talks. \n The South Korean foreign minister, Yun Byung-se, echoed Kerry's comments, calling North Korea's missile and nuclear tests a \"ticking time bomb\" and a threat to world safety. \"What we see is a looming perfect storm that may not only pounce on Northeast Asia but sweep over the entire world,\" he said. \n The Obama administration has been nudging allies Japan and South Korea to set aside historical differences and cooperate more closely in diplomacy and security as the threat posed by North Korea intensifies. \n A statement provided by the office of Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said the three governments \"explored ways to work together\" to ensure countries fully implement existing U.N. sanctions on North Korea. They also discussed work in the Security Council to tighten the sanctions and the possibility of taking measures of their own to restrict revenue sources for the North's missile and nuclear programs. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S., Japan, South Korea condemn nuke test by North Korea"}

Lamar, in front of a packed crowd at the Cobb Energy Performing Centre, said the ultra-smooth West Coast rapper \"paved a way into many hearts\" with his authentic rap flow and infectious persona. \n Hip-hop royalty from Dr. Dre to Pharrell Williams paid homage to Snoop, a legend in his own right. \n \"He mastered the game through tests and challenges that earned him the respect of a college professor, except his game came from the streets,\" Lamar said. \"He put (me) on game, so I would avoid the same pitfalls. \u2026 Snoop Dogg was the God, and continues to be so.\" \n During his acceptance speech, Snoop encouraged up-and-coming rappers to continue to \"push the envelope\" in being creative and original. \n \"To all the young rappers in the game, a lot of people don't understand you. Y'all are misunderstood,\" he said. \"I was misunderstood at the beginning. So you got to keep pushing, be original and diverse. Hip-hop was created many years ago and it's taken people so many places. You have to be who you are.\" \n When Snoop Dogg wasn't being honored, the show focused its attention toward police brutality of African-Americans. \n Wearing all black, T.I. performed his politically-charged song \"We Will Not\" as a stage full of people sporting dark attire held up \"Black Lives Matter\" signs. The rapper said he was motivated to write the song after hearing about a series of deaths of black people including Sandra Bland, who died while in police lockup after a traffic stop, and Philando Castile who was fatally shot by police during a traffic stop. Castile was licensed to carry and had a firearm in his car. \n Rapper Big K.R.I.T. and Lecrae, a Christian rapper, expressed their thoughts on the matter through their own poems and radio host Sway Calloway stood alongside Khaled and said \"we're at war.\" Actor Shameik Moore encouraged people to cast their vote. \n T.I. said at the end of his performance that blacks should unite adding that \"they can't kill us all.\" \n Before the show, Snoop said it felt \"amazing\" to be honored by the network. He broke through under the guidance of hit maker Dr. Dre, releasing his 1993 debut album \"Doggystyle,\" which featured iconic songs including \"Gin and Juice\" and \"What's My Name?\" \n \"He means so much to hip-hop,\" rapper Young Jeezy said. \"There are so many who look up to him. He paved a way for so many, and that's why everybody knows him as Uncle Snoop.\" \n Rapper Gucci Mane, recently released from prison, hit the stage first. He performed four songs, kicking his set off with \"First Day Out\" and \"First Day Out Tha Feds\" during his performance. The rapper made his return after being released in late May from a Federal Correctional Institution in Terre Haute, Indiana. \n He served a three-year sentence after pleading guilty to aggravated assault for attacking a fan at an Atlanta nightclub. That sentence ran concurrently with a 39-month federal sentence he was given in 2014 for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. \n First-time host DJ Khaled followed with \"Holy Key\" with soul singer Betty Wright and a choir dressed in gold. \n There were several recorded freestyle sessions, known as The Cypher, featuring several artists including Lil Wayne and comedian Kevin Hart, who rapped shirtless wearing dark sunglasses. During Hart's rap, some laughed while other applauded his efforts. \n Lamar took home Lyricist of the Year, Fat Joe and Remy Ma won Track of the Year award for their song \"All the Way Up.\" The Hustler of the Year honor went to DJ Khaled, and Best New Hip-Hop Artist was earned by Chance the Rapper, who was not in attendance. \n Rapper Desiigner closed out the show with \"Timmy Turner.\" \n The show will air on BET on Oct. 4. \n Online: \n http://www.bet.com/shows/hip-hop-awards/nominees.html \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Snoop Dogg honored in politically charged BET Hip-Hop Awards"}

{"date": "September 18, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Released Norwegian hostage Kjartan Sekkingstad carried a backpack as he boarded a plane to take him to Davao city for an audience with Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, Sunday, on Jolo island, Sulu province in southern Philippines. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Released Norwegian hostage Kjartan Sekkingstad, right, briefly delivered his statement after meeting Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in Davao city in southern Philippines on Sunday. \n INDANAN, Philippines \u00bb A Norwegian man freed by militants after a year of jungle captivity in the southern Philippines described the ordeal Sunday as \"devastating,\" carrying a backpack with a bullet hole as a reminder of a near-death experience that included the beheadings of the two Canadians kidnapped with him. \n Kjartan Sekkingstad was freed by his Abu Sayyaf captors on Saturday to rebels from the larger Moro National Liberation Front, which has signed a peace deal with the Philippine government and helped negotiate his release. On Sunday, he was handed over to Philippine authorities, along with three Indonesian fishermen freed separately by the Abu Sayyaf. \n Aside from the horror of constantly being warned that he would be the next to be beheaded by the brutal extremists, Sekkingstad said he survived more than a dozen clashes between Philippine forces and his captors in the lush jungles of Sulu province. \n In one intense battle, in which the forces fired from assault helicopters and from the ground, he said he felt a thud in his back and thought he was hit by gunfire. After the fighting eased, he discovered that he wasn't hit, and that his green, army-style backpack had been pierced by the gunfire instead. \n Sekkingstad was carrying the damaged backpack when he walked to freedom Saturday somewhere in the thick jungle off Sulu's mountainous Patikul town. \n On Sunday, the heavily bearded Sekkingstad, clad in a rebel camouflage uniform and muddy combat boots, was asked how he would describe his horrific experience. \n \"Devastating, devastating,\" he said, still clutching the backpack. \n Philippine presidential adviser Jesus Dureza, who received Sekkingstad and the three freed Indonesians from Moro National Liberation Front rebel chief Nur Misuari in Misuari's rural stronghold near Sulu's Indanan town, accompanied the Norwegian on a flight to southern Davao city, where the ex-hostage met President Rodrigo Duterte. \n Duterte told Sekkingstad that his travails were over. Sekkingstad, newly shaved but looking gaunt in a loose polo shirt, thanked all those who worked for his freedom. \n \"I am very happy to be alive and free,\" he said. \"It's a beautiful feeling.\" \n Sekkingstad was kidnapped from a yacht club he helped managed on southern Samal Island on Sept. 21, 2015, along with Canadians John Ridsdel and Robert Hall and Hall's Filipino girlfriend, Marites Flor, sparking a massive land and sea search by Philippine forces. \n The Abu Sayyaf demanded a huge ransom for the release of the foreigners, and released videos in which they threatened the captives in a jungle clearing where they displayed Islamic State group-style black flags. \n Ridsdel was beheaded in April and Hall was decapitated in June after ransom deadlines lapsed. When Flor was freed in June, she recounted in horror how the militants rejoiced while watching the beheadings. \n Sekkingstad said he and his fellow captives were forced to carry the militants' belongings and were kept in the dark on what was happening around them. At one point, he said, their heavily armed captors numbered more than 300. \n \"We were treated like slaves,\" he said. \n After the militants decapitated Ridsdel, Sekkingstad was threatened by the militants, who repeatedly told him, \"You're next.\" \n When the negotiations for his release began in recent months, Sekkingstad said the rebels began treating him better. \n It was not immediately clear whether Sekkingstad had been ransomed off. Duterte suggested at a news conference last month that 50 million pesos ($1 million) had been paid to the militants, but that they continued to hold on to him. The military said Saturday that relentless assaults forced the extremists to release the hostage. \n In Norway, Prime Minister Erna Solberg thanked Duterte and Dureza, and said his government supports the Philippines \"in their fight against terrorism.\" Solberg told Norway's NTB national news agency that \"Norwegian officials had not participated in any payment of ransom or made any concessions in the matter.\" \n Philippine forces launched a major offensive against the Abu Sayyaf after the beheadings of the Canadians sparked condemnations from then-Philippine President Benigno Aquino III and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who called on other nations not to pay ransoms if their citizens are abducted to discourage the militants from carrying out more kidnappings. \n The three Indonesian fishermen freed by the Abu Sayyaf were kidnapped in July off Lahad Datu district in Malaysia's Sabah state, according to regional Philippine military spokesman Maj. Filemon Tan. Their release came as Indonesian Defense Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu was visiting the Philippines. \n Five Indonesians, five Malaysians and a Dutch bird watcher, along with five Filipinos, remain in Abu Sayyaf custody, the Philippine military said. \n The Abu Sayyaf has been blacklisted as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the Philippines for deadly bombings, kidnappings and beheadings. Without any known foreign funding, the extremists have relied on ransom kidnappings, extortion and other acts of banditry, and some commanders have pledged loyalty to the Islamic State group partly in the hope of obtaining funds. \n Associated Press writers Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines, Matti Huuhtanen in Helsinki and Ali Kotarumalos in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.  \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Norwegian says his Philippine kidnapping was 'devastating'"}
