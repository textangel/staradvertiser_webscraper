{"date": "September 19, 2016", "text": "FOTOLIA / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n A group of friends drink beer at an outdoor rooftop bar. \n Why does drinking lead to hook-ups? One theory is that alcohol makes people feel more frisky. Another is that it simply causes people to let loose and act more impulsively, facilitating all kinds of behavior that would otherwise be considered inappropriate. \n Swiss researchers designed a study to see if they could shed some light on the situation. They recruited 30 men and 30 women, offered them beer and subjected them to a series of psychological tests. All of the study participants where white, in good mental health and between the ages of 18 and 50. (In addition, none of the women in the study were pregnant.) \n All of the volunteers in the double-blind study took the battery of tests twice \u2014 once after being served a glass of regular beer, and once after being served an equivalent amount of non-alcoholic beer. Though the volunteers might have been able to discern which beverage was the near beer and which was real deal, the researchers didn't tip them off. \n Here's what they learned from the volunteers who drank beer for the sake of science: \n \u2014People were quicker to recognize happy faces when there was alcohol in their system. \n \u2014People had a greater desire to be in a \"positive\" social environment \u2014 such as a party \u2014 after consuming an alcoholic beer. \n \u2014Although oxytocin \u2014 the molecule some people know better as the \"love hormone\" \u2014 is known to produce effects like these, blood tests showed that alcohol had no affect on the volunteers' oxytocin levels. \n \u2014People were somewhat put off by sexually explicit images after drinking the near beer \u2014 they rated the pictures \"less pleasant than neutral pictures\" \u2014 but not after drinking regular beer. \n \u2014Likewise, when people had an alcoholic buzz, they found sexually explicit images \"more pleasant\" than they did when the buzz was absent. This particular effect was particularly strong among women. \n \u2014There were no signs that alcohol enhanced \"sexual arousal\" in the volunteers. \n Putting it all together, the researchers concluded that alcohol's role as a social lubricant can be traced to its ability to facilitate \"sexual disinhibition,\" according to a report published Monday in the journal Psychopharmacology and presented at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology meeting in Vienna. \n The study was funded by University Hospital Basel, where the researchers work. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times  \n ", "author": "By Karen Kaplan Los Angeles Times", "title": "What researchers learned about hook-up culture from volunteers who drank beer for science"}

She still does not enjoy \"doing some of the things that come naturally to most politicians, like talking about myself.\" \n But she shared the lessons she has drawn on throughout her life, particularly from her mother, that inspired her lifelong passion to help children and families, which she said would also be the \"passion of my presidency.\" \n \"I can't promise you'll agree with me all the time, but I can promise you this: No one will work harder to make your life better,\" she said. \"I will never stop, no matter how tough it gets.\" \n The address was part of a larger effort by Clinton's campaign to refocus on substance rather than a daily tit-for-tat with Donald Trump. Clinton said the election \"shouldn't be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get on the cable news,\" a reference to Trump's pronouncement Friday that he now believes President Barack Obama was born in the U.S., after years of perpetuating the lie that Obama was born elsewhere. \n \"We can't get distracted when the media or my opponent turns this election into a circus,\" she said before launching into the prose of governance \u2014 her plans to expand broadband access, install half a billion solar panels and build a new electric grid. \n Her address revealed the degree to which Clinton's challenge goes beyond persuading voters to reject Trump and to persuade them to overcome cynicism or frustration with politics and with her that may lead them to vote for a third-party candidate, or not vote at all. \n \"I know that with Washington paralyzed by big money and partisanship, the gap between the change we want and the progress that politics should deliver can look like a chasm,\" she said. \"I also know that even if you're totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that. And I want to do my best to answer those questions.\" \n Campaign officials concede that enthusiasm for Clinton among the millennial generation is not where it needs to be for her to win in some battleground states, and that the speech is part of an effort to ramp up engagement with young voters. \n \"This generation is the most diverse and resilient generation of our lifetime, and they inspire and challenge us to be better,\" campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said. \"That is why Clinton will not only make the case against Trump, but she wants to earn their vote by making the case on why they should vote for her.\" \n That engagement includes campaigning on Clinton's behalf by surrogates like Obama and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who have enjoyed stronger support with younger voters in their campaigns. \n Clinton was interrupted by applause as she noted her work with Sanders, her erstwhile opponent, on a plan to make public college tuition free for some and debt-free for everyone. \n She also drew an extended ovation as she condemned Trump, citing his \"long history of racial discrimination in his businesses,\" promotion of social media messages by white supremacists and his lead role in advocating the so-called \"birther\" conspiracy against Obama. \n \"We have to stand up to this hate. We cannot let it go on,\" she said. \"And when we do that, we send a clear message: America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump.\" \n But the speech \u2014 one of several planned over the coming week meant to offer voters a fuller picture of Clinton's vision for the country \u2014 appeared likely to be overshadowed by the response to weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey and the apprehension of a suspect. \n The former New York senator and secretary of state, echoing an earlier statement, called the events a \"sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Tribune Co.  \n ", "author": "By Michael A.

And with the blaze at only 67 percent containment, there could be weeks left before the firefight is done. \n That puts it well past the previous high of $165 million established by a blaze that burned in California and Oregon in 2002. \n The figure does not include the actual damages done by the fire like destroyed homes, only the costs of extinguishing and containing it. \n It also is not adjusted for inflation, which would put the 2002 fire and others ahead of it. \n The cost is mostly attributable to the long duration of the fire, and the need to pay thousands of firefighters for their daily work, the U.S. Forest Service said. The daily costs got as high as $8 million at the fire's peak, though they've settled at closer to $2 million as it has calmed. \n The fire burning in the Los Padres National Forest wrought havoc on the summer tourist season in the area after it broke out because of an illegal campfire on July 22.

This is part of a more wide-ranging policy on immigrants that has ranged from an outright ban on foreign Muslim immigrants entering the United States \"until we know what the hell is going on\" to \"extreme\" vetting and an ideological test for would-be immigrants from countries and regions plagued by extremism. \n Clinton has said she would expand President Barack Obama's refugee program to accept about 65,000 Syrian refugees. This would be in addition to the tens of thousands of refugees accepted from around the world every year. Clinton said she would continue with the vetting currently in place, an effort that can take multiple years to complete. \n Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have sought refuge in Europe while many others wait in neighboring countries and refugee camps for the war to end or a chance to move away from the carnage.

Police said multiple people were injured at the St. Cloud shopping mall on Saturday evening in an attack possibly involving both shooting and stabbing. \n ST. CLOUD TIMES VIA AP \n Somali-American leaders hold a press conference Sunday in St. Cloud, Minn., to address the stabbing and shooting incident that happened Saturday at Crossroads Center Mall. A man in a private security uniform stabbed nine people at a Minnesota shopping mall Saturday. \n STAR TRIBUNE VIA AP \n Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith, from left, Gov. Mark Dayton, St. Cloud Police Chief William Blair Anderson, and St. Cloud Mayor David Kleis hold a press conference after meeting at St. Cloud City Hall today. \n ST. CLOUD, Minn. \u00bb One of the victims wounded in a stabbing at a central Minnesota mall says the man who carried out the attack showed no emotion and his eyes looked blank.  \n Ryan Schliep, one of 10 people who suffered wounds that were not life-threatening before the attacker was fatally shot, told WCCO-TV that the man \"just walked right at me\" before striking quickly and penetrating the skin of his scalp. \n \"He looked just blank in the eyes like he wasn't even there,\" Schliep said shortly before being released from a St. Cloud hospital. \n Authorities are treating Saturday's stabbings at Crossroads Center Mall as a possible act of terrorism, in part because an Islamic State-run news agency claimed that the attacker was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" who had heeded the group's calls for attacks in countries that are part of a U.S.-led anti-IS coalition. \n But it wasn't immediately known whether the extremist group had planned the attack or knew about it beforehand. St. Cloud Police Chief Blair Anderson said Monday the attack appeared to be the work of a single individual and there was no sign that the attacker, identified as 20-year-old Dahir Adan, was radicalized or communicated with any terrorist group. \n President Barack Obama said the stabbings had no apparent connection to weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey. \n Because Adan was Somali, leaders of the state's large Somali community acknowledged the prospect of a \"long winter\" for their people after the stabbings, but warned not to quickly accept the terrorism connection. \n \"We cannot give ISIS and other terrorist organizations more air time and propaganda without real facts,\" said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations' Minnesota chapter. \n Little is known about Adan, who was identified Sunday by his father, Ahmed Adan, and then by St. Cloud police Monday night. He had only a traffic ticket on his record, was apparently out of work after his job as a part-time security guard ended and hadn't enrolled in college since the spring semester. Adan was wearing a security guard's uniform during the attack. \n A spokesman for the family, Abdi Wahid Osman, read from a statement expressing condolences for the injured and anyone else who was impacted. \n \"As we mourn the death of our son, Dahir Adnan, who was very dear to us, we are in deep shock as everyone else is in the state of Minnesota,\" the statement said. \n Federal officials released no new information Monday on the investigation into the stabbing, which was stopped by an off-duty police officer just minutes into it. FBI Special Agent in Charge Rick Thornton has said authorities were digging into Adan's background and possible motives, looking at social media accounts and electronic devices and talking to people he knew. \n Minnesota has the nation's largest Somali population, an estimated 57,000 people. Both Anderson and Gov. Mark Dayton warned against a possible backlash due to the stabbings, especially in St. Cloud, where Somalis in the 65,000-resident city about 65 miles (104 km) northwest of Minneapolis have spoken about mistreatment in the past. \n \"I implore the citizens of St. Cloud and the citizens of Minnesota to rise above this incident and remember our common humanity,\" Dayton said. \n \"It's going to be tough times. We know it's going to be a long winter for this community,\" said Haji Yusuf, who is part of UniteCloud, a local group founded to tackle racial and ethnic tension in the city. \n Last year, St. Cloud school officials met with Somali parents, community elders and students after Somali-American students walked out to protest their treatment. One student had said Somali-Americans were called Islamic State members and had their headscarves pulled off, and a photo posted on social media of a Somali-American student who was using a wheelchair after breaking her leg with a caption that said she was \"disabled in ISIS.\" \n Five years earlier, CAIR's Minnesota chapter asked for a federal civil rights investigation into allegations that Muslim students had been harassed at two St. Cloud high schools. A 2011 agreement resolved the case, but the U.S. Department of Education still was monitoring the case last year. \n In 2013, CAIR called on police in nearby Waite Park to reject a training program about Somalis because a flier unfairly suggested the activities of al-Shabab \u2014 a militant group in east Africa that has had success in recruiting Somali-Americans in Minnesota \u2014 are supported by most Muslims. \n If the stabbings are ultimately deemed a terrorist act, it would be the first carried out by a Somali on U.S. soil. \n Adan was employed by the security firm Securitas, and was assigned for a few months to an Electrolux factory near the mall, Electrolux spokeswoman Eloise Hale said. His father, speaking through an interpreter, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he was 22, but court records and a driver's license database showed his age as 20. Police also said he was 20. \n A spokesman for St. Cloud State University confirmed that Adan was a student majoring in information systems, but hadn't enrolled since the spring semester. \n Yusuf, who has spoken with Adan's parents, said Adan went to the mall to pick up an iPhone. Yusuf said Adan seemed happy when left the home, which was the last time his parents saw him. \n A person at the T-Mobile store where Yusuf said Adan had gone declined to comment or take a message for his supervisor. \n Five minutes after authorities received the first 911 call, Jason Falconer, a part-time officer in the city of Avon who was there shopping, began shooting the attacker as he was lunging at him with the knife, Anderson said, and continued to engage him as the attacker got up three times. \n Avon Police Chief Corey Nellis said Monday that Falconer owns a firing range and is the city's firearms instructor. \"If I was going to ask anybody to fire \u2026 live rounds in a crowded mall, I would trust his abilities next to anybody's,\" Nellis said. \n The mall reopened Monday after being closed Sunday. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Victim: Mall attacker emotionless; leaders urge 'rise above'"}

At right is Rev. Joey Crutcher, her and Terence's father. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Police worked the scene of a shooting late Friday, in Tulsa, Okla. A Tulsa police officer shot and killed a black man who ignored repeated requests to put up his hands before reaching into an SUV that was stalled in the middle of a street, the police department said. \n TULSA, Okla. \u00bb An unarmed black man killed by a white Oklahoma officer who was responding to a stalled vehicle can be seen in police video walking away from officers and toward his SUV with his hands up before he approaches the driver's side door, where he drops to the ground after being shocked with a stun gun then fatally shot. \n In Tulsa police helicopter footage that was among several clips released today showing the shooting of 40-year-old Terence Crutcher and its aftermath, a man in the helicopter that arrives above the scene as Crutcher walks to the vehicle can be heard saying \"time for a Taser.\" He then says: \"That looks like a bad dude, too. Probably on something.\" \n Police Chief Chuck Jordan announced before the video and audio recordings' release that Crutcher had no weapon on him or in his SUV when he was shot Friday. It's not clear from the footage what led Betty Shelby, the officer who fired the fatal shot, to draw her gun or what orders officers might have given Crutcher. Local and federal investigations are underway to determine whether criminal charges are warranted in the shooting or if Crutcher's civil rights were violated. \n Crutcher's twin sister, Tiffany Crutcher, called for charges today. \n \"The big bad dude was my twin brother. That big bad dude was a father,\" she said. \"That big bad dude was a son. That big bad dude was enrolled at Tulsa Community College, just wanting to make us proud. That big bad dude loved God. That big bad dude was at church singing with all of his flaws, every week. That big bad dude, that's who he was.\" \n Police video shows Crutcher walking toward his SUV that is stopped in the middle of the road. His hands are up and a female officer is following him. As Crutcher approaches the driver's side of the SUV, three male officers walk up and Crutcher appears to lower his hands and place them on the vehicle. The officers surround him, making it harder to see his actions from the dashboard camera's angle. \n Crutcher can be seen dropping to the ground. Someone on the police radio says, \"I think he may have just been tasered.\" One of the officers near Crutcher backs up slightly. \n Then almost immediately, someone can be heard yelling, \"Shots fired!\" Crutcher's head then drops, leaving him completely lying out in the street. \n After that, someone on the police radio can be heard saying, \"Shots fired. We have one suspect down.\" \n Officer Tyler Turnbough, who's also white, used a stun gun on Crutcher, police said. \n The shooting comes just four months after former Tulsa County volunteer deputy Robert Bates was sentenced to four years in prison on a second-degree manslaughter conviction in the 2015 death of an unarmed black man. Shelby worked as a Tulsa County sheriff's deputy for four years before joining the Tulsa Police Department in December 2011, officials said. She has been placed on paid leave. \n The initial moments of Crutcher's encounter with police are not shown in the footage. Shelby did not activate her patrol car's dashcam, said police spokeswoman Jeanne MacKenzie, and the ground-level video released today came from the car of a second officer who arrived at the scene. \n Initial police briefings indicated Crutcher was not obeying officers' commands, but MacKenzie said today she didn't know what Crutcher was doing that prompted police to shoot. Two 911 calls described an SUV that had been abandoned in the middle of the road. One unidentified caller said the driver was acting strangely, adding, \"I think he's smoking something.\" \n After the shooting, Crutcher could be seen lying on the side of the road, blood pooling around his body, for nearly two minutes before anyone checked on him. When asked why police did not provide immediate assistance once Crutcher was down, MacKenzie said, \"I don't know that we have protocol on how to render aid to people.\" \n The American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, which also called for charges, said Crutcher was left to bleed while officers stood by. The group's executive director, Ryan Kiesel, said Crutcher's death shows \"how little regard\" Tulsa police have for the community's minorities. \n Dozens of protesters gathered outside the county courthouse this evening holding signs that read, \"Justice 4 Crutch\" and \"Don't Shoot.\" \n With relations between police and blacks in Tulsa already uneasy, the community needs to be the place where change happens, Tiffany Crutcher said. \n \"This is bigger than us right here. We're going to stop it right here,\" she said. \n U.S. Attorney Danny C. Williams said the Department of Justice's civil rights investigation into the shooting will be separate from a local one into whether criminal charges should be filed. \n \"The Justice Department is committed to investigating allegations of force by law enforcement officers and will devote whatever resources are necessary to ensure that all allegations of serious civil rights violations are fully and completely investigated,\" he said. \n Speaking today in Tulsa, civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said Crutcher committed no crime and gave officers no reason to shoot him. \n \"When unarmed people of color break down on the side of the road, we're not treated as citizens needing help. We're treated as, I guess, criminals \u2014 suspects that they fear,\" said Crump, who is representing Crutcher's family just as he did relatives of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed, black Florida teenager who was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012. \n He said Tulsa police drew their own conclusions about Crutcher. \n \"So I guess it's a crime now to be a big black man,\" Crump said. \"My God, help us.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tulsa police say man had no gun; video shows he had hands up"}

{"date": "September 19, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Activists in Syria's besieged Aleppo protested against the United Nations on Sept. 13 for what they say is its failure to lift the siege off their rebel-held area. \n BEIRUT \u00bb Syria's military today declared that the U.S.-Russian brokered cease-fire was over, shortly after the Russian military said it was \"meaningless\" to continue observing the agreement. The Syrian declaration and Moscow's statement came amid mounting violations and an exchange of accusations between Russia and the United States. \n Soon after, the U.S. said it's prepared to extend the fractured ceasefire despite numerous violations and the Syrian military's announcement. \n It was unclear this evening whether the agreement \u2014 which has brought a brief respite to the war-torn country \u2014 would truly collapse on the ground. Shortly before the Syrian military declaration, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly that the truce was \"holding but fragile.\" \n Residents of eastern Aleppo reported the resumption of airstrikes in their besieged areas. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The government also said it repelled an insurgent attack on areas it controls south of Aleppo. \n In the wake of the Syrian announcement, Kerry expressed annoyance at Damascus and Moscow's handling of the cease-fire. \n \"It would be good if they didn't talk first to the press but if they talked to the people who are actually negotiating this,\" he said. \"As I said yesterday, (it's) time to end the grandstanding and time to do the real work of delivering on the humanitarian goods that are necessary for access.\" \n But Kerry also acknowledged that the first stage of the truce \u2014 which called for a week of calm and the delivery of humanitarian aid to several besieged communities \u2014 had never really come to fruition. \n The State Department later said that it was ready to work with Russia to strengthen the terms of the agreement and expand deliveries of humanitarian aid. \n Spokesman John Kirby said Russia, which is responsible for ensuring Syria's compliance, should clarify the Syrian position. \n A Russian Foreign Ministry statement late tonight appeared to signal that the deal could still be salvaged, saying that the failure by the rebels in Syria to respect the cease-fire threatens to thwart the agreement. \n The cease-fire came into effect on Sept. 12. Under terms of the agreement, the successful completion of seven days of calm and humanitarian aid deliveries would be followed by an ambitious second-stage plan to set up a joint U.S.-Russian coordination center to plan military strikes against the Islamic State group and a powerful al-Qaida-linked militant faction. \n But from the start, the truce has been beset by difficulties and mutual accusations of violations. \n Aid deliveries to the besieged eastern districts of Aleppo, a key point in the truce agreement, have not reached their destination. The U.N. accused the government of obstructing the delivery while Russian officials said rebels opened fire at the delivery roads. \n Rebel forces and activists say government planes have bombed areas that are under the truce agreement, including rebel-held parts of Aleppo. At least 22 civilians were killed in government bombings over the last week, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition monitoring group. The group said four civilians were killed in government-held areas. There were no independent reports of deaths of civilians on the government-side since the cease-fire came into effect. \n By today, both the Syrian government and prominent opposition activists were speaking of the truce as if it had already failed. \n George Sabra, of the opposition High Negotiations Committee, told The Associated Press today that the truce has been repeatedly violated and did not succeed in its main objective \u2014 opening roads for aid to enter besieged rebel-held areas. \n \"Hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo are waiting for this truce to allow aid to enter the city,\" he said, adding that there are aid trucks still waiting on the Turkey-Syria border. \"I believe that the truce is clinically dead.\" \n The Syrian military statement placed the blame squarely on the rebel groups. Damascus refers to all armed opposition groups as terrorists. \n \"This step (cease-fire) was to constitute a real chance to stop the bloodshed. But the armed terrorist groups didn't take it seriously and didn't commit to any of its articles,\" the military command statement said. \"The armed terrorist groups took advantage of the declared truce system and mobilized terrorists and weapons and regrouped to continue its attacks on civilian and military areas.\" \n One of the major rebel groups in Syria, Nour el-Din el-Zinki, said soon after the Syrian military declaration that the government, Russia and Iran, another major ally of President Bashar Assad, are responsible for the truce's failure. \n \"The regime of Bashar Assad had no real intention to commit to the truce. Instead it worked to undermine it with organized violations during the week as well as preventing aid from reaching Aleppo,\" the group said in a statement sent to reporters. \n Earlier today Lt. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi of the Russian military's General Staff said in a briefing that Damascus had fulfilled its obligations. \n \"With the rebels failing to fulfill conditions the cease-fire agreement, we consider its unilateral observance by the Syrian government forces meaningless,\" Rudskoi said. \n Rudskoi said the rebels have violated the truce 302 times since it took effect a week ago, killing 63 civilians and 153 Syrian soldiers. The opposition reported today 254 violations by government forces and their allies since the truce started. \n The current tensions come on the heels of the weekend air strike by the U.S.-led coalition on Syrian army positions near Deir el-Zour. Syria and Russia blasted Washington over the attack. \n The Saturday airstrikes involved Australian, British and Danish warplanes on Syrian army positions. The U.S. military said it would not intentionally hit Syrian troops, and that it came as it was conducting a raid on IS positions. \n Russia's military has said that it was told by the Syrian army that at least 62 Syrian soldiers were killed in the Deir el-Zour air raid and more than 100 wounded. The Observatory gave a different death toll, saying 90 troops were killed in the strikes. \n Assad said today the airstrikes of the U.S.-led coalition against his troops was meant to support the Islamic State group, calling the attack a \"blatant American aggression.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. and Russia seek to salvage truce; Syria calls it finished"}

{"date": "September 19, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nev., waited on the House steps of the U.S. Capitol on Sept. 8 in Washington for a rally. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Congressional negotiators today pressed to wrap up a must-do spending bill to prevent an election-season government shutdown and finally provide money to battle the threat of the Zika virus, but numerous sticking points remain. \n The stopgap measure would keep the government running past the end of the budget year this month. It's the only measure that has to pass before Congress adjourns for Election Day. As such, the talks have been tricky, with Republicans controlling Congress battling Democrats and the Obama administration. \n A controversy involving whether Planned Parenthood should be eligible for anti-Zika funding in Puerto Rico \u2014 which sparked a Democratic blockade of an earlier measure \u2014 appears to have been defused, lawmakers and aides say. But unrelated controversies over pesticide regulations, spending cuts and limitations on how many hours long-haul truckers can drive remain unresolved. \n Top Senate leaders had hoped to seal an agreement today in time for a procedural vote slated for early evening, but talks over the weekend failed to produce progress, aides briefed on the talks said. The procedural vote has already been postponed once and it's not clear whether today's vote will occur as scheduled. \n The $1 billion-plus to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus is months overdue. Republicans were slow to act on Obama's February request and then sparked an imbroglio with Democrats by restricting new health grants for Puerto Rico to entities like public health providers and hospitals, a step that Republicans acknowledge was aimed at ensuring Planned Parenthood was ineligible to receive any funds. A proposed solution would move the money to different accounts and make sure Planned Parenthood remains eligible to receive it. \n Another proposal would temporarily ease pesticide spraying rules from Clean Water Act requirements for permits. Supporters say the permits are duplicative since pesticides are generally regulated by a different environmental law, but the idea is opposed by the administration, which says it's an assault on environmental laws. \n Democrats also are opposed to pairing the Zika money with spending cuts intended to try to pay for it. Other disasters, like floods and emergency wildfire funds, haven't required such offsetting cuts, and Democrats don't want to set the precedent. \n But House conservatives insist on cuts, known in Washington-speak as offsets, and Democrats are willing to accept some \u2014 especially those that are painless, such as erasing money that wouldn't be spent anyway under arcane budget rules. \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is eager to send vulnerable incumbents such as Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., back to their states to campaign. \n Any measure that's going to prevent a shutdown on Oct. 1 will need the support of Democrats and a signature from President Barack Obama, and McConnell is better positioned to take charge since he has a less combative group of Republicans than House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. \n On Saturday, Obama used his radio address to pressure Congress, listing unresolved business such as the emergency Zika money, aid to flood-ravaged Louisiana and Flint, Michigan, hit by lead-contaminated water, and the languishing Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland. \n \"If any of these priorities matter to you, let your congressperson know,\" Obama said. \"And if they still refuse to do their jobs \u2014 well, you know what to do in November. Our government only works as well as the people we elect. And that's entirely up to you.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Congress struggles to finish Zika aid, prevent shutdown"}

Rahami was wanted for questioning in the bombings that rocked the Chelsea neighborhood of New York and the New Jersey shore town of Seaside Park. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Ahmad Khan Rahami was taken into custody after a shootout with police, today, in Linden, N.J. Rahami was wanted for questioning in the bombings that rocked the Chelsea neighborhood of New York and the New Jersey shore town of Seaside Park. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This undated photo provided by the FBI shows Ahmad Khan Rahami. The New York Police Department said it is looking for Rahami for questioning in the New York City explosion that happened Saturday. \n LINDEN, N.J. \u00bb A New Jersey police officer responding to a call about a hoodied vagrant curled up asleep in a bar doorway roused him and quickly recognized the bearded face of perhaps the most wanted man in America. \n Ahmad Khan Rahami \u2014 identified in an FBI bulletin just hours earlier as a man wanted in the weekend bombings in New York City and New Jersey \u2014 pulled a gun, shot the officer and triggered a running gun battle in the street that ended with Rahami wounded and in custody today, authorities said. \n A bloodied Rahami was loaded into the back of an ambulance, just 50 hours after the first blast that started it all. \n Rahami, 28, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan who lived with his Muslim family in Elizabeth, New Jersey, underwent surgery for a gunshot wound to the leg as authorities began drawing up charges in a case that spread fear across the New York area and revived anxiety about homegrown terrorism. \n New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said officials have every reason to believe the series of bombings \"was an act of terror,\" though investigators said Rahami's exact motive isn't yet clear. \n With Rahami's arrest, officials said they have no indication there are more bombs or suspects to find, though they cautioned that they are still investigating. \n Still, after a whirlwind investigation that put Rahami in custody in just two days' time, \"I'm a lot happier today than I was yesterday,\" New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill said. \n The probe started when a pipe bomb blew up Saturday morning in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity race to benefit Marines. No one was injured. \n Then a shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bomb similar to those used in the Boston Marathon attack exploded Saturday night in New York's Chelsea section, wounding 29 people, none seriously. An unexploded pressure-cooker bomb was found blocks away. \n Late Sunday night, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an Elizabeth train station. Investigators said they are still gathering evidence and have not publicly tied Rahami to those devices. \n Late Monday, a hospitalized Rahami was charged in New Jersey with five counts of attempted murder of police officers in connection with the shootout and was held on $5.2 million bail. Federal prosecutors said they were still weighing charges over the bombings. \n It wasn't known if Rahami had an attorney. Messages left for family members were not immediately returned. \n Rahami lived with his family above their fried-chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, and his relatives have clashed with the city over closing times and noise complaints they said were tinged with anti-Muslim sentiment. A childhood friend, Flee Jones, said Rahami had become more religious after returning from a trip to Afghanistan several years ago. Still, some of the family restaurant's customers said that while Rahami was devout, he was more likely to talk about his interest in cars than to mention faith. \n William Sweeney Jr., the FBI's assistant director in New York, said there were no indications Rahami was on law enforcement's radar at the time of the bombings. \n Authorities zeroed in on him as the potential bomber after a fingerprint and DNA obtained from one of the New York sites and \"clear as day\" surveillance video from the bombing scene helped identify him, according to three law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case. \n Five people were pulled over Sunday night in a vehicle associated with Rahami but were questioned and released, Sweeney said, declining to say whether they might later face charges. The law enforcement officials said at least one of Rahami's relatives was in the car, which appeared headed toward Kennedy Airport in New York after coming from New Jersey. \n Linden Mayor Derek Armstead said the break in the case came late Monday morning, when a bar owner reported someone asleep in his doorway. \n Jack Mazza, co-manager of nearby V.C.M.R. Truck Services, said the bar owner came over exclaiming about the sleeping man, and Mazza walked over to see a man curled up with a sweatshirt hood pulled over his head in the rain. \n \"He looked like a bum,\" Mazza said. \n After an officer arrived and recognized Rahami, Rahami shot the officer, who was saved by his bulletproof vest, authorities said. More officers joined in a gun battle that spilled into the street. \n Another police officer was grazed by a bullet. Authorities said neither officers' injuries were life-threatening. \n Peter Bilinskas said he was standing by his desk at his Linden bowling-supply shop when he heard what sounded like gunfire and saw a man walking down the street with a gun in his hand. \n As a police car pulled up at the traffic light in front of the shop, the man fired about six shots at the cruiser, then continued down the street with police following him, Bilinskas said. \n As the East Coast was rattled by the bombings, a man who authorities say referred to Allah wounded nine people in a stabbing rampage at a Minnesota mall Saturday before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. Authorities are investigating it as a possible terrorist attack but have not drawn any connection between the bloodshed there and the bombings. \n The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a national Muslim advocacy group, welcomed Rahami's arrest. The organization and the Afghan Embassy in Washington condemned the bombings. \n Around the time Rahami was captured, President Barack Obama was in New York on a previously scheduled visit for a meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. He called on Americans to show the world \"we will never give in to fear.\" \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called for using \"whatever lawful methods are available\" to get information from Rahami, mocked the fact that he would receive quality medical care and legal representation, and called for profiling foreigners who look like they could have connections to terrorism or certain Mideastern countries. \n Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton said her rival's anti-Muslim rhetoric gives \"aid and comfort\" to Islamic terrorists by helping them recruit fighters. \n Rahami's father, Mohammad, and two of Rahami's brothers sued the city of Elizabeth in 2011 after it passed an ordinance requiring their restaurant, First American Fried Chicken, to close early because of complaints from neighbors that it was a late-night nuisance. \n The Rahamis charged in the lawsuit that they were targeted by neighbors because they are Muslims. The lawsuit was terminated in 2012 because one of Rahami's brothers had pleaded guilty to blocking police from enforcing the restrictions on the restaurant. \n Ryan McCann, of Elizabeth, said that he often ate at the restaurant and recently began seeing Ahmad Rahami working there more. \n \"He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy, that's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home,\" McCann said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Suspect is shot and captured in New York-area bombings"}

{"date": "September 19, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A view of the Homeland Security Department headquarters in Washington, as seen in June 2015. The U.S. government has mistakenly granted citizenship to at least 858 immigrants who had pending deportation orders from countries of concern to national security or with high rates of immigration fraud, according to an internal Homeland Security audit released today. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb The U.S. government has mistakenly granted citizenship to at least 858 immigrants from countries of concern to national security or with high rates of immigration fraud who had pending deportation orders, according to an internal Homeland Security audit released today. \n The Homeland Security Department's inspector general found that the immigrants used different names or birthdates to apply for citizenship with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and such discrepancies weren't caught because their fingerprints were missing from government databases. \n The report does not identify any of the immigrants by name, but Inspector General John Roth's auditors said they were all from \"special interest countries\" \u2014 those that present a national security concern for the United States \u2014 or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud. The report did not identify those countries. \n In an emailed statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the findings reflect what has long been a problem for immigration officials \u2014 old paper-based records containing fingerprint information that can't be searched electronically. DHS says immigration officials are in the process of uploading these files and that officials will review \"every file\" identified as a case of possible fraud. \n Roth's report said fingerprints are missing from federal databases for as many as 315,000 immigrants with final deportation orders or who are fugitive criminals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not reviewed about 148,000 of those immigrants' files to add fingerprints to the digital record. \n The gap was created because older, paper records were never added to fingerprint databases created by both the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service and the FBI in the 1990s. ICE, the DHS agency responsible for finding and deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, didn't consistently add digital fingerprint records of immigrants whom agents encountered until 2010. \n The government has known about the information gap and its impact on naturalization decisions since at least 2008 when a Customs and Border Protection official identified 206 immigrants who used a different name or other biographical information to gain citizenship or other immigration benefits, though few cases have been investigated. \n Roth's report said federal prosecutors have accepted two criminal cases that led to the immigrants being stripped of their citizenship. But prosecutors declined another 26 cases. ICE is investigating 32 other cases after closing 90 investigations. \n ICE officials told auditors that the agency hadn't pursued many of these cases in the past because federal prosecutors \"generally did not accept immigration benefits fraud cases.\" ICE said the Justice Department has now agreed to focus on cases involving people who have acquired security clearances, jobs of public trust or other security credentials. \n Mistakenly awarding citizenship to someone ordered deported can have serious consequences because U.S. citizens can typically apply for and receive security clearances or take security-sensitive jobs. \n At least three of the immigrants-turned-citizens were able to acquire aviation or transportation worker credentials, granting them access to secure areas in airports or maritime facilities and vessels. Their credentials were revoked after they were identified as having been granted citizenship improperly, Roth said in his report. \n A fourth person is now a law enforcement officer. \n Roth recommended that all of the outstanding cases be reviewed and fingerprints in those cases be added to the government's database and that immigration enforcement officials create a system to evaluate each of the cases of immigrants who were improperly granted citizenship. DHS officials agreed with the recommendations and said the agency is working to implement the changes. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "More than 800 immigrants mistakenly granted citizenship"}
