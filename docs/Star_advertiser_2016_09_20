{"date": "September 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Investigators search a car at the scene of a police involved shooting in Falcon Heights, Minn. \n ATLANTA >> Philando Castile. Eric Garner. And now Terence Crutcher. Each was a black man killed in a confrontation with an officer, with the aftermath captured on video. And each time, the video leaves the impression of a wounded man left to die alone, with no sense of urgency to try to save him. \n Law enforcement experts say it's not a sign of callousness, but of trying to ensure the officers and others are safe before approaching someone who could be armed or remain a threat even after they've been shot. \n Civil rights activists call it the ultimate indignity and one more example of indifference and quick-to-shoot attitudes of police toward minorities. \n \"When the police take actions that result in injury to you and then leave you on the ground to die, well, I think that's a constitutional violation,\" said Randolph M. McLaughlin, a civil rights attorney and professor at Pace Law School in New York City. \n In the latest case, Crutcher, 40, was killed after his vehicle stalled in the middle of a street in Tulsa, Oklahoma. \n A helicopter-mounted police camera recorded Crutcher walking toward his van with his hands up. On the video, as several officers follow him, he appears to reach into the vehicle when he is shot. As he lies on the ground, the officers stand nearby but no one provides aid until about a minute or two later. \n That gap has stirred questions about why he was left in the street, motionless, unarmed and seemingly no threat. \n Law enforcement experts say that in those situations, police are furiously trying to figure out whether there are other weapons nearby, whether other people might be in the vehicle and how much of a threat the person is. Is it safe for police or EMTs to approach? All of that must be determined, no matter how badly injured the wounded person might appear. \n In countless cases, they say, people have been shot and yet still posed a threat. In one well-known 2013 case, a man in Oregon was pulled over by a state trooper; he emerged from the vehicle wearing military camouflage, fired multiple shots and then got back into his car. Although shot in the chest, he drove a mile away before collapsing from his injuries. \n More recently, the suspect in multiple stabbings at a Minnesota mall was shot three times by an off-duty officer before he succumbed to the injuries \u2014 within just an arm's length of the officer. \n Unlike the movies, which often show people falling instantly to the ground, many who are shot can still function and pose a threat. \n \"They will fight through the pain,\" said Lance LoRusso, a lawyer and former police officer in Georgia who represents officers involved in the use of deadly force. \"They had nothing in their bloodstream but determination.\" \n Beyond the police shootings in recent years, what disturbs civil rights activists are how people shot by officers are treated afterward. \n Garner, a 43-year-old man who was selling cigarettes on the street in Staten Island, died after an officer put him in a chokehold. Video of the incident shows no medical assistance was provided for at least six minutes. Castile was shot during a vehicle stop in an incident recorded by his girlfriend, who was sitting next to him. The video shows him sitting in the car, his shirt bloodied, with an officer pointing a gun at him but no one coming to his aid. \n McLaughlin, the attorney, said it's especially jarring in recent days to see Ahmad Khan Rahami, the suspect in the bombings in New York and New Jersey, being given aid and put in an ambulance after a gun battle with police. He calls it a double standard that exposes inequality. \n \"If that works for an alleged terrorist \u2014 why doesn't that same principle apply when police stop any individual in the street?\" he asked. \n McLaughlin urges citizens to not just film encounters with police but to also call 911 to ensure medical aid is provided more quickly \"because the police may not do it, out of shock out of fear, whatever.\" \n John Bostain, a former police officer in Virginia, now trains law enforcement as co-owner of Command Presence Training Associates. He said it's wrong to think officers want to shoot someone and then purposely avoid providing medical help. \n In the immediate aftermath of a shooting, he said, officers are working furiously to assess and secure the scene to make sure it's safe for the officers, any first responders as well as the public. Does the person have weapons or ready access to weapons? Is anyone else in the car who could pose a threat? It might seem to take a long time for the public viewing a video afterward, but not for the officers who are sorting through these and other questions in rapid fire, he contends. \n \"I don't see this as an overt example of cops just not giving a crap and letting this guy lay there and die,\" Bostain said. \"I think we have to understand they're human beings and their brains are processing things a thousand miles an hour. Their perception of time versus our perception of watching it on a video are totally different.\" \n \"Just because we shot somebody doesn't mean we don't want them to survive,\" he said. \"We really don't want to hurt people. \u2026 That's just not who we are.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Time gap in offering aid after police shooting stirs concern"}

{"date": "September 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Terence Crutcher, right, with his twin sister Tiffany. Crutcher, an unarmed black man was killed by a white Oklahoma officer Friday, Sept. 16, 2016, who was responding to a stalled vehicle. \n TULSA, Okla. >> The unarmed black man shot dead in the middle of a Tulsa street last week by a white police officer had run-ins with the law dating back to his teenage years and had recently served a four-year stint in prison. \n But those closest to the 40-year-old victim, Terence Crutcher, described him as a church-going father who was beginning to turn his life around. After marking his 40th birthday with his twin sister last month, Crutcher sent her a text that read, \"I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna make you all proud.\" \n Crutcher was due to start a music appreciation class at a local community college on Friday, the day he was fatally shot by Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby after she responded to a report of a stalled vehicle. \n The shooting was captured in graphic detail by a police helicopter and a cruiser dashcam, though it's not clear from that footage what led Shelby to draw her gun or what orders officers gave Crutcher. An attorney representing Crutcher's family says Crutcher committed no crime and gave officers no reason to shoot him. \n Shelby was put on paid administrative leave while local and federal officials investigate the shooting. \n Crutcher's criminal history includes a 1995 arrest in nearby Osage County in which officers reported they saw him fire his weapon out a vehicle window. Records obtained by The Associated Press on Tuesday show that when Crutcher was ordered to exit the vehicle for a pat-down search, he began making a movement to his right ankle before an officer managed to get control of Crutcher. A .25-caliber pistol was found in his right sock, the arresting officer wrote in an affidavit. \n Crutcher eventually entered a no-contest plea to charges of carrying a weapon and resisting an officer and received suspended sentences, court records show. \n Oklahoma prison officials confirmed Tuesday that Crutcher also served four years in prison from 2007 to 2011 on a Tulsa County drug trafficking conviction. \n Crutcher's family could not be reached for comment on his criminal record. But an attorney for his family, Melvin Hall, said those details were not known by police at the scene. \n \"Nobody claimed that he was a perfect individual. Who is perfect? But that night he was not a criminal,\" Hall said. \"He did not have any warrants. He had not done anything wrong. He had a malfunctioning vehicle, and he should have been treated accordingly.\" \n Terence Crutcher was scheduled to begin the music class at Tulsa Community College on the day he was shot, and TCC President Leigh Goodson said in a statement that Crutcher had talked with staff about his desire to be successful in college. \n \"He brought to TCC his talents, hopes and dreams of creating a successful life by dedicating himself to completing a degree,\" Goodson said. \n Crutcher's sister, Tiffany Crutcher, described his text message at a press conference on Monday, where she also called for charges against Shelby. \n On Friday, two 911 calls describing an SUV that had been abandoned in the middle of the road preceded the fatal encounter between Crutcher and the police. One unidentified caller said the driver of the stalled vehicle was acting strangely, adding, \"I think he's smoking something.\" \n Tulsa Police Sgt. Dave Walker told the Tulsa World on Tuesday that investigators recovered one vial of PCP in Crutcher's SUV, but he declined to say where in the vehicle it was found or whether officers determined if Crutcher used it Friday evening. \n An autopsy and toxicology results are pending, and police said the toxicology report could take several weeks. \n Attorneys for Crutcher's family said the man's relatives did not know whether drugs were found in his vehicle and, even if they were, that wouldn't justify his fatal shooting. \n PCP or phencyclidine, also called angel dust, can cause slurred speech, loss of coordination and a sense of strength or invulnerability, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. At high doses, it can cause hallucinations and paranoia. \n Police video shows Crutcher walking toward his SUV, which is stopped in the middle of the road. His hands are up and a female officer is following him. As Crutcher approaches the driver's side of the SUV, more officers arrive and Crutcher appears to lower his hands and place them on the vehicle before the officers surround him. \n Crutcher can be seen dropping to the ground. Someone on the police radio says, \"I think he may have just been tasered.\" Then almost immediately, someone can be heard yelling, \"Shots fired!\" and Crutcher is left lying in the street. \n Police Chief Chuck Jordan said Monday that Crutcher had no weapon on him or in his SUV when he was shot. \n Shelby's attorney, Scott Wood, said Crutcher was not following the officers' commands and that Shelby was concerned because he kept reaching for his pocket as if he was carrying a weapon. \n \"He has his hands up and is facing the car and looks at Shelby, and his left hand goes through the car window, and that's when she fired her shot,\" Wood told the Tulsa World. \n But attorneys for Crutcher's family challenged that claim Tuesday, presenting an enlarged photo from the police footage that appeared to show that Crutcher's window was rolled up. \n Local and federal investigations are underway to determine whether Crutcher's civil rights were violated and whether Shelby should face charges. Hundreds of protesters rallied Tuesday night outside police headquarters in downtown Tulsa calling for her firing. \n Betty Shelby's mother-in-law, Lois Shelby, said the officer is grieving for Crutcher's family and isn't prejudiced. She told the AP in a phone interview Tuesday that Shelby \"thought she had to protect her own life\" when she shot Crutcher. \n \"She wouldn't harm anyone. We're all sick. We feel for the (Crutcher) family,\" Lois Shelby said. \"But, you know, we have a family that goes out every day and faces life and death. And when she is being accused of things she didn't do wrong, it's too much, and they don't think about our family.\" \n The shooting comes four months after ex-Tulsa County volunteer deputy Robert Bates was sentenced to four years in prison on a second-degree manslaughter conviction in an unarmed black man's 2015 death. Bates said he mistakenly grabbed his gun instead of his Taser. Shelby worked as a Tulsa County sheriff's deputy for four years before joining the Tulsa Police Department in December 2011, officials said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Family: Tulsa shooting victim was turning his life around"}

{"date": "September 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A pharmacist holds a package of EpiPens epinephrine auto-injector, a Mylan product, in Sacramento, Calif. \n WASHINGTON >> The head of pharmaceutical company Mylan is defending the cost for life-saving EpiPens, signaling the company has no plans to lower prices despite a public outcry and questions from skeptical lawmakers. \n \"Price and access exist in a balance, and we believe we have struck that balance,\" Heather Bresch says in prepared testimony released by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee ahead of her Wednesday appearance before the panel. \n The price of EpiPens has grown to $608 for a two-pack, an increase of more than 500 percent since 2007. Republicans and Democrats have said families struggling to pay for the emergency allergy shots have every right to be outraged by Mylan, a company whose sales are in excess of $11 billion. \n Bresch says in the testimony that she wishes the company had \"better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration\" of the rising prices for some families. \n \"We never intended this,\" she says. \n But she says investments are necessary to ensure more access for those who need it and the company has made strides to more widely distribute the drug to schools and others. \n \"We don't want to go back to a time \u2014 not that long ago \u2014 when awareness of anaphylaxis was much lower and epinephrine auto injectors were only available in schools with a prescription for an individual child,\" she says. \"Achieving this level of expansion of awareness requires significant investment.\" \n House Oversight chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and the panel's top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, have said they also want to examine ways to encourage greater competition in the EpiPen market. \n \"Our goal is to work together to ensure that critical medications, like the EpiPen, are accessible and affordable for all of our constituents,\" Chaffetz and Cummings said in a joint statement last week. \n Bresch has some familiarity with Capitol Hill \u2014 she is the daughter of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. But lawmakers so far haven't given any deference to her because she is related to a colleague. Several other committees have called for investigations into the matter. \n EpiPens are used in emergencies to stop potentially fatal allergic reactions to insect bites and stings, and foods like nuts and eggs. People usually keep multiple EpiPens handy at home, school or work, but the syringes, prefilled with the hormone epinephrine, expire after a year. \n Bresch noted that Mylan has said it will begin selling its generic version for $300 for a pair. That will still bring Mylan tens of millions of dollars while helping it retain market share against current and future brand-name and generic competition. \n The company has also offered coupon cards and has doubled the limit for eligibility for its patient assistance program. \n Critics have said the coupons, discount cards and patient assistance programs aren't real solutions because many customers won't use them or won't qualify for them. \n In her testimony, Bresch says she understands there is considerable concern and skepticism about the pricing. She says some think the company makes $600 off each EpiPen, but that is not true. \n She says the company makes about $50 per pen after rebates, fees, materials and other costs are subtracted. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mylan CEO set to defend EpiPen prices amid public outcry"}

The United States also flew two B-1B bombers over South Korea on Sept. 13. \n \"What we are showing today is just one tool we have to choose from a wide array of options. The alliance grows stronger every day and we remain prepared to defend and to preserve the security of the Korean Peninsula and the region,\" Lt. Gen. Thomas Bergeson, commander of the U.S. 7th Air Force in South Korea, said in a statement. \n North Korea uses such flyovers and the American military presence in the South in its propaganda as alleged proof of U.S. hostility, which it says is the reason it needs a nuclear weapons program. After last week's flyover, North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency described the B-1B as an \"ill-famed nuclear war means\" and accused the United States of resorting to \"nuclear threat and blackmail\" against the North. \n The B-1B doesn't currently carry nuclear weapons under a disarmament treaty, and some U.S. experts do not consider them as nuclear capable in their current configuration. \n Military experts raise concerns that North Korea is moving closer toward obtaining the ability to put nuclear warheads on a variety of its ballistic missiles, a growing arsenal that one day may include a reliable weapon that could reach the U.S. mainland. \n North Korea conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test to date on Sept. 9, claiming it as a successful nuclear warhead detonation that proved its ability to mass produce \"standardized\" nuclear weapons that could be used on missiles. \n There is a possibility that North Korea will follow its latest nuclear test with a long-range rocket launch as it did after its fourth nuclear test in January. The North's state media on Tuesday said leader Kim Jong Un observed a ground test of a new rocket engine and ordered a satellite launch preparation. \n Outsiders view North Korea's space launches as a cover for banned ballistic missile tests as the country openly pursues long-range nuclear weapons. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. flies bombers over South Korea again in show of force"}

They continued into early Wednesday morning, when TV footage showed dozens of protesters on Interstate 85 facing a line of law enforcement officers. At one point a fire flared up. \n Neither the North Carolina Highway Patrol nor Charlotte police could immediately be reached for comment. The North Carolina Department of Transportation website showed a portion of I-85 near UNC Charlotte was closed in both directions. The website said the closure is due to police activity. \n Earlier in the night, a larger group of demonstrators gathered near the scene of the shooting. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department tweeted that demonstrators were destroying marked police vehicles and that approximately 12 officers had been injured, including one who was hit in the face with a rock. Photos and TV video showed police firing tear gas to break up the crowd. Some officers were in riot gear. \n The unrest in Charlotte came just hours after another demonstration in Tulsa, Oklahoma, over the shooting there of an unarmed black man by police. \n Charlotte police officers went to the complex about 4 p.m. looking for a suspect with an outstanding warrant when they saw Scott \u2014 who was not the suspect they were looking for \u2014 inside a car, department spokesman Keith Trietley said in a statement. \n Officers saw Scott get out of the car with a gun and then get back in, Trietley said. When officers approached, the man exited the car with the gun again. At that point, officers deemed the man a threat and at least one fired a weapon, he said. \n Scott was taken to Carolinas Medical Center and pronounced dead. \n Officer Brentley Vinson, who shot Scott, has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure in such cases. Vinson has been with the department for two years. \n Detectives recovered a gun at the scene and were interviewing witnesses, Trietley said. \n Police blocked access to the area, which is about a mile from the campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, as protesters gathered after the shooting. \n Video from WCCB-TV in Charlotte showed police in riot gear stretched across a two-lane road confronting protesters at the apartment complex later in the night. Some of the officers flanked the main line on one side of the road. \n Some protesters were heard yelling \"Black lives matter,\" and \"Hands up, don't shoot!\" One person held up a sign saying \"Stop Killing Us.\" \n Other footage showed protesters lingering around a police vehicle after shattering its windows. \n One television news crew retreated from the scene after demonstrators began rocking their remote van, which was parked near the apartment complex where the shooting occurred. \n Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts appealed for calm and tweeted that \"the community deserves answers.\" \n In Tulsa, hundreds of people rallied outside police headquarters calling for the firing of police officer Betty Shelby, who shot 40-year-old Terence Crutcher on Friday during a confrontation in the middle of a road that was captured on police dashcam and helicopter video. \n Shelby's attorney has said Crutcher was not following the officers' commands and that Shelby was concerned because he kept reaching for his pocket as if he was carrying a weapon.

{"date": "September 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n An assistant demonstrates the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone to a visitor at a Samsung Electronics display booth during an electronics expo in Beijing. \n BEIJING >> Liu Jingtang was a Samsung loyalist. The Shanghai technology consultant traded up steadily through its smartphones to the new Note 7. But Liu's devotion was shaken by the Korean tech giant's confusing response to its latest product safety scare. \n Liu, 32, said Samsung Electronics quickly confirmed his Note 7 wasn't covered by a recall announced last week. But he said after reports China might have suffered its first explosion of the problem-plagued phone, Samsung's announcement that it saw no problem with the battery with no other explanation left him baffled. \n \"My loyalty to Samsung is bound to decline by a lot,\" said Liu. \"Samsung was my priority, but not anymore.\" \n China should be a bright spot for Samsung as it wrestles with a global recall of 2.5 million of its new flagship smartphones. The company has not confirmed any in China suffer the same problems that led to fires in the United States. But its brand has been battered by complaints it is doing too little to reassure Chinese owners their handsets are safe. \n The potential damage to its image threatens to disrupt Samsung's efforts to use the Note 7 to propel faster growth in a crowded Chinese market where it has slipped to sixth place after being the No. 1 brand as recently as mid-2014. \n Chinese consumers are unusually alert to safety issues following an avalanche of scandals over shoddy or fake food, medicines and other goods. They also are sensitive about being treated as well as Western consumers. \n \"I think consumers are pretty unhappy with Samsung,\" said Ben Cavender of China Market Research Group. \"Consumers start to feel like they are being taken advantage of, that they are not being accorded the same respect here as they are abroad.\" \n Asked what it was doing to reassure Chinese consumers, Samsung said in a statement it is confident about the safety of Note 7s sold by authorized outlets. \n IKEA suffered a similar backlash in June after the Swedish furniture recalled dressers in the United States and Canada due to concerns they could tip over and harm children. When the company didn't immediately do the same in China, people posted angry comments online asking whether it valued Chinese lives less. IKEA announced a recall in China in July. \n Samsung has blamed the fires on a manufacturing flaw in batteries and said Note 7 units sold in China would not be affected because theirs came from a different supplier. \n On Monday, Samsung said its investigation into the first report of a Galaxy Note 7 fire in China found unspecified \"external factors\" might be to blame. It said it was unable to investigate a second fire report because the consumer refused to hand over the charred phone. \n Liu, the technology consultant, said the statement made him question why Note 7 phones sold in China would be different from those sold abroad. \n \"They hastily put out this statement. Was that really good? I think it was unsatisfactory,\" said Liu. As for external factors, he said, \"does that mean the customer deliberately heated it over a fire? That doesn't make much sense.\" \n Samsung surprised customers by saying no phones in China were covered by its global recall and then recalling 1,858 phones. It said those were distributed for testing before sales to the public began. \n \"For Samsung to recall only 1,858 units in China while it recalls 1 million in the United States seems insincere,\" said a comment left on a website of the Communist Party newspaper People's Daily. \n \"Whether those phones that are not recalled will wind up being a problem or not will be a bomb planted in the hearts of customers,\" it said. \n Samsung is the world's biggest smartphone brand by number of units sold but in China it trails market leader Huawei Technology Ltd. and three other local brands \u2014 Vivo, Xiaomi and Oppo. Apple Inc.'s iPhone was in fifth place in the first half of this year. \n The Note 7 \"was a good opportunity (to expand sales), but they blew it,\" said Liu. \n Working in Samsung's favor is the fact that phones are sold through retailers in China instead of carriers. That allows users to switch brands quickly and new competitors to enter the market. \n \"In any given month, a brand is going to leapfrog another brand and come up with a brighter screen or bigger battery of faster charging,\" said Cavender. \n On Tuesday, the Note 7 was on sale at electronics retailers and shops run by state-owned phone carrier China Mobile Ltd., though employees said customers were asking about the reports of explosions. \n \"Sales for Note 7 were slightly affected by the incident but we are still selling them,\" said a saleswoman who was reached by phone at an outlet of Suning, the country's biggest electronics retailer, in the Wangjing neighborhood on Bejiing's northeast side. \"We are making explanations to customers every day, it is up to the customer to believe it or not.\" \n The Note 7 was sold out in black and only available in gold at a China Mobile store in the capital's eastern business district, said a salesman who would give only his surname, Li. He said a customer bought one Tuesday and no one asked about the report of an explosion. \n \"There are some customers who only favor Samsung and they don't bother asking questions,\" said Li. \n Longer term, the Note 7 in China is likely to \"take a major sales hit,\" said Cavender. \n \"People who want to buy a phone are going to switch to Apple or to a local brand like Huawei,\" said Cavender. \"Or if they want a Samsung, they probably are going to wait for the next generation, because they don't want to take the risk that they will get a faulty product.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Samsung suffers backlash in China over smartphone response"}

{"date": "September 20, 2016", "text": "BEIJING >> In films, women and girls are much more likely to take off their clothes than male actors and to be scantily clad in the first place, studies show. Less than a third of speaking characters are female and men outnumber women behind the camera by a ratio of five to one. \n Campaigners are highlighting this gender inequality in film at the China Women's Film Festival that runs until Sunday in Beijing, arguing that the phenomenon distorts views of women and the world, and that the male-dominated film industry repeats the same mistakes out of habit. \n The nine-day festival features more than 30 Chinese and international films about women's rights, women's achievements and gay women, which are then slated to be shown in more than 10 cities across China. \n Festival chairman Li Dan said the aim was to increase the representation of women in film at a time when Chinese audiences have apparently accepted gender inequality in movies. \n \"Usually people and audiences have the idea that female characters should be pretty, be looking for a good marriage or a rich man or a Mr. Right, and if the movie follows that path it will have a good box office,\" said Li, who works for Crossroads Center Beijing, a nonprofit working with marginalized groups and the festival organizer. \"Very few movies have strong female roles and characters.\" \n Hollywood actresses have also spoken out about a lack of good roles for women and the gender pay gap, among them Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Streep, who starred in the festival's opening film \"Suffragette,\" about British women's fight for the vote in the early 20th century. \n In the last three years, a campaign has gradually been gaining ground to raise awareness of the unequal representation of men and women in movies based on the Bechdel Wallace test, which started out as a joke in a 1986 comic book. To pass the test, a film must have two female characters with names who talk to each other in the film about something other than men. Films that fail the test include \"Avatar,\" \"Slumdog Millionaire\" and \"The Jungle Book.\" \n Li said that at the end of the festival they plan to write an open letter signed by at least 50 celebrities to major Chinese film producers and cinema companies calling on them to use the test in the hope that it will affect the type of films that are produced and raise awareness of gender inequality in film and society. He also hopes to attract tens of thousands of signatures from the public. \n The sponsors of the festival, which runs until Sunday, include the embassies of Holland, Norway, France, Sweden and Britain, and the European Union delegation. \n Other independent film festivals have run into trouble from Chinese authorities, but Li said they did not choose films with politically sensitive topics, such as the recently loosened one-child policy. Although China's constitution enshrines gender equality, some nongovernmental groups promoting women's rights have been closed over the last 18 months amid a more general crackdown on political activism. \n Ellen Tejle, who runs an arthouse cinema in the Swedish capital of Stockholm, launched the \"A-rate\" campaign three years ago to encourage producers, cinemas and the public to submit a film to the Bechdel Wallace gender bias test. \n At the China Women's Film Festival, Tejle said that internationally, 7 percent of directors are women and women have 30 percent of the speaking roles \u2014 and this hasn't changed since the 1940s. \n Even Disney characters Mulan and Pocahontas, who are the protagonists of their respective films, speak for less than a quarter of the speaking time of all the characters, Tejle said. Women's characters are often limited to mothers, wives, girlfriends and princesses and shown without jobs, while male roles are funny, strong and heroic, affecting the dreams that children have for their own lives, she said. \n In China, movies tended to portray the ruling Communist Party's ideal of gender equality up until the 1990s, when the film industry went commercial with a view to making money. \"Since then, the proportion of female roles has gone down, and sometimes if you remove their roles it wouldn't affect the overall movie,\" said Li. \n Debunking the idea that films with women in the lead role aren't bankable, a study by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media in Los Angeles found that they outgrossed films with a male lead: Among the top 100 grossing non-animated films in North America of 2015, movies with female leads made on average $90 million, while those with male leads made $76 million. \n Other research has found that in the 11 countries with the biggest box office, a quarter of actresses are shown partially or fully naked as opposed to just over a tenth of male actors. That study, sponsored by the Geena Davis Institute and carried out by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California, also found that female teens were just as likely to be sexualized \u2014 shown in sexy attire or partially naked\u2014 in films as women aged 21 to 39. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n AP news assistant Henry Hou contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Louise Watt on Twitter at https://twitter.com/louise\u2014watt \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Chinese film festival pushes for end to gender inequality"}

Hanson, who won an Oscar for the screenplay for L.A. Confidential and directed Eminem in the movie 8 Mile, has died. \n LOS ANGELES >> Curtis Hanson, who won a screenwriting Oscar for \"L.A. Confidential\" and directed the psychological thriller \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" and Eminem's tale of Detroit hip-hop \"8 Mile,\" has died. He was 71. \n Paramedics declared Hanson dead at his Hollywood Hills home late Tuesday afternoon, Los Angeles police spokesman Tony Im said. Hanson died of natural causes, Im said, but he did not have further details. \n A native of Reno, Nevada, who grew up in Los Angeles, Hanson dropped out of high school to work as a photographer, writer and editor for the magazine \"Cinema.\" \n \"It was, in a sense, my film school,\" Hanson said in a 2002 interview with the Guardian. \n He began screenwriting and directing in the early 1970s, but didn't see serious success until directing 1992's \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.\" The film starring Rebecca De Mornay as a revenge-seeking nanny became a major hit. \n Hanson went on to direct 1994's \"The River Wild\" with Meryl Streep and Kevin Bacon, and 2000's \"Wonder Boys\" with Tobey Maguire and Michael Douglas. \n His breakthrough as an acclaimed filmmaker came with 1997's \"L.A.

{"date": "September 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gestures during a campaign stop at Temple University in Philadelphia, Monday. \n WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. >> For months, Democrats argued that voters would get \"serious\" about the campaign once it reached the fall and would reject Donald Trump's no-holds-barred approach. \n They're still waiting. \n With fewer than 50 days left, polling shows a tightening national race and \u2014 most unnerving to Democrats \u2014 a Trump rise in key battleground states. But as Trump's provocative appeal gains traction, Hillary Clinton is sticking with the traditional playbook: Lots of attack ads, a focus on getting out the vote and intense preparation for next week's first general election debate. \n Her approach underscores what's emerged as a central question of the 2016 campaign: Can Clinton's play-it-safe political strategy win against a chaos candidate? \n Even President Barack Obama, who long dismissed the idea of a future Trump administration, has started ringing alarm bells, warning Democratic supporters to expect a tight race that Clinton could possibly lose. Recent polls suggest the Republican may have an edge in Iowa and Ohio and is likely in a close race with Clinton in Florida and North Carolina. \n \"This guy is not qualified to be president,\" Obama told donors at a Manhattan fundraiser on Sunday. \"This should not be a close election, but it will be.\" \n Clinton's campaign, Democrats say, has little choice but to stick with its plan. The always-measured Clinton, they argue, can't out-improvise one of the most unpredictable politicians of the modern era. \n \"We're going through the roller-coaster rides of campaigns. All she can do is just keep plowing ahead,\" said Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist who ran Obama's Florida operation in 2008 and advised him four years later. \"She's going to win it by grinding it out.\" \n Hoping to calm some supporters' concerns, Clinton's campaign sent out a memo Monday, reminding them that the electoral map favors Democrats. The memo charted various paths to 270 electoral votes and urged backers to channel their worry into volunteering. \n \"Battleground states carry that name for a reason: They're going to be close, from now until Election Day,\" wrote campaign manager Robby Mook. \"But we are going to win them because we've spent the past year building a superior ground game to communicate our message and turn our people out to vote. So instead of worrying, let's just get to work!\" \n But Trump, who lacks Clinton's organized effort on the ground but regularly fills massive arenas, is far from a standard opponent. In the primary, he knocked off more than a dozen rivals who took a basically standard approach to his unpredictable rhetoric. \n \"Everybody in the primary at one point or another tried to take Donald Trump down in the way you take someone down who says absurd things and none of them worked,\" said Rick Tyler, a former aide to primary rival Sen. Ted Cruz. \"She's trying to do more of the same. And more of the same isn't working.\" \n Clinton aides see next week's debate at Hofstra University as a key moment. The Monday night match-up will finally give voters a chance to compare the candidates side-by-side. \n Clinton must communicate the \"contrast and choice to voters that are tuning in for the first time,\" said spokesman Brian Fallon. \n For his part, Trump has begun taking baby steps toward becoming a slightly more traditional candidate, reading off teleprompters, rolling out policy proposals and making overtures to minorities \u2014 creating even more uncertainty among Democrats about how he'll act on the debate stage. \n Though aides decline to detail debate preparations, Clinton has built a lot of downtime into her schedule for recent weeks. Then there was the pneumonia episode. \n She is holding sessions with experienced Democratic debate experts, including Ron Klain, Karen Dunn and Robert Barnett, all of whom advised Obama. One closely held secret: the identity of the person playing Trump in the sessions. \n \"In an unpredictable race against an unpredictable candidate, by definition the only thing you can control is what you do,\" said Mo Elleithee, a former Clinton aide who's now head of the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service. \"They're focusing on that.\" \n While Clinton has been prepping, her team has stuck with its strategy: Define Trump in the summer with a barrage of negative ads. \n Clinton' campaign and allies have spent more than $180 million on TV and radio advertising between mid-June and this week, according to Kantar Media's political ad tracker. Trump and his supporters spent about $40 million in the same time period. \n It's a strategy that mirrors the one pursued by Obama during his re-election campaign, when his team barraged Mitt Romney through the summer with ads casting him as an out-of-touch plutocrat. \n But Clinton, with deep unfavorability ratings of her own, is a far different candidate from Obama. Her team is making a renewed push to ensure turnout from groups who supported the president \u2014 young voters, Latinos and African-Americans. But she acknowledges she has work to do, telling young voters in Philadelphia on Monday she understands they \"may still have some questions\" about her. \n Looking to the debates, Clinton says she's ready for whatever Trump sends her way. \n \"I am going to do my very best to communicate as clearly and \u2013 and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we've seen coming from my opponent,\" she said on \"The Steve Harvey Morning Show.\" \"I understand it's a contact sport.\" \n WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. >> (AP) \u2014 Hillary Clinton accused Donald Trump of giving \"aid and comfort\" to Islamic terrorists Monday, declaring after a weekend of violent attacks in three states that his anti-Muslim rhetoric helps groups like ISIS recruit new fighters. Trump showed no sign of changing, casting \"many\" foreigners coming to the U.S. as a \"cancer within.\" \n The Democratic presidential candidate touted her own national security credentials at a hastily arranged news conference outside her campaign plane, saying she was the most qualified to combat terrorism and accusing Republican Trump for using the incidents to make \"some kind of demagogic point.\" \n \"I'm the only candidate in this race who's been part of the hard decisions to take terrorists off the battlefield,\" Clinton, a former secretary of state, told reporters. \"I have sat at that table in the Situation Room.\" \n She added: \"I know how to do this.\" \n The possibility of a home-grown terrorist plot cast a long shadow over the presidential race, diverting both candidates' attention from the daily controversies of the presidential race and giving them a high-profile opportunity to make their case to undecided voters. \n Clinton and her team see her experience and what they say is her steady judgment as key selling points for her candidacy. On the campaign trail, she frequently invokes her role in the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, describing to voters the tense atmosphere in the White House alongside President Barack Obama. \n But while much of the foreign policy establishment has rallied around Clinton, Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, promises to close U.S. borders and vows to aggressively profile potential terrorists have fueled his presidential bid. \n On Monday, he hit hard on those points, calling for tougher policing, including profiling foreigners who look like they could have connections to terrorism or certain Mideastern nations. \n \"Knock the hell out of 'em,\" Trump said on \"Fox and Friends\" in a telephone interview. \n \"We don't want to do any profiling,\" he said of current U.S. policy. \"If somebody looks like he has a massive bomb on his back, we won't go up to that person and say I'm sorry because if he looks like he comes from that part of the world we're not allowed to profile. \u2026 Give me a break.\" \n Pointing to her \"aid and comfort\" remark and others, Trump's campaign said Clinton was accusing him of treason, going beyond the bounds of acceptable campaigning and trying to change the subject from her own failures. Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon responded: \"The Trump campaign can call it whatever they want; Hillary Clinton will continue to call it out.\" \n Clinton urged voters not to \"get diverted and distracted by the kind of campaign rhetoric we hear from the other side.\" She insinuated that Islamic militants, particularly those affiliated with ISIS, are rooting for Trump to win the White House. The Republican has said he would bar immigration from nations with ties to terrorism. \n \"We're going after the bad guys and we're going to get them, but we're not going to go after an entire religion,\" Clinton said. \n Clinton briefly turned her focus from national security on Monday, wooing younger voters at a midday rally in Philadelphia. \n At an invitation-only event at Temple University, she acknowledged that she needs to do more to get millennials on board. \n \"Even if you are totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me. I get that. And I want to do my best to answer those questions,\" she told several hundred students gathered in an ornate, wood-paneled lecture hall. \n This election marks the first presidential campaign where millennials make up the single largest generation among U.S. adults, having surpassed baby boomers during the past four years. The group helped anchor Obama's support, but Clinton has failed to attract them in the same numbers. \n She was to meet with the leaders of Egypt, Ukraine and Japan late in the day in New York City. The leaders are in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. Trump announced plans to meet with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi on Monday. \n New York officials said Monday the bombings in a Manhattan neighborhood and a New Jersey shore town were looking increasingly like acts of terrorism with a foreign connection. Authorities were also investigating the stabbings of nine people at a Minnesota mall as a possible act of terrorism. \n An Afghan immigrant wanted for questioning in the bombings was captured in New Jersey Monday after being wounded in a gun battle with police, authorities said. \n The events came as both candidates were dealing with missteps. Trump and his allies spent Sunday \u2014 repeatedly and falsely \u2014 accusing Clinton of pushing the idea that President Obama was not born in the U.S. \u2014 a conspiracy theory long championed by Trump himself. \n Clinton, meanwhile, is still facing questions about her health and openness after a video caught her staggering after abruptly leaving a 9/11 ceremony. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "As Trump rises, Clinton struggles with traditional playbook"}

She also refused to remove herself from her client's case, which the judge postponed to Thursday. \n Several supporters wore a similar lapel button: Black, about the size of a silver dollar, with white letters. Attorney Jonathan MacArthur said he'll wear it again to Herndon's courtroom on Thursday. \n \"This is an issue about criminal justice,\" Ballou told the judge. \n She noted that some deputy district attorneys wear small office badge-type lapel pins, and that uniformed court officers are allowed to wear symbolic black bands on their badges to mourn police officers killed on duty. \n \"This is not political speech. It is not supporting a particular candidate,\" she said of her pin. \"I believe a courtroom is the proper place.\" \n Ballou, a public defender for 11 years, said outside court that she took her stand after the head of the Las Vegas police union sent a letter last week to the chief state district court judge, David Barker, complaining that what the union executive termed \"'Black Lives Matter' propaganda\" had no place in courtrooms. \n \"We are certain that the courts would not allow similar public displays from citizens who believe that killers should be sentenced to death or that sexual predators should be castrated,\" Las Vegas Police Protective Association director Steve Grammas wrote. \"While we embrace the First Amendment, we do not believe that such statements should be made in the halls of justice.\" \n Grammas said in a brief email that he raised the issue at the request of a union member, who was \"satisfied to have the issue addressed.\" Grammas didn't immediately respond to follow-up questions. \n Barker was in court hearings and unavailable to immediately respond to messages. \n A court spokeswoman, Mary Ann Price, pointed to court rules of conduct making judges responsible for applying rules of decorum, proper attire and dignity. \n Herndon, who earlier asked court spectators to cover T-shirts they'd worn to support victims in another case, told Ballou he tries to keep his courtroom free of outside influences. \n The pin, the judge said, \"is making a political statement, that, 'I wear this in protest of how the court is treating minority defendants.'\" \n \"Wear it in the hallway. Wear it in front of the courthouse,\" Herndon added. \"Demonstrate. Protest. Use your voice. But that's not what dealing with justice on an individual case is about.\" \n Ballou, a self-described \"middle-aged, middle-income\" woman, said she feared for her life when she was surrounded by four Nevada Highway Patrol officers during a traffic stop for a driving infraction last July 4. \n \"People are getting killed in the streets every day. People who look like me,\" she said. \"Black Lives Matter is not a protest against police. It is a protest against police brutality.\" \n She said she was moved to wear the pin after hearing about the police union letter, amid a backdrop of high-profile police shootings of black men that have ignited protests and a national dialogue about race in America. \n Ballou also invoked recent national anthem protests by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick over racial injustice, including comments he made to the media that \"people don't realize what's really going on.\" \n In Las Vegas, race in criminal justice has been a controversial issue in recent years. \n The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department drew scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department's office of Community Oriented Policing Services and began in 2013 to change a range of policies after a review of officer-involved shootings over several years. \n The seven-month COPS review looked at 87 cases of police use of deadly force from 2007 to 2012.

We will announce it in New York,\" Moroccan Environment Minister Hakima el-Haite told The Associated Press. \n In the world of international diplomacy, this is considered a blistering pace, reflecting a sense of urgency in the fight against global warming and a desire to seal the deal before Ban and U.S. President Barack Obama leave office. \n After years of negotiations, governments agreed in Paris last December to curb the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that scientists say are warming the planet. \n Ban, who has made climate change a top priority since he became secretary-general nearly 10 years ago, urged world leaders in his keynote speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday to bring the Paris Agreement into force by the end of the year. \n \"The Earth assails us with rising seas, record heat and extreme storms,\" Ban said. \"With the Paris Agreement on climate change, we are tackling the defining challenge of our time.\" \n U.S. diplomats are also pushing other countries to accelerate their ratification efforts so that the deal can enter into force this year. The White House says Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry plan to corner foreign leaders in the hallways during the U.N. gathering to personally pressure them to join this week. \n \"We're very anxious to have it move forward quickly,\" U.S. climate envoy Jonathan Pershing told the AP. \"We are talking to everybody about the urgency.\" \n Pershing said the haste comes down to the fact that \"this is a problem that can't wait.\" \n Others say another factor is the potential of a shift in U.S. climate policy depending on the outcome of the presidential election in November. Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton has said the U.S. must implement the Paris Agreement, but Republican candidate Donald Trump has said he will cancel the deal. \n \"The Obama administration clearly would like to see this done before they leave office,\" said Alden Meyer, a veteran observer of the U.N. climate talks at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \n \"That doesn't guarantee that the next president will fully implement Paris,\" Meyer said. \"But it would take at least four years for the U.S. to formally withdraw.\" \n The Paris Agreement asks both rich and poor countries to take action to curb the rise in global temperatures that is melting glaciers, raising sea levels and shifting rainfall patterns across the globe. It requires governments to present national plans to reduce emissions, though the targets themselves aren't internationally binding. \n The European Union, which considers itself as one of the architects of the Paris deal, is trying to fast-track its ratification process to avoid the embarrassment of sitting on the sidelines when it comes into force. \n The EU, which accounts for 12 percent of global emissions, originally planned to wait for its 28 member states to approve the deal domestically, but now wants to ratify it on their behalf. \n \"It's technically possible,\" said Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, a spokeswoman for EU Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete. \"But politically it's a decision of the member states.\" \n With or without the EU, there's a chance that the deal can enter into force as early as the next U.N. climate conference, which starts Nov. 7 in Marrakech, Morocco. \n For some the timing is mostly symbolic, because the first round of emissions targets doesn't start until 2020. For others, like the island nations who face an existential risk from rising seas, it's imperative that countries prepare to implement \u2014 and improve \u2014 their targets as soon as possible. \n \"We cannot wait,\" said Maldives Environment Minister Thoriq Ibrahim, who chairs an alliance of small island states. \"We are at the forefront of climate change and we are the people who will suffer if there is no action taken early.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n AP writers Edith M.

They did not release the pilots' names or any information about the condition of the surviving airman. \n The aircraft, assigned to the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron, crashed in the Sutter Buttes, a mountain range about 60 miles (97 kilometers) north of Sacramento. \n Col. Larry Broadwell, the base commander, said the flight, including its flight path was routine before the crash. He pledged to support the family of the deceased pilot and said surveillance pilots will mourn the loss. \n \"These incidents, while extremely tragic and hard for us to overcome, they're incidents that we do overcome,\" Broadwell said. \"I am confident that the U-2 squadrons here and the U-2 squadrons around the world are going to come off the mat stronger than they were before.\" \n The U-2 \"Dragon Lady\" is a surveillance and reconnaissance plane capable of flying above 70,000 feet (21,336 meters), an extremely high altitude that's twice as high as a typical commercial airliner flies. The U-2 is known as one of the most difficult aircraft to fly at low altitudes due to the characteristics that allow it to travel near space, according to an Air Force fact sheet. \n Beale Air Force Base is home to the Air Force's fleet of single-seat U-2s and a double-seat variant used for training pilots to fly the specialized aircraft. It also is the base for the T-38 Talon, a training aircraft, and the RQ-4 Global Hawk, an unmanned surveillance drone. It houses 4,500 military personnel. \n \"We are saddened by our Airman's death & offer condolences to the family & all who are mourning this tremendous loss,\" Gen. Dave Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, said on Twitter. \n Ejection seats allow military pilots to get out of a stricken plane and parachute safely to the ground. After the death in this instance, military investigators will look into whether the chute properly deployed and whether the pilot hit debris after ejecting, said Michael Barr, an aviation safety instructor at University of Southern California who flew fighter missions in Vietnam. \n \"If the chute didn't properly deploy, that would be fatal,\" Barr said. \n The U-2 is slated for retirement in 2019 as the military relies increasingly on unmanned aircraft for intelligence gathering, though senior U.S. lawmakers from California are pressuring the Air Force to delay the retirement. \n A U-2 based at Beale crashed in 1996 and slammed into the parking lot of a newspaper in Oroville, California. The pilot and a woman who had just renewed her newspaper subscription were killed. \n ", "author": "By Associated Press", "title": "1 Air Force pilot dead, 1 hurt after ejecting in California"}

{"date": "September 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Ahmad Khan Rahami. \n NEW YORK \u00bb Ahmad Khan Rahami vowed to martyr himself rather than be caught after setting off explosives in New York and New Jersey, and he'd hoped in a handwritten journal championing jihad that \"the sounds of bombs will be heard in the streets,\" federal terrorism charges lodged against him today alleged. \n Criminal complaints in Manhattan and New Jersey federal courts provided chilling descriptions of what authorities say drove the Afghan-born U.S. citizen to set off explosives in New York and New Jersey, including a bomb that injured over two dozen people when it blew up on a busy Manhattan street. \n Meanwhile, more details emerged about Rahami's past, including the disclosure that the FBI had looked into him in 2014 but came up with nothing. \n According to the court complaints, Rahami's journal included a passage that accused the U.S. government of slaughtering Muslim holy warriors in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. \n \"Inshallah (God willing) the sounds of the bombs will be heard in the streets. Gun shots to your police. Death to your OPPRESSION,\" the journal ended. \n One portion expressed concern at the prospect of being caught before being able to carry out a suicide attack and the desire to be a martyr, the complaints said. Still another section included a reference to \"pipe bombs\" and a \"pressure cooker bomb\" and declared: \"In the streets they plan to run a mile,\" an apparent reference to one of the blast sites, a charity run in a New Jersey shore town. \n There also were laudatory references to Osama bin Laden, Anwar al-Awlaki \u2014 the American-born Muslim cleric who was killed in a 2011 drone strike and whose preaching has inspired other acts of violence \u2014 and Nidal Hasan, the former Army officer who went on a deadly shooting rampage in 2009 at Fort Hood, Texas, the complaints said. \n Authorities said some of the journal was unintelligible because it was damaged in gunfire when Rahmani, 28, initiated a shootout that led to his capture Monday outside a bar in Linden, New Jersey. Initially charged with attempted murder of police officers, he was held on $5.2 million bail. \n Rahmani remains hospitalized with gunshot wounds. It wasn't immediately clear whether he had a lawyer who could comment on the charges. \n The court complaints describe Rahami buying bomb-making equipment so openly between June and August that he ordered citric acid, ball bearings and electronic igniters on eBay and had them delivered to a Perth Amboy, New Jersey, business where he worked until earlier this month. \n San Jose, California-based eBay Inc. noted that the products are legal and widely available and said the company had worked with law enforcement on the investigation. \n Video recorded two days before the bombings and recovered from a family member's phone shows him igniting incendiary material in a cylinder, then shows the fuse being lighted, a loud noise and flames, followed by billowing smoke and laughter, the complaints said. \n Federal agents would like to question Rahami. But Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., who received a classified briefing from the FBI, said Rahami was not cooperating; that could also be a reflection of his injuries. \n Investigators are looking into Rahami's overseas travel, including a visit to Pakistan a few years ago, and want to know whether he received any money or training from extremist organizations. \n In 2014, the FBI opened up an \"assessment,\" the least intrusive form of an FBI inquiry, based on comments from his father after a domestic dispute, the bureau said in a statement. \n \"The FBI conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks and multiple interviews, none of which revealed ties to terrorism,\" the bureau said. \n A law enforcement official said the FBI spoke with Rahami's father in 2014 after agents learned of his concerns that the son could be a terrorist. During the inquiry, the father backed away from talk of terrorism and told investigators that he simply meant his son was hanging out with the wrong crowd, according to the official, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. \n Rahami's father told reporters Tuesday outside the family's fried-chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, New Jersey, that he called the FBI at the time because Rahami \"was doing real bad,\" having stabbed the brother and hit his mother. Rahami was not prosecuted in the stabbing; a grand jury declined to indict him. \n \"But they checked, almost two months, and they say, 'He's OK, he's clear, he's not terrorist.' Now they say he's a terrorist,\" the father, Mohammad Rahami, said. Asked whether he thought his son was a terrorist, he said: \"No. And the FBI, they know that.\" \n The disclosure of the father's contacts with the FBI raises questions about whether there was anything more law enforcement could have done at the time to determine whether Rahami had terrorist aspirations. \n That issue arose after the Orlando massacre in June, when FBI Director James Comey said agents a few years earlier had looked into the gunman, Omar Mateen, but did not find enough information to pursue charges or keep him under investigation. \n Asked Tuesday about Rahami, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama \"is confident that the Department of Justice and the FBI will go back and review the interactions that this individual had with law enforcement to determine if there's something different that could have been done or should have been done to prevent the violence that we saw over the weekend.\" \n As for whether Obama was concerned that the 2014 FBI inquiry had been closed after finding no terror ties, Earnest noted Rahami's rights as a U.S. citizen. \n Rahami worked as an unarmed night guard for two months in 2011 at an AP administrative technology office in Cranbury, New Jersey. At the time, he was employed by Summit Security, a private contractor. \n AP global security chief Danny Spriggs said he learned this week that Rahami worked there and often engaged colleagues in long political discussions, expressing sympathy for the Taliban and disdain for U.S. military action in Afghanistan. Rahami left that job in 2011 because he wanted to take a trip to Afghanistan, Spriggs said. \n AP spokesman Paul Colford said the AP told law enforcement officials about Rahami's work at the Cranbury facility. \n Summit's vice president of security services, Daniel Sepulveda, said Rahami last worked for the company in 2011. Sepulveda said he was unaware of any complaints about Rahami's conduct. \n William Sweeney, the FBI's assistant director in New York, said on Monday that that at the time of the bombing, Rahami was apparently not on the FBI's radar. Nor were Afghan intelligence officials aware of either Rahami or his family, said Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, director-general of the Afghan National Directorate of Security. \n The bombing investigation began when a pipe bomb blew up Saturday morning in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity race to benefit Marines. No one was injured. Then a shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bomb exploded Saturday night in New York's Chelsea section, wounding 31 people, none seriously. An unexploded pressure-cooker bomb was found blocks away \u2014 with Rahami's fingerprints on it and his face captured by a nearby surveillance camera, according to the court complaints. \n Late Sunday night, five explosive devices were discovered in a trash can at an Elizabeth train station. Fingerprints also matched the materials found there to Rahami, the complaints said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Court documents: Bombing suspect vowed to be martyr"}

Jolie has filed for divorce from Pitt, bringing an end to one of the world's most star-studded, tabloid-generating romances. \n NEW YORK \u00bb Angelina Jolie Pitt has filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, bringing an end to what began as the world's most tabloid headline-generating romance before morphing into a star-studded engine of family and philanthropy. \n Jolie Pitt, 41, cited \"irreconcilable difference\" in divorce papers filed Monday in Los Angeles. She is seeking physical custody of their six children, with visitation rights for Pitt. \n An attorney for Jolie Pitt, Robert Offer, said today that her decision to divorce was made \"for the health of the family.\" The filing dated the couple's separation to last Thursday. \n \"I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the wellbeing of our kids. I kindly ask the press to give them the space they deserve during this challenging time,\" Pitt said in a statement to People. \n Mark Vincent Kaplan, a veteran divorce attorney who was Kevin Federline's attorney in his divorce from Britney Spears and has handled several high-profile cases, reviewed the filing at the AP's request. \n \"There is no indication on the face of the petition filed by Ms. Jolie that there is a prenuptial agreement, or that if there is a prenup, she is asking the court to consider whether or not to invalidate it,\" said Kaplan. \n Though together for 12 years, Pitt and Jolie Pitt \u2014 known as \"Brangelina\" \u2014 only wed in August 2014. They married privately in the French hamlet of Correns in Provence with their children serving as ring bearers and throwing flower petals. They announced the ceremony days later. \n Their children are: 15-year-old Maddox, 12-year-old Pax, 11-year-old Zahara, 10-year-old Shiloh, and 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. \n This is the second marriage for Pitt, 52, who previously wed Jennifer Aniston. It's the third for Jolie Pitt, who was previously married to Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller. \n Their initial romance sparked a tabloid avalanche unlikely any in recent memory. Pitt and Jolie became close while filming 2005's \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" prompting widespread speculation \u2014 consistently denied by the couple \u2014 that Jolie prompted Pitt's divorce from Aniston. Pitt and Aniston announced their separation in January 2005. \n But after the media upheaval, Jolie Pitt and Pitt settled into their own unique kind of globe-trotting domesticity. They were seldom-seen Hollywood royalty, predicated more on parenting than partying. \n The pair adopted children from Cambodia, Vietnam and Ethiopia. They formed the Jolie-Pitt Foundation in 2016. Jolie Pitt, a special envoy for the United Nations, became an outspoken voice for refugees, as well as for breast cancer treatment after undergoing a double mastectomy herself. Pitt built homes in New Orleans for victims of Hurricane Katrina. \n Jolie Pitt also launched herself as a film director. Last year, the couple starred together in her \"By the Sea,\" playing a glamorous couple vacationing together in France while their marriage was on the rocks. It made a mere $538,000 at the box office. \n In a 2014 interview with The Associated Press, Jolie Pitt said playing a couple with marital problems was cathartic. \n \"It almost makes you get past those issues because you can laugh at them,\" Jolie Pitt said. \"You do a film about bad marriage and you witness that behavior. You study it, you let it out, you attack each other and then you just want to hold each other and make sure you never behave that way.\" \n Jolie Pitt earlier this year finished shooting her fourth feature as director, \"First They Killed My Father.\" The film, about the 1970s Khmer Rouge regime, was shot in Cambodia. \n The pair was seen publicly together as recently as July, when they were spotted taking their twins to breakfast in Los Angeles. \n Pitt stars with Marion Cotillard in Robert Zemeckis' upcoming spy thriller \"Allied\" and narrates Terrence Malick's IMAX documentary \"Voyage of Time.\" \n In recent years, Pitt's production company, Plan B, has been behind a growing number of acclaimed releases, including the Academy Award best-picture winner \"12 Years a Slave,\" last year's \"The Big Short\" and the recently debuted festival hit \"Moonlight.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Jolie files for divorce from Pitt 'for health of the family'"}

He then approaches the driver's side of his vehicle, where an officer shocks him with a stun gun and another fatally shoots him. \n Officers were called to the scene to respond to a report of a stalled vehicle. \n Police Chief Chuck Jordan announced Monday, before the video and audio recordings were released, that Crutcher had no weapon on him or in his SUV when he was shot. It's not clear from the footage what led Betty Shelby, the officer who fired the fatal shot, to draw her gun or what orders officers gave Crutcher. \n Shelby's attorney, Scott Wood, said Crutcher was not following the officers' commands and that Shelby was concerned because he kept reaching for his pocket as if he was carrying a weapon. \n \"He has his hands up and is facing the car and looks at Shelby, and his left hand goes through the car window, and that's when she fired her shot,\" Wood told the Tulsa World for a story published today. \n Local and federal investigations are underway to determine whether criminal charges are warranted in the shooting or if Crutcher's civil rights were violated. \n Police helicopter footage was among several clips released that show the shooting and aftermath.

And when she is being accused of things she didn't do wrong, it's too much, and they don't think about our family.\" \n Betty Shelby declined comment today, referring calls to her attorney. \n Police video shows Crutcher walking toward his SUV that is stopped in the middle of the road. His hands are up and a female officer is following him. As Crutcher approaches the driver's side of the SUV, another officer walks up followed by two others and Crutcher appears to lower his hands and place them on the vehicle. The four officers surround him, making it harder to see his actions from the dashboard camera's angle. \n Crutcher can be seen dropping to the ground. Someone on the police radio says, \"I think he may have just been tasered.\" One of the officers near Crutcher backs up slightly. \n Then almost immediately, someone can be heard yelling, \"Shots fired!\" Crutcher's head then drops, leaving him completely lying out in the street. \n After that, someone on the police radio can be heard saying, \"Shots fired. We have one suspect down.\" \n Officer Tyler Turnbough, who is also white, used a stun gun on Crutcher, police said. Shelby's attorney, Wood, said Turnbough fired the stun gun at the same time Shelby opened fire because both perceived a threat. \n The shooting comes four months after ex-Tulsa County volunteer deputy Robert Bates was sentenced to four years in prison on a second-degree manslaughter conviction in an unarmed black man's 2015 death. Bates said he mistakenly grabbed his gun instead of his Taser. Shelby worked as a Tulsa County sheriff's deputy for four years before joining the Tulsa Police Department in December 2011, officials said. She has been placed on paid leave. \n The initial moments of Crutcher's encounter with police are not shown in the footage, and Wood said the situation unfolded for about two minutes before the videos began. Shelby did not activate her patrol car's dashcam, said police spokeswoman Jeanne MacKenzie, and the ground-level video released Monday came from the car of a second officer who arrived at the scene. \n Two 911 calls described an SUV that had been abandoned in the middle of the road. One unidentified caller said the driver was acting strangely, adding, \"I think he's smoking something.\" \n After the shooting, Crutcher could be seen lying on the side of the road, blood pooling around his body, for nearly two minutes before anyone checked on him. When asked why police did not provide immediate assistance, MacKenzie said: \"I don't know that we have protocol on how to render aid to people.\" \n The American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, which also called for charges, said Crutcher was left to bleed while officers stood by. The group's executive director, Ryan Kiesel, said Crutcher's death shows \"how little regard\" Tulsa police have for the community's minorities. \n Benjamin Crump, one of the attorneys for Crutcher's family, said Monday that Crutcher committed no crime and gave officers no reason to shoot him. \n \"When unarmed people of color break down on the side of the road, we're not treated as citizens needing help. We're treated as, I guess, criminals \u2014 suspects that they fear,\" Crump said. \n Associated Press writer Jill Bleed in Little Rock, Arkansas, contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Attorney: Man ignored officer's commands before shooting in Tulsa"}

{"date": "September 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Passengers disembarked from Saudi Arabian Airlines plane at the parallel runway of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport after it made a distress call shortly before landing Tuesday at suburban Pasay city south of Manila. \n MANILA \u00bb A pilot of a Saudi Arabian Airlines plane mistakenly pressed a hijack warning button as it approached Manila's airport on Tuesday, causing airport officials to mobilize commando forces and isolate the jet after it landed, Philippine officials said. \n Manila airport manager Eddie Monreal said Flight SV872 from Jiddah made the distress call about 20 miles from the airport. Airport authorities asked for a verification of the emergency message and one of the pilots confirmed the distress call verbally with the airport tower, aviation security chief Mao Aplasca said. He said the pilot did not immediately say the emergency call was a mistake. \n The pilot did not tell the control tower that the button had been pushed accidentally until the plane was parked, Aplasca said. Despite the assurance, airport authorities continued to treat the incident as a crisis, Monreal said. \n \"We can never play around with safety and security,\" Monreal said. \"We decided that we will not take that call hook, line and sinker saying that it was a mistake.\" \n Security forces were deployed around the Boeing 777 as a precaution. Outside the airport complex, police quickly set up a security cordon and checkpoints. \n The passengers were later allowed to disembark and told reporters that everything had seemed normal in the cabin until relatives informed them by cellphone about reports that the aircraft may have been hijacked. \n When Princess Habiba Sarip-Paudac, a news anchor at a state-run TV network who was on the plane, peered out of the window, she saw SWAT forces and police, some with dogs, who later boarded the plane. She said the passengers \"felt like it was really a hijacking. They thought someone would throw tear gas.\" \n As the plane sat isolated on the tarmac, \"Not even one crew explained. For two hours, they were saying, 'Sorry ma'am, we don't know anything, we don't know what to say,'\" Paudac told reporters. \n Many of those coming off the plane were dressed in white, likely indicating that they were returning from the annual hajj pilgrimage, a ritual required of all able-bodied Muslims once in a lifetime. \n Saudi Arabian Airlines, also known as Saudia, does brisk business during the hajj, which reached its climax last week. \n The 71-year-old airline, which operates 119 planes, said on its official Twitter feed later Tuesday that there was a false alarm of a hijacking aboard the flight. \n Monreal said the plane was carrying 410 passengers and 21 crew members. \n The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines said it is investigating the cause of the incident. \"Appropriate penalties and sanctions will be imposed on the erring pilot if the result is indeed a human error,\" it said in a statement. \n The pilots were not being held during the investigation, Aplasca said. \n The incident came after Philippine officials in February announced they had strengthened security for Saudi Arabia's embassy in Manila and its national airline because of a possible threat. At the time, officials also said additional armed officers were posted in the boarding area for the Saudi flag carrier and to guard the airline's luggage. \n It did not elaborate on the threat. However, it came as the Sunni-ruled kingdom has been on increasingly hostile terms with Shiite power Iran. \n Associated Press writers Jim Gomez in Manila and Adam Schreck and Jon Gambrell in Dubai contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Saudia plane isolated in Manila after false distress call"}

No injuries were reported, but the small coastal town of Pescadero about 50 miles south of San Francisco lost a community hub where locals gathered for special occasions and tourists stopped while traveling along Highway 1. \n Fire officials said it appears the fire started well before they were called to store at about 5:30 a.m. The flames were shooting through the roof when fire trucks arrived, said Cal Fire Deputy Chief Jake Hess. It took about four hours to extinguish the blaze. \n Authorities haven't yet determined a cause. \n \"It's an absolutely devastating loss for the community,\" Hess said, \"and for the greater Bay Area.\" \n The store was located less than a mile from the Pacific Ocean. Campers at nearby sites could pick up last-minute supplies while motorists could enjoy a sit-down meal and drink. \n The owners, husband and wife Steve and Cindy Simms, could not be reached for comment. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fire destroys landmark coastal California watering hole"}
