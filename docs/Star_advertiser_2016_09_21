There were no other occupants in the truck. \n Osler, 38, was a second-generation firefighter whose father worked for the same department. He was married with two children. \n Gov. Jerry Brown said in a statement that Osler \"dedicated his life to protecting his fellow Californians. This tragedy reminds us of the dangers firefighters face every day.\" \n Osler's father-in-law, Leonard Yniguez, described him as \"just the most perfect person. He was always there for everybody.\" \n Osler married Yniguez's daughter, Jennifer, after they graduated from high school in Santa Clarita. He kept a memorial to his father at his home. It included his father's helmet, shoulder patches and a photo of him when he rescued a baby. \n \"It was in his hallway leading into this master bedroom,\" Yniguez told the Ventura County Star. \"He would see it every night when he went to bed. Now, we have to do it for him.\" \n The California Highway Patrol was investigating the cause of the crash. \n Ventura County was among several departments that sent more than 1,000 firefighters to the fire, which was 45 percent contained. \n Firefighters focused Wednesday on the blaze's southeast boundary. Voluntary evacuation orders were in place for about 400 residents of the San Miguelito Canyon area. \n Officials said the fire did not pose an immediate threat to the base's launch complex that fires satellites into space. Its cause was under investigation. \n Vandenberg encompasses nearly 100,000 acres along the Pacific Ocean.

The committee took a \"mid-range guess\" between two estimates provided by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. \n When Trump introduced his economic plan last week, he vowed that his tax cuts would be paid for partly by triggering record economic growth. The committee was skeptical and presumed these steps would generate no new growth.

{"date": "September 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Mylan CEO Heather Bresch testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington before the House Oversight Committee hearing on EpiPen price increases. \n WASHINGTON >> Mylan CEO Heather Bresch infuriated lawmakers as she tried \u2014 and mostly failed \u2014 to explain steep cost increases of her company's life-saving EpiPens. \n Outraged Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Wednesday grilled Bresch about the emergency allergy shot's sky-high price and the profits for a company with sales in excess of $11 billion. The list price of EpiPens has grown to $608 for a two-pack, an increase of more than 500 percent since 2007. \n In almost four hours of questioning, the soft-spoken CEO at times seemed unsure, or declined to answer directly, when asked questions about the company's finances and profits, angering lawmakers. \n \"You could make this thing go away by being honest and candid but I don't think you are,\" House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told Bresch as he ended the hearing. Afterward, he told reporters he thought she created more problems with her vague testimony. \n The frustration was bipartisan. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, compared Bresch's answers to a game of \"hide the ball.\" \n Defending the company's business practices, Bresch said she wishes Mylan had \"better anticipated the magnitude and acceleration\" of the rising prices for some families. \n \"We never intended this,\" Bresch said, but maintained that her company doesn't make much profit from each emergency allergy shot and signaled the company has no plans to lower prices. \n Families who rely on multiple EpiPens to respond when their children have allergic reactions, whether at home, school or sporting events, have lashed out at Mylan in a growing public outcry. Bresch blamed the furor partly on the complexity of drug pricing. \n In response to one question, Bresch acknowledged she made $18 million in salary last year. \n \"Sounds like you're doing pretty well on this,\" said Rep. John Mica, R-Fla. \n Chaffetz, said high executive pay at Mylan \"doesn't add up for a lot of people\" as the EpiPen price has increased. He said executives for the company made $300 million over five years while the list price for a pair of the allergy shots rose. \n \"Parents don't have a choice,\" Chaffetz said. \"If your loved one needs this, it better darn well be in your backpack.\" \n Bresch, who displayed an EpiPen, said the company makes only approximately $50 in profit on each shot. But Chaffetz said he finds that \"a little hard to believe.\" \n EpiPens are used in emergencies to stop anaphylaxis, the potentially fatal allergic reactions to insect bites and stings and foods like nuts and eggs. People usually keep multiple EpiPens handy at home, school or work, but the syringes, prefilled with the hormone epinephrine, expire after a year. \n The company says it has distributed tens of thousands of free shots to schools and raised awareness of deadly allergies. That requires investment, Bresch said. \n The Mylan executive has some familiarity with Capitol Hill \u2014 she is the daughter of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. But lawmakers so far haven't given any deference to her, and several other committees have called for investigations into the price increase. \n Bresch noted that Mylan has said it will begin selling its generic version for $300 for a pair. That will still bring Mylan tens of millions of dollars in revenue while helping retain market share against current and future brand-name and generic competition. \n The company has also offered coupon cards and has doubled the limit for eligibility for its patient assistance program. But critics have said the coupons, discount cards and patient assistance programs aren't real solutions because many customers won't use them or won't qualify for them. \n Republican Rep. Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee, a physician, told Bresch that she was \"trying to make us feel good\" about the generic version and other programs, but that he doesn't feel good about it. \n \"A mother would cut off her right arm to get that drug. You chose to charge her $600 instead of cutting off her arm,\" DesJarlais said. \"Lower the price so they can afford it.\" \n Last year, more than 3.6 million U.S. prescriptions for two-packs of EpiPens were filled, according to data firm IMS Health. That brought in sales of nearly $1.7 billion for Mylan, though the company says it receives about $1.1 billion after rebates and fees paid to insurers, distributors and other health care businesses. \n In the Senate, leaders of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs' investigations subcommittee said earlier this month that they have begun an inquiry into the company's pricing and competition practices. The Aging Committee requested briefings on the issue, and Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has written several letters to Mylan demanding answers. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mylan CEO infuriates lawmakers at hearing on EpiPen costs"}

Rahami was wanted for questioning in the bombings that rocked the Chelsea neighborhood of New York and the New Jersey shore town of Seaside Park. \n HACKENSACK, N.J. \u00bb As a defense attorney asked for an immediate federal court hearing for the Elizabeth man who allegedly committed two bombings in New York and New Jersey, people across the region remained anxious this evening, when a portion of a highway in the Bronx was closed after a pressure cooker was found in an underpass and later deemed not to be a bomb. \n Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, who was captured after a shootout in Linden on Monday, remained in a Newark hospital where he was being treated for gunshot wounds. An attorney with a legal aid group wrote in federal court papers that Rahami has been questioned for days without access to legal representation. \n U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said earlier today that Rahami would be brought \"in the near future\" to federal court in lower Manhattan, not far from the Chelsea neighborhood where he allegedly set off a bomb Saturday night injuring more than 30 people. \n On Wednesday evening, a portion of the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx was shut down while police investigated a package containing a pressure cooker located in an underpass near East 134th Street and Alexander Avenue. Police sent a bomb squad to the scene, according to the report, and said they did not find wires or a cellphone with the package, items that typically are used in pressure cooker bombs. \n Meanwhile, the estranged mother of Rahami's child attempted to have the child's name changed amid intense media attention in New Jersey, and the FBI asked for the public's help in finding two men who removed a bomb from a suitcase in Manhattan, perhaps inadvertently rendering it unable to explode. \n Federal authorities filed charges Tuesday against Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen who graduated from Edison High School in 2007, alleging he was inspired by overseas terror groups, referred to the late leader of al-Qaida as \"Brother Osama bin Laden,\" and had been plotting the bombings for months, purchasing some of the components on eBay using his own name. On Monday, Rahami was charged with the attempted murder related to a shootout with Linden police. \n While authorities have said they are looking into Rahami's travels overseas to his home country of Afghanistan and to Pakistan, there was nothing in the complaint indicating he had help building the bombs or planting them. Authorities recovered a cellphone video from the camera of one of Rahami's relatives showing an igniter for a bomb being set off in a backyard. Only Rahami was seen in the video. \n A pipe bomb detonated along the route of a Marine Corps charity run in Seaside Park on Saturday morning and a pressure cooker bomb went off on West 23rd Street in Manhattan, where at least 31 people were injured. Another pressure cooker bomb found on West 27th Street did not detonate. Two men were seen in surveillance video removing it from a suitcase, taking the bag but leaving the bomb. Five unexploded bombs were found in a backpack near an Elizabeth train station. \n On Wednesday, the FBI released a photo of the two men who removed the bomb from the suitcase on 27th Street. Authorities said they did not believe they were involved in the bombings and added that the men were lucky that they did not set off the pressure cooker bomb. They were seen walking on West 27th Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues about 8:52 p.m. \n In New Jersey, an Edison woman was awarded full custody of the child she had with Rahami on Tuesday, according to court records released Wednesday. However, a Superior Court judge in Middlesex County denied her emergency request to change the child's name, according to the records. The judge also denied the mother's request to order the media not to have contact with her or her child. The court said it had no authority to grant the requests. \n Since 2008, the mother, Maria J. Mena, has been engaged in a court battle with Rahami over custody and support of their child. Rahami allegedly violated a restraining order barring contact with Mena and was behind on child support payments, records show. \n Elsewhere, federal authorities and a defense attorney sparred in court documents filed on Wednesday over Rahami's status. \n David E. Patton, director of Federal Defenders of New York, said in court papers that Rahami has been \"held and questioned by federal enforcement agents since his arrest,\" and he asked a judge to schedule a hearing, adding that his office would represent Rahami by phone if he is unable to travel to New York. Patton did not respond to a message seeking comment. \n Federal prosecutors responded by saying in court papers that Rahami technically has not been arrested on the federal charges and that Patton's requests were \"premature.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 The Record (Hackensack, N.J.)  \n ", "author": "By Jeff Pillets and Abbott Koloff The Record (Hackensack, N.J.)", "title": "Attorney says Rahami will be brought to federal court in 'near future'"}

However, that odor suggested the heat damage was recent, it said. \n \"It was considered that burning odors would generally dissipate after an extended period of environmental exposure, including salt water immersion, as expected for items originating from\" the missing plane, the statement said. \n Gibson has collected 14 pieces of debris potentially from the missing plane, including a triangular panel stenciled \"no step\" that he found in Mozambique in February. Officials say that panel was almost certainly a horizontal stabilizer from a Flight 370 wing. \n Gibson had said the darkened surfaces of the latest debris could be evidence that a fire ended the flight far from its scheduled route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. But he conceded he had no idea when the apparent heat damaged had occurred. \n A sonar search of 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 square miles) of seabed which is calculated to be the most likely crash site in the southern Indian Ocean is almost complete without any trace of the plane being found. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "MH370 Investigators cast doubt on catastrophic fire evidence"}

{"date": "September 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, left, and his wife, Priscilla Chan, rehearse for a speech in San Francisco on Tuesday. Zuckerberg and Chan have a new lofty goal: to cure, manage or eradicate all disease by the end of this century. \n SAN FRANCISCO \u00bb Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a goal that's even more ambitious than connecting the entire world to the internet: He and his wife want to help eradicate all disease by the end of this century. \n Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are committing $3 billion over the next 10 years to accelerate basic scientific research, including the creation of research tools \u2014 from software to hardware to yet-undiscovered techniques \u2014 they hope will ultimately lead to scientific breakthroughs, the way the microscope and DNA sequencing have in generations past. \n The goal, which they are unlikely to live to see accomplished, is to \"cure, prevent or manage all disease\" in the next 80 or so years. They acknowledge that this might sound a crazy, but point to how far medicine and science have come in the last century \u2014 with vaccines, statins for heart disease, chemotherapy, and so on \u2014 following millennia with little progress. \n \"So if you even just assume that we'll be able to continue to make progress on that same trajectory, then that implies that by the end of this century we will have been able to solve most of these types of things,\" Zuckerberg said in an interview. He and Chan have spent the past two years speaking to scientists and other experts to plan the endeavor. He emphasized \"that this isn't something where we just read a book and decided we're going to do.\" \n Through their philanthropic organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the commitment includes $600 million to fund a new research center in San Francisco where scientific and medical researchers will work alongside engineers on long-term projects spanning years or even decades. The goal is not to focus narrowly on specific ailments, such as bone cancer or Parkinson's disease, but rather to do basic research. One example: a cell atlas that maps out all the different types of cells in the body, which could help researchers create various types of drugs. \n Chan's work as a pediatrician seems to be a big driver in their couple's decision to take up this latest cause. \n \"I've been with families where we've hit the limit of what's possible through medicine and science,\" Chan said. \"I've had to tell families devastating diagnoses of leukemia, or that we just weren't able to resuscitate their child.\" \n The couple spoke with The Associated Press in their home in Palo Alto, California, where their infant daughter, Max, had just woken from a nap. Their dog, Beast, came by to sit briefly during the 25-minute interview. \n Zuckerberg and Chan hope that their effort will inspire other far-reaching efforts and collaboration in science, medicine and engineering, so that basic research is no longer relegated to the margins. \n \"We spend 50 times more on health care treating people who are sick than we spend on science research (to cure) diseases so that people don't get sick in the first place,\" Zuckerberg said. He added that the approach reflects a belief that \"people are always going to suffer from disease so therefore we should focus on treating people who are sick.\" \n Eric Lander, a professor of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard, said he's had some 20 conversations with Zuckerberg and Chan over the past year about the initiative and called their goal \"the right kind of goal for thinking about that kind of timeframe.\" He is not involved with the project itself, but expressed confidence in it. \n \"Mark has brought new models to industry with Facebook,\" he said, adding that while organizations like the National Institutes of Health are \"fantastic,\" there is \"no point in replicating what existing models do.\" \n \"It's very hard with today's science funding to build a team to work on scientific problems that are like what you would find at a world-class technology company, that are that scale,\" Zuckerberg said. \"So that's something I think we can concretely help out with.\" \n Their new center, called Biohub, will run as an independent research center at the University of California, San Francisco in collaboration with UC Berkeley and Stanford University. \n The Chan Zuckerberg science initiative will be headed by Cori Bargmann, a neuroscientist who is best known in scientific circles for her research on the behavior of a tiny worm called C. elegans. Bargmann said the idea of bringing engineers and scientists together presents a \"unique opportunity to take science in a new direction.\" \n Zuckerberg said the couple decided to focus on creating better tools because this is where they see need, based on their conversations with scientists. \n \"It's not that no one is doing this today, but out of all the money that our society spends on science funding, probably not enough is going toward tool development,\" Zuckerberg said. \n Tools, he added, are long-term investments. It will likely take years for the first tools to be developed through this initiative, and even longer before they are used to cure diseases. \n Zuckerberg and Chan, who have committed to donating 99 percent of their wealth, have spent the past two years meeting with scientists and other experts to come up with the endeavor. The two stressed that they believe that their goal can be accomplished, if not in their lifetime, then in their child's lifetime. It was Max's birth last November that inspired the billionaire couple to give away nearly all their money to help solve the world's problems. \n At the time, this was valued at more than $45 billion worth of Facebook stock, which the couple transferred to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The couple's philanthropy plan won't affect Zuckerberg's status as controlling shareholder of Facebook. \n Zuckerberg and Chan often draw comparisons to Bill and Melinda Gates, whose philanthropic work also focuses on health and education. In an emailed statement, the Gates said investing \"in basic science research is at the root of the world's most important innovations and achievements.\" Zuckerberg and Chan, they added \"are making an incredible commitment to research and development that will lead to the breakthroughs to cure disease and lift millions out of poverty.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Facebook CEO, wife to invest at least $3 billion to cure diseases"}

Historic preservationists are outraged that the owner of the cemetary has obtained a permit and posted a notice of plans to exhume hundreds of graves and transfer the remains to another section of the cemetery so the land can be sold for potential development. \n RENO, Nev. >> A pioneer cemetery on the edge of downtown Reno where the remains of Civil War soldiers, city founders and a tribal chief have rested for more than a century has been anything but restful in recent weeks. \n The cemetery's owners want to dig up as many as 1,100 graves on one end of the 6-acre site and move them to the other end to make way for a development. Reno residents and heirs of the dead are outraged, calling the cemetery a Nevada historical treasure that should not be disturbed. \n \"Save our souls,\" reads a handwritten note between fluttering ribbons tied to the chain-link fence that encircles Hillside Cemetery. Next to the note is a sign bolted to the fence with a markedly different tone: \"Notice of determination for disinterment and removal of human remains.\" \n The owners posted the notice, secured health permits to move remains and alerted family members in recent weeks in accordance with a 2001 state law known as the Cemetery Authority Act. \n After encountering a groundswell of opposition, the owners said Sunday they've temporarily suspended any plans for exhumations. But critics remain concerned. \n \"They call it the Cemetery Authority Act. I call it the Grave Robbers Law,\" said Fran Tryon, a retired teacher and genealogist who founded the Hillside Cemetery Preservation Foundation. \n The site overlooking Interstate 80 a half-mile (0.8 kilometers) from the main casino drag is Reno's oldest cemetery, the final resting place for hundreds who reflect northern Nevada's unique frontier past. Granite tombstones and wooden markers sit atop many of the graves, while others are marked by tiny flags or simply a pile of rocks. \n The buried include a former Kentucky congressman who moved to Nevada in 1870 and later was appointed a national bank examiner by President Grover Cleveland. Not far away are the remains of Paiute Chief Johnson Sides, who worked as an interpreter and \"peacemaker\" for the U.S. Army. \n Also interred at Hillside are state lawmakers, saloon keepers, train-hopping hobos and dozens of infant victims of scarlet fever and other epidemics from the early 1900s. \n \"This is northern Nevada's history,\" Tryon told The Associated Press during a recent tour of the property. \"These are our founding fathers.\" \n Facing the prospect of hundreds of graves being moved, volunteers have spent months removing weeds and litter, and posting makeshift signs and markers on the blighted grounds that had become overgrown with sagebrush. \n Health officials say opponents' fears that exhuming the graves could spread anthrax and other diseases are largely unfounded. The only real threat would be to workers doing the digging, who will wear protective clothing. \n \"Each set of remains would be relocated in its own container,\" the Reno health district said in a release. \n Drew Lawton, owner of another cemetery that controls Hillside, last week assured the Reno City Council exhumation of graves was not imminent. And on Sunday, just before meeting with dozens of heirs of the dead, he issued a statement on behalf of the cemetery that said in view of \"a few families' unfavorable responses,\" any potential disinterment is on hold. He declined to elaborate. \n Lawton said in a previous statement that any renovation would include appropriate monuments, fencing and financial provisions for the cemetery's ongoing care, and any work would be done by archaeologists and other experts. \n Developer Vinton Hawkins has the option to buy the land. His spokesman, Reno lobbyist Greg Ferraro, said earlier they envisioned a \"multi-phased project\" and that discussion about long-term development was premature. \n \"The Cemetery Authority has gone above and beyond what Nevada law requires in an effort to connect with families,\" Ferraro said in a statement. \n Tryon acknowledged past problems with vandalism and dumping at the site. But she said neighboring fraternities and sororities that once partied there have helped with cleanup in recent years. Over Labor Day weekend, they helped fill more than a dozen garbage bags with weeds and trash. \n Jeremy Lambert, a U.S. military veteran who lives across the street, joined the cleanup effort four months ago. \n \"I didn't like all the weeds,\" Lambert said. \"Then I saw the foundation's site on Facebook and started to learn about all the veterans here \u2014 Civil War, Spanish American War, World War I. \n \"I think it's disrespectful,\" he said. \"They fought for their country. They should be left alone.\" \n Among the heroes, mayors and business leaders laid to rest at the cemetery are everyday people who deserve respect too, Tryon said.

His colleague, Nguyen Thi Minh Thuy, who was given a three-year jail term on the same charge, is also appealing her sentence. \n At the appeals trial in Hanoi, Vinh maintained his innocence. \n \"The verdict did not provide any valid evidence to convict me,\" Vinh told the court. \"In the 24 articles, there was no evidence to demonstrate that I instructed Thuy to post them.\" \n Vinh, 60, quit the police force and set up a private investigation firm.

The officer was charged with murder, but only after a judge ordered public release of the graphic squad car video last year. Circulation of the video prompted frequent protests, allegations of a cover-up and repeated calls for Emanuel to step down. \n The Justice Department has since launched a systemic probe of department practices. \n In the interim, Emanuel has tried to make his own changes, ousting his police chief, abolishing the agency that handles police investigations and pitching a new system for reviewing police misconduct and department audits. The former White House chief of staff said Wednesday that the approach to crime in the city has to be comprehensive. \n Chicago has seen a dramatic rise in the number of shootings and homicides this year. In August alone, there were 90 homicides, marking the first time in two decades there have been that many in a single month. Overall, the city has recorded more than 500 homicides this year \u2014 higher than all of 2015 \u2014 and is on pace to climb past the 600-homicide mark for the first time since 2003. \n Emanuel said the violence spike was new, noting the number of homicides in 2014 was among the lowest on record. That year closed with roughly 400 murders. \n \"What happened this year is new,\" Emanuel said Wednesday, the day Chicago police announced the additional jobs. \"So we're meeting it with a new response, which is more police, more technology, greater investment in mentoring, our summer jobs and our afterschool.\" \n Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said he asked for additional officers and Emanuel \"delivered.\" The plan, which will start in January 2017, is to add 516 new officers, 92 field-training officers, 200 detectives, 112 sergeants and 50 lieutenants. The changes will increase the number of sworn officers from about 12,500 to about 13,500. \n What's missing is how the cash-strapped city will fund the officers. Emanuel declined to detail where the money will come from. Already his tenure has seen a property tax hike and the council approved new water and sewer tax increases earlier this month. \n \"We will have the resources in the budget to pay for this,\" Emanuel said. \n Activists who've called for additional community resources and leadership changes criticized the plan to add so many officers. \n \"The causes of crime and intra-communal violence exist because of the conditions of poverty that Rahm Emanuel has exacerbated for Chicago,\" Black Lives Matter Chicago said in a statement. \"What more policing will accomplish is more violence, more lock ups and more trauma for our already suffering communities.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Chicago's mayor to deliver major speech on city crime"}

Ding said Xia planned to file an appeal. \n Xia's sentencing comes amid a string of recent cases and subversion trials demonstrating the ruling Communist Party's determination to silence independent human rights activists and government critics. But the most those accused received was 7 \u00bd years. \n By comparison, Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, identified by the party as an existential threat to its rule, is serving an 11-year sentence for subversion. \n \"The harsh sentence against Xia Lin sends the sternest warning yet to the community of human rights lawyers that they must toe the party line,\" said Maya Wang, a Hong Kong-based researcher with Human Rights Watch. \n Wang said president and party leader Xi Jinping has made clear that, despite its calls for strengthened rule of law, the party intends to use the legal system to enforce its uncontested rule. \"Anyone who challenges this aspiration will not be tolerated.\" \n Ding and advocacy group Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders said the charges against Xia, who was born in 1970, related to money he had borrowed from friends, who asserted they did so freely and had not brought legal complaints against him. He was accused of defaulting on that debt, but no convincing evidence was provided, they said. \n \"He had indeed borrowed money from people, but it is just normal borrowing and lending money,\" Ding said. \n The Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders said that Xia was detained on Nov. 8, 2014, as he began preparing to defend Guo Yushan, the head of the Chinese think tank, the Transition Institute. It said Guo had been detained a month early for supporting the Occupy Central pro-democracy movement in the semi-autonomous Chinese region of Hong Kong. \n Lacking evidence of fraud, investigators instead focused on Xia's association with government critics, including renowned artist and human rights activist Ai Weiwei, the group said. \n \"The numerous legal violations, not least the length of time it took to bring Xia to trial, demonstrate the flimsiness of the authorities' case. Xia Lin should be freed on Thursday and compensated for his time in detention,\" human-right researcher Frances Eve said in a statement. \n Xi's campaign against dissent began gathering steam in the summer of 2015, when about 300 activists and lawyers were initially seized in a roundup and questioned before most were released. \n But more than a dozen of those detained last year remain in custody, their legal fates still unknown. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "China sentences activist lawyer to 12 years on fraud charges"}

The Hawaii Occupational Safety and Health Division enforced a penalty of $7,700 for each violation classsified as serious, the highest maximum penalty for a serious violation. \n UH has 20 days to contest the penalties. An informal conference between UH and the safety and health division has been scheduled for Sept. 30. \n According to the findings, \"activities performed in the laboratory by researchers with the potential exposure to explosion and fire hazards were not assessed for appropriate personal protective equipment.\" \n Concerns about the chemical hygiene plan were also raised. \n UH spokesman Dan Meisenzahl said the university is in the process of reviewing the violations and will seek clarification at the upcoming meeting with the Hawaii Occupational Safety and Health Division. \n This is the third investigation into the blast, which seriously injured researcher Thea Ekins-Coward, who lost an arm and suffered other injuries. \n The explosion occurred at a laboratory operated by the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute that was located in the SOEST building. Postdoctoral fellow Ekins-Coward, 29, was working on a mixture of low-pressure hydrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen when the portable metal cylinder the gases were contained in exploded. \n About a month after the explosion, the Honolulu Fire Department said its investigation determinedthe blast was likely caused by a digital pressure gauge in the tank that produced an electrical spark and in turn detonated the flammable gas in the tank. \n In July, an independent investigation from a University of California for Laboratory Safety team concluded the explosion was likely caused by static electricity. The report said the gauge was not inside the tank and detonation was caused by an electrostatic charge, accumulated by the gas storage tank or by Ekins-Coward herself, that was released when she touched a metal housing as she attempted to turn off the gauge. \n Meisenzahl, who also spoke on behalf of the Energy Institute, reiterated the number of improvements done at the Manoa campus since the explosion that include risk assessment and proper training.  \n \"Our priority is to strengthen the culture of safety on campus,\" he said. \"UH has really embraced this goal.\" \n ", "author": "By Rosemarie Bernardo rbernardo@staradvertiser.com", "title": "State imposes penalties totaling $115,500 in UH lab blast"}

Federal court complaints filed Sept. 20 gave a chilling glimpse into what authorities say motivated the Afghan-born U.S. citizen to set off explosives last weekend in New York City and New Jersey, including a bomb that injured 31 people in Manhattan. The complaints said in his bloodied journal, damaged by shots from his gun battle with police, he fumed that the U.S. government was slaughtering Muslim holy warriors and alluded to plans for revenge. \n FBI VIA AP \n This video frame grab provided by the FBI shows two unidentified men walking in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York on Saturday, around the time when a bomb exploded on a nearby street. Investigators said the men are being sought as witnesses in connection with the explosion and another explosive device that was found nearby. \n NEW YORK \u00bb Investigators of last weekend's bombings have released an image of two men who took a suitcase they found on a city street, possibly without realizing a wired pressure cooker they removed from it and left behind could have blown them to bits. \n Police investigating the bombings in New York and New Jersey have been saying for several days they were looking for the men, who they stressed were being sought as potential witnesses in the case, not as suspects. \n \"They're not in any jeopardy of being arrested,\" Jim Watters, chief of the New York Police Department's counterterrorism unit, said on Wednesday. \"We have no reason to believe they're connected.\" \n Federal prosecutors have charged Ahmad Khan Rahami with detonating a pipe bomb in a New Jersey shore town on Saturday morning and a pressure cooker bomb in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood later that night. Thirty-one people were injured in the New York blast. A second pressure cooker bomb left in Manhattan didn't explode and is the subject of the latest public plea. \n Prosecutors said surveillance video shows Rahami rolling a suitcase down the street, then abandoning it on the sidewalk where that second device was found. \n A few minutes later, two men pass by the luggage and appear to admire it, police said. They then remove a pressure cooker from the luggage, leave the pressure cooker on the sidewalk and walk away with the luggage. \n \"I think they were more interested in the bag, not what they were taking out,\" Watters said, adding that they were \"very, very lucky\" the bomb didn't explode. \n In court papers, a public defender sought a court appearance for Rahami, an Afghan-born U.S. citizen, so he can hear the federal terrorism charges against him. \n On Wednesday night, Manhattan U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein refused a request by Federal Defenders of New York to schedule an initial appearance for Rahami on federal charges, even if it must be conducted remotely from a hospital bed. \n The judge noted that court rules require an arrested person be brought before the court \"without unnecessary delay.\" \n He said there is no evidence contrary to government claims that Rahami remains held on state charges in New Jersey and has not yet been arrested on the federal charges. \n The judge was also unpersuaded by federal defender claims that federal law enforcement is involved in detaining and questioning Rahami. \n \"In fact, this question is very much in dispute,\" Gorenstein wrote. \n Rahami, 28, was arrested on Monday following a shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey. He is being held on $5.2 million bail, and he faces state charges of attempted murder of police officers. \n Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Rahami will be moved to New York to face federal charges in the \"near future.\" \n In a bloodied journal recovered by investigators, Rahami made references to Osama bin Laden, American-born Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and former Army officer Nidal Hasan, who went on a shooting rampage in Ford Hood, Texas, according to a federal complaint. \n In one section, the complaint says, Rahami wrote: \"Death to your oppression.\" \n Two federal law enforcement officials said Rahami's wife, thought to be a Pakistani national, will return soon to the United States. One of the officials said the wife made a statement to authorities after walking into the U.S. Embassy in the United Arab Emirates. The other official said investigators believe she left the U.S. for Pakistan in June. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the ongoing case. \n Meanwhile, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, touring the site of the Manhattan blast on Wednesday, said he believes insurance companies will cover most of the losses incurred by those whose businesses and homes were damaged. But he said if there are gaps in coverage, the state would pay for anything left outstanding from its emergency funds. \n Also Wednesday, a homeless man who took a backpack from a garbage can near a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, on Sunday night, not knowing it contained pipe bombs prosecutors say were made by Rahami, said he's grateful he didn't prompt an explosion. \n \"I don't like to think about what could have happened, but I'm just so blessed and glad it didn't,\" Lee Parker said. \"I still have my nine lives, I guess, and I'm going to keep trying to live them well.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "2 potential bombing witnesses seen with suitcase are sought"}

Police arrested Vague on suspicion of sexually assaulting several women while working as a driver for Uber and Lyft in Escondido, Calif. \n ESCONDIDO, Calif. \u00bb A former driver for Uber and Lyft was charged today with sexually assaulting several women while on the job, and Southern California investigators said that there are likely more victims. \n An 18-year-old college student reported that she was assaulted Friday afternoon after requesting an Uber car in a city near San Diego, said Escondido police Lt. Justin Murphy. \n The woman told police that the driver picked her up on the Palomar College campus in San Marcos and immediately turned off the Uber app. She texted friends, telling them she felt uncomfortable, and then he drove her to another location where he attacked her inside his blue 2014 Chrysler mini-van, Murphy said. \n Later that day, police arrested Jeremy Vague, 37, at his home. \n The former college basketball player, who is 7 feet tall and weighs 270 pounds, pleaded not guilty today to multiple sexual assault charges. A phone listing for Vague could not be found and his attorney could not be reached for comment. \n In the course of the investigation, Murphy said detectives discovered the additional victims, including two 19-year-old women in the neighboring city of Escondido. \n Vague had given one of them a Lyft ride on Sept. 7, and the other was waiting at the destination. Vague asked to take a picture with the two of them and as they posed he touched them inappropriately, Murphy said. \n On Sept. 6, another student, who had not requested a ride, called Palomar College police to report an Uber driver identified as Vague had tried to lure her into his minivan, but she had refused. Murphy said campus police contacted Vague and told him to stay away from the college. \n It was unclear when Uber and Lyft were contacted about the assaults or when the companies ended his employment. \n According to court records, Vague pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of vehicle burglary in northern Utah stemming from a July 2002 incident. The Associated Press reported at the time that Vague and another man were arrested for stealing golf clubs. \n No one at either company responded to emails asking whether they knew about his record and whether that would have prevented him from being hired. \n In April, Uber agreed to pay at least $10 million to settle allegations by California prosecutors that it misled passengers about the quality of its driver background checks. San Francisco and Los Angeles prosecutors sued in 2014, saying Uber's background checks were inferior to what taxi drivers undergo because they did not include fingerprint checks for past convictions. Instead, the San Francisco-based company's process relies on a name search of other criminal databases and motor vehicle department files going back seven years. \n Lyft settled a similar case last year by agreeing to pay $250,000 and stop claiming its background checks were among the industry's best. \n Both ridesharing companies are cooperating with authorities. \n Lyft said in a statement that the company has \"a strict zero-tolerance policy for any type of violent behavior, abuse or harassment and have permanently deactivated the driver's access to the platform. Drivers on the Lyft platform undergo a thorough criminal background check across local, state and federal databases that go back in time to the maximum extent allowable by law.\" \n A statement from Uber said, \"There is no excuse for the violent acts described and reported to police. We are working with law enforcement officials to fully support their investigation, and the driver has been banned from accessing the Uber app.\" \n Vague, who is married, had worked for Lyft for nine months and Uber for three months, Murphy said. \n Vague also has worked as a coach for a high school girls' basketball team in San Diego County. He played basketball for at least one season for Utah State University in 2000 and 2001, according to the team's website. \n A bill requiring stricter background checks for ride-hailing companies has passed the California Legislature and is awaiting Gov. Jerry Brown's signature. \n It would prohibit the companies from hiring drivers who are registered sex offenders, have been convicted of violent felonies or have a driving under the influence conviction in the past seven years. \n Neither drugs nor alcohol were factors in the sexual assault cases, police said. \n Police believe there may be more victims and Murphy urged them to call authorities. \n \"We're asking you to find the courage to come forward so we can hold Vague accountable for his actions,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Former Uber, Lyft driver charged with assaulting passengers"}

Authorities used tear gas to disperse protesters in an overnight demonstration that broke out Tuesday after Keith Lamont Scott was fatally shot by an officer at an apartment complex. \n CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u00bb Violent protesters rampaged through parts of downtown Charlotte as anger continued to build over the deadly police shooting of a black man and the wildly different stories about what happened from authorities and the victim's family and neighbors. \n North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency Wednesday night in the state's largest city and called in the National Guard after Charlotte's police chief said he needed the help. \n A peaceful prayer vigil turned into an angry march and then a night of violence after a man was shot and critically wounded as protesters charged police in riot gear trying to protect an upscale hotel in Charlotte's typically vibrant downtown. Police did not shoot the man, city officials said. \n The unrest took many by surprise in Charlotte, the banking capital of the South with a population of 830,000 people, about 35 percent of them black. The city managed to pull through a racially charged shooting three years ago without the unrest that erupted in recent years in places such as Baltimore, Milwaukee and Ferguson, Missouri. Police charged Randall Kerrick with voluntary manslaughter within days, but the jury at his trial couldn't reach a unanimous verdict. \n On Wednesday, hundreds of protesters who were shouting \"black lives matter\" and \"hands up, don't shoot\" left after police fired flash grenades and tear gas after the shooting. But several groups of a dozen or more protesters stayed behind, attacking people, including reporters, shattering windows to hotels, office buildings and restaurants and setting small fires. \n At one point, television news helicopters showed protesters on the loop highway around downtown, trying to stop cars for several minutes before police arrived. \n \"My heart bleeds for what our great city is going through,\" McCrory said on WBTV-TV. He was mayor of Charlotte for 14 years before becoming governor. \n Authorities said three people and four police officers were injured, but those figures had not been updated early Thursday morning. Videos and pictures on Twitter showed reporters and other people being attacked. \n The violence happened amid questions about what happened Tuesday afternoon when 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed in the parking lot of his condominium complex. Police did not release dashboard or body camera footage, but said Scott had a gun and refused several orders to drop his weapon. Scott's family and neighbors said he was holding a book. \n \"He got out of his car, he walked back to comply, and all his compliance did was get him murdered,\" said Taheshia Williams, whose balcony overlooks the shady parking spot where Scott was Tuesday afternoon. She said he often waited there for his son because a bicycle accident several years ago left him stuttering and susceptible to seizures if he stayed out in the hot sun too long. \n Charlotte Police Chief Kerr Putney was angered by the stories on social media, especially a profanity-laced, hourlong video on Facebook, where a woman identifying herself as Scott's daughter screamed \"My daddy is dead!\" at officers at the shooting scene and repeating that he was only holding a book. \n Putney was adamant that Scott posed a threat, even if he didn't point his weapon at officers, and said a gun was found next to the dead man. \"I can tell you we did not find a book,\" the chief said. \n Not long after the Facebook video was posted Tuesday night, the first night of destructive protests began near the shooting scene, about 15 miles northeast of downtown Charlotte. Dozens of demonstrators threw rocks at police and reporters, damaged squad cars, closed part of Interstate 85, and looted a stopped truck and set a fire. Authorities used tear gas to break up the protests. \n The distrust of police continued after Wednesday's shooting of a protester.

A Hauula resident believes he got hepatitis A aboard Hawaiian Airlines Flight 65 from Oakland, Calif., to Kona, Hawaii, on July 26. A flight attendant on the plane who had eaten scallop sushi at Genki had hepatitis A but didn't know it at the time. \n A Hauula resident who believes he contracted hepatitis A aboard a Hawaiian Airlines flight filed a lawsuit in Circuit Court today claiming he was exposed to the disease by a flight attendant. \n It appears to be the first case made public in the current outbreak that involves transmission from one infected person to another in a commercial setting, rather than from eating contaminated food or close contact within a household. \n Most of the 276 hepatitis A cases so far stem from eating tainted scallops served raw at Genki Sushi, which were identified by health authorities last month as the source of virus and pulled from the market. \n There have been a handful of secondary cases passed within households, according to the state Health Department. But no person-to-person transmission in a work setting had yet come to light. \n The suit was filed by John Driscoll, an artist and plasterer who lives in Hauula, against Genki Sushi USA , scallops distributor Koha Foods and importer Sea Port Products Corp. \n Driscoll believes he got the virus aboard Hawaiian Airlines Flight 65 from Oakland, Calif., to Kona, Hawaii, on July 26. A flight attendant on the plane who had eaten scallop sushi at Genki had hepatitis A but didn't know it at the time. \n Hepatitis A symptoms appear from two weeks to as long as 50 days after exposure, and people are infectious even before they realize they are sick. The virus spreads through contaminated food or water, or close physical contact. \n Driscoll had not eaten at Genki, and none of his close personal contacts had hepatitis A, according to his attorney, Michael F. O'Connor. \"Driscoll first began to experience symptoms of his Hepatitis A infection on or about the morning of Aug. 8, 2016, while at work,\" the suit said. \"He left work early at around 11 a.m. to return home and rest. While on his way home, Driscoll received a phone call from the State of Hawaii Department of Health to inform him that he had been exposed to HAV [hepatitis A virus] while on his flight on July 26.\" \n \"The next day, Driscoll sought medical treatment and submitted a blood sample for laboratory testing,\" the suit said. \"Driscoll's blood sample ultimately tested positive for the outbreak strain of HAV.\" \n Driscoll was working a special job at the International Marketplace in Waikiki, which was supposed to last for six weeks, but because of his illness, he only put in three or four days on the job. He is still recovering, according to the lawsuit, which seeks damages for pain and suffering, lost wages and medical expenses. \n O'Connor, his attorney, said they are not suing Hawaiian Airlines because it did not serve the scallops so product liability law is not applicable. \n The Health Department publicizes cases of food workers who have tested positive for the virus, so that patrons can take precautions, including getting vaccinations. \n So far 17 food handlers have come down with the disease: workers at 13 different restaurants, two Hawaiian Airlines flight attendants and 2 cafeteria employees at different schools. None were Genki Sushi employees. \n Seattle attorney Bill Marler, who is also handling Driscoll's case, said it highlights the need to vaccinate food-service workers. \n \"Hepatitis A is the only food-borne illness that you can stop secondary transfer by vaccinating the people that likely would transfer it, which are close family members or people who work in food service,\" he said. \n ", "author": "By Susan Essoyan sessoyan@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Hauula man says he got hepatitis A on flight with infected attendant"}

Disney said it would no longer sell the boy's costume for a Polynesian character that some Pacific Islanders have compared to blackface. \n WALT DISNEY ANIMATION STUDIOS \n \"Moana\" is a computer-generated animated comedy-adventure about a spirited teenager on an impossible mission to fulfill her ancestors' quest. She teams up with her hero, the legendary demi-god Maui, to traverse the open ocean on an action-packed voyage, encountering enormous sea creatures, breathtaking underworlds and ancient folklore. \n Disney said it would no longer sell a boy's costume for a Polynesian character that some Pacific Islanders have compared to blackface. \n The getup depicts Maui \u2014 a revered figure in Polynesian oral traditions and viewed by some Pacific Islanders as an ancestor \u2014 who is a character in the upcoming animated movie \"Moana.\" It has a long-sleeve brown shirt and long pants featuring full-body tattoos. It comes with a fake shark-tooth necklace and green-leaf \"skirt.\" \n Disney's online store had offered boy's pajamas and a men's t-shirt in a similar design, but those products were no longer available today. \n \"The team behind Moana has taken great care to respect the cultures of the Pacific Islands that inspired the film, and we regret that the Maui costume has offended some,\" the company said in a statement. \"We sincerely apologize and are pulling the costume from our website and stores.\" \n Chelsie Haunani Fairchild said it's offputting to have a child wear the skin of another race. \n \"Polyface is Disney's new version of blackface. Let's call it like it is, people,\" Fairchild said in a video she posted on Facebook. \n The Native Hawaiian college student said in an interview the costume doesn't honor or pay homage to a culture or person, but makes fun of it. \n Fairchild, who is attending school in San Antonio, Texas, later said she accepted the apology, but it didn't change what the company did. She said Disney only stopped marketing the outfit because people spoke out. \n \"Moana\" is due for release in November. The animated feature is about a teenager who sails through the South Pacific to a fabled island. She meets Maui, who helps her explore the ocean. \n The Disney online store began selling the costume recently, just in time for Halloween. The listing noted the getup had \"padded arms and legs for mighty stature!\" \n Tevita Kaili, a professor of cultural anthropology at Brigham Young University-Hawaii, said he was happy Disney responded to the criticism and pulled the product. \n He said the costume featured tattoos that would be used in Polynesia by chiefs, adults and those committed to the community. They're removed from their cultural context by appearing on a Halloween costume, he said. \n For example, the outfit has triangle designs used to symbolize sharks. These would normally be used by families who consider sharks to be ancestral guardians, he said. \n Kaili himself views Maui as an ancestor, like many people from his home island of Koloa in Tonga, where a temple is dedicated to him. \n Kaili said stories handed down about Maui snaring the sun or pulling islands out of the ocean are just metaphors for how he discovered new islands as he sailed the ocean. \n \"For most of us in the Pacific, in Polynesia, we see Maui as an important ancestor to us \u2014 as a real person,\" he said. \n The costume earned international condemnation. \n Marama Fox, a co-leader of New Zealand's indigenous Maori Party and a member of New Zealand's parliament, said the costume was a case of cultural misappropriation and an example of a company trying to profit off of another culture's intellectual property. \n The movie itself, she said, appeared to be playing into stereotypes. \n \"It depicts Maui as a bit of a beefy guy, and not in a good way. That's not the picture I have of the Maui who fished up the North Island, and had a number of feats attributed to him,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Disney pulls costume criticized as 'Polyface'"}

{"date": "September 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton waved as she boarded her campaign plane at Westchester County Airport in White Plains, N.Y. today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump listened as he was introduced by boxing promoter Don King prior to speaking to the Pastors Leadership Conference at New Spirit Revival Center, today, in Cleveland, Ohio. \n CLEVELAND \u00bb Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton decried a fresh round of police-involved shootings today, with the Republican nominee saying he was \"very troubled\" by the killing of a black man by a white police officer in Oklahoma. \n Courting black voters who have long spurned Republicans, Trump's event in Cleveland Heights' New Spirit Revival Center took a bizarre turn when he was introduced by boxing promoter Don King, who used a racial slur as he made the case for black voters to support Trump. \n Trump's latest foray into the black community not only sought to connect with voters in Cleveland, home to a large community of African-American voters key to Clinton's prospects in Ohio, but also with moderate suburban voters, who frequently hear Clinton describe Trump as extreme. \n King, introducing Trump, raised eyebrows when he said a black man is always framed by his skin color, recalling that he once told pop icon Michael Jackson \"if you're poor, you're a 'poor Negro.' If you're rich, you're a 'rich Negro.'\" An educated black man is \"an intellectual negro.\" \n King, who is black, continued: \"If you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n\u2014\u2014\u2014- I mean Negro \u2014 you are 'a dancing and sliding and gliding Negro.'\" Gasps and laughs could be heard from the audience. \n The King incident underscored the often clumsy way in which Trump has made his appeal to minority voters. Many black community leaders and voters have been offended by his dire depiction of life in minority communities. Trump's outreach has also been viewed cynically as an attempt by his campaign to soothe concerns among more moderate, suburban voters. \n At the end of the Ohio church event organized by members of his diversity coalition, Trump was asked about recent high-profile police shootings in Oklahoma and North Carolina. Trump said 40-year-old Terence Crutcher, who was killed in Friday's Tulsa, Oklahoma, shooting, \"looked like he did everything you're supposed to do. And he looked like a really good man.\" \n \"This young officer, I don't know what she was thinking. I don't know what she was thinking but I'm very, very troubled by that,\" Trump said, calling it a \"terrible situation.\" \n But hours later he called for the expanded use of stop-and-frisk, a police tactic that a federal judge has ruled can be discriminatory against minorities. Trump said during a Fox News town hall taping that the tactic that gives police the ability to stop and search anyone they deem suspicious had \"worked incredibly well\" in New York, where it expanded under former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. \n Clinton notably made no direct mention of Trump in a speech in Orlando, Florida, focused on helping people with disabilities thrive in the U.S. economy. She pointed to the Oklahoma and North Carolina shootings at the start of her remarks, saying it added two more names \"to a long list of African Americans killed by police officers. It's unbearable and it needs to become intolerable.\" \n Clinton has made curbing gun violence and police brutality a central part of her candidacy. She has campaigned alongside a group of black women called the \"Mothers of the Movement,\" who advocated for more accountability and transparency by law enforcement. The group includes the mothers of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, black victims of high-profile killings. \n Trump, joined by running mate Mike Pence at the Ohio event, has routinely praised police officers in his speeches to supporters. But after reading from notes about the role of the black church in the civil rights movement and vowing to help struggling black Americans, Trump questioned the Tulsa officer's reaction in shooting Crutcher, who was unarmed. \n Video of the shooting, which Trump cited, shows Crutcher's hands up as officers approach and Crutcher then appears to place his hands on a vehicle before the officers surround him. He then drops to the ground. Someone on the police radio says, \"I think he may have just been tasered.\" Then almost immediately, someone can be heard yelling, \"Shots fired!\" Crutcher is left lying in the street. \n Trump's meeting came after street demonstrations continued into the early hours today in Charlotte, North Carolina. On Tuesday, 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was fatally shot by Charlotte police officer Brentley Vinson, who is black. Officers say Scott was armed and posed a threat. Police used tear gas to disperse protesters during the demonstrations that left about a dozen officers injured. \n During the question-and-answer session at the church, Trump said he was a \"tremendous believer in the police and law enforcement, because we need that for our society.\" But he said law enforcement was also troubled by the police-involved shootings, adding, \"People that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing.\" \n Clinton, meanwhile, has aimed to make a more proactive case for her election and not get drawn into daily skirmishes with Trump. Campaigning in Orlando, she pledged to provide more job opportunities to people with disabilities and get rid of the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities. \n While she steered clear of Trump \u2014 with the exception of her campaign mantra, \"Love trumps hate,\" \u2014 the topic was an implicit poke at Trump's much-publicized mocking of a disabled journalist during a rally last year. \n Associated Press writers Catherine Lucey in Orlando, Florida, and Bill Barrow in Cleveland contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton, Trump decry latest police shootings of black men"}

Greenland is losing about 40 trillion pounds more ice a year than scientists had thought, according to a new study that uses GPS to help estimate how much is melting there. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Greenland is losing about 40 trillion pounds more ice a year than scientists had thought, according to a new study that used GPS to help estimate how much is melting. \n So instead of losing on average 550 trillion pounds of ice each year between 2003 and 2013, Greenland lost about 590 trillion pounds , said co-author Michael Bevis of Ohio State University in a study published today in the journal Science Advances . That's about a 7.6 percent difference. \n The Empire State Building weighs 730 million pounds, so 40 trillion pounds a year is the equivalent to more than 50,000 Empire State Buildings. \n \"If you look at the last 15 years since we've been having these measurements, it's clearly getting worse, the ice loss,\" Bevis said. \"It is pretty scary.\" \n Overall, though, it is still \"a small percentage. I don't think it changes the picture of what's going on,\" cautioned study co-author Beata Csatho at the University at Buffalo. The extra ice loss adds a tiny amount \u2014 one-sixtieth of an inch a decade \u2014 to global sea level rise, Bevis said. Altogether, Greenland melt adds one fiftieth of an inch \u2014 0.54 mm\u2014 a decade, he said. \n \"Not good news certainly as the values are already larger than we'd had wished, but not a dramatic change in the overall already very alarming pattern we've been seeing over the past couple decades,\" said Duke University climate scientist Drew Shindell, who wasn't part of the study team. \n Most measurements of ice sheet loss in Greenland and Antarctica use a satellite that measures changes in gravity and uses computer simulations to calculate the weight loss of ice. But the trouble is that as ice sheets melt, ground juts up to take its place, both instantly and slowly over centuries. The rocks that rise to replace the heavier ice are counted in the overall ice mass by the satellite and thus the satellites overstate how much ice there is, Bevis said. \n The new measurements that use global positioning satellites and other sources compensate for that and are thus more accurate, Bevis said. \n Erik Ivins, a senior research scientist at NASA's sea level and ice group who wasn't part of the team, called the study a significant breakthrough. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Greenland ice loss 40 trillion pounds bigger than thought"}

{"date": "September 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n IRS Commissioner John Koskinen was sworn in on Capitol Hill in Washington, today, prior to testifying before the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearing. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb IRS Commissioner John Koskinen expressed regret to Congress today for his agency's past mistreatment of tea party groups, but said he has cooperated with congressional investigators and does not deserve to be impeached. \n The IRS chief made the remarks at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on a drive by hard-line conservatives to oust Koskinen. Their impeachment resolution accuses him of lying to lawmakers, ignoring subpoenas and overseeing an agency that destroyed emails as Congress investigated how the IRS subjected tea party groups seeking tax exemptions to harsh investigations years ago. \n The agency has apologized for its actions and Koskinen has said he's done nothing wrong. Government investigators have found no evidence that Koskinen or the IRS purposely destroyed evidence or that the agency's actions were politically motivated. \n \"I did nothing to impede the operation of the Congress,\" Koskinen, speaking under oath, told the lawmakers. \n Besides solid opposition from Democrats, the push has divided Republicans, won no backing from GOP leaders and has no chance of garnering the votes Congress would need to oust him. \n Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said the IRS engaged in \"a political plan to silence the voices of groups representing millions of Americans.\" He said Koskinen is facing \"very serious allegations.\" \n But Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the panel's top Democrat, said Republicans were engaged in \"partisan attacks cloaked in the impeachment process\" that he said\"are doomed from the start.\" \n Some Democrats tried scoring their own political points by asking Koskinen about GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. \n Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., asked if people under IRS audit are free to release their tax returns, a situation Trump has asserted in refusing to release his forms. Koskinen said such taxpayers can release their returns. \n Nadler also asked if someone can use money from a charitable foundation to buy a portrait or a football helmet autographed by former quarterback Tim Tebow or to pay fees from legal disputes. Reports have said money from the Donald J. Trump Foundation has been used for those purposes. \n Koskinen said, generally, charitable money shouldn't be used to benefit someone who runs a charitable foundation. He declined to comment on specific details. \n The IRS chief told lawmakers he's been truthful and has provided all the documents he could to investigators. He said impeaching him would be \"improper.\" \n Without being specific, he also conceded: \"The truth is that we did not succeed in preserving all of the information requested and some of my testimony later proved mistaken. I regret both of those failings.\" \n Koskinen told lawmakers in June 2014 that no emails had been destroyed since congressional investigations began. One year later, Koskinen learned that backup tapes containing numerous emails had been erased by IRS workers in Martinsburg, West Virginia, in March of 2014. \n \"The old midnight shift guys in Martinsburg excuse,\" scoffed Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, which is pushing impeachment. \n Many GOP lawmakers want to avoid an impeachment showdown in the shadow of November's elections, fearing it could alienate independents who could consider the effort overly partisan and confrontational. \n Last week, members of the Freedom Caucus agreed to today's hearing after dropping plans to force an immediate House impeachment vote. Caucus members conceded they would have likely lost. \n However, one lawmaker in that group, Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., has not ruled out forcing an impeachment vote before the November elections. \n In May 2013, the IRS conceded that during the 2010 and 2012 elections, it subjected conservative groups seeking tax exemptions to excessively harsh examinations. Many groups with those tax exemptions play major roles in political campaigns, and they are not required to reveal donors. \n Koskinen joined the agency in December 2013, after the improper actions occurred. \n A focus of those investigations was Lois Lerner, who had led the IRS office that processes applications for tax exempt status. She refused to answer lawmakers' questions and later retired. \n In June 2014, the IRS told Congress that it lost an unknown number of Lerner's emails when her hard drive crashed in 2011. \n Then in June 2015, the IRS inspector general said the agency had accidentally erased 422 backup tapes in March 2014 that could have had up to 24,000 of Lerner's emails. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "IRS chief tells House panel he does not deserve impeachment"}

A black police officer shot a black man at an apartment complex Tuesday, authorities said, prompting angry street protests late into the night. \n CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u00bb Police officers gave a black man multiple clear warnings to drop a handgun before one of the officers opened fire and killed him, Charlotte's police chief said today, hours after protesters and police clashed in unrest that saw semi-trucks looted and set on fire. \n At least 16 officers were injured, including one who was hit in the face with a rock. Authorities had to use tear gas to disperse the protests, which happened after another demonstration in Tulsa, Oklahoma, over the shooting there of an unarmed black man by police. \n Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. Officers told Scott, who was not the suspect they were looking for, to drop the gun. He got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying it, the chief said, and he was shot because he posed a threat. \n \"It's time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story's a little bit different as to how it's been portrayed so far, especially through social media,\" he said. \n His comments were an apparent reference to a profanity-laced, hourlong video that a woman claiming to be Scott's daughter posted to Facebook soon after the shooting, saying that her father had an unspecified disability and was unarmed.

A man was taken into custody after his two children were asphyxiated, his wife's two older children were fatally shot and his wife was shot and slashed at their suburban Detroit home, police said today. \n DEARBORN HEIGHTS, Mich. \u00bb A man is in custody after his two young children were asphyxiated using a car exhaust, his wife's two older children were fatally shot and his wife was shot and slashed at their suburban Detroit home, police said today. \n The man, whose name has not been released, called 911 early today and said he had killed his family, Dearborn Heights police Lt. Michael Krause told The Associated Press. Officers found the man on the porch and took him into custody, Krause said, adding he will face charges in the coming days. \n Krause said \"some sort of domestic dispute\" preceded the killings. \n The car where the man's children, a 4-year-old girl and a 6-year-old boy, were asphyxiated was parked outside the home and had a hose hooked to the exhaust that was routed into the car, Krause said. Police found those children on the ground floor of the home and administered CPR, he said. They were taken to hospital, but didn't survive. \n In the basement, police found the bodies of a 17-year-old girl and a 19-year-old man, along with their mother, who had gunshot and knife wounds, Krause said. \n The woman, whose age wasn't immediately available, is in critical condition, Krause said. He said she is not the biological mother of the younger children. \n Mayor Dan Paletko, speaking near the home, called the killings \"a tragedy in every sense of the word.\" \n State police are on the scene with a crime lab, assisting local police. Neighbors described the family as quiet and hardworking. \n \"Just two or three weeks ago, they had a birthday party \u2014 balloons and all that stuff out there,\" Ronnie Jones told WXYZ-TV. \"They've been working on the house the last two or three months.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police: 2 asphyxiated kids among 4 dead in Detroit area"}

{"date": "September 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Corry Hawkins, center, appears in court Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2016, in Las Vegas. Hawkins was sentenced Tuesday to life without parole for his role as an accomplice in a life insurance murder plot by a mother of four to kill her husband, a U.S. Air Force service member from Guam. \n LAS VEGAS \u00bb A 38-year-old ex-convict was sentenced Tuesday to life in Nevada state prison without parole for taking part in a murder plot by a mother of four to kill her husband, a U.S. Air Force service member from Guam, for his life insurance worth $650,000. \n Corry Hawkins' attorney, Andrea Luem, asked Tuesday for leniency and a chance for her client to one day seek parole in the December 2010 shooting death of Staff Sgt. Nathan Paet. \n But Clark County District Court Judge Douglas Herndon said he was convinced Hawkins helped plan the murder as well as accompanying Michael Rodriguez when Rodriguez gunned Nathan Paet down in his garage. \n The dead man's brother, Eric Paet, told the judge the family in Guam hoped for the maximum sentence for Hawkins, who pleaded guilty in October 2015 to murder, conspiracy, burglary and possession of a weapon by an ex-felon. \n The wife, Michelle Antwanette Paet, and Rodriguez, her boyfriend and co-conspirator, were later convicted in separate trials of first-degree murder and other charges. They are each now also serving life sentences without parole. \n Paet, 28, who served in Iraq, was an F-15 supply technician with the 757th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas. He was preparing to drive to work when he was shot five times. \n Jurors heard that Michelle Paet alerted Rodriguez by text message that Nathan Paet was running late but was coming out the door. \n Jurors were told Nathan Paet died in front of his children, who ranged in age from 2 to 9, while Michelle Paet feigned horror and surprise. \n Authorities said Michelle Paet later texted a smiley face to Rodriguez, who had gone to Hawkins' apartment and burned his clothes in the fireplace. \n Hawkins' former girlfriend, Jessica Austin, who also lived at the apartment, pleaded guilty to felony conspiracy to commit murder. Her sentencing is pending. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "No parole for defendant in slaying of U.S. airman from Guam"}
