The students spent the past week in Los Angeles as academy guests, meeting with studios and networking over fancy dinners. \n \"This is the most amazing week of my life,\" said Alex Schaad, of the University of Television and Film Munich, as he received his medal. \"This evening, this ceremony, this whole week and this award will change a lot of things, and I will owe you that for the rest of my life.\" \n Rongfei Guo, a Chinese filmmaker studying at New York University, said her parents don't understand the world of independent film, but the academy recognition will let her \"prove to my parents that what your daughter's doing is about an Academy Award.\" \n Liu said she was inspired by seeing \"so many people who are excited about the future.\" Edgerton said he's humbled by the next generation of filmmakers. \n \"They have their eyes on what's really going on,\" he said. \"And they're not thinking about the money, and I love that!\" \n Members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences chose the 17 winning films from a record 1,749 submissions. The winning filmmakers hail from China, Greece, Israel, Germany, Poland, Singapore and the United States. More than half are women. \n Yvonne Ng, a student at City College of New York whose film is about the aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing, found a theme among the chosen works. \n \"It's no coincidence that tonight all the winners, the majority of our films are all about the past tragedies that happened on humanity,\" she said as she accepted her medal. \"Someone tonight said to me that we represent the future of filmmaking. And I think we also represent the future that's screaming for peace and love, compassion and mutual respect.\" \n Jimmy Keyrouz of Columbia University, whose film about a musician rebuilding his piano after it's destroyed by terrorists, thanked the academy for helping young filmmakers get their work seen. \n \"Our message is one of hope, and when people are hopeless and desperate, it becomes easier to turn to extremism,\" he said. \"And in a world that is torn by wars and devastation, art is a mighty tool that helps us fight extremism and terrorism, so thank you to the academy for joining our fight. We take so many things for granted, like freedom of speech and expression, and in so many parts of the world, these are luxuries that must be fought for every day.\" \n All of the winning student films are now eligible for Academy Awards. Two student films received nominations last year. Previous Student Academy Award winners include Spike Lee, Trey Parker, Cary Fukunaga, Robert Zemeckis and Pixar's Pete Docter and John Lasseter. \n The 2016 Student Academy Award winners: \n \u2014 \"All These Voices,\" David Henry Gerson, American Film Institute \n \u2014 \"Cloud Kumo,\" Yvonne Ng, City College of New York \n \u2014 \"The Swan Girl,\" Johnny Coffeen, Maharishi University of Management \n \u2014 \"Die Flucht,\" Carter Boyce, DePaul University \n \u2014 \"Once upon a Line,\" Alicja Jasina, University of Southern California \n \u2014 \"The Wishgranter,\" Echo Wu, Ringling College of Art and Design \n \u2014 \"Fairy Tales,\" Rongfei Guo, New York University \n \u2014 \"4.1 Miles,\" Daphne Matziaraki, University of California, Berkeley \n \u2014 \"From Flint: Voices of a Poisoned City,\" Elise Conklin, Michigan State University \n \u2014 \"It's Just a Gun,\" Brian Robau, Chapman University \n \u2014 \"Nocturne in Black,\" Jimmy Keyrouz, Columbia University \n \u2014 \"Rocket,\" Brenna Malloy, Chapman University \n \u2014 \"Invention of Trust,\" Alex Schaad, University of Television and Film Munich (Germany) \n \u2014 \"Tenants,\" Klara Kochanska, The Polish National Film, Television and Theatre School (Poland) \n \u2014 \"Where the Woods End,\" Felix Ahrens, Film University Babelsberg (Germany) \n \u2014 \"Ayny,\" Ahmad Saleh, Academy of Media Arts Cologne (Germany) \n \u2014 \"The Most Beautiful Woman,\" Maya Sarfaty, Tel Aviv University (Israel) \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Young filmmakers thank the academy at Student Academy Awards"}

Clinton doesn't propose that but does advocate for tighter gun laws to curb violence. \n Trump has credited former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of his top supporters, for using stop-and-frisk to bring down crime. The practice continued when Michael Bloomberg, who is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, was mayor. \n In 2013, a U.S. district judge ruled that stop-and-frisk unlawfully targeted minorities. Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, described the program Wednesday as an \"abysmal failure\" and \"code for racial profiling.\" \n The current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat backing presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, was elected in 2013 on a call to curtail the practice and improve relationships between police and minorities. \n Trump is struggling to gain any traction versus Clinton among black voters ahead of November's election. \n The candidates are locked in a tight battle in the overall race. As he swung through Ohio on Wednesday to discuss policing and minority issues, the RealClearPolitics poll average showed him with a 2.5 percentage point lead in the critical state. Nationally, Clinton has a 1.5 percentage point lead in the site's poll average. \n Trump and Clinton have also responded to the police killing of a black man named Terence Crutcher last week in Tulsa, Okla., in a shooting that was caught on video. \n \"This young officer, I don't know what she was thinking, but I'm very very troubled by that,\" Trump said Wednesday at New Spirit Revival Center, a largely black church in Cleveland. \"Did she get scared, was she choking, what happened?\" \n Clinton said Wednesday in Florida that while not all facts are known yet in either the Tulsa or Charlotte killings, \"we do know that we have two more names to add to a long list of African-Americans killed by police officers.

{"date": "September 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Trump has eschewed the kind of mock debate setups candidates traditionally use to get ready for the high-pressure events and hasn't tapped anyone to play Clinton in his prep sessions. \n WASHINGTON >> Donald Trump's advisers are urging him to keep his cool during next week's presidential debate and resist attempts by Hillary Clinton to provoke him with questions about his business record, wealth or controversial comments about minorities. \n The focus underscores the campaign's concern that too many Americans still don't believe the Republican has the temperament to be president, which could be a difference-maker in a close race with Clinton. \n \"He can't let Hillary get under his skin,\" said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and Trump adviser. \n Gingrich is part of a rotating cast of politicians and policy experts traveling with Trump on his private plane for mid-flight debate preparations, according to Republicans familiar with the preparations. Others include retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, who is advising Trump on national security, and economist Peter Navarro. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a loyal Trump supporter, has been helping on issues such as the federal government's relationship with the states. \n Trump has eschewed the kind of mock debate setups candidates traditionally use to get ready for the high-pressure events and hasn't tapped anyone to play Clinton in his prep sessions. But aides say he is studying written briefing material on domestic and international issues and is also talking through topics with advisers. \n \"He's a formidable, well-prepared candidate with a formidable, well-prepared team,\" said Navarro, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. \n Some Trump aides are more concerned about Trump's disposition on the debate stage than his command of the issues, according to Republicans who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the private debate preparations. \n In particular, Trump advisers are trying to steel him for the likelihood that Clinton will aim to get a rise out of him on live television in front of what both campaigns expect to be a record-setting audience. \n The Republican has long lashed out at critics in deeply personal ways, especially after a perceived slight. Clinton has raised that habit as evidence that Trump is too thin-skinned to be trusted with nuclear weapons and other life-and-death decisions that cross a president's desk. \n Voters seem to share Clinton's concerns. According to a new AP-GfK poll, just 30 percent of registered voters say they consider Trump at least somewhat qualified to be president. Only 24 percent consider him at least somewhat civil, while half consider him at least somewhat racist. \n It's unclear how aggressive Clinton will be in trying to bait Trump during Monday night's faceoff at New York's Hofstra University. On the campaign trail and in television ads, she's targeted Trump's criticism of a U.S.-born judge of Mexican descent, his feud with an American-Muslim family whose son was killed in Iraq while serving in the Army and his mocking of a disabled reporter. She's also challenged his business success and suggested he isn't releasing his taxes to the public because he's not as wealthy as he contends. \n \"We have no doubt that his handlers are prevailing on him to arrive at the debate more subdued and to try to suppress his true self,\" said Brian Fallon, Clinton's spokesman. \"Clearly his advisers agree that that is not a very presidential image.\" \n Trump backers say the real estate mogul is prepared to stay steady no matter what Clinton throws at him. \n \"We're going to see the debate prep making sure that she's not going to be able to pull him somehow off the message,\" said Rep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican who is one of Trump's most loyal backers in Congress. He spoke shortly after joining other supportive lawmakers for a meeting Thursday with Trump political director Jim Murphy. \n Collins said the Republican nominee understands the importance of presenting \"President Trump to the American public.\" \n Trump has had more success staying on message following an August campaign shakeup and he's given in to his new senior team's insistence that he stick to a more scripted message during campaign rallies. The debates will be the biggest test of whether he can keep that up for 90 minutes of live television with his political opponent standing just a few feet from him. \n In an interview Thursday morning on \"Fox and Friends,\" Trump said he would \"stay cool\" in the debate. \n \"I'm going to be very respectful of her,\" he said. \"I think she deserves that and I'm going to be nice. And if she's respectful of me, that'll be nice.\" \n But during a Thursday night rally in suburban Philadelphia, Trump revived his efforts to cast Clinton's stamina as weak. \n \"Where is Hillary today?\" he asked. \"They say she's been practicing for the debate. Some people think she's sleeping.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump debate challenge: Keeping his cool if Clinton attacks"}

{"date": "September 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton waves as she boards her campaign plane at Westchester County Airport in White Plains, N.Y., on Wednesday. \n STATE COLLEGE, Pa. \u00bb Students all over Penn State University agree on this much about Hillary Clinton: \"She's slimy,\" said Anay Pope. \n And Pope, 25, is a Clinton supporter. For the moment. \n Clinton's poll numbers are sagging, and the biggest reason is that she's plunging among young voters. A Quinnipiac University poll this month found that in a four-way race, Clinton is up 5 points nationally with 18- to 34-year-old voters, down from a 24-point lead just a month before. \n Just days ahead of the first debate Monday and less than two months before voting ends, interviews with more than 30 young voters in the battleground state of Pennsylvania underscore her two challenges: Many young voters are taking serious looks at Donald Trump as well as Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein. And many are debating whether they even want to vote this year. \n \"There's probably nothing Trump can say to make me vote for him,\" Pope said, but added, \"She makes it hard to vote for her.\" \n The Clinton campaign is quickly boosting its efforts to win over these voters, a tough mission since they've never been much on her side. \n In 27 Democratic primary contests this year, she won an average of 28 percent of the 17- to 29-year-old vote, according to a study by CIRCLE, which studies youth voting trends. Bernie Sanders was the clear young-voter favorite. \n Trump didn't fare much better, winning one-third of the youth vote in 21 GOP primaries, but he did well among those without four-year college degrees. \n If there's a sign of Clinton's challenges with young voters, it's clear on the campuses of Penn State and the nearby Central Pennsylvania Institute of Science and Technology, in the middle of one of the nation's swing states, where it's easier to find a New York Giants football fan than a Clinton loyalist. \n These are voters whose political awareness began in the mid-2000s. They have little regard \u2014 or use for \u2014 government and politics. They've seen the United States embroiled in two wars, a brutal recession that affected their parents and a Washington that seems endlessly mired in gridlock. \n They do know Trump, the host of \"The Apprentice\" and \"The Celebrity Apprentice,\" and his blunt talk has some appeal. \n Elliot Jersild, 22, a Penn State junior statistics major, wasn't planning on voting. Then along came Trump. \n \"He's the only reason I'm voting now,\" Jersild said. \"He's not politically correct, and that means we can have an honest discussion about policy without being called racist or sexist.\" \n \"Trump is not a politician,\" added Felippe Maher, 20, a Penn State junior economics and history major. \n Kristen Probst, 26, a practical-nursing student at Central Pennsylvania Institute, is a registered Democrat, but Clinton won't get her vote. \"Trump is no fake,\" she explained. \n Plenty of students dislike Trump, though; Quinnipiac found two-thirds of young voters view him unfavorably. The campus's College Republican chapter voted 3 to 1 against endorsing him. \n \"I despise him with all my heart,\" said Michael Straw, 21, the group's president. He's undecided. He doesn't agree with Clinton's plans to involve government in boosting the economy, and he does appreciate Libertarian Gary Johnson's free-market ideas. \n Students are intrigued by Johnson, and polls show him gaining support. But Quinnipiac also found that 44 percent hadn't heard enough about him, and the young voters are reluctant to eagerly embrace him at this point. \n Johnson at least has fresh ideas, said Matthew Pendleton, 21, a senior economic major. Exactly, said Daniel Donaher, 20, a junior electrical engineering major. He's less likely to involve the U.S. in war, Donaher said, whereas Clinton is \"hawkish.\" \n Clinton's biggest obstacle is clearly herself. Vincent Cucchiara, 18, a sophomore chemical engineering major, echoed a common complaint: She doesn't seem real. \n Cucchiara, a Libertarian who is undecided, recalled how Clinton endorsed same-sex marriage only three years ago. During her 2008 campaign, she favored civil unions. \n The Penn State Students for Hillary group disputes the notion their candidate is so unpopular. Johnna Purcell, 20, who heads the group, called reports of lagging support a \"myth.\" She concedes, though, that getting students to vote will be tough. \n \"They distrust the system, and they don't want to work within the system,\" she said. \"We're showing people the only way to change it is to work within it.\" \n Clinton needs young voters to hear that message. President Barack Obama won 60 percent of their votes four years ago and 66 percent in 2008. Quinnipiac put Clinton's young-voter support at 31 percent in a four-way race.  \n She's pushing hard. The campaign has added staff in key states that will zero in on the millennial vote. \n Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., are out pushing for her. Clinton herself used an appearance in Philadelphia at Temple University on Monday to stress the need for young people to turn out. She recalled her days as a young Democratic activist. \n To many, it all looked like vintage Clinton, shaping her message to get what she wants. \n \"I just don't feel I can trust her,\" said Jesse Weber, 21, a senior immunology major who's undecided. He's no fan of Trump, finding the Republican \"makes people feel uncomfortable,\" a deadly trait for a president. He's thinking of not voting. \n Most students who say they'll vote for Clinton do so grudgingly. They were Sanders supporters who spent months disparaging Clinton, and they're not about to wear her buttons or urge their friends to join them. \n \"Trump doesn't have a very solid or logical train of thought,\" said Marvin Barnhill, 18, a sophomore labor and employment relations major. A registered Democrat, he said he \"distrusts\" Clinton but that at least she's better than Trump. \n \"I'm not passionate about Hillary Clinton,\" added Larissa Gil, 20, a senior philosophy and German major. \"She doesn't have the integrity Bernie does, but she will do a 100 percent better job than Trump.\"  \n The biggest danger for Clinton is another controversy, anything that feeds that distrust. \n \"The moment I get my head wrapped around the fact that I can vote for her in November another scandal comes out,\" said Pope, and that's why her vote \"has been hanging by a thread the whole time.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 McClatchy Washington Bureau  \n ", "author": "By David Lightman McClatchy Washington Bureau", "title": "Young voters to Clinton: We can't stand you"}

{"date": "September 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel delivers his new public safety plan to combat gun violence for the nation's third-largest city at the Malcolm X Community College. \n CHICAGO >> Mayor Rahm Emanuel appealed to Chicago residents Thursday for help fighting the troubling rise in city violence, announcing youth mentoring efforts, policing strategies and gun legislation as his plan to fight and prevent crime. \n He used the invitation-only speech to cap off announcements in recent days that the city will add nearly 1,000 police officers, expand the use of body cameras and require de-escalation training, reforms in the wake of an ongoing U.S. Department of Justice investigation of the police department. \n The former White House chief of staff highlighted a new $36 million public-private mentoring partnership that'll help over 7,000 youths over the next three years, veering from prepared remarks when describing the struggles young people face in neighborhoods tormented by gangs and violence. \n \"The deck has been stacked against the kids,\" he said. \"It's time we reshuffle the deck and put our kids on the top of that deck.\" \n Inside the Malcolm X College gym on Chicago's near West Side, security was tight and the reception was friendly with the audience of aldermen, community leaders and Emanuel administration members applauding at least a dozen times during the 40-minute speech. Outside, there were a few protesters calling for scrutiny of police misconduct investigations, a theme that's rippled for months. \n Emanuel, in his second term as mayor, has been trying to rebuild trust in his leadership, particularly after the 2014 death of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager shot 16 times by a white police officer. The officer was charged with murder, but only after a judge ordered the public release of the graphic squad car video last year. Circulation of the video prompted frequent protests, allegations of a cover-up and repeated calls for Emanuel to step down. \n The Justice Department has since launched a systemic probe of department practices. And Emanuel, who initially opposed the idea of a federal probe, said Thursday that the city should work with federal agencies to improve. \n \"Fighting crime requires a partnership between the police and the community. And we all know that this partnership has been tested in Chicago,\" he said. \"It is a problem that has festered in this city for decades. The shooting of Laquan McDonald brought it to a breaking point.\" \n His speech also touched on new technology, including gunshot-tracing cameras; gun shop legislation; and the need for more neighborhood resources. \n He bluntly asked Chicagoans for assistance. Calling respect \"a two-way street,\" he said there's no pass for people to taunt police or for officers to dismiss citizens who need help. \n \"Every one of us has a role to play in rebuilding the vital partnership between our police and the community. We all have to hold ourselves, and each other, to a higher standard,\" he said. \"So today I am calling on all Chicagoans to join in a comprehensive plan \u2014 a blueprint \u2014 to confront gun violence.\" \n Emanuel recapped changes instituted by his administration, including abolishing the agency that handles police investigations and pitching a new system for reviewing police misconduct and department audits. \n Chicago has seen a dramatic rise in the number of shootings and homicides this year. In August alone, there were 90 homicides, marking the first time in two decades there have been that many in a single month. Overall, the city has recorded more than 500 homicides this year \u2014 higher than all of 2015 \u2014 and is on pace to climb past the 600-homicide mark for the first time since 2003. \n The city's image has also come up on the presidential campaign trail with Republican nominee Donald Trump suggesting Thursday that Chicago is more violent than Afghanistan. Trump also endorsed a stop-and-frisk policing method for the city, which a federal judge said New York City used unconstitutionally because of its overwhelming impact on minority residents. \n During the speech, Emanuel described several high-profile cases, his voice cracking when noting the shooting death of the 19-year-old son of a Chicago police officer. \n Emanuel didn't specify how the city would pay for the new efforts in his speech, including the addition of the new officers, which is expected to cost about $134 million. \n The addition of police has prompted criticism from groups including Black Lives Matter, who say resources should be spent on schools, health care and affordable housing. \n Alderman Willie Cochran said he was encouraged by Emanuel's efforts, but said more could have been done sooner. \n \"He knew all along there was a need,\" he said. \"The proof is in the pudding.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Chicago's mayor details mentoring plans in crime speech"}

{"date": "September 22, 2016", "text": "LOS ANGELES TIMES / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n Holiday weight gain is not unique to only the United States. \n Halloween is right around the corner, which means Thanksgiving and Christmas will be coming up soon. If you're already worried about putting on extra pounds over the holidays, a new study has some discouraging news: Your fears are justified. \n Americans who participated in the study saw their weight increase by 0.2 percent during the Thanksgiving holiday and 0.4 percent over Christmas, researchers report in Thursday's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. \n Though Americans are known to have trouble maintaining a healthy weight \u2014 38 percent of us are obese and another 33 percent are merely overweight, according to the latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 this pattern of holiday weight gain is hardly unique to the United States. \n In Germany, study participants boosted their body weight by 0.6 percent around Christmas and another 0.2 percent around Easter. And in Japan, celebrants got 0.5 percent heavier over Christmas and 0.3 percent heavier during Golden Week, a period that encompasses four national holidays. \n \"Different countries celebrate different holidays, but many such celebration periods have one thing in common: an increased intake of favorite foods,\" study authors wrote. \n The researchers analyzed daily fluctuations in the weight of 2,924 people with Withings wireless scales, which automatically transmit weight measurements to a smartphone app. That prevented study participants from fudging their numbers on days when the scale delivered unwelcome news. \n The research team \u2014 Elina Helander of Tampere University of Technology in Finland, Brian Wansink of the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab and Angela Chieh of Withings, a consumer electronics company in Paris \u2014 examined data collected from the scales between August 2012 and July 2013. The weight readings were converted into daily weight changes, which were used to compute an average for each country. \n To measure the effects of big holidays, the team determined the highest weight of each participant during the 10 days after a holiday and compared it with his or her weight 10 days before the holiday. That way, the researchers were able to include the extra pounds people put on while drinking Pumpkin Spice Lattes (380 calories per 16-ounce serving) in the days leading up to Thanksgiving and eating gingerbread while waiting for Santa. \n The effect of all this binging was visible on scales in all three countries. \n The Christmas-to-New-Year's season was the biggest doozy in the Western nations, causing Germans to put on an average of 1.75 pounds and Americans to gain an average of 1.3 pounds, according to the study. \n In Japan, the most significant toll came during Golden Week, with study participants gaining an average of 1.1 pounds. Although the absolute amount of weight gain was lower than in the other countries, it represented the same percentage increase as was seen in the U.S. \n About half of this extra weight was lost relatively soon after it was put on, but the other half persisted \"until the summer or beyond,\" the researchers wrote. In all three countries, the average weight of the study participants was lower at the end of the study than it was at the start. \n That's probably a sign that this group of people was \"more motivated toward weight loss than average,\" the researchers noted. (And that explains why they invested in Withings scales, which start at about $130.) \n A truly representative sample of Americans, Germans and Japanese might gain even more weight over the holidays, Wansink said. Previous studies have found that people tend to gain 3 to 4 pounds over the holidays and take longer to burn it off, but those results were based on self-reported data that aren't as reliable as the measurements from the wireless scales. \n Wansink said he was surprised the Americans didn't pack on holiday pounds more often. The Fourth of July and Labor Day were two prime candidates, since celebrations often revolve around barbecues. \n The study findings demonstrate that if you wait until January to overhaul your eating habits, you're already way behind. \n \"Make an October resolution instead of a New Year's resolution,\" Wansink said. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times  \n ", "author": "By Karen Kaplan Los Angeles Times", "title": "Study: All over the world, people celebrate holidays by gaining weight"}

Angelina Jolie Pitt has filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, bringing an end to one of the world's most star-studded, tabloid-generating romances. \n LOS ANGELES \u00bb The FBI is gathering information about an incident involving actor Brad Pitt and his family aboard a private flight last week, the agency confirmed today. \n Spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the FBI is still evaluating whether to open an investigation into allegations Pitt was abusive during the flight toward one of his six children with actress Angelina Jolie Pitt, as several media outlets have reported. \n The news reports from anonymous sources contend the actor is under investigation by a child welfare agency because of the Sept. 14 airborne incident. \n Amara Suarez, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, said the agency could not confirm whether it was investigating Pitt or the well-being of the former couple's children. \n A representative for Pitt declined comment today. \n Jolie Pitt filed for divorce Monday and her lawyer released a statement the following day saying she came to the decision \"for the health of the family.\" She listed their separation date as Sept. 15, the day after the alleged plane incident, and the actress is seeking sole custody of all six of the children. \n A phone message left for Jolie Pitt's attorney Laura Wasser was not returned today. \n Koochiching County, Minnesota, Sheriff Perryn Hedlund told The Associated Press today that Brad Pitt was on a plane that landed at the International Falls, Minnesota, airport near the Canadian border on Sept. 14. \n Hedlund said his sheriff's deputies were not called to the airport, and International Falls police were also not called. \n \"There's no incident whatsoever reported to law enforcement,\" Hedlund said. \n He said he didn't know why the plane landed in International Falls, but said it's not uncommon for hockey players or other celebrities to stop at the airport. \n Messages left with the airport's manager were not returned today. \n Pitt and Jolie Pitt \u2014 known as \"Brangelina\" \u2014 were together for 12 years but only wed in August 2014. They married privately at their French chateau in the Provence hamlet of Correns with their children serving as ring bearers and throwing flower petals. They announced the ceremony days later. \n Their six children include 15-year-old Maddox, 12-year-old Pax, 11-year-old Zahara, 10-year-old Shiloh, and 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. \n This is the second marriage for Pitt, 52, who previously wed Jennifer Aniston. It's the third for Jolie Pitt, 41, who was previously married to Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller. \n In 2006, they formed the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to which they funneled many of the millions they made selling personal pictures to celebrity magazines. \n In addition to their philanthropy, much of their off-screen public image has been about their role as parents. \n Although Jolie Pitt's divorce filing sought sole physical custody of their children, divorce experts say the actors will have to agree to a parenting plan or face a public custody battle in court. Both actors have, in separate statements, said their primary concern was their children and asked for privacy. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "FBI says it's evaluating abuse allegations against Pitt"}

Charlotte police refused under mounting pressure today to release video that could resolve wildly different accounts of the shooting of a black man, as the National Guard arrived to try to head off a third night of violence in this city on edge. \n CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u00bb Protesters massed on Charlotte's streets for a third night today in the latest sign of mounting pressure for police to release video that could resolve wildly different accounts of the shooting of a black man. \n Demonstrators chanted \"release the tape\" and \"we want the tape\" while briefly blocking an intersection near Bank of America headquarters and later climbing the steps in front of the city government center. Later, several dozen demonstrators climbed onto an interstate highway through the city, but they were pushed back by police in riot gear. \n Still, the protests lacked the violence and property damage of previous nights \u2014 and a midnight curfew imposed by the mayor aimed to add a firm stopping point for the demonstrations. Local officers' ranks were augmented by members of the National Guard carrying rifles and guarding office buildings against the threat of property damage. \n So far, police have resisted releasing police dashcam and body camera footage of the death of 43-year Keith Lamont Scott earlier this week. His family was shown the footage Thursday and demanded that police release it to the public. The family's lawyer said he couldn't tell whether Scott was holding a gun. \n But Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said earlier in the day that releasing the footage of Scott's killing could undermine the investigation. He told reporters the video will be made public when he believes there is a \"compelling reason\" to do so. \n \"You shouldn't expect it to be released,\" Putney said. \"I'm not going to jeopardize the investigation.\" \n Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts waited until Thursday's protests were underway for more than an hour before signing documents for the citywide curfew that runs from midnight to 6 a.m. The curfew will last for multiple days until officials determine the emergency has passed. \n In an interview with CNN, Roberts said she thought the curfew was the most effective way to maintain peace in the city. \n Charlotte is the latest U.S. city to be shaken by protests and recriminations over the death of a black man at the hands of police, a list that includes Baltimore, Milwaukee, Chicago, New York and Ferguson, Missouri. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Thursday, prosecutors charged a white officer with manslaughter for killing an unarmed black man on a city street last week. \n In Charlotte, scores of rioters Wednesday night attacked reporters and others, set fires and smashed windows of hotels, office buildings and restaurants in the city's bustling downtown section. The NASCAR Hall of Fame was among the places damaged. \n Forty-four people were arrested after Wednesday's protests, and one protester who was shot died at the hospital Thursday; city officials said police did not shoot the man and no arrests have been made in 26-year-old Justin Carr's death. \n Police have said that Scott was shot to death Tuesday by a black officer after he disregarded loud, repeated warnings to drop his gun. Neighbors, though, have said he was holding only a book. The police chief said a gun was found next to the dead man, and there was no book. \n Putney said that he has seen the video and it does not contain \"absolute, definitive evidence that would confirm that a person was pointing a gun.\" But he added: \"When taken in the totality of all the other evidence, it supports what we said.\" \n Justin Bamberg, an attorney for Scott's family, watched the video with the slain man's relatives. He said Scott gets out of his vehicle calmly. \n \"While police did give him several commands, he did not aggressively approach them or raise his hands at members of law enforcement at any time. It is impossible to discern from the videos what, if anything, Mr. Scott is holding in his hands,\" Bamberg said in a statement. \n Scott was shot as he walked slowly backward with his hands by his side, Bamberg said. \n The lawyer said at a news conference earlier in the day that Scott's wife saw him get shot, \"and that's something she will never, ever forget.\" That is the first time anyone connected with the case has said the wife witnessed the shooting. Bamberg gave no details on what the wife saw. \n Roberts, who also watched the footage of the shooting, was asked by CNN whether she saw Scott holding a gun. \n \"It is not a very clear picture and the gun in question is a small gun. And it was not easy to see \u2026 so it is ambiguous,\" she replied. \n Experts who track shootings by police noted that the release of videos can often quell protest violence, and that the footage sometimes shows that events unfolded differently than the official account. \n \"What we've seen in too many situations now is that the videos tell the truth and the police who were involved in the shooting tell lies,\" said Randolph McLaughlin, a professor at Pace University School of Law. He said it is \"irresponsible\" of police not to release the video immediately. \n Other cities have released footage of police shootings. Just this week, Tulsa police let the public see video of the disputed Sept. 16 shooting, though the footage left important questions unanswered. \n The police chief acknowledged that he has promised transparency in the investigation, but said, \"I'm telling you right now, if you think I say we should display a victim's worst day for consumption, that is not the transparency I'm speaking of.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "3rd night of Charlotte protests stay largely peaceful"}

Boyd died Wednesday, three days after the fight with the officers. Police are investigating his death, and an autopsy is pending. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Linda Burch, 51, stands in the doorway of her home in Middle River, Md., today. Burch is the grandmother of Tawon Boyd, 21, who died Wednesday, three days after he was punched and held to the ground by Baltimore County police officers who responded to his home after his girlfriend called 911 because he was acting strangely. \n MIDDLE RIVER, Md. \u00bb A black man died three days after he called police to his suburban Baltimore home during an outburst of strange behavior and was punched in the face and held to the ground by officers, police and relatives said.  \n Tawon Boyd, 21, died Wednesday after spending three days in a hospital following the confrontation with officers Sunday morning outside his home in Middle River. Baltimore County police said in a statement that he became aggressive with officers, who used physical force to subdue him. \n \"They kept on grabbing on him and holding him down, and he started screaming, 'Grandma, Grandma, they're going to kill me,'\" Linda Burch, Boyd's grandmother, told The Associated Press. Burch, 51, had been staying with her grandson and witnessed the confrontation across the street from his home. \n An autopsy is being conducted to determine the cause of death. A lawyer for Boyd's family, Latoya Francis-Williams, told The Associated Press that Boyd's kidneys and heart failed. She said it's not clear whether his death resulted from the beating or a medical condition, but she said he hadn't experienced kidney failure previously. \n \"He didn't have those bruises. He wasn't battered before this. He wasn't unconscious before this,\" Francis-Williams said today. \"All of the physical injuries came from the severe beating he took on Sunday.\" \n The confrontation occurred after Boyd himself called 911, police and Francis-Williams said Thursday. The lawyer and police initially believed Boyd's girlfriend had placed the call. Francis-Williams said the operator heard Boyd's girlfriend in the background saying he needed medical attention. Boyd did not ask for medical aid and officers responded because the call indicated a domestic disturbance, police said in a statement. \n When police arrived, Boyd told officers there was someone inside his house, but in fact there was no intruder, according to a police report obtained by The AP. He \"appeared to be confused and paranoid,\" police said in the report, and his girlfriend told officers he was acting \"crazy.\" \n The confrontation with police began after Boyd repeatedly banged on the door of a neighbor's home and officers tried to pull him away to keep him from going inside, according to the police report. Police said Boyd also tried to enter several marked police cars. He refused to obey orders to lie down and put his hands on his back, and began grabbing and kicking officers, injuring three of them, police said. \n \"I think they killed him,\" Burch told AP. \"By them being so many, and they tall and big, and he's small. It didn't take all them police just to try to hold him down.\" \n Boyd was 5-foot-5 inches tall, according to court records, and Francis-Williams said he weighed 122 pounds. \n Francis-Williams said she's found no evidence that Boyd was violent before officers started beating him. \n \"Blows to the head, choking somebody \u2014 that's deadly force,\" Francis-Williams said. \"I haven't heard any officer articulate that his or her life was in danger or there was an actual threat of severe bodily injury or death.\" \n One officer punched Boyd twice in the face because Boyd was hanging onto him, according to the police report. The officers restrained Boyd by holding him down with their arms and legs, the report said. The confrontation with police lasted about five minutes, and five officers were involved, the report said. \n Medics were called during the struggle and gave Boyd something to calm him down, but the name of the medication was redacted from the police report. Police said medical privacy laws prevent them from detailing the treatment. \n The report said officers believed Boyd was under the influence of a narcotic. Boyd's uncle, Prinice Thomas, told AP that he had never known Boyd to use any drug other than marijuana. \n Boyd worked as a forklift operator, his family's attorney said, and he had a 3-year-old son with his girlfriend, Deona Styron, who was pregnant with the couple's second child. In June, Styron sought a temporary protective order against him, alleging that he hit and choked her, according to court records. \n \"He gets mad and starts hitting me and fussing at me and I can't take it anymore. He needs to seek help,\" Styron wrote. \n Styron did not return a message left at a number listed for her. \n Homicide detectives are investigating the incident, standard procedure in police-involved deaths. The department did not reveal the races of the officers. \n Like many black men who have died during confrontations with police, Boyd's name was trending as a hashtag on Twitter, but there were no immediate protests. Boyd died on the same day that Baltimore County prosecutors said no charges would be filed in the death of Korryn Gaines, a 23-year-old black woman who, police and prosecutors said, pointed a shotgun at officers during a standoff at her apartment. \n About 70 people gathered for a community meeting Thursday night in Randallstown, where Baltimore County State's Attorney Scott Shellenberger faced questions from residents about his decision not to bring charges in the Gaines case. \n Kelly Carter, executive director for the Liberty Road Business Association, said the two cases have reinforced her concerns that the county's police department needs to work on community relations. \n \"I think that they need to go back to the drawing board and create new training programs for the officers,\" Carter said after the meeting. \"And I think there needs to be more of a presence in building community relations.\" \n Activists with the Black Lives Matter movement protested over Gaines' death, and a wrongful-death lawsuit has been filed. \n Francis-Williams said lawsuits were possible and that the county's police department has problems similar to neighboring Baltimore city, where a Justice Department investigation found repeated civil rights violations. The investigation followed the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died after suffering a spinal injury while riding in a Baltimore police van. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Man dies, days after fight with police; lawyer blames cops"}

Police say Tulsa officer Shelby fired the fatal shot that killed 40-year-old Terence Crutcher on Sept. 16. \n TULSA, Okla. \u00bb Prosecutors charged a white Oklahoma police officer with first-degree manslaughter today, less than a week after she killed an unarmed black man on a city street and just days after police released graphic videos, saying in court documents the officer \"reacted unreasonably.\" \n Tulsa officer Betty Shelby fatally shot 40-year-old Terence Crutcher on Sept. 16. The affidavit filed with the charge says Shelby \"reacted unreasonably by escalating the situation from a confrontation with Mr. Crutcher, who was not responding to verbal commands and was walking away from her with his hands held up, becoming emotionally involved to the point that she over reacted.\" \n Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler said arrangements were being made for Shelby's surrender. \n The swift action in Tulsa stood in contrast to Charlotte, North Carolina, where police refused under mounting pressure today to release video of the shooting of another black man this week and the National Guard was called in to try to a head off a third night of violence. Demonstrations in Tulsa since Crutcher's death have been consistently peaceful. \n Dashcam and aerial footage of the shooting and its aftermath showed Crutcher walking away from Shelby with his arms in the air. The footage does not offer a clear view of when Shelby fired the single shot that killed Crutcher. Her attorney has said Crutcher was not following police commands and that Shelby opened fire when the man began to reach into his SUV window. \n But Crutcher's family immediately discounted that claim, saying the father of four posed no threat to the officers. They also pointed to an enlarged photo from police footage that appears to show Crutcher's window was rolled up. And police said Crutcher did not have a gun on him or in his vehicle. \n The affidavit filed today also indicates that Shelby \"cleared the driver's side front\" of Crutcher's vehicle before she began interacting with Crutcher, suggesting she may have known there was no gun on the driver's side of the vehicle. \n The affidavit says Shelby told police homicide investigators that \"she was in fear for her life and thought Mr. Crutcher was going to kill her. When she began following Mr. Crutcher to the vehicle with her duty weapon drawn, she was yelling for him to stop and get on his knees repeatedly.\" \n Crutcher was wearing \"baggy clothes\" but Shelby \"was not able to see any weapons or bulges indicating a weapon was present,\" the affidavit states. \n Prosecutors offer two possible theories in charging documents: that Shelby killed Crutcher impulsively in a fit of anger or that she wrongly killed him as she sought to detain him. The case first goes to a judge, who will decide whether there is enough evidence for a trial. Lee F. Berlin, a Tulsa-based defense lawyer and a former assistant district attorney in Oklahoma, said prosecutors may at some point decide to move forward with only one of the theories or could present both to jurors and let them decide. \n If convicted, Shelby faces between four years and life in prison. \n Crutcher's twin sister, Tiffany Crutcher, said the family was pleased criminal charges were filed and urged a vigorous prosecution that leads to a conviction. \n \"Our goal now is to ensure that this never happens to another innocent citizen,\" Tiffany Crutcher said. \"We're going to break the chains of injustice. We're going to break the chains of police brutality.\" \n Tulsa Mayor Dewey Bartlett said police worked quickly to provide Kunzweiler with the information he needed to decide whether to charge the officer. \n \"I appreciate their efforts as well as the District Attorney's usual thorough evaluation of the rules of law for which we are all accountable,\" Bartlett said in a written statement. \"We will continue to be transparent and ensure the system carries out its responsibility to provide justice.\" \n Shelby, who joined the Tulsa Police Department in December 2011, was en route to a domestic violence call when she encountered Crutcher's vehicle abandoned on a city street, straddling the center line. Shelby did not activate her patrol car's dashboard camera, so no footage exists of what first happened between the two before other officers arrived. \n The police footage shows Crutcher approaching the driver's side of the SUV, then more officers walk up and Crutcher appears to lower his hands and place them on the vehicle. A man inside a police helicopter overhead says: \"That looks like a bad dude, too. Probably on something.\" \n Police Sgt. Dave Walker has said investigators found a vial of the drug PCP in Crutcher's vehicle. Shelby's attorney, Scott Wood, has said that Shelby completed drug-recognition expert training and thought Crutcher was acting like he might be under the influence of PCP. \n Attorneys for Crutcher's family said the family didn't know whether drugs were found in the SUV, but that even if they were, it wouldn't justify the shooting. \n A toxicology report could take several weeks. \n Wood did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment about Shelby being charged. \n In the videos, the officers surround Crutcher and he suddenly drops to the ground. A voice heard on the police radio says: \"Shots fired!\" The officers back away and Crutcher is left unattended on the street for about two minutes before an officer puts on medical gloves and begins to attend to him. \n \"The tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Crutcher are on the hearts and minds of many people in this community,\" Kunzweiler said. \"It's important to note that despite the heightened tensions felt by all, which seemingly beg for an emotional response and reaction, our community has consistently demonstrated the willingness to respect the judicial process.\" \n At least two dozen people gathered outside the courthouse after the district attorney announced the officer was charged. Later, a peaceful rally was held in front of City Hall. Some demonstrators expressed disappointed Shelby wasn't charged with first-degree murder, but others considered Thursday's announcement a victory. \n \"Today we can say without a shadow of a doubt that the system has worked for black lives,\" said activist Marq Lewis, an organizer of the civil rights group We the People Oklahoma, which led the rally in front of City Hall. \"We are getting something done in Tulsa that no other city is getting done.\" \n Earlier this year, a former volunteer deputy with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office was sentenced to four years in prison after he was convicted of second-degree manslaughter in the shooting death of Eric Harris, who was also black and unarmed. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tulsa police officer charged in man's death"}

{"date": "September 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A person walked in front of a Yahoo sign at the company's headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., in Nov. 2014. Yahoo says the personal information in 500 million accounts was stolen in a massive security breakdown. The breach disclosed today, the latest setback for the beleaguered internet company, dates back to late 2014. \n SAN FRANCISCO \u00bb Computer hackers swiped personal information from at least 500 million Yahoo accounts in what is believed to be the biggest digital break-in at an email provider. \n The massive security breakdown disclosed today poses new headaches for Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer as she scrambles to close a $4.8 billion sale to Verizon Communication. \n The breach today dates back to late 2014, raising questions about the checks and balances within Yahoo \u2014 a fallen internet star that has been laying off staff to counter a steep drop in revenue during the past eight years. \n At the time of the break-in, Yahoo's security team was led by Alex Stamos, a respected industry executive who left last year to take a similar job at Facebook. \n Yahoo didn't explain what took so long to uncover a breach that it blamed on a \"state-sponsored actor\" \u2014 parlance for a hacker working on behalf of a foreign government. The Sunnyvale, California, company declined to explain how it reached its conclusions about the attack, but said it is working with the FBI and other law enforcement as part of its ongoing investigation. \n MOST ACCOUNTS EVER STOLEN \n \"This is a pretty big deal that is probably going to cost them tens of millions of dollars,\" predicted Avivah Litan, a computer security analyst for Gartner Inc. \"Regulators and lawyers are going to have a field day with this one.\" \n Litan described it as the most accounts stolen from a single email provider. \n The stolen data includes users' names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birth dates, scrambled passwords, and the security questions \u2014 and answers \u2014 used to verify an accountholder's identity. \n Last month, the tech site Motherboard reported that a hacker who uses the name \"Peace\" boasted that he had account information belonging to 200 million Yahoo users and was trying to sell the data on the web. \n Yahoo is recommending that users change their passwords if they haven't done so since 2014. The company said the attacker didn't get any information about its users' bank accounts or credit and debit cards. \n THE VERIZON IMPACT \n News of the security lapse could cause some people to have second thoughts about relying on Yahoo's services, raising a prickly issue for the company as it tries to sell its digital operations to Verizon Communications. \n That deal, announced two months ago, isn't supposed to close until early next year. That leaves Verizon with wiggle room to renegotiate the purchase price or even back out if it believes the security breach will harm Yahoo's business. That could happen if users shun Yahoo or file lawsuits because they're incensed by the theft of their personal information. \n Verizon said it still doesn't know enough about the Yahoo break-in to assess the potential consequences. \"We will evaluate as the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests, including consumers, customers, shareholders and related communities,\" the company said in a statement. \n DELAY OF ACQUISITION? \n At the very least, Verizon is going to need more time to assess what it will be getting into if it proceeds with its plans to take over Yahoo, said Scott Vernick, an attorney specializing in data security for the law firm Fox Rothschild. \n \"This is going to slow things down. There is going to be a lot of blood, sweat and tears shed on this\" Vernick said. \"A buyer needs to understand the cybersecurity strengths and weaknesses of its target these days.\" \n Investors evidently aren't nervous about the Verizon deal unraveling yet. Yahoo's stock added a penny today to close at $44.17. But the Verizon sale represents a sliver of Yahoo's total market value, which primarily consists of a stake in Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group currently worth $42 billion. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Yahoo says hackers stole info in 500 million user accounts"}

{"date": "September 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney paused before answering a question, Thursday, during a news conference after a second night of violence following Tuesday's fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, N.C. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A CMPD officer, center, spoke with protesters in Charlotte, N.C. on Wednesday. \n CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u00bb Charlotte police refused under mounting pressure today to release video that could resolve wildly different accounts of the shooting of a black man, as the National Guard arrived to try to head off a third night of violence in this city on edge. \n Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said that releasing police dashcam and body camera footage of the killing of 43-year Keith Lamont Scott could undermine the investigation. He told reporters the video will be made public when he believes there is a \"compelling reason\" to do so. \n \"You shouldn't expect it to be released,\" Putney said. \"I'm not going to jeopardize the investigation.\" \n Meanwhile, an undisclosed number of National Guardsmen assembled in Charlotte, sent in by Gov. Pat McCrory after a second straight night of racial unrest that seemed at odds with Charlotte's image as a diverse, forward-looking banking capital of the New South/ \n Charlotte is just the latest U.S. city to be shaken by protests and recriminations over the death of a black man at the hands of police, a list that includes Baltimore, Milwaukee, Chicago, New York, and Ferguson, Missouri. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, today, prosecutors charged a white officer with manslaughter for killing an unarmed black man on a city street last week. \n In Charlotte, scores of rioters Wednesday night attacked reporters and others, set fires and smashed windows of hotels, office buildings and restaurants in the city's bustling downtown section. The NASCAR Hall of Fame was among the places damaged. \n Forty-four people were arrested, and one protester was shot and critically wounded; city officials said police did not shoot the man. \n Today, in a measure of how tense things had become, three of Charlotte's major employers \u2014 Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy \u2014 told thousands of employees not to venture into the city. \n Hours before nightfall today, the police chief said he saw no need for a curfew. In addition to the National Guardsmen, North Carolina state troopers and U.S. Justice Department conflict-resolution experts were sent to keep the peace. \n Demonstrators have been demanding answers in Scott's killing, with some carrying signs that read \"Release the tapes.\" \n Police have said that Scott was shot to death Tuesday by a black officer after he disregarded loud, repeated warnings to drop his gun. Neighbors, though, have said he was holding only a book. The police chief said a gun was found next to the dead man, and there was no book. \n Putney said that he has seen the video and it does not contain \"absolute, definitive evidence that would confirm that a person was pointing a gun.\" But he added: \"When taken in the totality of all the other evidence, it supports what we said.\" \n Justin Bamberg, an attorney for Scott's family, said the family would watch police video of the shooting later today. \n \"The family wants answers. The family deserves answers,\" Bamberg said. \"Quite frankly, we don't know what's on the video. We know what law enforcement says is on the video.\" \n The lawyer also said that Scott's wife saw him get shot, \"and that's something she will never, ever forget.\" That is the first time anyone connected with the case has said the wife witnessed the shooting. Bamberg gave no details on what the wife saw. \n Experts who track shootings by police noted that the release of videos can often quell protest violence, and that the footage sometimes shows that events unfolded differently than the official account. \n \"What we've seen in too many situations now is that the videos tell the truth and the police who were involved in the shooting tell lies,\" said Randolph McLaughlin, a professor at Pace University School of Law. He said it is \"irresponsible\" of police not to release the video immediately. \n Other cities have released footage of police shootings. Just this week, Tulsa police let the public see video of the disputed Sept. 16 shooting, though the footage left important questions unanswered. \n Last year, a Chicago police officer was charged with murder the same day the city released dashcam video that showed him shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times, footage that contradicted the accounts of officers who said the teen swung a knife at them. \n \"We all stand together declaring there must be transparency and the videos must be released,\" the Rev. William Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP, said at a news conference. \"At this point, there is speculation because the videos have not been released. Be clear: There is unrest in Charlotte and across America because of what we do know.\" \n The police chief acknowledged that he has promised transparency in the investigation, but said, \"I'm telling you right now, if you think I say we should display a victim's worst day for consumption, that is not the transparency I'm speaking of.\" \n Associated Press writers Seanna Adcox, Jeffrey Collins, Jack Jones and Gary Robertson contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Charlotte police refuse to release video of deadly shooting"}
