{"date": "September 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Police confront protesters blocking I-277 during a third night of unrest following Tuesday's police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, N.C., on Thursday. \n CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u00bb Still in an official state of emergency and under a midnight curfew, Charlotte's uptown relaxed today after three days of passionate protests and occasional violence.  \n People went to restaurants, walked their dogs on the street and generally ratcheted down the tension that came in the wake of a police killing Tuesday of a man in University City. \n Even a dramatic video recording the fatal shots and released by attorneys for the family of the dead man, Keith Lamont Scott, did not appear to raise the level of anger or protest in the city's urban core. \n Police and National Guard troops maintained a visible presence throughout uptown. The EpiCentre entertainment complex, magnet for some of the week's most tumultuous upheaval, closed down early. \n Still, there was still plenty of evidence of civic dissent. \n After darkness fell Friday, protesters gathered at the crossroads of Trade and Tryon holding signs. \n \"#it was a book,\" said one, referring to early reports from his family and neighbors that Scott had a book, not a gun, when shot. \n Around 8:30 p.m., about 100 demonstrators moved past the intersection, chanting: \"We're shutting down police brutality,\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" \n \"Everyone is being peaceful,\" said police Capt. Mike Campagna. \"Everything went well last night. There's no reason that can't happen tonight.\" \n For a short time, marchers went up on Interstate 277 at Caldwell Street, where they encountered police in riot gear. Police moved them off the highway and the demonstrators changed course for Church Street nearby, then gathered at Romare Bearden Park. \n Eric Gordon, a musician from Fort Lauderdale who arrived in Charlotte Friday, had seen the Scott video, which he called disturbing. \"I feel like he was no threat,\" he said. \n Gordon said he came to Charlotte to support the protests. \"I'm all about tranquility and peace,\" he said. \"I want everyone in unity.\" \n After largely peaceful protests Thursday night, uptown regained a bit of its corporate pace during the day Friday. \n Wells Fargo told thousands of employees to report to work as usual at the bank's uptown towers after urging them to work from home the day before. \n But Bank of America, which had a branch bank stormed by vandals outside its signature headquarters skyscraper Wednesday, told its employees to work remotely again Friday. \n At the EpiCentre, which suffered looting and significant damage Wednesday night, signs said it would close at 4 p.m. Friday and Saturday, and at 5 p.m. on Sunday. \n Authorities said the National Guard and extra State Highway Patrol troopers would remain in Charlotte through Sunday's NFL Panthers day game against Minnesota. \n Agents of the State Bureau of Investigation, who have taken over the investigation into the killing of Scott, have identified and interviewed most of the critical witnesses in the case, authorities said, and have obtained copies of police dashboard and body camera footage. \n Widespread calls have been made for the city to release police videos of the shooting, including from Scott's family. Late Friday, the SBI issued a statement that left the decision with Charlotte leaders and hinted that the release is under consideration. \n \"CMPD remains the custodian of the original recording and as such has the legal authority to release it,\" the agency said. \"It is understood discussions are actively underway between local officials regarding the release of that video.\" \n Attorneys for the family of Scott released a cellphone video taken by his wife, Rakeyia Scott, that captures the moment of the shooting. \n Rakeyia Scott was heading to her husband's truck, where he was sitting, when she heard officers. \"Drop the gun!\" police can be heard shouting at least seven times in the shaky, two-minute video. \n \"Don't shoot him, Don't shoot him!\" Rakeyia Scott cries. \n \"He doesn't have a gun,\" she yells. \"He's not going to do anything to you guys.\" \n At one point, she tells police that her husband has \"TBI,\" or traumatic brain injury, and just had his medicine. \n As police continue to demand Scott drop his gun, she calls out, \"Keith, get out the car. Keith! Keith! Don't you do it! Don't you do it! Keith!\" \n Four shots are heard in rapid succession. \n Then she is heard screaming, \"Did you shoot him? Did you shoot him? Did you shoot him? He better not be f \u2014\u2014 dead. \u2026 These are the police officers that shot my husband, and he better live. \u2026 He better live. Because he didn't do nothing to them.\" \n A second video was posted on YouTube Friday that was apparently taken by someone on a balcony in the apartment complex after the shooting. \n Officers stand over and move around the body of Scott in the parking lot as a woman is heard to say, \"He ain't moving.' \" At another point, the woman says, \"And they still putting the handcuffs on him.\" \n SBI agents went door-to-door Friday talking to neighbors at the Village at College Downs apartment complex on Old Concord Road where the shooting took place. \n Several neighbors told The Charlotte Observer he often sat on the stoop of his sister's home, keeping an eye on his seven children and those of his neighbors. \n He would hand out candy to youngsters, and occasionally dollar bills, they said. \n \"He was very humanitarian,\" Fostoria Robinson said. \"He was like a big, gentle bear. He was just a family member who tried to live right.\" \n Scott had been in a severe motorcycle crash about a year ago, family members and his attorneys said, and he suffered traumatic brain injury and hip problems. \n Neighbors said he walked slowly and with a limp, sometimes using a cane. Since the crash, he would sometimes stutter and have trouble remembering what he said. \n Neighbors said he often sat reading in his white truck near the entrance to the neighborhood, waiting for his son to get off the school bus. That's what they believe he was doing the afternoon he was shot, they said. \n Scott's mother, Vernita Scott-Walker, said her son once worked as a security guard for a Charlotte mall. \n He was big and broad-shouldered, and when he put on his security guard uniform, he cut such an impressive figure that she called him \"Robocop.\" \n He was the youngest of her three boys and the second youngest of her seven children. \"My baby,\" she called him.  \n As a child, he was quiet. But as he grew older, he became talkative and outgoing. He talked with her by phone every day. He loved to travel with his family, to listen to music, to dance and to read \u2014 particularly the Bible and the Quran. \n \"He was a family man first,\" she said in a telephone interview from her home in Charleston. \"He was a loving husband, and a happy dad with his children. He was a church-going person.\" \n Scott had a minor police record, but no felony convictions. \n He was found guilty of driving while intoxicated in April 2015 in Gaston County.  \n In April 2004, he was convicted of misdemeanor assault with a deadly weapon in Mecklenburg County. \n In 1992, he pleaded guilty in Charleston County, S.C., to carrying a concealed weapon (not a gun), simple assault and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. \n In Raleigh, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said it had cost $300,000 so far for extra law enforcement forces and National Guard sent to Charlotte. \n \"This state, this governor and the city of Charlotte,\" McCrory said, \"will not tolerate destruction of property, the harming of individuals and especially attacks toward the men and women of law enforcement, and the men and women of our National Guard.\" \n He complimented Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police on their handling of the civic unrest so far \u2014 in arresting those committing crimes and trying to restore trust in the community. \n \"You couldn't ask for better professionalism,\" he said. \"You saw people hugging them, them hugging back. It was the best of America that you saw.\" \n He said demands for police video tapes of the shooting to be released needed to be balanced against the need for a fair investigation by the SBI and protection of the rights of those under scrutiny. \n CMPD Chief Kerr Putney said Friday that eventually the videos will come out. \"It's a matter of when. \u2026 It's not that I want to hide anything.\" \n Putney said releasing video without the right context could inflame the situation, adding, \"The video is not a panacea.\" \n At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama thinks it should be up to local officials to decide whether to release the police videos. \n \"But as a matter of principle,\" Earnest said, \"I think the president has reached a pretty common-sense conclusion that when you're in a position needing to build trust with a group of people, being as candid as possible is usually the best approach.\" \n In other activity Friday related to the shooting: \n \u2014Obama called for an end to the violence on ABC's \"Good Morning America, saying \"looting, breaking glass, are not going to advance the cause. In Charlotte, my hope is people in the community pull together and do things the right way.\" \n \u2014A New York Times editorial demanded authorities release the police videos, saying, \"Keeping the public in the dark heightens tension and undermines trust in law enforcement.\" \n \u2014Rayquan Borum, 21, was arrested in the shooting death of Justin Carr, 26, during the violence Wednesday night on East Trade Street. Putney said police do not yet know whether Carr and Borum knew each other. \n \u2014Charlotte's city website went down for a time Wednesday night, spokesman Ken Brown said. He said the city is looking into a claim that the website was hacked and that city and police employee data were compromised. \n \u2014Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts praised the restraint by thousands of protesters who marched in Charlotte Thursday and early Friday. \"Last night was what a lawful demonstration looks like,\" she said. \n \u2014Putney said Friday that the curfew was ordered after police got intelligence that a violent group was coming from South Carolina to join the protests. Aside from marchers clashing briefly with police on Interstate 277, there was no violence Thursday night and only three arrests. \n Police said that during the demonstrations, one officer suffered a minor hand injury, two were sprayed with a chemical agent and a National Guard member had a minor injury. \n \u2014Scores of students conducted a peaceful protest in the courtyard of Mallard Creek High School. It lasted about 45 minutes and had the support of the school administration. \"It was basically a huge crowd talking about the Black Lives Matter movement \u2026 and how we need to be peaceful,\" student Kayla Smith said. \n \u2014\u2014  \n (Celeste Smith, Steve Harrison, Mark Price, Katherine Peralta, Joe Marusak, Ronnie Glassberg and Alex Daugherty of McClatchy's Washington Bureau contributed.)  \n \u2014\u2014  \n \u00a92016 The Charlotte Observer (Charlotte, N.C.)  \n ", "author": "By Rick Rothacker, Mark Washburn and Adam Bell The Charlotte Observer", "title": "Staggered by protests, Charlotte regains its footing"}

Mark Francis said police were seeking a Hispanic man wearing black and armed with a rifle last seen walking toward Interstate 5. \n \"We are still actively looking for the shooter,\" Francis said at a news conference. \"Stay indoors, stay secure.\" \n Authorities say the motive for Friday night's shooting which also left a male critically wounded was unknown. \n The FBI was assisting local authorities as dozens of police officers searched for the suspect. The FBI's Seattle office said on Twitter that it \"has no information to suggest additional attacks planned\" in Washington state but did not elaborate. \n The deadly shooting happened in the Cascade Mall in Burlington, Washington, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) north of Seattle. Francis said the \"lone shooter\" attacked the victims with a \"hunting type rifle.\" \n Authorities initially reported four people were killed, then said three were dead, before revising the number again. Francis said the number fluctuated as authorities searched the shopping center. \n Tari Caswell told the Skagit Valley Herald she was in the Macy's women's dressing room when she heard \"what sounded like four balloons popping.\" \n \"Then I heard seven or eight more, and I just stayed quiet in the dressing room because it just didn't feel right. And it got very quiet. And then I heard a lady yelling for help, and a man came and got me and another lady, and we ran out of the store,\" Caswell told the newspaper. \n Stephanie Bose, an assistant general manager at Johnny Carino's Italian restaurant near the Macy's store at the mall, said she immediately locked the doors to the restaurant after hearing about the shooting from an employee's boyfriend. \n \"He was trying to go to the mall and people were screaming,\" she told The Associated Press. \"It was frantic.\" \n She said he could see police at the doors with assault rifles and said they were no longer guarding the doors as of 9:30 p.m. \n Francis said at about 8:30 p.m. that the mall had been evacuated and emergency medical personnel were cleared to enter. Francis said authorities were still doing a \"final clear\" of the 434,000-square-foot (40,319-square-meter) mall late Friday night. He said 11 search teams and two K9 units were involved. \n The parking lot was closed and emergency management officials told people they would be able to retrieve vehicles Saturday. \n Gov. Jay Inslee said tragedy had struck the state. \n \"We urge residents to heed all safety and detour warnings. Stay close to your friends and loved ones as we await more information and, hopefully, news of the suspect's capture,\" Inslee said in a statement. \n The Cascade Mall is an enclosed shopping mall that opened in 1990, according to the mall's website. It features J.C. Penney, TJ Maxx, and Macy's stores, among other stores, restaurants and a movie theater. \n On Sept. 17 a man stabbed 10 people at a Minnesota mall before being shot and killed by an off-duty police officer.

{"date": "September 23, 2016", "text": "PACIFIC PRESS / SIPA USA / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n Sixty-five alleged drugs users were arrested on August 31 in Culiat, a notorious drug den in Quezon City, Philippines. Of the 65 users, 9 were caught smoking shabu, aka methamphetamine, and 5 were minors. \n PARANAQUE CITY, Philippines \u00bb For two decades, Jerry Gonzaga was addicted to drugs. Like many of his neighbors and friends in Paranaque, a city south of Manila, Gonzaga would take shabu, an inexpensive amphetamine, to keep him focused on fixing cars, selling umbrellas and doing other odd jobs to feed his wife and eight children. \n Then, on June 30, Rodrigo Duterte \u2014 who won the presidency largely on a pledge to combat crime, threatening to kill scores of drug users \u2014 took office and Gonzaga, a wiry 43-year-old, tried to turn himself in to police. At the station, officers made him sign a form pledging to stay off drugs. \"It said, 'If you're caught the first, second and third time, there are warnings and conditions,'\" he said. \"'If you're caught a fourth time, we'll have nothing to do with whatever happens to you.'\" \n Then, the police turned him away. \n Since June, an estimated 687,000 people across the Philippines have surrendered to police as Duterte has delivered on his brutal promise. Since he came to power, more than 3,500 suspected drug users and dealers have been killed, some by police, others by shadowy vigilantes. \n His anti-drug campaign, conducted in flagrant disregard for international standards of human rights or due process, has strained the country's already-overburdened corrections system. Its courts are notoriously slow and corrupt; its jails are bursting; and its rehabilitation centers are scarce, numbering 50 nationwide. Experts say that drug dealers are at risk of falling back on their old habits as soon as the climate of fear subsides. \n The president estimates that 3.7 million of the country's 100 million people are drug users, and many are like Gonzaga \u2014 poor, terrified of the increase in extrajudicial violence and struggling to navigate a society that lacks the resources to help them. \n \"People are living in absolute fear,\" said Clarke Jones, a researcher at the Australian National University who studies the Philippine prison system and its relationship with the drug trade. \n \"I think they're realizing that if they don't give themselves up their lives are in jeopardy. But an addict's an addict. \n \"It's a temporary motivation \u2014 you're about to lose your life, better give yourself in,\" he continued. \"But if they're in the criminal justice system, if they're put in prisons or jails, that doesn't address their dependency. Drugs are still available throughout the prison system, in different forms. If they remain in the community, there's no community support structure to keep them off drugs. Drugs are going to go underground for some time, but they're not gonna go away.\" \n Duterte, 71, has repeatedly reaffirmed his commitment to a violent, hard-line drug policy \u2014 \"Shoot (the drug dealer) and I'll give you a medal,\" he said on national television in June \u2014 and the country's addicts have cause to take him seriously. \n On Sept. 15, a witness at a Senate investigation testified that Duterte ordered extrajudicial executions during his 22-year tenure as mayor of the southern city of Davao. Edgar Matobato said that he belonged to a group of vigilante killers nicknamed the Davao Death Squad, which assassinated more than 1,000 people in the city; that Duterte ordered several killings; and that Duterte once killed a Department of Justice agent with an Uzi. (Duterte's communications secretary, Martin Andanar, denied the claims the same day.) \n The rehabilitation program at New Bilibid Prison, the country's biggest correctional facility, with more than 23,000 prisoners, is already bursting at the seams. On a rainy August afternoon, its hallways were bustling. In one room, inmates watched a dance performance by the program's \"glee club\"; in another, they had teeth pulled by a team of volunteer dentists. \n The number of surrenders under Duterte has been \"overwhelming,\" said Resurrection Morales, the prison's head of reform programs. \"It's mind blowing for the correctional officers to think about these hundreds, thousands of drug defendants turning themselves in.\" \n Morales said that so far, detention centers, not prisons, have taken the brunt of the drug war \u2014 courts are still processing scores of drug-related cases \u2014 but that her staff was bracing for a huge wave of new inmates. \n \"We need the facilities,\" she said. \"There are so many arrests, but people don't have the facilities.\" \n She said that the prison was operating at 158 percent of capacity, that 40 prison guards were often left in charge of more than 15,000 inmates, and that inmates have a medical allowance of only 10 cents per day, creating the looming specter of a public health crisis. \n \"Since we lack personnel, a prison guard might do administration work, and reform work \u2014 I have prison guards who are teaching, who are maintaining order in classrooms, who are doing communications as part of their administrative functions,\" she said. \"We just have to be prepared for another increase in the number of convictions.\"  \n Archie Bueno, 46, a prisoner at New Bilibid, said that he was incarcerated for drug dealing in 2008, after a five-year trial. \"The system is very slow,\" he said. \"A lot of people come in and only a few come out. There are a lot of prisoners here who are very qualified to leave, on parole. But they can't leave.\" Some, he said, are more than 70 years old. \n \"As the place gets more crowded, life here is getting harder,\" he continued. Some cells, he said, are designed to accommodate 40 prisoners; instead, they're accommodating more than 100. \n \"There are cells here where you can't even sleep a full night,\" he said. \"Prisoners can't even stretch out. You get up, you go to the restroom, and you come back and your space is gone.\" \n Gonzaga, the Paranaque drug addict, says that he's been off drugs for months, but he's bracing for an uncertain future.  \n \"Many are worried because of the way the government has decided to fight drugs,\" he said. \"The government should consider that these people are also human \u2014 they have families, people who care about them. They should be given a second chance.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times  \n ", "author": "By Jonathan Kaiman Los Angeles Times", "title": "In the Philippines, drug addicts living 'in absolute fear'"}

{"date": "September 23, 2016", "text": "CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n Elliott Nott, 41, was arrested two weeks after a camera was found in a bathroom at Ogden International School at 24 W. Walton St. \n CHICAGO \u00bb A former music teacher at a Chicago elementary school is accused of placing a camera under the sink of a public bathroom, just down from his classroom, and recording at least one child who was his student.  \n Elliott Nott, 41, was charged with seven felony counts of unauthorized videotaping and one felony count of child pornography two weeks after the camera was discovered in the third-floor bathroom of the Ogden International School on the city's Near North Side. \n Nott used putty to attach a motion-activated camera under a sink in the bathroom. A search of the camera turned up \"multiple images and videos\" of school staff using the bathroom, as well as an 8-year-old boy, prosecutors said. \n The boy had been Nott's student for two years and had special permission to use that bathroom, something Nott knew, according to Assistant State's Attorney Melissa Howlett. \n The camera's existence came to light Sept. 7 when an employee found the small black device with a lens and red blinking light on the bathroom floor. The camera was turned over to police, Howlett said. \n About two days later, Nott checked himself in at Swedish Covenant Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, Howlett said. Nott made a statement to a hospital social worker, who in turn notified police and the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, according to the prosecutor. \n Authorities got a search warrant for Nott's home and seized a computer, two cellphones and other electronic media for forensic analysis, Howlett said. Police also took clothing from Nott's home that matched clothing partially seen on the video as it was being placed under the sink in the bathroom, she said. \n Nott was dismissed from the school, Ogden Principal Michael Beyer said. \n Nott was hired in 2009 at Ogden to teach music to students in kindergarten through fifth grade and to coach track, according to an online biography. He studied voice and choral directing at Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington, where Nott's father was a professor, and has taught at schools in New Hampshire, New York, Tennessee and Minnesota. \n Nott also coached track and field at Lane Tech High School from 2008 through 2010, according to his biography. \n In an email to parents Friday, Beyer said police have \"been in contact with all of the individuals who have been impacted by this incident and those individuals have been made aware.\" \n Beyer included some guidelines to help children cope with the incident. \n \"Parents and school staff should reassure the child's safety, especially at school,\" he wrote. \"Children should know that they are in a safe place where they can trust the adults in their presence. Again, reassure them that Ogden took immediate steps to ensure the safety of students and staff in the building and will continue to make efforts to keep our school safe.\" \n Chicago Public Schools officials had no immediate comment on what background checks were made on Nott. \n Nott is married and has two young children, 3 and 4. His wife, who teaches cello, sat in the spectator's gallery during a bond hearing Friday afternoon. \n \"I will have no comment,\" she told reporters. \n Before the hearing began, she sat with her head in her hands.  \n Nott's attorney, Gigi Gilbert, said her client had been the family's primary breadwinner before he was fired from Ogden. He said Nott's wife was standing behind her husband. \n \"These are serious allegations. We're aware of that, but hopefully the public will remember that he's innocent until proven guilty,\" said Mark Basile, another attorney for Nott. He and Gilbert said Nott has no criminal background. \n Nott was a standout track star for Normal Community High School during the 1990s, winning the 1993 Class AA state 1,600 meters in 4:16.52. He was a former music director of the Broadway United Methodist Church in Lakeview, leaving in 2009, according to the church's pastor, the Rev. Alka Lyall. \n Though Lyall has only been with the church for a year, she said many church members, including choir members, were stunned at news of Nott's arrest. \n \"Feelings here are just raw and people are hurting,\" she said. \"There's a lot of disbelief and shock.\" \n Nott belongs to a bluegrass band called The Reclaimers and also plays in a church band in Skokie, according to his biography. \n Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil ordered Nott held on $75,000 bail. If he makes bond and is released from jail, he cannot have contact with any alleged victims and must surrender his passport.  \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Chicago Tribune  \n ", "author": "By William Lee, Megan Crepeau and Juan Perez Jr. Chicago Tribune", "title": "Prosecutors: Ex-teacher placed camera under sink in school bathroom"}

She also suffered nonlethal claw injuries to her chest, shoulder and arm, according to the report. \n Jeff Miller, Konwiser's uncle, said he still hasn't gained closure on the events that led to his niece's death. He's waiting for the results of other pending investigations. \n \"I still have a lot of questions,\" he said. \"I may never get the answers to the questions, but I'll wait until we have the final reports.\" \n The tiger house has four cages, all of which were locked except for one, according to the report. Investigators found all the doors to that cage open, and two padlocks hanging outside the keeper door. \n The cage had a placard indicating that animals had access to the area, according to the report. A box large enough to block Konwiser's view of the tiger was inside the cage, an investigator wrote. \n Zoo officials have attributed the attack to \"human error\" by Konwiser. Zoo president Andrew Aiken said employees \"are never allowed to enter a tiger enclosure to which the animal has access.\" Miller said he questions Aiken's accounting of the attack and wants further investigation. \n The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission is investigating the attack and does not have a time frame for when its report will be released, said Carol Lyn Parrish, an agency spokeswoman. \n When a nearby maintenance worker heard Konwiser's screams, he ran to her aid and saw a tiger standing over her and a large puddle of blood, according to the medical examiner's report. Zoo staff tried unsuccessfully to lure the tiger away from Konwiser, and the lead veterinarian fired a tranquilizer dart that subdued the tiger, the report states. \n The attack was called into 911 at 1:56 p.m., and Konwiser was pronounced dead an hour later at St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach. \n The report identifies the tiger that killed Konwiser as Hati, a 12-year-old, 350-pound male tiger. Only about 300 Malayan tigers remain in the wild. \n A toxicology report showed no presence of alcohol or illegal drugs in Konwiser's system. It detected Topiramate, a drug prescribed to treat and prevent seizures or migraine headaches. Konwiser didn't have epilepsy, but she took medication to prevent migraines, her uncle said. \n The autopsy report noted Konwiser's tattoos, which included tiger paw prints on her foot and lower back. \n \u2014\u2014 \n (Sun Sentinel staff writer Emily Miller contributed to this report.)  \n \u2014\u2014  \n \u00a92016 Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)  \n ", "author": "By Skyler Swisher Sun Sentinel", "title": "Autopsy report details zookeeper's last moments before fatal tiger attack"}

Charlotte police squat next to Keith Lamont Scott as Scott lies face-down on the ground, in Charlotte, N.C. \n CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u00bb In the shaky video she shot on her cellphone, Rakeyia Scott can be heard trying to save her husband's life. \n \"Don't shoot him!\" she shouts to the Charlotte, N.C., police officers who surrounded her husband this week in the parking lot of a condominium complex. \"He has no weapon.\" \n As police officers scream at 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott \u2014 \"Drop the gun!

Did you shoot him?\" she screams as she walks closer to the scene, still shooting from her phone. \"He better not be dead, he better not be \u2026 dead.\" \n Soon, she was using the phone to call 911, her husband's body splayed on the ground. \n Attorneys for the Scott family on Friday released the first publicly available video of Tuesday's shooting as Charlotte continued to reel from days of protests that have focused, in part, on city officials' refusal to release police footage of the incident. \n \"Release the tapes!\" has become a familiar refrain on Charlotte's streets. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has called for an end to \"the rioting\" in Charlotte, while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton zeroed in on the video, calling for release of the footage \"without delay.\" \n The debate in Charlotte has once again highlighted the uneven level of transparency that exists in cases of police shootings across the U.S. \n Days earlier, police in Tulsa, Okla., had quickly allowed the public to see disturbing video of another line-of-duty shooting, this one involving a white police officer and a black motorist who died with his hands in the air. \n Many cities do not have fixed policies about when to release crucial footage of a police shooting, and such killings frequently turn into chaotic political struggles. In many cases, family members, activists and social media users turn up the pressure on local officials, as happened Friday in Charlotte, by releasing their own footage. \n The public now may have media tools as good as or better than those of the police. Encounters with police are sometimes now live-streamed as they happen, a tactic clearly intended to influence the outcome in real time. \n After a shooting, members of the public can release their own footage when they believe that police have not described an incident truthfully. \n Such pressure is unusual for police investigators, who in other kinds of cases are typically allowed to hold off on releasing video recordings of an incident. The reasons are many. A video of a crime, for example, can often be used to test whether a suspect is lying or a witness is remembering an incident accurately. \n Indeed, release of a video may cause confusion about whether a witness is describing what they saw during a crime or what they saw on the video. \n Charlotte Police Chief Kerr Putney has said release of the official video would be counterproductive and could potentially compromise the integrity of the investigation \u2014 though in a small concession, he did permit Keith Scott's family to view it. \n \"It's not that I want to hide anything,\" Putney said at a news conference Friday morning. \"I want to be more thoughtful and deliberate. If I were to put it out indiscriminately and it doesn't give you good context, it can inflame the situation, exacerbate backlash, increase distrust.\" \n Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts said she believes the tape should be made public, though not necessarily right now. \n \"I lean towards transparency in everything our city does,\" Roberts said Friday, but she emphasized that the question is one of timing. \n \"I know there's a delicate balance when there's an ongoing investigation. If one piece is released early, it can jeopardize the integrity of the investigation,\" she said. \"If you have already seen something on the internet, it can cloud your memory, it can alter what you think you saw.\" \n Scott's fatal encounter with the police began Tuesday afternoon when officers confronted him outside a Charlotte condominium complex. Police say Brentley Vinson, a 26-year-old black officer, was looking for a suspect with an outstanding warrant \u2014 not Scott \u2014 and approached Scott shortly before 4 p.m. \n According to the police account, Scott stepped out of the truck with a gun, and then got back in the truck. Police said that they told Scott to drop the gun but that he got back out of the vehicle with the weapon and \"posed an imminent deadly threat.\" \n Scott's family has insisted he was holding not a gun, but a book. \n Neither the official video, as the police describe it, nor Scott's wife's cellphone footage appears to answer the question definitively. Putney has said that while the police video footage doesn't offer \"absolute definitive visual evidence\" that would confirm Scott was pointing a gun, the \"totality of all other evidence\" supported the police account of his death. \n Rakeyia Scott's cellphone footage, which is shaky and taken for the most part from behind police vehicles, also does not clearly show the moment when her husband was shot by police. In the video, Rakeyia Scott tells the officers he has a \"TBI,\" a traumatic brain injury. \n \"He's not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine.\" \n In the video, Rakeyia Scott also directs orders to her husband as officers move in, with one of them asking for a baton.  \n \"Keith, don't let them break the windows!\" she says, her voice quivering. \n \"Come on out the car,\" she insists. \"Keith, don't do it!\" \n \"Keith, get out the car,\" she says again, her voice rising. \"Keith, Keith, Keith \u2014 don't you do it!\" \n After the shots are fired, Scott is seen splayed on the ground, not moving, and surrounded by officers. His wife then calls 911. \n On Friday, Putney pushed back against expectations that the police footage of Scott's death \"will be a panacea.\"  \n \"I can tell you that will not be the case,\" he said, adding that investigators are still interviewing witnesses and reviewing evidence. \"The process is painstakingly slow sometimes. It's going to take them some time to piece together everything that happened.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n (Kaleem reported from Charlotte, Jarvie, a special correspondent, from Atlanta, and Pearce from Los Angeles.)  \n \u2014\u2014  \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times  \n ", "author": "By Jenny Jarvie, Matt Pearce and Jaweed Kaleem Los Angeles Times", "title": "'Don't shoot him,' wife pleads to police in video of fatal Charlotte shooting"}

Jolie Pitt filed for divorce from her husband on Monday, demanding sole physical custody of their six children. \n LOS ANGELES \u00bb Allegations Brad Pitt was abusive on a private plane last week relate to the actor's treatment of his 15-year-old son, sources said today, as the FBI continued to gather information before determining whether to open an investigation.  \n FBI Spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said the agency hasn't made a decision on a formal investigation into what occurred on a plane ferrying Pitt, his wife Angelina Jolie Pitt and their six children. \n Several news outlets have reported that a child welfare agency in Los Angeles is investigating the well-being of the children, who range in ages from 8 to 15. \n Sources familiar with the allegations, but not authorized to speak publicly, say the child welfare investigation centers on Pitt's conduct toward his son Maddox, 15, during an argument on the Sept. 14 flight. No law enforcement agency responded to the plane when it landed in Minnesota after the incident. \n Amara Suarez, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services, said the agency could not confirm whether it was investigating Pitt or the well-being of the former couple's children. \n Calls to the offices of Pitt's attorney, Lance Spiegel, and Jolie Pitt's lawyer, Laura Wasser, were forwarded to recorded messages stating their firms do not comment on clients. \n Jolie Pitt filed for divorce Monday and her lawyer released a statement the following day saying she came to the decision \"for the health of the family.\" She listed their separation date as Sept. 15, the day after the alleged plane incident, and the actress is seeking sole custody of all six of the children. \n Koochiching County, Minnesota, Sheriff Perryn Hedlund told The Associated Press on Thursday that Brad Pitt was on a plane that landed at the International Falls, Minnesota, airport near the Canadian border on Sept. 14. \n Hedlund said his sheriff's deputies were not called to the airport, and International Falls police were also not called. \n \"There's no incident whatsoever reported to law enforcement,\" Hedlund said. \n He said he didn't know why the plane landed in International Falls, but said it's not uncommon for hockey players or other celebrities to stop at the airport. \n Pitt and Jolie Pitt \u2014 known as \"Brangelina\" \u2014 were together for 12 years but only wed in August 2014.

{"date": "September 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama spoke in the East Room of the White House in Washington on Sept. 22. Obama vetoed a bill that would have allowed the families of 9/11 victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb President Barack Obama nixed a bill today that would have allowed the families of 9/11 victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia, arguing it undermined national security and setting up the possibility that Congress might override his veto for the first time of his presidency. \n The bill had sailed through both chambers of Congress with bipartisan support, clearing the final hurdle just days before the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. But the White House said the bill, which doesn't refer specifically to Saudi Arabia, could backfire by opening up the U.S. government and its officials to lawsuits by anyone accusing the U.S. of supporting terrorism, rightly or wrongly. \n \"I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001,\" Obama wrote to the Senate in a veto message about the bill, known as the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. But, he said, \"the JASTA would be detrimental to U.S. national interests more broadly, which is why I am returning it without my approval.\" \n The move paves the way for Congress to try to override the veto, which requires a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate. Previous attempts to overturn Obama's vetoes have all been unsuccessful. \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., indicated Thursday that there was sufficient support in the House to override Obama's veto. Yet the White House has worked assiduously to try to peel off supporters, and said today it was unclear whether enough had defected to avert an override. \n With lawmakers eager to return home to campaign ahead of the November election, a vote could come early next week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office said the Senate would take up the override \"as soon as practicable in this work period.\" \n Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate's No. 3 Democrat and a traditional Obama ally, came out swinging against Obama's veto while predicting lawmakers would reverse it \"swiftly and soundly.\" \n \"The families of the victims of 9/11 deserve their day in court, and justice for those families shouldn't be thrown overboard because of diplomatic concerns,\" Schumer said. \n A coalition of 9/11 victims' families, meanwhile, said they were \"outraged and dismayed.\" In a response circulated by their lawyers, the families insisted the bill would deter terrorism, \"no matter how much the Saudi lobbying and propaganda machine may argue otherwise.\" \n Though the concept of sovereign immunity generally shields governments from lawsuits, the bill creates an exception that allows foreign governments to be held responsible if they support a terrorist attack that kills U.S. citizens on American soil. Opponents say that's a slippery slope considering that the U.S. is frequently accused wrongly by its foes of supporting terrorism. \n \"Americans are in countries all over the world,\" House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, a Republican, wrote today in a letter urging colleagues not to support a veto. \"Many of those countries do not respect the rule of law, and we cannot expect their responses to be as measured and narrow as ours.\" \n Fifteen of the 19 men who carried out the attacks were Saudi nationals. Families of the victims spent years lobbying lawmakers for the right to sue the kingdom in U.S. court for any role elements of Saudi Arabia's government may have had in the attacks. Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, strongly objected to the bill. \n Obama long had objected, too, warning that if U.S. citizens are allowed to take the Saudis into court, then foreign countries could do the same to the United States, its diplomats and its service members. The administration was also apprehensive about undermining a longstanding yet difficult relationship with Saudi Arabia. The U.S. relies on the Saudis as a counter to Iran's influence in the region as well as to help combat the spread of terrorism throughout the Middle East. \n Since the bill's passage, the White House has lobbied aggressively to persuade lawmakers to withdraw support, and found some sympathetic listeners. The bill had passed by voice vote \u2014 meaning lawmakers didn't have to go on the record with their positions \u2014 and the White House was hoping the prospect of a recorded vote would lead some Democrats to reconsider publicly rebuking their president. \n Debate about the bill has spilled onto the presidential campaign trail, as candidates vie to appear tough on terrorism. The issue is one of a few where Democrat Hillary Clinton has publicly disagreed with Obama, with her campaign saying today that she supports efforts to \"hold accountable those responsible\" for the attacks. \n In the run-up to Obama's veto, the White House said the system the U.S. uses to identify and punish countries that support terrorism was set by law and is more effective than a \"patchwork\" of legal decisions. Yet the bill's proponents disputed arguments of a boomerang effect if the measure were to become law. \n The bill had triggered a perceived threat by Saudi Arabia to pull billions of dollars from the U.S. economy if it was enacted. But Saudi Foreign Minister Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir denied in May that the kingdom made any threats over the bill. He said his country had merely warned that investor confidence in the U.S. would shrink if the bill became law. \n The House vote on Sept. 9 came two months after Congress released 28 declassified pages from a congressional report into 9/11. The pages reignited speculation over links that at least a few of the attackers had to Saudis, including government officials. The allegations were never substantiated by later U.S. investigations into the terrorist attacks. \n Associated Press writers Richard Lardner, Erica Werner and Lisa Lerer contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama vetoes 9/11 bill, possible override by Congress looms"}

Police have said he was armed, but witnesses say he held only a book. The 2 \u00bd-minute video does not show the shooting, though gunshots can be heard. \n Scott's wife, Rakeyia Scott, tells officers that he has a TBI, or traumatic brain injury. At one point, she tells her husband to get out of the car so police don't break the windows. She also tells him, \"don't do it,\" but it's not clear exactly what she means. \n As the encounter escalates, she repeatedly urges police, \"You better not shoot him.\" \n After the gunshots, Scott can be seen lying face-down on the ground while his wife says \"he better live.\" She continues recording and asks if an ambulance has been called. The officers stand over Scott. It's unclear if they are checking him for weapons or attempting to give first aid. \n In the footage, Scott's wife states the address and says, \"These are the police officers that shot my husband.\" \n Representatives for the police department and the mayor's office did not immediately return emails from The Associated Press seeking comment. \n The video emerged after a third night of protests over the shooting gave way to quiet streets today. The largely peaceful demonstrations in the city's business district were watched over by rifle-toting members of the National Guard. \n Protesters called on police to release video that could resolve wildly different accounts of the shooting earlier this week. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said today that there is footage from at least one police body camera and one dashboard camera. \n The family of Scott, 43, was shown the footage Thursday and demanded that police release it to the public. The video recorded by Scott's wife had not been previously released. \n Demonstrators chanted \"release the tape\" and \"we want the tape\" Thursday while briefly blocking an intersection and later climbing the steps to the door of the city government center. Later, several dozen demonstrators walked onto an interstate highway through the city, but they were pushed back by police in riot gear. \n State Attorney General Roy Cooper also called on Charlotte officials to release the video, saying doing so would help bring the community and law enforcement together. Cooper, a Democrat, is running for governor in November. \n Charlotte is the latest U.S. city to be shaken by protests and recriminations over the death of a black man at the hands of police, a list that includes Baltimore, Milwaukee, Chicago, New York and Ferguson, Missouri. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Thursday, prosecutors charged a white officer with manslaughter for killing an unarmed black man on a city street last week. \n Thursday's protests in Charlotte lacked the violence and property damage of previous nights, and a curfew enacted by the city's mayor encouraged a stopping point. \n Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts signed documents to keep the curfew in effect from midnight until 6 a.m. each day until the state of emergency declared by the governor ends. \n After the curfew took effect, police allowed the crowd of demonstrators to thin without forcing them off the street. Police Capt. Mike Campagna told reporters that officers would not seek to arrest curfew violators as long as they were peaceful. \n Putney said today that releasing the footage of Scott's death could inflame the situation. He has said previously that the video will be made public when he believes there is a \"compelling reason\" to do so. \n \"It's a personal struggle, but I have to do what I think is best for my community,\" Putney said. \n During the same news conference, Roberts said she believes the video should be released, but \"the question is on the timing.\" \n Earlier in the week, the Charlotte protests turned violent, with demonstrators attacking reporters and others, setting fires and smashing windows of hotels, office buildings and restaurants. \n Forty-four people were arrested after Wednesday's protests, and one protester who was shot died at the hospital Thursday. City officials said police did not shoot 26-year-old Justin Carr. A suspect was arrested, but police provided few details. \n Putney said he has seen the video and it does not contain \"absolute, definitive evidence that would confirm that a person was pointing a gun.\" But he added: \"When taken in the totality of all the other evidence, it supports what we said.\" \n Justin Bamberg, an attorney for Scott's family, said it's \"impossible to discern\" from the videos what, if anything, Scott is holding in his hands. \n Scott never aggressively approached officers and was shot as he walked slowly backward with his hands by his side, Bamberg said. \n Associated Press writers Tom Foreman Jr., Mitch Weiss, Seanna Adcox and Jeffrey Collins in Charlotte, North Carolina; Gary Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina; and Jack Jones in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Video shows deadly encounter between Charlotte police, Keith Scott"}

It also considered and addressed extensive public comments during the rulemaking process, which included public meetings in Hawaii and the mainland United States. \n Native Hawaiians have not had a formal unified government since the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893. In 1993, Congress enacted the Apology Resolution which offered an apology to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the United States for its role in the overthrow and committed the Federal government to a process of reconciliation. As part of that reconciliation process, in 2000 the Department of the Interior and the Department of Justice jointly issued a report identifying as its lead recommendation the need to foster self-determination for Native Hawaiians under Federal law. \n \"We heard from the Native Hawaiian community about the importance of this rule to preserving its culture and traditions,\" said Kristen Sarri, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management, and Budget. \"This historic rule provides an opportunity for a Native Hawaiian government to exercise its inherent powers of self-government, self-determination, and economic self-sufficiency. It recognizes the special political and trust relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiian community and will help to more effectively implement the laws that Congress passed.\" \n The news release said the decision to reorganize a Native Hawaiian government is one for the Native Hawaiian community \u2014 not the Federal government \u2014 to make as an exercise of self-determination. If a formal government-to-government relationship is reestablished, it could provide the community with greater flexibility to preserve its distinct culture and traditions. It could also enhance their ability to affect its special status under Federal law by exercising powers of self-government over many issues directly impacting community members. \n On the net: \n ", "author": "By Star-Advertiser staff", "title": "Federal government finalizes pathway for formal relations with Native Hawaiians"}

{"date": "September 23, 2016", "text": "LOS ANGELES \u00bb A case of leprosy, extremely rare in the United States, has been diagnosed in a Southern California elementary school student, sending health officials scrambling to reassure parents and the public that the disease is hard to transmit and easy to treat. \n Two children from Indian Hills Elementary School in Jurupa Valley had initially been diagnosed by a local doctor with the condition known medically as Hansen's disease, Riverside County health officials said Thursday. But this week they received results from the National Hansen's Disease Laboratory Research Program in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and they showed that only one of the children had tested positive. \n Emails were sent to parents at the elementary school, where classrooms had been sanitized since the initial diagnosis, emphasizing how hard it is to contract leprosy and that there is no danger to the child's classmates. \n \"It is incredibly difficult to contract leprosy,\" said Dr. Cameron Kaiser, Riverside County's public health officer. \"The school was safe before this case arose and it still is.\" \n The U.S. sees only about 150 leprosy cases occur each year, and over 95 percent of the population is naturally immune to it. \n Despite its reputation as an incredibly infectious plague that makes sufferers shed body parts, the disease can only be passed through prolonged contact, and is fairly easily treated with antibiotics. \n It is not spread through short-term contact like handshakes or even sexual intercourse. \n Those most at risk are family members who are in constant contact with an untreated person, and is usually contracted by people who have traveled to places like India, Brazil and Angola where it's more common. \n County health officials would say only that the child got the disease through prolonged contact with another person who is not in the county. \n They would say nothing about the identity of either child who was tested. \n \"The only way to protect the two students is for nobody to know who they are,\" district Superintendent Elliott Duchon told the Riverside Press-Enterprise. \n Duchon was at the school on Thursday afternoon to answer questions from concerned parents. \n Leprosy remains a problem in tropical hot spots of the world with some 250,000 new infections reported each year. Similar to tuberculosis, it can stay dormant for years before attacking the skin and nerves. \n The disease has long been misunderstood, with false stories of fingers and toes falling off adding to the stigma. Fear led some countries to quarantine people. \n Antibiotics typically kill the bacteria within days and make it non-contagious. It usually takes a year or two to fully clear the germ from the body. \n If left untreated, it can cause severe nerve damage, deformity and disability. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Leprosy found in California elementary school student"}

{"date": "September 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n North Korean defectors prepare to release balloons carrying leaflets and a banner denouncing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for North Korea's latest nuclear test, in Paju, near the border with North Korea, South Korea. \n Officially, the United States and North Korea barely speak to each other, their communications often limited to public exchanges of insults. \n The U.S. ambassador in Seoul is \"a villain, a crazy person,\" a North Korean diplomat says. North Korea is a \"wasteland\" compared to South Korea, President Obama tells the United Nations. \n But out of the limelight, and sometimes in secret, a small corps of former U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials, often working with academic specialists, meet regularly with high-ranking North Koreans. They have sat down in Singapore, Berlin, Beijing and elsewhere to discuss everything from the details of North Korea's nuclear program to concerns about the effects of international trade sanctions on Pyongyang. They have talked about the growing security fears in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo, and about the timing of North Korean missile tests. \n If it's not quite diplomacy, it sometimes gets pretty close. \n \"The North Koreans understand that we're in no way representing the United States government. So sometimes, we can raise things that the U.S. government isn't able to,\" said Leon V. Sigal, a former State Department policy official and long a key player in what are commonly called Track 2 talks. \"I can say to them, 'Hey, this is why the U.S. government is doing this.' And then probe and say to them: 'Look, what you're doing is not going to work. How about this?'\" \n The two countries did quietly hold a series of discussions, apparently late last year, but those came to nothing. Since then, North Korea has staged two nuclear tests and a flurry of missile tests, building an increasingly sophisticated arsenal, but there have been no known direct communications between Washington and Pyongyang. \n While Track 2 talks are common between rival countries \u2014 Indian academics, for instance, regularly meet with their Pakistani counterparts \u2014 the North Korean discussions are often seen as a key part of Washington-Pyongyang relations. \n To critics, the Track 2 North Korea meetings are a waste of time. Or worse, they allow Pyongyang to claim the high road \u2014 insisting it's seeking an avenue to peace \u2014 despite its years of cheating on past deals. \n But John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, said that with communication between North Korea and the U.S. almost non-existent, Track 2 talks have become a placeholder for government-to-government discussions. Informal talks are \"a way for the North Koreans to send indirect messages,\" he said, and try out ideas they may be hesitant to suggest in official channels. \n While Track 2 participants are rarely formally debriefed by U.S. officials, the substance of their talks is often widely shared among the small pool of experts \u2014 in government, academia and think tanks \u2014 who focus on North Korea. That information can then be used once official talks restart. \"There's a lot that you pick up just by sitting in the same room,\" ranging from what issues are open to discussion to group dynamics, Delury said. \n But what has emerged recently from Track 2 discussions? That depends on who you ask. \n To Sigal, the talks have revealed a North Korea willing to discuss limitations on its nuclear weapons program, despite Pyongyang's public insistence that it is now a nuclear power. \n \"Even now, as bad as things are, it's clear\" that North Korea is ready to talk, he said. He declined to spell out the details of his discussions, but said that a series of slow, reciprocal steps by both sides \u2014 \"they would suspend certain activities, the U.S. would take certain steps\" \u2014 could lead back to official negotiations. \n In the end, he said, those negotiations may not be successful, but: \"You don't know until the U.S. and the North Koreans sit down and try to work things out.\" \n Some other Track 2 participants, though, say they've seen no sign of North Korean willingness to discuss denuclearization. \n \"During several meetings in recent months, I've raised the idea of a denuclearization dialogue with the North Koreans,\" Evans Revere, a former Asia specialist at the State Department, said in an email. \"The response from them has been quite definitive . 'There will be no denuclearization; we are now a nuclear-weapons state; the time for denuclearization dialogue is over; you must learn to live with and accept this new reality.'\" \n Who is right? It's hard to know. North Korea's policy statements are rarely easy to interpret, with serious proposals sometimes buried inside bombastic propaganda, and experts regularly disagreeing about what message is intended. \n Some North Korea watchers, for example, believe that Pyongyang held out an olive branch in July, when a story from the state news agency said the North wanted \"the denuclearization of the whole Korean Peninsula.\" While the statement also included a long list of North Korean demands that would seemingly make any agreement impossible, some saw it as a first offer, and a sign that Pyongyang was willing to start negotiating. \n The U.S. government, though, has seen little that looks like an olive branch. \n Anna Richey-Allen, the spokesperson for the State Department's East Asia and Pacific Bureau, said Washington is open to talking to Pyongyang. \"But the onus is on North Korea to take meaningful actions toward denuclearization and refrain from provocations,\" she said in an emailed statement. \n Years of broken agreements have left much of the world \u2014 and much of the U.S. government \u2014 unwilling to trust North Korea in negotiations. American officials are deeply hesitant about agreeing to direct talks with Pyongyang, fearing the political fallout if the North again reneges on a deal. \n But as Pyongyang's arsenal continues to grow, with experts warning it could have nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States within a few years, Sigal says the U.S. must focus on those years when North Korea did stand by at least some of its agreements. \n \"Most people in Washington have an assumption that the North Koreans are bad guys \u2014 which is true enough \u2014 but also that you can't deal with them. I say that assumption is fundamentally wrong,\" Sigal said. \"I think you have to be talking to them. And that's the purpose of Track 2.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Almost diplomacy: U.S. ex-officials, N. Koreans quietly meet"}

{"date": "September 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Egyptian coast guard and rescue workers bring ashore bodies recovered from a Europe-bound boat that capsized off Egypt's Mediterranean coast, in Rosetta, Egypt. \n ROSETTA, Egypt \u00bb The bodies of 162 people had been pulled from the waters off the Egyptian coast by today, two days after a boat carrying hundreds of migrants capsized in the Mediterranean while attempting to head to Europe. \n Dozens more are feared dead, said Mohammed Sultan, the governor of Beheira, who provided The Associated Press with the latest figures. He also said that the search operation is still ongoing. Many of them are believed to be children and women who were unable to swim away when the boat sank. \n Wahdan el-Sayyed, the spokesman of the Nile Delta province of Beheira, told The Associated Press that the search operation was ongoing. \n An AP reporter near the Nile Delta city of Rosetta saw between 20 to 30 bodies brought in by coast guards in gray inflatable boats and fishermen in wooden boats early this morning and delivered to ambulances at the coast guard pier. Pictures posted on social networking sites showed dozens of bodies lined up in black plastic bags, and others floating near wooden fishing boats. Videos showed that some fishermen were using nets to bring up the bodies. \n In one video, a fisherman was heard shouting into his mobile phone that, \"the sea is littered with bodies.\" \n Many of those gathered at the shore where the bodies arrived appeared to be wearing surgical masks to protect them from the smell of decaying bodies. Some brought chunks of ice to be placed on the bodies to prevent them from decomposing. \n Authorities have struggled to give accurate figures for the number of people on board the capsized vessel. The U.N. Refugee Agency, UNHCR, estimated that the boat was packed with some 450 people, while the state news agency MENA said earlier that the number might be as high as 600. \n The boat was located nearly 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from the Nile Delta port city of Rosetta when it sank. It had waited at sea for many hours \u2014 perhaps days \u2014 for smaller wooden boats carrying migrants to arrive from different points along the Egyptian coastline. \n Survivors said that overcrowding caused the boat to capsize. \n Egyptian officials said that over 160 people were rescued and that the majority are Egyptians, while the others are Sudanese and other nationalities, including Somalians and Eritreans. \n The head of the local council in the area, Ali Abdel-Sattar, said that the currents have carried the bodies of the victims many kilometers away from the site of the sinking. \"Today, four bodies, including two Egyptian children, were found 20 kilometers to the east,\" he told the AP. \n He added that many of the migrants are believed to have been \"stored in the bottom of the boat, in the fridge.\" \n \"Those are the ones who drowned first, most probably stuck, and their bodies might not be retrieved anytime soon,\" he said, adding, \"those we found are the ones liberated from the boat. I believe many are stuck and now laying in the bottom of the sea.\" He said the boat may now have sunk to 16 meters (yards) below sea level. \n The EU border agency, Frontex, recently said more than 12,000 migrants arrived in Italy from Egypt between January and September this year, compared to 7,000 in the same period last year. Yet UNHCR says that since 2014 there has been a steady increase in the number of people intercepted while trying to leave Egypt, with 4,600 people arrested this year, a 28-percent increase compared to the previous year. \n On Thursday, four people described as members of the vessel's crew were arrested over charges of human trafficking and manslaughter. \n At a small pier called el-Borg, hundreds of families had gathered today, hoping to identify the bodies of their loved ones. Women screamed and relatives pushed and shoved while swarming the ambulances heading to the hospital. \n Fishermen said that they had difficulty collecting the badly decomposed bodies, with one saying, \"we didn't know how to pull them out.\" \n Survivors and relatives told the AP earlier that the boat sank around 5:30 a.m. on Wednesday, and that it took coast guards around six hours to come to the rescue. Fishing boats in the vicinity were the first to provide help. \n \"I have never seen such a large number of people drowning in the waters as I saw that day,\" a 42-year-old fisherman told AP. \n He said he arrived at 11 a.m. in the morning and helped the survivors. \"We threw the ropes, we pulled them in, and many were unconscious. The strong majority are youngsters,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of security fears. \n Many of the survivors were briefly detained by police. Some of those rescued were taken to hospitals, where they lay handcuffed to beds and under police guard. \n The Egyptian news portal, Al-Youm al-Sabei, published interviews with several survivors who said that before their journey the migrants had been \"stored\" for several days in chicken farms by the traffickers to evade police. Some of the interviewees said the traffickers asked for $6250 per family, to be given on arrival in Italy. \n After his release, survivor Ahmed Darwish said, \"my advice is that no one should undertake this risk, and especially anyone who saw these things, they will never do it again.\" \n The International Organization for Migration has said that this year over 3,500 have died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe, with this number \"rapidly approaching\" the record death toll set last year. \n Those who chose to risk the dangerous journey are often fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "162 bodies retrieved after migrant boat capsizes off Egypt"}
