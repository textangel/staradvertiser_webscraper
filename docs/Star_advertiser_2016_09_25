Extra security was posted outside the stadium in response to protests over the shooting death of a black man by a police officer on Sept. 20. \n THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER VIA AP \n A Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer in riot gear watches foot traffic pass an entrance area at Bank of America Stadium, where people were protesting, prior to an NFL football game between the Minnesota Vikings and the Carolina Panthers in Charlotte, N.C., today. When the national anthem was played, the protesters all dropped to one knee as many NFL players have been doing for weeks to call attention to issues, including police shootings. \n CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u00bb Charlotte lifted its midnight curfew, signaling movement toward normalcy after a state of emergency was imposed after the shooting death of a black man by police last week that brought National Guard troops and armored vehicles to downtown street corners. \n A weekend without street violence was highlighted Sunday as the city hosted the NFL game between the Carolina Panthers and the Minnesota Vikings without interruption. \n Still, protests continued for a sixth day since 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed Tuesday after a confrontation with Charlotte police. The first two nights of protests were violent, with demonstrators smashing windows, blocking part of an interstate through downtown, and burning the contents of a tractor-trailer. More than a dozen police officers were injured. \n Protesters clambered onto Interstate 277 through the city's downtown Sunday night and tried to block traffic until police arrived. The protesters ran, but one fell in front of an all-terrain vehicle operated by a Greensboro police officer helping the Charlotte force, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said. The protester, 26-year-old Donnell Jones of Missouri, was not hurt and was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, police said. \n Earlier Sunday, about 100 demonstrators gathered across the street from Bank of America Stadium before the football game to protest the Scott shooting. They were surrounded by at least two dozen police officers on bicycles. \n When the national anthem was played, the protesters all dropped to one knee as many NFL players have been doing for weeks to call attention to issues, including police shootings. Inside the stadium, Carolina safety Marcus Ball raised his fist during the anthem. \n Video footage police released Saturday of the Scott shooting incident hasn't settled questions about whether he threatened authorities with a gun before he was felled by a black officer. Police Chief Kerr Putney said Saturday that Scott was \"absolutely in possession of a handgun,\" adding that, while officers didn't break the law, the State Bureau of Investigation continues to pursue the case. \n While police say Scott had a gun, residents contend he was unarmed. It's not apparent in the video if he's holding anything shortly before he was shot. The dramatic video released by Charlotte police shows officers with guns drawn surrounding the man just before the shooting. \n Police also released photos on Saturday of what they said was a loaded handgun found at the scene, adding it bore Scott's DNA and fingerprints. They also said Scott had marijuana. \n In the police vehicle dashboard camera video released Saturday night, Scott could be seen slowly backing away from his SUV with his hands down. Four shots are heard in quick succession, and he crumples to the ground mortally wounded. \n Protests against Scott's fatal shooting were largely peaceful after the dashboard camera and police body-cam videos were released. \n Away from the marching, others said the videos increased their doubt about the police explanation that Scott's shooting was necessary and justified. Dozens of people on Sunday stopped by a makeshift memorial near the site where Scott died. Most said after watching the police videos that they were struck by what appeared to be little threat Scott pose the officers. \n \"If he had a gun in his hand, I couldn't see it. If he had one, he never raised it,\" Reda Burch said. \"His hands never left his side. So no, I don't see a reason to kill him.\" \n The videos changed the mind of Stacey Sizemore, who said that she worked in human resources for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department before leaving about six years ago. She said she knows police officers strive to protect the public, but the videos put new doubt into her mind that the shooting was necessary. \n \"If you're backing up, that's saying you don't want a fight. You don't want a confrontation. So that's the part that, kind of, didn't make it better for me,\" Sizemore said. \n Relatives and their attorney have also said what they saw on the partial police video footage left them wondering why Scott was killed. \n Charlotte has been on edge since Scott's death. The demonstrations reached a violent crescendo Wednesday before the National Guard was called in a day later to maintain order. Forty-four people were arrested after Wednesday's protests, and one protester who was shot died at a hospital Thursday. City officials said police did not shoot 26-year-old Justin Carr, and a suspect was arrested. A police report said Carr had been shot in the head. \n The next three nights of protests were free of property damage and violence, with organizers stressing a message of peace at the end of the week. Mayor Jennifer Roberts lifted the curfew on the city Sunday evening. \n Charlotte is the latest U.S. city to be shaken by protests and recriminations over the death of a black man at the hands of police, a list that includes Baltimore, Milwaukee, Chicago, New York and Ferguson, Missouri. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Charlotte ends curfew imposed after man shot by police"}

{"date": "September 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In a photo taken Friday in Basking Ridge, N.J., people pray during a service at the Bernards Township Community Center. The case of the New Jersey Muslim charged with planting bombs in New York and New Jersey is the latest of many challenging moments for the state's large Muslim population. \n PATERSON, N.J. \u00bb At the Islamic Center of Passaic County, which draws about 2,000 people each Friday for communal prayers, the talk is about how this year is different. \n After the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, people of other faiths in the surrounding community were generally able to see the difference between the radical perpetrators and American Muslims, said Omar Awad, president of the center. But he suggested that distinction seems to be blurring in the public mind amid the anti-Muslim rhetoric of the presidential campaign and growing anger over terrorist strikes in Europe and the United States, the latest allegedly plotted by a New Jersey Muslim. \n \"They're trying to strike fear between neighbors, between the very fabric of society that we spent so much time trying to make sure that we knitted,\" said Awad, a New Jersey native, sitting in the offices of the 27-year-old Paterson mosque. \n Like Muslims around the country, New Jersey's have been slogging through a particularly painful year. \n On the campaign trail, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, falsely claimed that Muslims in Jersey City celebrated when the World Trade Center fell, as he sought to promote a proposed national database for Muslims and increased surveillance of mosques. \n Gov. Chris Christie, who once sharply dismissed those who questioned the loyalty of a Muslim judicial appointee, has endorsed Trump. \n And now New Jersey Muslims are facing the broad scrutiny that follows when someone in their community is suspected of being a militant. Ahmad Khan Rahami, a U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan, who worked at his family's chicken takeout restaurant in Elizabeth, has been charged by federal officials in two states with planting bombs in New York and at a military charity run and a train station in New Jersey. Federal authorities said he praised Muslim extremists and prayed he'd be martyred. \n \"I don't want the stigma to go out that there's some kind of issue in Elizabeth, that it's a hotbed for people with radical ideas, because it's not,\" said Hassen Abedellah, an attorney and Elizabeth native, who is president of the Darul Islam mosque in the city. \n Abedellah said he was \"in shock\" when he learned that Rahami was being sought by police. Abedellah could not say for sure whether Rahami had ever worshipped at Darul Islam, but said the suspect could have passed through, since many Muslims in the community at one time or another have attended Friday prayers there. \n It is the latest difficulty for one of the larger Muslim communities in the United States. Muslims comprise about 1 percent of the U.S. population, but make up about 3 percent of the residents in New Jersey, according to the Pew Research Center. New Jersey Muslims are predominantly African-American, Arab or South Asian, plus Muslim asylum seekers from the Balkans and elsewhere. Several Muslims serve as state judges and mayors, among other public positions. \n In Elizabeth, Muslims have had a presence since at least the mid-20th century, developing mainly from a community of African-American Muslims and eventually growing to encompass immigrants from around the world, Abedellah said. Friday prayer at Darul Islam can draw as many as 500 people. \n The Sept. 11 attacks hit hard in New Jersey. Hundreds of victims of the suicide hijackings came from the state. In the aftermath, Muslim leaders joined with other religious and community leaders to quell any backlash. Mohammad Ali Chaudry, a Pakistani-born economist who had lived in New Jersey since the 1970s, ran for public office in 2001 in Basking Ridge and said he encountered no bias. \n \"Not a single person during that walking campaign, going door to door, asked me what my religion was,\" said Chaudry, who went on to serve on the township committee and, eventually, as mayor. \"They were concerned about what am I going to do about the deer problem. We have a lot of deer. How am I going to keep taxes down?\" \n Still, suspicion followed the community. Reports by The Associated Press revealed that the New York Police Department had been monitoring the daily life of Muslims in New Jersey, New York and beyond, including monitoring the Muslim Students Association at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, and Muslim businesses and mosques in Newark. New York City has since settled lawsuits accusing the department of waging a covert campaign of religious profiling and illegal spying. \n \"People felt very uncomfortable knowing that they are part of society but not really accepted as being part of the society,\" said Mikal Nash, a professor at Essex County College in Newark and author of \"Muslims in Newark, New Jersey: A Social History.\" \n New Jersey also found itself at the center of movement against Islamic law, or Shariah, in the U.S., after a state judge denied a woman a restraining order against her husband, who she said beat and sexually assaulted her. The judge said the husband's Islamic religious views meant he believed he was entitled to sexual relations at any time with his wife \u2014 legal reasoning that Muslim law experts rejected and a ruling an appellate court later reversed. Yet, the case was seized on by advocates for bans on Islamic law in other states. \n In New Jersey, the number of anti-Muslim hate crimes reported to the government remains low but is increasing, rising from four in 2014 to 14 last year, according to researchers at the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, Bernardino. But tensions can be seen in the vocal resistance to building mosques in some communities, with an ongoing fight in Bayonne and another in Basking Ridge that has stretched over four years and is now in court. \n Christie's political pivot has been especially disheartening for New Jersey Muslims. They had viewed the governor as a reliable ally. Five years ago, he drew notice for slamming critics of his decision to appoint an American Muslim, Sohail Mohammed, to the Superior Court. \"They're criticizing him because he's a Muslim American,\" Christie said, condemning conspiracists who argued Mohammed would bring Islamic law into state courts. \n \"This Shariah law business is crap. It's just crazy. And I'm tired of dealing with the crazies,\" Christie said. \n Chaudry, a longtime Republican, said he was stunned when the governor backed Trump this year. Chaudry had worked with the New Jersey attorney general's office on Muslim outreach and was appointed by Christie to a state commission on public service. But because of Trump, he left the GOP to join the Democrats, and has since been heavily involved in registering Muslims to vote, conducting outreach after Friday juma, or communal prayers, and surrounding the recent celebration of the Eid al-Adha holiday. He is also coordinating public speaker training for young people at his mosque. \n \"You have to be at the decision table,\" Chaudry said. \n Despite the tumult, and the glare from the Rahami case, New Jersey Muslims are persevering. The Islamic Center in Paterson is encouraging families to attend a holiday celebration called \"Great Muslim Adventure Day\" at the Six Flags amusement park in New Jersey. And next weekend in Elizabeth, where Rahami lived, more than 300 people are expected to attend the sixth annual meeting of the American Muslim Consumer Consortium, on marketing to Muslims and commemorating their achievements in the business world. \n \"I encourage Donald Trump and his supporters to come and see what the real American Muslim community in the U.S. is all about,\" said Sabiha Ansari, a co-founder of the conference. \"We are just as patriotic, proud and American as anyone else.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Bomb case is latest hardship for New Jersey's large Muslim community"}

Elementary schools in Arlington, South Burlington, Vt., and Holyoke, Mass., are among those that went homework-free at the start of the school year. \n SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. \u00bb Guess what, kids? No homework. Really. All year.  \n A small but growing number of elementary schools and individual teachers are doing away with the after-school chore to allow kids more time to play, participate in activities, spend time with families, read and sleep. \n There's been pushback against homework from parents in recent years who say their children's time is monopolized by other activities, said Steven Geis, president of the National Elementary School Principals' Association. \n At North Trail Elementary School, in Farmington, Minnesota, where he is principal, students do what he says is engaging homework. \n Some schools and individual teachers are revising their homework policies to ensure that they are effective, he said. \n At the Orchard School, a kindergarten-through-5th grade school in South Burlington, Vermont, the principal there said he's seen more anxiety among students in the last decade. The school opted to do away with homework this school year, based in part on the book \"The Homework Myth.\" \n \"They're just kids. They're pretty young and they just put in a full day's shift at work and so we just don't believe in adding more to their day. We also feel that we are squashing their other passions and interest in learning,\" Principal Mark Trifilio said. \n Alfie Kohn, the outspoken education lecturer and author of the book, \"The Homework Myth,\" says homework is a case of all pain and no gain. \n \"The disadvantages of homework are clear to everyone: exhaustion, frustration, loss of time to pursue other interests and often diminution of interest in learning,\" he said. \"Homework may be the greatest extinguisher of curiosity ever invented.\" \n But Harris Cooper, a psychology and neuroscience professor at Duke University, who has been studying the effects of homework for 30 years, disagrees. \n He thinks all school children should be doing homework, but the amount and type should vary depending on age and developmental levels. \n Cooper led research that reviewed more than 60 studies on homework between 1987 and 2003 and found that homework had a positive effect on student achievement, but the positive correlation was much stronger for students in grades 7-12 than for those in elementary school. \n He prescribes homework assignments that are short, simple and lead to success for elementary school kids, he said. \n It teaches kids that they don't just learn in the classroom and helps turn them into lifelong learners while improving their sense of independence, and time management and study skills, Cooper said. \n \"Homework is like medicine. If you take too little, it does nothing. If you take too much, it can kill you,\" Cooper said. \"You've got to get the dose right, and if you do, it can do wonders.\" \n A lot of the backlash is a reaction to some teachers assigning too much homework, he said. \n A guideline for many schools is 10 minutes of homework per grade: so 10 minutes in 1st grade, 20 minutes in 2nd grade and so on. \n \"We definitely don't say 'no homework' but we try to keep it reasonable,\" said Cherie Stobie, principal at the K-8 Marion school in Marion, Montana. \n \"The main benefit is just having the additional time to practice later in the day because research shows that if students practice, you know they take a break after they've learned something and they practice it again later, it's more likely to be retained,\" she said. \n Noelle M. Ellerson, of AASA: The School Superintendents Association, said there has been a small but growing number of schools or teachers revising homework policies or talking about it \"whether it's to do away with it or to shift to a policy where homework is the classwork they didn't finish during the day or where the homework of the child is to read with their parents.\" \n At the Orchard School, the children's daily home assignment now is to read books, get outside and play, eat dinner with family \u2014 including helping with setting and cleaning up \u2014 and get a good night's sleep. \n \"It's awesome,\" 9-year-old Avery Cutroni said of the no-homework policy. She had dance and piano lessons after school recently, so said she had a busy schedule. Plus, she's reading more on her own, her mother said. \n \"I think it gives kids a lot time for mental and physical rest which I think is super important,\" said Heidi Cutroni, of the school's elimination of homework. \"I think it's really good for parent-teacher-student relations in all directions and I think it just gives kids a chance to use their time for what their passionate and excited about.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Goodbye to homework for some elementary schools and classes"}

The rise in the rash of toxic blue-green algae blooms is causing the shut-down of various lakes and reservoirs in Alameda, Santa Clara and Contra Costa counties. \n BAY AREA NEWS GROUP / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n Sunshine Townsend, a water management technician with the East Bay Regional Park District, looks for the presence of blue green algae in the water in Lake Anza on Sept. 15 in Berkeley, Calif. \n BAY AREA NEWS GROUP / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n Sunshine Townsend, a water management technician with the East Bay Regional Park District, collects a sample of blue green algae from Lake Anza on Sept. 15 in Berkeley, Calif. \n WALNUT CREEK, Calif. \u00bb Katie Stone didn't know about the threat of toxic blue-green algae in Castro Valley's Lake Chabot until after her beloved 5-year-old chocolate lab Josie lapped up some of the reservoir water on a visit there last year.  \n Josie sickened and died within a few hours. \n It was a stark early example of California's growing problems with cyanobacteria, a naturally occurring substance that has blossomed like a slimy weed to infect more than 40 state lakes and waterways stretching from Berkeley, San Jose, Discovery Bay, the Russian River and Redding to Los Angeles. It is the highest count ever and double the 22 reported last year, according to officials. \n Many people and water agencies have been caught off guard by the growing extent of the algae, which can cause gastrointestinal upsets, skin rashes and allergic reactions in people, and sickness or death among dogs, livestock, sea otters and other wildlife. \n California's five-year drought created ideal conditions for brewing toxic levels of the naturally occurring bacteria, which multiplies rapidly in hot temperatures, low water flows and stagnant water choked with fertilizers and nutrients. \n Despite more rainfall this year, the mischievous microbes are causing more trouble than ever because nutrients that built up during the drought were washed off hills. The algae is triggering health warnings and advisories, the closing of swim areas, layoffs of lifeguards and a reduction in park visitors and revenues. \n Stone, a Castro Valley resident, said neither she nor the lake operator were prepared on a winter day in 2015 for the toxic algae when she took Josie to Lake Chabot east of Oakland, where neither dogs nor people are supposed to make body contact with the water. Dogs being dogs, however, Josie apparently romped away for a brief slurp. She died that night from kidney failure. \n \"It was traumatic. We were very upset the regional park district didn't have prominent warning signs,\" she said. \"They are doing a much better job now.\" \n East Bay Regional Park District officials say they have become more rigorous about warning signs. \n \"The algae caught everyone by surprise, and it was difficult to get clear guidance and protocols on what to do about it,\" said Carolyn Jones, a park district spokeswoman. \"We went more than 80 years before we had a closure for this toxic substance in the drought.\" \n It's hard to track algae outbreaks over time because reporting of algae blooms has been spotty and inconsistent among the many different lake operators and owners. \n However, there are many signs the algae is getting worse in California as well as spreading to other states such as Ohio and Florida, and global warming only portends more blooms, says Beverley Anderson-Abbs, an environmental scientist with the state Water Resources Control Board. \n Among the waterways closed at times are Del Valle Reservoir near Livermore, Pyramid Lake near Los Angeles and Lake Elsinore in Riverside County. \n San Jose closed its Cunningham Lake to boating and fishing for the first time earlier this month because of the toxic algae, disappointing kayakers, paddle boaters and a local outrigger canoe club, said Alex Pearson, a manager in the city parks and recreation department. Almaden Lake also was closed earlier this month, but it has had other algae-related closures off and on since 2010. \n Contra Costa County health officials posed warning signs this year in some waters in Discovery Bay, a boater-oriented community. \"The effect on recreation has been huge \u2014 not being able to boat or swim in areas at the high time of the season,\" said Contra Costa County Supervisor Mary Piepho, a Discovery Bay resident. \n She said the build-up underscores the need for the state to allocate greater fresh water flows through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River to flush out pollutants. \n Runoff from algae-contaminated inland lakes also flows out of streams and rivers to harm sea otters that eat shellfish in Monterey Bay, a team of 15 state and university researchers concluded in a 2010 paper. They linked 21 deaths of southern sea otters, an endangered species, to toxic effects of the blue-green algae between 1997 and 2008, the scientists wrote in the journal PLOS ONE. \n State officials stepped up their efforts to alert the public to the risks and water officials of how to manage them. On Aug. 24, they issued a caution to the public to heed local warning signs to avoid contact with contaminated water bodies and to keep pets away. The big message: When in doubt, stay out. \n Likewise, state officials urged lake operators to be vigilant in monitoring for the toxic algae, and to use state guidelines on when to put up caution signs and closure signs. \n Some lake managers are testing herbicides to reduce algae blooms, but the results have been mixed and inconclusive, officials say.  \n \"There is no silver bullet,\" Anderson-Abbs said. \"Generally, the best thing to do is to stay out of the water until the bloom is over.\" \n After losing one dog to algae poisoning, Stone said she keeps her other dog on a leash at all times in parks, and they steer clear of freshwater lakes. \n \"I don't trust lake water anymore where the water is still and you don't know what is building up,\" said Stone, an epidemiologist. \"We take her to the ocean.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 East Bay Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.)  \n ", "author": "By Denis Cuff East Bay Times", "title": "Toxic algae troubles many California lakes and waterways"}

President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC leader Rodrigo Londono, alias Timochenko, are expected to sign a peace accord to end more than five decades of conflict Sept. 26 in the Caribbean city of Cartagena. \n CARTAGENA, Colombia \u00bb Colombia will take a big step toward emerging from its long nightmare of bloody violence Monday when the government and the country's largest rebel movement sign a peace accord that emerged from four hard years of negotiations. \n The significance of the deal can't be overstated: Colombia's five-decade conflict, partly fueled by the nation's cocaine trade, has killed more than 220,000 people and driven 8 million from their homes. \n Underlining the importance of the day, the pact is being signed by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and by the top commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a rebel fighter known by the alias Timochenko. Fifteen Latin American presidents, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry are scheduled to witness the signing in the colonial Caribbean city of Cartagena. \n The ceremony late Monday afternoon will be charged with symbolism. The more than 2,500 guests have been invited to wear white as a sign of peace, and Santos will put his signature on the 297-page accord with a pen made from a recycled shell used in combat. \n The signing won't close the deal, though. Colombians are being given the final say on endorsing or rejecting the accord in an Oct. 2 referendum. Opinion polls point to an almost-certain victory for the \"yes\" vote, but some analysts warn that a closer-than-expected finish or low voter turnout could bode poorly for the many challenges the country faces implementing the ambitious accord. \n Among the biggest and most controversial steps will be judging the war crimes of guerrillas as well as state actors. Under terms of the accord, rebels who lay down their weapons and confess their abuses will be spared jail time and allowed to provide reparations to their victims by carrying out development work in areas hit hard by the conflict. \n The government has also committed itself to addressing unequal land distribution, which has been a longstanding FARC demand harkening back to its roots as a peasant army in 1964, and the administration agreed to work with the guerrillas to provide alternative development to tens of thousands of families that depend on the cocaine trade. \n Only if the accord passes the referendum will the FARC's roughly 7,000 fighters begin moving to 28 designated zones where over the next six months they are to turn over their weapons to U.N.-sponsored observers. \n The rebels were forced to the negotiating table after being pushed to the edge of Colombia's vast jungles by a decade-long, U.S.-backed military campaign that claimed the lives of a number of its top commanders. \n Negotiations, which had been expected to take a few months, stretched over more than four years and had to overcome a number of crises, from the military's killing of the FARC's then top commander, known as Alfonso Cano, shortly after he authorized a secret backchannel with the government to the rebels' capture of an army general who until a few months ago would have been a trophy prisoner. \n \"What's good about the fact that it lasted four years is that it was a very thorough process,\" Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of the ceremony. Norway and Cuba were co-sponsors of the negotiation that began in Oslo in 2012 and then shifted to Havana. \n \"The mindset of everyone has changed,\" Brende said. \"I feel very genuinely that President Santos and Commander Timochenko want this to work and not go into the blame game.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Colombia to sign historic peace deal on ending long conflict"}

Lawrence Convention Center on Thursday in Pittsburgh, Pa. \n MIAMI \u00bb Donald Trump says taxes in the United States are higher than almost anywhere else on Earth. They're not.  \n He says he opposed the Iraq war from the start. He didn't. \n Now, after years of spreading the lie that President Barack Obama was born in Africa, Trump says Hillary Clinton did it first (untrue) and that he's the one who put the controversy to rest (also untrue). \n Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has. Over and over, independent researchers have examined what the Republican nominee says and concluded it was not the truth \u2014 \"pants on fire\" (Politifact) or \"four Pinocchios\" (Washington Post Fact Checker). \n Trump's candidacy was premised on upending a dishonest establishment that has rigged American political and economic life, so many of his loyalists are willing to overlook his lies, as long as he rankles the powerful, said Republican strategist Rob Stutzman. \n \"It gives him not only license, but incentive to spin fantasy, because no one expects him to tell the truth,\" said Stutzman, who worked against Trump during the primaries. \"They believe they're getting lied to constantly, so if their hero tells lies in order to strike back, they don't care.\" \n Still, Trump's pattern of saying things that are provably false has no doubt contributed to his high unfavorable ratings. It also has forced journalists to grapple with how aggressive they should be in correcting candidates' inaccurate statements, particularly in the presidential debates that start Monday. \n At a time of deep public mistrust of the news media, the arbitration of statements of fact, long seen as one of reporters' most basic duties, runs the risk of being perceived as partisan bias. \n But so does the shirking of that role. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, one of the debate moderators, has faced a storm of criticism for telling CNN: \"It's not my job to be a truth squad.\" \n After a Sept. 8 town hall on NBC, critics skewered moderator Matt Lauer for failing to correct Trump's false statement that he opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq. CBS correspondent Lesley Stahl drew milder reprimands for letting Trump repeat the same lie twice in a July interview on \"60 Minutes,\" responding \"yeah\" both times with no correction. \n Trump's Democratic rival faces integrity questions of her own. A new Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll found that 41 percent of voters saw Trump as better than Clinton at being honest and straightforward; just 31 percent thought that Clinton would be better than Trump in that area. \n Republicans have used Clinton's use of a private email server when she was secretary of State to cast doubt on her honesty, saying she has been untrustworthy for decades. Her efforts to fight back were damaged when FBI Director James Comey said in early July that she had been \"extremely careless\" in her handling of emails that officials said should have been considered classified. \n Nonetheless, the scope of Trump's lies is unprecedented, and he is dogged in refusing to stop saying things once they are proven untrue. \n Buzzfeed unearthed an audio recording showing that Trump backed the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and a 2011 video in which he called for swift military action against Moammar Gadhafi, then the leader of Libya. In the months since then, Trump has lied dozens of times on both issues, saying he opposed the use of force in Iraq and Libya. \n Trump campaign spokesmen Hope Hicks and Jason Miller did not respond to an email requesting comment on Trump's history of falsehoods. \n Thomas E. Mann, a resident scholar at the University of California, Berkeley's Institute of Governmental Studies, said Trump appears to recognize that a faction of the Republican Party has lost respect for facts, evidence and science \u2014 presuming, for example, that anything negative said about Obama is probably true. \n Moreover, he said, the New York business mogul once thrived as a reality television star playing himself on \"The Apprentice,\" and in that realm there's \"no need to have any touch with genuine reality \u2014 it's all as he defines it.\" \n \"He's a salesman,\" Mann said. \"He's a con man. He's hustled people out of money that they're owed. He's lived off tax shelters. He's always looking for a scheme and a con, and in that sphere, you just fall into telling lies as a matter of course.\" \n In \"Trump: The Art of the Deal,\" his 1987 best-seller, Trump said \"a little hyperbole never hurts.\" \n \"People believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It's an innocent form of exaggeration \u2014 and a very effective form of promotion,\" he said. \n Trump's coauthor, Tony Schwartz, put it less benignly in a July interview with The New Yorker. \"He lied strategically,\" Schwartz recalled. \"He had a complete lack of conscience about it.\" \n PolitiFact, a Tampa Bay Times site that won a Pulitzer for its coverage of the 2008 election, has rated 70 percent of the Trump statements it has checked as mostly false, false or \"pants on fire,\" its lowest score. By contrast, 28 percent of Clinton's statements earned those ratings. \n \"As we noted when we awarded Trump our 2015 Lie of the Year award for his portfolio of misstatements, no other politician has as many statements rated so far down the dial,\" PolitiFact writer Lauren Carroll reported in June. \"It's unlike anything we've ever seen.\" \n At a recent Trump rally in downtown Miami, supporters vouched for his trustworthiness. \n \"I think he has been very straightforward, whether people like it or not,\" said Rosario Rodriguez-Ruiz, 42, a Republican real estate broker and accountant. \n Some in the audience conceded that Trump might have cut corners in business, but said they were more troubled by what they called Clinton's dishonesty about her email and the deadly raid on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya. Miguel Pita, 56, said Trump had to \"bend the rules\" to avoid taxes. \"I look at it as a 'Catch Me If You Can' type of deal,\" he said.  \n Suzanne Roberts, 61, a retired Miami finance professor, said Clinton was \"capable of spreading heinous rumors about anything, anyone, at any time.\" As Elton John's \"Funeral for a Friend\" blasted through the concert hall's loudspeakers, she said Trump was correct to argue for five years that Obama was born outside the United States. \n \"He was born on a naval base in Mombasa, Kenya \u2014 that's what I think,\" Roberts said. \"I've done some research.\" \n A few days earlier, Trump spoke at a black church in Flint, Mich. When he started to criticize Clinton, the pastor interrupted and asked him not to give a political speech. \n \"The audience was saying let him speak, let him speak,\" Trump later told Fox News. \n \"That isn't true,\" reported National Public Radio correspondent Scott Detrow, an eyewitness. \"In fact, several audience members began to heckle Trump, asking pointed questions about whether he racially discriminated against black tenants as a landlord.\" \n When Trump released his child-care plan on Sept. 13, he said Clinton didn't have one. She did. He has often described himself as popular among blacks; the latest Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll found 7 percent of black voters support him.  \n Trump also depicts crime as rising and out of control in America's inner cities despite years of falling crime rates. He has said that black people kill 81 percent of white homicide victims, when in fact whites kill 82 percent of white homicide victims, according to PolitiFact. \n Marty Kaplan, a professor of entertainment, media and society at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, has two theories on Trump's lies. \n Perhaps he's just putting on an act, like P.T. Barnum \u2014 a \"marketer, con, snake-oil salesman who knows better, knows how to get the rubes into the tent.\" Or maybe, Kaplan suggested, Trump is just \"completely unconstrained by logic, rules, tradition, truth, law.\" \n \"I'm confused,\" he said, \"whether the whole fact-free zone that he's in is a strategic calculation or a kind of psychosis.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times  \n ", "author": "By Michael Finnegan Los Angeles Times", "title": "Scope of Trump's lies are unprecedented for a modern presidential candidate"}

He was 87. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS / MARCH 2015 \n Arnold Palmer is seen at the Arnold Palmer Invitational golf tournament in Orlando, Fla., on March 22, 2015. Palmer, who brought a country-club sport to the masses, died today in Pittsburgh. He was 87. \n Arnold Palmer brought a country club sport to the masses with a hard-charging style, charisma and a commoner's touch. At ease with both presidents and the golfing public, and on a first-name basis with both, \"The King\" died today in Pittsburgh. He was 87. \n Alastair Johnston, CEO of Arnold Palmer Enterprises, confirmed that Palmer died this afternoon of complications from heart problems. Johnston said Palmer was admitted to the UPMC Hospital on Thursday for some cardiovascular work and weakened over the last few days. \n \"Today marks the passing of an era,\" said Johnston, Palmer's longtime agent at IMG. \"Arnold Palmer's influence, profile and achievements spread far beyond the game of golf. He was an iconic American who treated people with respect and warmth, and built a unique legacy through his ability to engage with fans.\" \n \"If it wasn't for Arnold, golf wouldn't be as popular as it is now,\" Tiger Woods said in 2004 when Palmer played in his last Masters. \"He's the one who basically brought it to the forefront on TV. If it wasn't for him and his excitement, his flair, the way he played, golf probably would not have had that type of excitement. \n \"And that's why he's the king.\" \n Beyond his golf, Palmer was a pioneer in sports marketing, paving the way for scores of other athletes to reap in millions from endorsements. Some four decades after his last PGA Tour win, he ranked among the highest-earners in golf. \n \"It is not an exaggeration to say there would be no modern-day PGA Tour without Arnold Palmer. There would be no PGA Tour Champions without Arnold Palmer. There would be no Golf Channel without Arnold Palmer,\" PGA Tour Commisioner Tim Finchem said in a statement. \n \"No one has had a greater impact on those who play our great sport or who are touched by it. It has been said many times over in so many ways, but beyond his immense talent, Arnold transcended our sport with an extraordinarily appealing personality and genuineness that connected with millions, truly making him a champion of the people.\" \n He would hitch up his pants, drop a cigarette and attack the flags. With powerful hands wrapped around the golf club, Palmer would slash at the ball with all of his might, then twist that muscular neck and squint to see where it went. \n \"When he hits the ball, the earth shakes,\" Gene Littler once said. \n Palmer rallied from seven shots behind to win a U.S. Open. He blew a seven-shot lead on the back nine to lose a U.S. Open. \n He was never dull. \n \"I'm pleased that I was able to do what I did from a golfing standpoint,\" Palmer said in 2008, two years after he played in his last official tournament. \"I would like to think that I left them more than just that.\" \n He left behind a gallery known as \"Arnie's Army,\" which began at Augusta National with a small group of soldiers from nearby Fort Gordon, and grew to include a legion of fans from every corner of the globe. \n Palmer stopped playing the Masters in 2004 and hit the ceremonial tee shot every year until 2016, when age began to take a toll and he struggled with his balance. \n It was Palmer who gave golf the modern version of the Grand Slam \u2014 winning all four professional majors in one year. He came up with the idea after winning the Masters and U.S. Open in 1960. Palmer was runner-up at the British Open, later calling it one of the biggest disappointments of his career. But his appearance alone invigorated the British Open, which Americans had been ignoring for years. \n Palmer never won the PGA Championship, one major short of capturing a career Grand Slam. \n But then, standard he set went beyond trophies. It was the way he treated people, looking everyone in the eye with a smile and a wink. He signed every autograph, making sure it was legible. He made every fan feel like an old friend. \n Palmer never like being referred to as \"The King,\" but the name stuck. \n \"It was back in the early '60s. I was playing pretty good, winning a lot of tournaments, and someone gave a speech and referred to me as 'The King,'\" Palmer said in a November 2011 interview with The Associated Press. \n \"I don't bask in it. I don't relish it. I tried for a long time to stop that and,\" he said, pausing to shrug, \"there was no point.\" \n Palmer played at least one PGA Tour event every season for 52 consecutive years, ending with the 2004 Masters. He spearheaded the growth of the 50-and-older Champions Tour, winning 10 times and drawing some of the biggest crowds. \n He was equally successful off with golf course design, a wine collection, and apparel that included his famous logo of an umbrella. He bought the Bay Hill Club & Lodge upon making his winter home in Orlando, Florida, and in 2007 the PGA Tour changed the name of the tournament to the Arnold Palmer Invitational. \n The combination of iced tea and lemonade is known as an \"Arnold Palmer.\" Padraig Harrington recalls eating in an Italian restaurant in Miami when he heard a customer order one. \n \"Think about it,\" Harrington said. \"You don't go up there and order a 'Tiger Woods' at the bar. You can go up there and order an 'Arnold Palmer' in this country and the barman \u2014 he was a young man \u2014 knew what the drink was. That's in a league of your own.\" \n Palmer was born Sept. 10, 1929 in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, the oldest of four children. His father, Deacon, became the greenskeeper at Latrobe Country Club in 1921 and the club pro in 1933. \n He had two loves as a boy \u2014 strapping on his holster with toy guns to play \"Cowboys and Indians,\" and playing golf. It was on the golf course that Palmer grew to become so strong, with barrel arms and hands of iron. \n \"When I was 6 years old, my father put me on a steel-wheeled tractor,\" he recalled in a 2011 interview with the AP. \"I had to stand up to turn the wheel. That's one thing made me strong. The other thing was I pushed mowers. In those days, there were no motors on anything except the tractor. The mowers to cut greens with, you pushed. \n \"And it was this,\" he said, patting his arms, \"that made it go.\" \n Palmer joined the PGA Tour in 1955 and won the Canadian Open for the first of his 62 titles. He went on to win four green jackets at Augusta National, along with the British Open in 1961 and 1962 and the U.S. Open in 1960, perhaps the most memorable of his seven majors. \n Nothing defined Palmer like that 1960 U.S. Open at Cherry Hills. He was seven shots behind going into the final round when he ran into Bob Drum, a Pittsburgh sports writer. Palmer asked if he could still win by shooting 65, which would give him a four-day total of 280. Drum told him that 280 \"won't do you a damn bit of good.\" \n Incensed, Palmer headed to the first tee and drove the green on the par-4 opening hole to make birdie. He birdied the next three holes, shot 65 and outlasted Ben Hogan and 20-year-old amateur Jack Nicklaus. \n Palmer went head to head with Nicklaus two years later in a U.S. Open, the start of one of golf's most famous rivalries. It was one-sided. Nicklaus went on to win 18 majors and was regarded as golf's greatest champion. Palmer won two more majors after that loss, and his last PGA Tour win came in 1973 at the Bob Hope Classic. \n Tom Callahan once described the difference between Nicklaus and Palmer this way: It's as though God said to Nicklaus, \"You will have skills like no other,\" then whispered to Palmer, \"But they will love you more.\" \n \"I think he brought a lot more to the game than his game,\" Nicklaus said in 2009. \"What I mean by that is, there's no question about his record and his ability to play the game. He was very, very good at that. But he obviously brought a lot more. He brought the hitch of his pants, the flair that he brought to the game, the fans that he brought into the game.\" \n Palmer combined power with charm, reckless abandon with graceful elegance. Golf no longer was a country club game for old men who were out of shape. He was a man's man, and he brought that spirit to the sport. \n It made him a beloved figure, and brought riches long after he stopped competing. \n That started with a handshake agreement with IMG founder Mark McCormack to represent Palmer in contract negotiations. Palmer's image was everywhere, from motor oil to ketchup to financial services companies. Even as late as 2011, nearly 40 years after his last PGA Tour win, Palmer was No. 3 on Golf Digest's list of top earners at $36 million a year. He trailed only Woods and Phil Mickelson. \n Palmer's other love was aviation. He piloted his first aircraft in 1956, and 10 years later had a license to fly jets that now are the standard mode of transportation for so many top players, even though the majority of them are merely passengers. Palmer flew planes the way he played golf. He set a record in 1976 when he circumnavigated the globe in 57 hours, 25 minutes and 42 seconds in a Lear 36. He continued flying his Cessna Citation 10 until he failed to renew his license at age 81, just short of 20,000 hours in the cockpit. \n Through it all, he touched more people than he could possibly remember, though he sure tried. When asked about the fans he attracted at Augusta National, Palmer once said, \"Hell, I know most of them by name.\" \n Only four other players won more PGA Tour events than Palmer \u2014 Sam Snead, Nicklaus, Woods and Hogan. \n Palmer's first wife, Winnie, died in 1999. They had two daughters, and grandson Sam Saunders plays on the PGA Tour. Palmer married Kathleen (Kit) Gawthrop in 2005. \n Details on a memorial service and burial will be announced later. \n Palmer was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997, which was caught early. He returned to golf a few months later, winking at fans as he waded through the gallery, always a smile and a signature for them. \n \"I'm not interested in being a hero,\" Palmer said, implying that too much was made about his return from cancer. \"I just want to play some golf.\" \n That, perhaps, is his true epitaph. Palmer lived to play. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Golf great Arnold Palmer dies at 87"}

Friday, Sept. 23, 2016, over Tuesday's fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. \n CHARLOTTE, N.C. >> Charlotte's police chief announced Saturday that he would release body and dashboard camera footage of the shooting of a black man after several days of demonstrations that have coalesced around demands that the public see the video. \n Chief Kerr Putney said at a news conference that the video would be made available through a web link in a news release that was coming out within a half hour of him addressing media. He said that and other evidence they were releasing would corroborate their account of how things unfolded, including that Keith Lamont Scott was holding a gun when he was shot. \n He addressed reporters hours after several hundred demonstrators took to the street for a fifth day and marched around downtown Charlotte. \n Putney said that he decided to release the footage after receiving assurances from the State Bureau of Investigation that it would not impact their independent probe of the shooting. \n Asked whether he expected the footage to quiet protesters, Putney responded: \"The footage itself will not create in anyone's mind as to what this case represents\u2026 the footage only supports the other information\" such as forensic evidence and witness statements. \n He also said that his officers didn't break the law but noted that the State Bureau of Investigation is continuing its investigation. \n \"Officers are absolutely not being charged by me, but again, there's another investigation ongoing,\" he said. \n Putney said that Scott was \"absolutely in possession of a handgun,\" and that officers also saw marijuana in his car \u2014 prompting officers to act. \n Amid anxiety and unease over the shooting of Scott, demonstrations in Charlotte have gone from violent to peaceful, although demands to see video of the encounter remained at the forefront of discussions for those taking to the streets. \n Many of the hundreds massed outside at the Charlotte police department building Saturday afternoon chanted the name \"Keith Scott.\" The 43-year-old black man was shot to death by a black officer earlier in the week, and police have not released dashcam and body camera video. \n Protesters marched Saturday through the streets of a city on edge after Scott's shooting death. The demonstrations reached a violent crescendo on Wednesday before the National Guard was called in a day later to maintain order. \n The next two nights of protests were free of property damage and violence, with organizers stressing a message of peace at the end of the week. \n On Saturday, demonstrators changed, \"No tapes, no peace\" and raised signs including one reading \"Stop Killing The Black People.\" Community organizers said on Friday they anticipated that protests would continue in some form until the videos were released. \n Charlotte is the latest U.S. city to be shaken by protests and recriminations over the death of a black man at the hands of police, a list that includes Baltimore, Milwaukee, Chicago, New York and Ferguson, Missouri. \n Earlier in the week, the Charlotte protests turned violent, with demonstrators attacking reporters and others, setting fires and smashing windows of hotels, office buildings and restaurants. \n Forty-four people were arrested after Wednesday's protests, and one protester who was shot died at a hospital Thursday. City officials said police did not shoot 26-year-old Justin Carr. A suspect was arrested, but police provided few details. \n On Thursday, protests were largely peaceful after National Guard members came to the city to help keep order and the mayor imposed a curfew. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Charlotte to release body and dash camera video of shooting"}

{"date": "September 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This late Saturday, Sept. 24, 2016, image from video by KIRO7 photographer Jeff Ritter shows suspected Cascade Mall shooter Arcan Cetin at Skagit County Jail in Mount Vernon, Wash., after his arrest in Oak Harbor, Wash., earlier in the evening. Investigators on Sunday tried to piece together information on the 20-year-old suspect in the deadly Washington state mall shootings who was apprehended after a nearly 24-hour manhunt. \n OAK HARBOR, Wash. >> The 20-year-old man suspected of killing five people with a rifle at a Macy's makeup counter had had a string of run-ins with the law in recent years, including charges he assaulted his stepfather, and was described by a neighbor as so \"creepy, rude and obnoxious\" that she kept a Taser by her front door. \n As investigators tried to piece together information on Arcan Cetin, who was arrested Saturday evening after a nearly 24-hour manhunt, a picture emerged of a troubled young man. Court records show more than a half-dozen criminal cases in Island County alone since 2013. \n Authorities said the gunman in the attack at the Cascade Mall in Burlington opened fire in the department store's cosmetics department Friday night, killing a man and four females ranging from a teenager to a senior citizen. The killer then fled. \n Cetin said nothing and appeared \"zombie-like\" when he was taken into custody on a sidewalk outside his apartment complex some 30 miles away in Oak Harbor by a sheriff's officer who recognized him as the suspect in the rampage, authorities said. \n Cetin immigrated to the U.S. from Turkey and is a legal permanent resident, officials said. \n As the surrounding area absorbed news of the arrest, critical questions remained, including the gunman's motive. The FBI said early Saturday that there was no indication the shooting was terrorism, but local authorities said later in the day that they were ruling nothing out. \n On Sept. 17, a 20-year-old man stabbed 10 people at a Minnesota mall before being shot to death by an off-duty police officer. Authorities said they are investigating the attack by Dahir Ahmed Adan as a possible act of terrorism. \n On Sunday, investigators searched Cetin's vehicle and the apartment complex and were seen carrying boxes from a rear, upstairs unit. The four-unit building was surrounded with yellow police tape. Detectives would not say what they found. \n Amber Cathey, 21, lived in an apartment next to Cetin for the past three months and said she was so frightened by him that she complained to apartment management and kept a stun gun handy. Cathey said she blocked him on Snapchat after he sent her a photo of his crotch. \n \"He was really creepy, rude and obnoxious,\" Cathey said. She said she would try to avoid him by walking the long way around to her apartment if she saw his car in the parking lot. The two were in high school together as well, and Cathey said he acted the same way then. \n The Seattle Times reported that court records show Cetin faced three charges of assaulting his stepfather. The newspaper said Cetin also was arrested on drunken driving charges. It gave no details on when the arrests took place or how the cases may have been resolved. \n In the assault case, Cetin was told by a judge last December that he was not to possess a gun, the newspaper reported. However, the stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was \"going through a hard time.\" \n Attempts to reach Cetin's family for comment by phone and social media weren't immediately successful. A man who came to the door Sunday morning at an Oak Harbor address believed to be where Cetin's stepfather and mother live asked an Associated Press reporter to leave the property. \n Social media accounts apparently belonging to Cetin showed he had a fondness for the military and video games. \n A Twitter account showed, among other things, selfies, photos of him in younger years and pictures of Turkish food. He once participated in paintball and said he \"can't wait for Halo 5,\" the first-person shooter video game. He also tweeted: \"Shout out to the ROTC peeps.\" A Facebook account showed he liked military-related sites. \n Oak Harbor is a city of 22,000 on Whidbey Island with many military families associated with the nearby Naval Air Station Whidbey Island. \n Sheriff's Lt. Mike Hawley said he spotted Cetin from a patrol car and immediately recognized him as the suspect in the shooting rampage. \n \"I literally hit my brakes, did a quick turn, I jumped out,\" Hawley said. \"We both jumped out with our guns, and he just froze.\" \n Cetin was unarmed and was carrying a satchel with a computer in it. \"He was kind of zombie-like,\" Hawley said. \n No immediate charges were brought against Cetin, who awaited a court appearance Monday. \n The names of the dead were not immediately released by police. But The Seattle Times identified one as 16-year-old Sarai Lara. Her mother said she survived cancer as a young girl and was a happy student. \n Authorities in suburban Seattle identified another victim as Belinda Galde, 64, a probation officer with the Snohomish County District Court. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mall shooting suspect: 'Creepy,' multiple arrests, disputes"}

{"date": "September 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leaves in his vehicle after a meeting with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at Trump Tower, Sunday, in New York. \n NEW YORK >> Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were meeting separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday, giving the each candidate fresh bragging rights about their knowledge of foreign policy and readiness to lead the nation on the eve of their first presidential debate. \n Trump and Netanyahu discussed \"at length\" Israel's use of a fence to help secure its borders, an example Trump frequently cites when he's talking about the wall he wants to build between the U.S. and Mexico. \n \"Trump recognized that Israel and its citizens have suffered far too long on the front lines of Islamic terrorism,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"He agreed with Prime Minister Netanyahu that the Israeli people want a just and lasting peace with their neighbors, but that peace will only come when the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept Israel as a Jewish State.\" \n Clinton was expected to meet with the prime minister later in the day, also in New York. \n The meeting was designed to put Israel on good footing with the next U.S. president. But it also served to showcase the candidates' expertise in foreign policy in the shadow of their first debate Monday, six weeks before Election Day. Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, often says that Trump does not know enough about the world and lacks the temperament to be president. Trump has argued that he has extensive experience with foreign policy through his career as a business executive and blames Clinton for many of the nation's stumbles in foreign policy. \n Meanwhile, the candidates deployed their top supporters to the Sunday shows to take early jabs at their opponents and lower expectations for a showdown expected to draw 75 million viewers \u2014 many of them disenchanted with both candidates, the least-popular presidential hopefuls in history. \n Facts and who will determine them during the 90-minute debate seemed to be a top concern of the campaigns' strategists given Trump's habit of saying things that are untrue and the public's general distrust of Clinton. \n Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, told ABC's \"This Week\" that he is concerned Trump will continue his habit of sometimes saying things that aren't true and still get a passing grade. He called on moderator Lester Holt to correct any inaccuracies made by the candidates. But Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said it's not the job of debate moderators to fact check. \n Trump's vice presidential running mate, Mike Pence, meanwhile, said that Gennifer Flowers will not attend the debate. Trump had tweeted that if frequent Trump critic Mark Cuban attended the showdown, he'd put Flowers, allegedly the former mistress of Clinton's husband Bill, in the audience too. Conway said that Flowers had a right to be there if \"somebody else gives her a ticket.\" But Pence drew a harder line. \n \"Gennifer Flowers will not be attending the debate tomorrow night,\" Pence said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \n The candidates were focused on other matters Sunday. \n Trump's campaign said that during his meeting with Netanyahu, the Republican presidential nominee promised, \"extraordinary strategic, technological, military and intelligence cooperation between the two countries\" if he's elected. \n The press was barred from covering the meeting between Netanyahu and Trump, but Trump's campaign said in a statement that the men, who have known each other for years, discussed \"many topics important to both countries,\" including \"the special relationship between America and Israel and the unbreakable bond between the two countries.\" \n Among those topics: the nuclear deal with Iran, the battle against Islamic State militants, military assistance provided by the U.S. to Israel and other security issues. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton, Trump buff foreign policy bona fides on debate eve"}

{"date": "September 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n California's traffic-locked roads are being considered for their potential to serve a new purpose as clear power producers. \n LOS ANGELES >> All those cars on California's famously gridlocked highways could be doing more than just using energy \u2013 they could be producing it. \n The California Energy Commission is investing $2 million to study whether piezoelectric crystals can be used to produce electricity from the mechanical energy created by vehicles driving on roads. \n The commission is in the process of choosing a company or university to take on small-scale field tests. It will study how the small crystals, which generate energy when compressed, could produce electricity for the grid if installed under asphalt. \n Scientists already know the technology works, but the state needs to figure out whether it can produce high returns without costing too much. Similar projects in other parts of the world have been discontinued. \n \"It's not hard to see the opportunity in California,\" said Mike Gravely, the commission's deputy division chief of energy research and development. \"It's an energy that's created but is just currently lost in vibration.\" \n Scientists say it's a matter of shifting perceptions. \n \"No longer is driving just the act of using energy. Maybe it's also part of the process of generating it,\" said Paul Bunje, a scientist at a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that funds technological developments and the former founding director of UCLA's Center for Climate Change Solutions. \n The hope is that the use of clean energy produced by roads will help the state reach its goal of producing 50 percent of California's electricity with renewables by 2030, Gravely said. \n The state is on target to reach 25 percent by the end of the year, according to the energy commission. \n Whether the technology can withstand the wear and tear of traffic is something that concerns Joe Mahoney, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. \n \"One would need to consider which would last longer: the pavement or the devices,\" he said, adding highways need to be resurfaced every 10 to 30 years. \n There is also uncertainty about whether the technology will be competitive enough with other renewables to merit full-scale investment. \n California's funding to study the technology follows a series of projects in Tokyo, Italy and Israel that appear to have failed or been dropped. \n Most notably, an Israeli company whose pilot test attracted global attention in 2009 is now in the process of liquidation, and the project was unsuccessful, according to the Israeli roads authority. \n The company, Innowattech, also had plans to install its devices under a section of Italian highway but pulled out, according to Salini Impregilo, the Italian construction company involved. \n It was the Israeli project that inspired California lawmaker Mike Gatto, a Los Angeles Democrat, to ask the energy commission to fund pilot projects in California. \n Gatto submitted a bill to the Assembly in 2011 and has lauded the Israeli project in several news releases since. \n He told The Associated Press that he didn't know the project apparently failed. \n \"Hearing these details for the first time \u2014obviously, they're not heartening,\" Gatto said. \"I don't want anything to be colored by one tiny experiment by one company in a different country.\" \n Gatto said he thinks the technology is still viable. \n \"It's probably that there are cost issues that might have been present in Israel that might not be present here,\" he said. \n Innowattech data also featured heavily in the commission's feasibility study, published by an energy consulting company in 2014. The study gathered and compared the data available from projects experimenting with the technology at the time. \n But the commission's Gravely said conclusions were drawn from a range of sources, assuring him the results are reliable. He added he has spoken to several manufacturers within the United States who are eager to explore it. \n Bunje noted it's not uncommon for a technology's early adopters to fail. \n \"Innovation comes with risk,\" he said. \"There is a general rule that you don't know what is going to work.\" \n Regardless of the risks, it's worth trying new things, he said. \n The $2 million California is using to test the new technology will come from a renewable investment fund created by the California Public Utilities Commission. Bidding will end Nov. 18, and the commission will award the contract in the spring. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "California eyes unusual power source: its gridlocked roads"}

There are also concerns voiced about the wide-ranging social and government budget costs involved, including for the overdose antidote naloxone. \n Some signs of heroin overdose backlash: \n \u2014 Gov. Paul LePage in hard-hit Maine vetoed legislation this year to expand access to naloxone, usually under the brand name Narcan. He has explained that when people are receiving a dozen or more doses, they should start having to pay for it. The Legislature overrode his veto. \n \u2014 An effort by authorities in Ohio's Hamilton County to get a dangerous heroin batch off the streets by offering immunity for people who turn in drugs drew a rebuke from Sheriff Richard Jones in neighboring Butler County, who argued it only enables dealers and users and gives them an excuse if they are caught. \n \u2014 A police photo of a grandmother and her boyfriend unconscious after overdosing with a 4-year-old boy in their car went viral this month after the police department in Ohio's East Liverpool posted it on Facebook, drawing thousands of comments including from people decrying lenience toward users who endanger children or steal to support their habits. \n \u2014 A retired attorney wrote an op-ed column in The Cincinnati Enquirer examining the costs of treating heroin addiction, the strain on public resources and the rise in \"drugged driving\" accidents as he urged aggressive punishment. \"What social policy is advanced by subsidizing recklessness?\" John M. Kunst Jr., of suburban Cincinnati, wrote earlier this year. \"Why do we excuse and enable addiction?\" \n \"I understand the frustration,\" said Police Chief Thomas Synan Jr. of Newtown, Ohio, who heads a Cincinnati-area heroin coalition task force. \"I understand the feeling that someone is doing something to themselves, so why do the rest of us have to pay? But our job is to save lives, period.\" \n He started hearing more of the frustration amid an overdose spike in the Cincinnati area that saw 174 reported overdoses within six days last month. And the outbreaks continue, with seven overdose deaths Saturday in the Cleveland area. \n Synan said unlike with repeat heroin overdosers, he has never had members of the public say he shouldn't try to save a habitual drunk driver after an auto accident or someone who has repeatedly attempted suicide. \n Marion, Ohio, Fire Capt. Wade Ralph said heroin has an \"extremely expensive\" toll on his department, struggling to keep up while being understaffed and relying on donations from health organizations for naloxone to revive those who overdose. \n \"There's a human factor to that that some people, I think, just forget about or maybe they ignore it and say, 'Hey screw it, let them die.' I'm like, you can't do that. We have people here, we have guys at the firehouse, whose kids have been hooked on stuff like that,\" said Ralph, whose city of some 37,000 people was hit last year by 30 overdose hospitalizations and two deaths in a 12-day stretch. \n In the Cincinnati area, first responders have held the death toll to what appears to be low double digits, pending lab results. The spreading practice of mixing heroin with the powerful painkiller fentanyl or with carfentanil, so strong it's used to tranquilize elephants, has resulted in frequent needs for multiple doses of naloxone. \n \"If they weren't doing their job, they'd all be dead,\" said Christel Brooks, a recovering addict in Cincinnati who said she's been clean for 12 years now. She said the problem is lack of treatment facilities and other resources for intervention before rescued addicts resume drug use. \n Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Fire Chief Jay Delaney wrote this year to federal and state lawmakers for funding for the naloxone, expecting to administer doses this year worth about $10,000 to $11,000 at $40 each. \n \"Whether a firefighter is saving one from a burning building or administering Narcan, you're still saving that human being's life, so that's a big deal to us,\" said Delaney, whose department has received grant money this year but needs a steady funding answer. \"We never thought \u2026 that we would have so many that we would have to deal with so it became a funding crisis.\" \n Lawrence, Massachusetts, police last week released cellphone video of an overdosed mother lying in a store aisle while her toddler daughter tried to revive her before paramedics arrived and did so. \n Family Dollar clerk Nicaurys Anziani, who called 911, told The Eagle-Tribune newspaper she felt terrible for the little girl, who \"was just crying and crying and crying.\" \n Police said they hoped sharing the video will alert people to the consequences of drug use that they see on the front lines, as East Liverpool police explained about their photo of the overdosed couple with a child. \n Ron Calhoun, an anti-drug activist in northern Kentucky, disputes suggestions he hears often that reviving people with naloxone is enabling heroin use. \n \"The only thing Narcan enables is breathing,\" he responds. \"We just want to keep them alive and get them into treatment.\" \n He said one young woman he knows had been revived 15 times with naloxone. \n \"And today, she's in rehab,\" Calhoun said. \"Corpses don't do well in rehab.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Just say no to Narcan?

In the same article, the 30-year-old real estate developer talks up his millions, showcases his penthouse apartment and Cadillac, and allows a reporter to tag along as he visits job sites and lunches at the \"21\" club before hopping an evening flight to California for more deal-making. \n So much for that shy-guy claim. \n Young and ambitious, Trump worked just as hard at building his image as he did at expanding his real estate empire. \n Along the way, he honed the communications skills that would benefit him at the negotiating table, turn him into a reality TV star and launch a presidential campaign. \n He'll put them to the ultimate test as he goes one-on-one with Hillary Clinton in three nationally televised debates over the next month that will help determine the next president. \n Trump, who'd never participated in a debate before the presidential primaries, is keeping his preparations for Monday's leadoff general-election debate low key \u2014 no mock face-offs or the like. \n \"Really, you're preparing all of your life for these,\" he told Fox Business Network recently. \"You're not preparing over a two-week period and cramming.\" \n Is he ready? \n Experts on public speaking find all kinds of faults with Trump's oratory: His vocabulary is juvenile, his syntax is jumbled, he's casual about accuracy, he's demeaning, his voice is thin and nasal, he's weak on policy details and more. \n And yet, Aaron Kall, who directs the University of Michigan's Debate Institute and debate team, will venture to tell you this: \"He performs like a maestro.\" \n \"He's a media natural,\" says Kall, who edited a book about Trump's primary debate performances. \"He really understands audiences and tailors a message to what he thinks that they want to hear.\" \n Trump inherited a flair for promotion from his father. \n Fred Trump, who built homes and apartments in Brooklyn and Queens, used all sorts of gimmicks to sell his properties: He filled the scoop of a bulldozer with women in bikinis. He released balloons on Coney Island containing $50 discount coupons. He dressed up apartment building lobbies with bird cages. \n From the beginning, his son Donald never passed up an opportunity to be on camera. \n Long before NBC's \"The Apprentice\" turned Trump into a reality TV star in 2004, he was advancing his biz-whiz image in TV and movie cameos, chatting up Howard Stern on the radio and filming ads for Pizza Hut, McDonald's and more. Then, over 14 seasons of \"The Apprentice\" and \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" he sharpened his ability to work the camera, think on his feet and promote the Trump brand. \n As a presidential candidate, he's drawn on those same skills to keep himself in the news, dishing out provocations and insults sure to guarantee the public's attention. \n \"Across his history, he evolved from a builder to a brand,\" says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. \"He would not be successful were it not for his ingenuity at securing publicity.\" \n A big question heading into Monday's leadoff debate in Hempstead, New York, is which Trump will turn up on stage \u2014 the bombastic name-caller who dominated stages for most of the primary season or the more disciplined candidate of late who marveled during the final Republican debate, \"I can't believe how civil it's been up here.\" \n Voters looking for a smackdown may be disappointed. \n Kall says that because a key question for voters is whether Trump has the right temperament to be president, the Republican nominee needs to put the bluster on hold and offer a measured, thoughtful debate performance in which he shows a command of policy detail. \n Trump faltered on policy questions at times during the primary debates. At one point he appeared unfamiliar with the concept of the nuclear triad, which includes intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles and strategic bombers. On another occasion, he seemed unaware China was not part of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. \n Lillian Glass, an expert on speaking and body language, said Trump needs to be \"completely focused on what is discussed and not talk about himself and how great his business was and what he did in the past. We know. We all know. Now, it's time to focus on the issues.\" \n There's also Trump's voice to consider. \n Ruth Sherman, a public speaking coach, says the public has grown so accustomed to Trump over the decades that people give him a pass on what she says is a poor speaking voice. \n \"He doesn't get criticized for the quality of his speaking voice but he should,\" she says. \"It's a thin voice. It's not smooth. It's somewhat nasal.\" \n Plenty of critics have highlighted the GOP nominee's banal vocabulary \u2014 heavy on \"great,\" \"amazing,\" \"stupid,\" \"dumb,\" \"bad\" and \"sad.\" \n \"It almost sounds at times as if he's working from a random word generator in which there are a limited number of adjectives that are repeatedly used,\" says Jamieson. \n But a big part of Trump's appeal is his knack for simplification, skipping over the nuances of complex problems to dangle the promise of easy solutions. \n Trump may find that it was easier to pull that off on a crowded debate stage than it will be facing just Clinton, who is sure to try zero in on missing elements and policy gaps. \n Dan Schnur, director of the University of Southern California's political institute and a veteran of John McCain's 2000 presidential campaign, says of Trump: \"For all his bombast, he must know that 90 minutes toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton doesn't leave him much margin for error.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Nancy Benac on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/nbenac \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n What political news is the world searching for on Google and talking about on Twitter?

{"date": "September 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In March 2016, Hillary Clinton said, \"I am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama.\" Yet her first public speech was a star-making one, landing her in a Life magazine write-up at the age of 21. \n NEW YORK >> Hillary Clinton has said it herself: She's not the most naturally gifted public communicator. \n \"I am not a natural politician, in case you haven't noticed, like my husband or President Obama,\" she said in March. \n Yet her first public speech was a star-making one, landing her in a Life magazine write-up at the tender age of 21. She was a senior at Wellesley, the first student chosen to address a commencement there. Unhappy with the words of the U.S. senator invited to speak before her, she parried with an unplanned rebuke, before launching into her prepared remarks. It was unscripted and rather audacious \u2014 so audacious, in fact, that the president of Wellesley felt compelled to apologize to the senator. \n \"Courtesy is not one of the stronger virtues of the young,\" wrote Ruth Adams, in a letter recently unearthed by The Washington Post. \"Scoring debater's points seems, on occasion, to have higher standing.\" \n Nearly 50 years later, Clinton is facing the most important debates of her life as she squares off against Donald Trump beginning Monday \u2014 three high-stakes contests that could set the momentum for the remainder of the presidential campaign. \n What kind of communicator has she become in those years since Wellesley, the last 30 or so in the public eye? That first speech is significant, says Kathleen Hall Jamieson, of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, because it shows how even a college-age Clinton was able to think on her feet and jump on the moment \u2014 a key asset in a debate. \n Clinton also showed, and has honed for years, a propensity to engage the other side, to argue and counter-argue like a lawyer, Jamieson says \u2014 not surprising, since her next stop after Wellesley was a law degree at Yale. \n But along with those and other obvious strengths \u2014 such as the depth of her preparation \u2014 Clinton can sound scripted, especially in contrast to her husband, a gifted empathizer. \"'I feel your pain' \u2014 that was a joke line about Bill Clinton, but some people have to work harder at it than others,\" Jamieson says. \"It was more natural for Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton than it is for Hillary Clinton.\" \n She's also known to be guarded. \"People who support her say she is thoughtful,\" says Jamieson. \"Those who oppose her say she is hiding something. But she adds that there's good historical reason for Clinton to watch her words. \n \"She's been burned by statements that were taken to mean something she didn't necessarily intend, like her famous 1992 'cookies and teas' remark,\" which Jamieson says was \"taken egregiously out of context.\" \n Then, of course, there's the persistent description of Clinton \"lecturing\" \u2014 or worse, \"yelling.\" Many counter that this particular description is inextricably wound up in gender perceptions. (One commentator, Mark Rudov, said on Fox News in 2008 that when candidate Obama spoke, \"Men hear, 'Take off for the future,' and when Hillary Clinton speaks, men hear, 'Take out the garbage.\"') \n \"I don't think one can talk about anything related to Hillary Clinton where gender is not (a factor), whether it's conscious or not,\" says Deborah Tannen, professor of linguistics at Georgetown University. \n \"What you constantly hear about is her yelling,\" Tannen says. \"But of course, candidates all yell. They have to.\" That famous 2004 Howard Dean yell was a rare occasion when a male candidate was called out for it, she notes. \n Tannen says Clinton \u2014 like other women in authority \u2014 is subject to a \"double bind,\" meaning whatever she does is going to violate either expectations for how a woman should speak, or how a leader should. \n In other words, for a female candidate, appearing tough and empathetic at the same time is a challenge. Biographer Gail Sheehy says that during Clinton's 2008 presidential race, her campaign emphasized the toughness, so that she would be taken seriously \u2014 especially by the military \u2014 as a potential commander in chief. \n \"She won that battle,\" Sheehy says, \"but in the process it obscured her nurturing qualities \u2014 her ability to understand and relate to people who are vulnerable. We've seen that ability in her actions throughout her whole life \u2014 but even today she has a hard time conveying it.\" \n One of Clinton's most admired moments as a public speaker came in 1995, when, as first lady, she addressed the U.N. World Conference on Women in Beijing and made the powerful declaration that \"human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights.\" But Sheehy also points to a very different moment as memorable for Clinton \u2014 the 2008 \"coffee shop moment\" in New Hampshire, where Clinton's voice shook and she seemed near tears as she spoke of her goals for the country. \n \"She allowed herself to show a little vulnerability \u2014 in spite of herself \u2014 and wow, women all over the place related to her,\" Sheehy says. \"The problem is that today, there isn't very much 'we' in the way she speaks. We don't feel like she's having a conversation with us.\" In the debates, Sheehy suggests, Clinton might do well to inject some humor where she can, to portray accessibility. \n Some feel Clinton shouldn't have to be worrying about that at all. \n Why, wonders feminist blogger Andi Zeisler, isn't it enough for Clinton simply to show her qualifications for the job? When did it become, she asks, about being the candidate you can have a beer with \u2014 or who can dance with Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show? \n \"That's not the person I want to see, and that's certainly not who she wants to be,\" Zeisler says. \"I think she's from a time when you weren't SUPPOSED to have a beer with your president. They were supposed to be too busy and too smart.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Jocelyn Noveck on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/jocelynnoveckap \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n What political news is the world searching for on Google and talking about on Twitter?

What some of the women told The Associated Press about their experiences: \n \u2014\u2014 \n KIM JUNGAH, 40, chose to be trafficked because she could no longer endure poverty and malnutrition in the North. \n \"I thought about killing myself many times but it wasn't easy to do it. For me, escaping from North Korea was the only way to survive,\" she said. \n Before she was sold to a farmer in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang who paid 20,000 yuan ($2,990), Kim said potential buyers visited her and that brokers ordered her to stand up, turn around and show her profile. \n \"I felt so bad about that. I felt so humiliated and I realized they didn't see me as human being,\" she said. \n Kim said she was pregnant when brokers sold her to the Shenyang man, who eventually adopted her daughter. \n \"There aren't any mother and daughter who are separated like us. I'm demanding a simple thing. I'm demanding the parental rights that that every couple in the world has,\" she said. \n \u2014\u2014 \n KIM, 35, asked to be identified only by her surname. She allowed a stranger in China to marry her off with one of his friends, 14 years her senior, without knowing it was meant to clear the man's debt. \n \"When I first saw him (my husband), he really looked like a grandpa. He was like a country man who didn't care about his appearance at all \u2026 How can a man in his 30s look like a grandpa? I thought he was lying about his age,\" she said. \"I felt really bad and cried.\" \n She said her husband beat her about once a month and looked down on her so much. \n \"He always told me he brought a beggar-like person to his house \u2026 and threatened to report me to police to get me punished,\" she said. \"Do you know how intimidating that threat was to me?\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n PARK KYUNG-HWA, 44, offered herself to traffickers but escaped before being sold to a Chinese man. \n \"I had just prayed for meeting a good husband,\" she said. \"The women sold as brides were the people who belonged to the lowest class in the North. Our dreams were like eating rice fully and we had heard that even dogs and animals in China ate rice,\" she said. \n Park said she and six other women were on the back of a big truck loaded with logs for about 12 hours when brokers were moving them. \n \"If one log fell, we would have died all \u2026 We all cried. It was miserable \u2026 We held each other's' hands and sang together,\" she said. \n \u2014\u2014 \n CHAE OKHEE, 48, lived in China for about 16 years. She wasn't a trafficking victim but has many friends and relative living in Seoul who had been sold as brides to Chinese men before their arrivals to South Korea. \n \"One of my friends told me her Chinese husband had put her leg in the shackles to prevent her from going out,\" Chae said. \n She said her 25-year-old niece from North Korea had also lived with a Chinese man with \"a little bit of autism\" before she fled to South Korea in 2014. \n \"She said she wasn't beaten by her husband but she ran away wearing only underwear in the middle of night in collaboration with brokers,\" Chae said. \"She came here because she didn't want to live with him.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "North Korean defectors who became Chinese brides end silence"}

{"date": "September 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A woman passes the ship's bell from the USS Utah at the entrance to Tomich Hall on the grounds of the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Medal of Honor belonging to sailor Peter Tomich is displayed in the entrance to Tomich Hall on the grounds of the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I. Tomich was awarded the medal after giving his life while saving his shipmates aboard the USS Utah during the attack on Pearl Harbor. \n NEWPORT, R.I. >> A Navy chief who died saving his shipmates during the attack on Pearl Harbor has been reunited, in spirit, in Rhode Island with the bell from his ship. \n The hall where the Navy's senior enlisted-leaders study in Newport is named for Chief Peter Tomich; his picture and a Medal of Honor are displayed in the entryway of the Senior Enlisted Academy, part of the U.S. Naval War College. The bell from the ship on which Tomich served, the USS Utah, was recently put on display at the academy. \n One of the students who stopped to admire the new arrival, Senior Chief James Werner, said, \"I feel like it's at home, where it belongs.\" \n The Utah was torpedoed by Japanese aircraft in Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. Though the ship was capsizing, Tomich stayed below deck to make sure sailors had left their stations and the boilers were secure. Another, Fireman John Vaessen, remained at his station to keep the lights running as long as possible. \n Sailors who were on the water's surface heard knocking from within the overturned ship's hull and rescued another 10 men who were trapped within, the last being Vaessen, according to the Navy. Tomich was posthumously awarded the medal. The Navy says 64 men died and 461 men survived. \n The bell was likely removed from the ship before the war began, which is why it wasn't damaged, said Jay Thomas, of the Naval History and Heritage Command. It was common practice then to remove nonessential or valuable items from ships and store them. \n Years later, the Navy loaned the Utah's bell to the University of Utah for its Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps building. \n There are few artifacts associated with Tomich or the Utah, and the bell \"provides a connection with that story in a way that nothing else can,\" said Thomas, the assistant director for collection management. \n Tomich was born in in 1893 in Prolog, in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the Croatian border. He immigrated to the United States in 1913 and enlisted in the U.S. Army in New York. He became a U.S. citizen. \n After serving during World War I, he joined the Navy in 1919. \n The Utah has been called the \"forgotten ship\" of Pearl Harbor. It was moored on the far side of the island, away from the front-line battleships, because it had been converted from a battleship to a target ship for use in the practice of bombing operations with dummy bombs. \n The academy's director, Command Master Chief Richard Curtis, said he envisioned having a ship's bell to be displayed at the schoolhouse in October. He thought nothing would be more fitting than the Utah's bell, so he looked online and discovered it was in Utah. \n Curtis asked to borrow it so it could remind students what it means to lead and the sacrifices sometimes required. \n \"They should take pause at why that bell is standing there in front of the academy charged with teaching leadership, in a hall named after a man who gave his life to lead,\" he said. \n The bell and its steel bracket, weighing more than 500 pounds, were sent to Rhode Island in late August. The bell is on display until April, during which time more than 600 of the military's senior enlisted leaders will see it, Curtis said. International service members also study at the academy. \n The bell will be sent for a conservation assessment before it is loaned back to the University of Utah. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "WWII Navy chief reunited, in spirit, with his ship's bell"}

{"date": "September 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this frame grab from video, taken Sept. 14, 2016, Sarah Gray with her son Callum, 6, and infant daughter Jocelyn in their Washington home. Callum's identical twin Thomas died of a birth defect when he was just 6 days old, and the family donated Thomas' eyes, liver and umbilical cord blood for medical research. Now Gray has written a book about her unusual journey to find out if that donation really made a difference, revealing a side of science laymen seldom glimpse. \n WASHINGTON >> An ultrasound showed one of Sarah Gray's unborn twins was missing part of his brain, a fatal birth defect. His brother was born healthy but Thomas lived just six days. Latching onto hope for something positive to come from heartache, Gray donated some of Thomas' tissue for scientific research \u2014 his eyes, his liver, his umbilical cord blood. \n Only no one could tell the Washington mother if that precious donation really made a difference. So Gray embarked on an unusual journey to find out, revealing a side of science laymen seldom glimpse. \n \"Infant eyes are like gold,\" a Harvard scientist told her. \n \"I don't think people understand how valuable these donations are,\" said Gray, who hadn't either until her years-long quest brought her face-to-face with startled scientists. They had never met a relative of the donors so crucial to their work either. \n Families often find comfort in learning how many lives were saved if they donated a loved one's organs for transplant. But donating a body for research gets less attention \u2014 there are no headline-making \"saves.\" Yet critical medical research in labs around the country depends on scientists' ability to work with human cells and organs, so they can study both normal development and how disease does its dirty work. \n \"A lot of people, if the tissue doesn't get used for transplant, they think it's kind of second-rate tissue or something. I'd like them to know that people who do research with human tissue are doing worthwhile things that are going to, hopefully, lead to cures for all kinds of diseases,\" said Dr. James Zieske, a corneal specialist at Harvard and the Schepens Eye Research Institute, whose description of treasured infant eyes spurred Gray's hunt. \n Now, hoping to help other families facing decisions about donation, Gray has written a book, \"A Life Everlasting, The Extraordinary Story of One Boy's Gift to Medical Science.\" Gray and two of the scientists she met in her quest spoke with The Associated Press about donation for research. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n NEONATAL DONATIONS OF ANY TYPE ARE RARE \n Gray's obstetrician didn't think donation was an option for a baby with this birth defect, called anencephaly. Only when Gray persisted late in pregnancy did she learn, from the Washington area's organ procurement agency, that her baby's organs probably would be too small for transplant but that donation for research was an option. \n Statistics from the United Network for Organ Sharing show that organs from a dozen newborns, those younger than a month old, were donated last year for transplant. \n On the research front, Dr. Arupa Ganguly of the University of Pennsylvania studies retinoblastoma, eye cancer that attacks young children. Before receiving Thomas' tissue, she had waited six years for donation of a healthy young retina to compare with diseased ones. \n Cells taken from younger tissue typically grow much better than an adult's, said Zieske, who could recall receiving infant corneas only two or three times in his career. Thomas' corneas were ordered to study how to repair blindness-inducing corneal damage. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n MOST ANY TISSUE CAN BE USED \n In recovering tissue from deceased donors, hospitals consult a national registry of researchers' current needs. \n On that day in 2010, Thomas died at home in his father's arms. The organ agency retrieved his body, and recovered his eyes and liver. Blood from the umbilical cords of both Thomas and his healthy identical twin Callum already had been shipped to Duke University researchers studying what causes anencephaly. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n WAS THE RESEARCH WORTHWHILE? \n Two years later, all Gray knew was where Thomas' tissue had been shipped. So during a business trip to Boston, she called the Harvard-affiliated eye lab, identified herself as a donor mom, and asked for a tour \u2014 a first for the lab, and one that changed the scientists' perspective. \n \"I still think more about, when we get a donated cornea, who that came from,\" said Zieske. \n Eventually Gray visited each lab that procured and handled Thomas' tissue. A North Carolina biotechnology company, Cytonet, uses liver cells in researching treatment for babies awaiting a liver transplant. Penn's Ganguly froze some retinal tissue for future work. \n Callum, now 6, even started coming along. \n \"We explained to him there are some special scientists there working on helping other people, and they're using some stuff from Thomas to help them,\" said his father, Ross Gray. \n \"We always get a sample but we don't see the person behind that sample. The lab has really established a bond with that family. And I think it makes the work a lot more meaningful,\" Ganguly said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE JOURNEY ISN'T OVER \n Gray changed careers to work for the non-profit American Association of Tissue Banks. That brought her to a meeting where scientists debated if it was ethical to test a new technology \u2014 gene editing \u2014 to fight inherited diseases. \"If you have the skills and the knowledge to fix these diseases then freaking do it,\" she told the group, recounting how Thomas had suffered seizures each day of his brief life. \n And when Gray recently had a new baby, daughter Jocelyn, she donated the placenta for wound-healing therapy. She'd like to visit that lab, too. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mother uncovers lasting impact of baby son's organ donation"}

{"date": "September 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This image made from video provided by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department shows Keith Scott on the ground as police approach him in Charlotte, N.C., on Sept. 20, 2016. \n CHARLOTTE, N.C. >> Newly released police video of a black man's fatal shooting, sought by protesters for days, isn't settling questions about whether the man threatened police with a gun before he was felled by a black officer. \n Police said Keith Lamont Scott had a gun, though residents have said he was unarmed. It's not apparent in the video if he's holding anything shortly before he was shot. The dramatic video released by Charlotte police shows officers with guns drawn surrounding the man just before the shooting. \n In the dashboard camera video released Saturday night, Scott could be seen slowly backing away from his SUV with his hands down. Four shots are heard in quick succession, and he crumples to the ground mortally wounded. \n After the police vehicle dashboard camera and police body-cam videos were released, a fifth day of protests against Scott's fatal shooting was largely peaceful. Police blocked off downtown streets late into the night as they had throughout the day, allowing demonstrators to take over roadways without confrontations with vehicles. \n Police also released photos on Saturday of what they said was a loaded handgun found at the scene, adding it bore Scott's DNA and fingerprints. They also said Scott had marijuana. \n Relatives and their attorney said their questions aren't answered by the release of partial police video footage. \n \"There is no definitive evidence in this video as to whether or not there is an object in his hand, and if there is, what that object is,\" said Justin Bamberg, an attorney for Scott's family. \"But what we do know is that the moment Mr. Scott is shot, it appears as though he's not aggressively moving toward law enforcement; he's actually doing the opposite. He's passively stepping back.\" \n Ray Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, said some reporters had been looking into Scott's background but added that background shouldn't matter. \n \"What we know and what you should know about him is that he was an American citizen who deserved better,\" he said. \n The dashboard camera footage opens with a police car pulling up as two officers point their guns at Scott, who is inside the SUV with the doors closed and windows rolled up. Scott gets out and begins walking backward before shots are fired. \n From a different angle, newly released police body camera footage shows an officer approach with his gun drawn and another officer already pointing his gun at Scott. When Scott comes into view, his hands are at his side and he's standing beside his SUV. The body camera footage doesn't show the moment shots are fired, and Scott is next seen on the ground. \n Police Chief Kerr Putney said that Scott was \"absolutely in possession of a handgun.\" \n Police officers didn't break the law but the State Bureau of Investigation continues to pursue the case, he said. \n \"Officers are absolutely not being charged by me at this point, but again, there's another investigation ongoing,\" Putney said. \n A police narrative released along with the video gives the most complete account yet by the agency of what brought Scott to police attention. \n Two plainclothes officers in an unmarked vehicle were preparing to serve a warrant on someone else when Scott pulled up and parked next to them, according to the document. \n The officers saw Scott rolling a marijuana cigar, or blunt, though they didn't consider it a priority at first, it said. But then one of the officers saw him hold up a gun, the document states. \n \"Due to the combination of illegal drugs and the gun Mr. Scott had in his possession, officers decided to take enforcement action for public safety concerns,\" the document said. \n The narrative says Scott didn't respond to repeated commands to drop his weapon. \n Those commands aren't heard in the body camera video, which doesn't have audible sound until after the shooting. A separate video reportedly shot by Scott's wife includes audio of police demanding that the man drop the weapon, and Rakeyia Scott insisting her husband doesn't have one. \n Before the release of the video, hundreds of people had peacefully massed outside at the Charlotte police department building on Saturday afternoon chanting the name \"Keith Scott.\" They also chanted, \"No tapes, no peace\" and raised signs including one reading \"Stop Killing The Black People.\" \n Peaceful protests continued after the video release. \n The city has been on edge ever since Scott's shooting death. The demonstrations reached a violent crescendo on Wednesday before the National Guard was called in a day later to maintain order. Forty-four people were arrested after Wednesday's protests, and one protester who was shot died at a hospital Thursday. City officials said police did not shoot 26-year-old Justin Carr, and a suspect was arrested. \n The next two nights of protests were free of property damage and violence, with organizers stressing a message of peace at the end of the week. \n Charlotte is the latest U.S. city to be shaken by protests and recriminations over the death of a black man at the hands of police, a list that includes Baltimore, Milwaukee, Chicago, New York and Ferguson, Missouri. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Charlotte police release video of shooting but doubts remain"}

{"date": "September 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Syrian government forces captured a rebel-held area on the edge of Aleppo on Saturday, tightening their siege on opposition-held neighborhoods in the northern city as an ongoing wave of airstrikes destroyed more buildings. \n BEIRUT >> At least 23 civilians have been killed in renewed government airstrikes on the contested city of Aleppo, Syrian activists said Sunday, as France and Britain's Foreign Ministers raised the prospect of investigating Russia for war crimes, ahead of an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting about the spiraling violence in Syria. \n Medical workers and local officials reported airstrikes on neighborhoods throughout Aleppo's rebel-held eastern districts as an announced government offensive entered its fourth day. \n The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 23 civilians had been killed by 6 p.m. and said it expects the toll to rise. \n Ibrahim Alhaj of the Syrian Civil Defense search and rescue outfit said hospitals and rescuers have documented the deaths of 43 people so far. \n Hospitals are overwhelmed with casualties and medical workers are expecting many of the wounded to die from a lack of treatment, according to Mohammad Zein Khandaqani, a member of the Medical Council, which oversees medical affairs in the opposition areas. \n \"I've never seen so many people dying in once place,\" he said from a hospital in the city. \"It's terrifying today. In less than one hour the Russian planes have killed more than 50 people and injured more than 200.\" \n The Observatory, which relies on a network of contacts inside Syria, said earlier in the day that 213 civilians have been killed by airstrikes and shelling on opposition areas in and around Aleppo since a U.S.-Russian brokered cease-fire collapsed Monday evening. \n At the U.N., British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Russia should be investigated for war crimes following an attack on a Syrian aid convoy that claimed 20 lives, Monday. \n Johnson said that Russia's air force may have deliberately targeted the civilian convoy on Sept. 19. Russia denies involvement and instead suggests Syrian rebels or a U.S. drone were responsible. \n France's Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Russia and Iran will be guilty of war crimes if they don't pressure Syrian President Bashar Assad to stop escalating violence. \n Ayrault said an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting Sunday is a \"moment of truth\" for the U.N. \n The meeting was requested by the United States, Britain, and France, as pro-government forces extend their bombardment of the contested city of Aleppo. They are widely believed to be accompanied by Russian air strikes. \n Rebels meanwhile shelled Masyaf, a government stronghold near the central city of Hama, for the second day in a row, according to the Observatory. \n Masyaf is home to a large number of Alawites, members of President Bashar Assad's sect. Assad has rallied Syria's minorities behind his government behind fears of the Sunni-dominated rebellion. \n The U.S., Britain, and France are aligned on the Security Council against Russia and China, which back Assad in the country's protracted war, now in its sixth year. \n But a broad coalition of Syrian rebels denounced international negotiations for peace as \"meaningless,\" earlier Sunday. \n The statement released jointly by 33 factions called on the government and Russian forces to halt airstrikes and lift sieges on opposition areas. The U.N. estimates 600,000 Syrians are trapped in various sieges enforced by the government, rebels, and the Islamic State group across the country. \n \"Negotiations under the present conditions are no longer useful and are meaningless,\" the statement said. \n The factions said they would not accept to have Russia mediate any negotiations, calling it a \"partner to the regime in the crimes against our people.\" \n The statement was signed by some of the largest factions from across Syria but did not include the powerful, ultraconservative Ahrar al-Sham nor the al-Qaida-linked Fatah Sham Front. \n Efforts to revive the truce have floundered. An airstrike destroyed a U.N.-backed humanitarian convoy Monday inside opposition territory shortly after the Syrian military announced the agreement had expired. The U.N. says the attack could amount to a war crime if proven deliberate, though it has not assigned responsibility yet. The U.S. says it believes Russian jets were behind the strikes. \n Rebels Sunday retook an area in Aleppo that fell to government forces the day before, extending a punishing stalemate in the contested northern city. \n The Observatory says rebels seized Handarat, a largely uninhabited former Palestinian refugee camp, early Sunday \u2014 a day after it was lost to government forces. The camp has changed hands multiple times and is largely devastated and abandoned. \n The area is near Castello Road, a vital supply route to the city's besieged rebel-held areas. Government forces seized the Castello Road earlier this year, besieging rebel-held districts where some 250,000 people reside. \n Yasser al-Yousef, a spokesman for the Nour el-Din al-Zinki rebel faction, says rebels seized Handarat late Saturday night. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "At least 23 killed in Aleppo as UN meets over Syria"}
