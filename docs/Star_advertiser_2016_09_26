The National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for the Bay Area with record-breaking temperatures and unhealthy air expected all day. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Visitors to the Los Angeles County fair cool off under outdoor misters in Pomona, Calif. on Saturday. Californians braced today for another hot autumn day as forecasters warned of soaring temperatures and potential wildfires due to hot, dry and windy conditions. \n LOS ANGELES \u00bb An autumn heat wave sent California temperatures soaring again today, baking coastal cities that normally benefit from the cooling influence of the Pacific Ocean.  \n The mercury shot up into triple digits in downtown Los Angeles and points north and south as high pressure gripped the drought-stricken state. Most other areas were in the 90s or at least the 80s. \n \"It is 100 degrees and I have no air conditioning,\" said Samuel Steinberg, a college professor who lives on a hilltop near Occidental College in northeast Los Angeles. \"Luckily, my house is well shaded by trees.

It's too hot.\" \n In Ventura County and north along the Central Coast, several cities felt record temperatures including Oxnard, whose 105 degrees made for the hottest September day the city's ever had. \n Even infrastructure suffered. \n The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority imposed speed restrictions on some sections of its Metro Rail commuter lines to avoid damage to tracks and overhead power lines, which reached the upper range of heat tolerances. \n The high pressure also spawned Southern California's dangerous Santa Ana winds, the extremely dry and gusty blasts typical of fall that increase the risk of fast-spreading wildfires. \n But in a sign of a gradual easing of conditions, the National Weather Service canceled red flag warnings for fire danger at midafternoon. \n Several parts of the state saw record-breaking heat on Sunday as temperatures ran 10 to 25 degrees above normal for this time of the year. A record 104 degrees was set in Camarillo, about 47 miles northwest of Los Angeles, beating the old record of 102 set 38 years ago. \n San Francisco had a high of 98 degrees Sunday and temperatures in the Bay Area were in the 80s and 90s on Monday. \n For a second straight day, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District issued a Spare the Air Alert asking residents not to drive because of smog. \n North of San Francisco, crews battled a wildfire in rural Sonoma County in nearly 100-degree heat. The fire, which broke out Sunday morning near Cloverdale, spread to more than 2 square miles and forced some residents to evacuate, state fire officials said. \n \"With very dry fuels already in place, extreme fire behavior and rapid growth will be likely with any fire ignition,\" the weather service warned. \n On San Diego Bay, schools in the city of Coronado were on a minimum-day schedule Monday. School officials said classes would end at 12:30 p.m. because many of the island's classrooms are not air-conditioned. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "California bakes in triple-digit autumn heat wave"}

{"date": "September 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton smiles as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during the presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., today. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Donald Trump's habit of peddling hype and fabrication emerged unabated in the first presidential debate while Hillary Clinton played it cautiously in her statements, though not without error. They both denied making statements that they are on the record as saying. \n A look at some of the claims in the debate and how they compare with the facts: \n His first known public comment on the topic came on Sept. 11, 2002, when he was asked whether he supported a potential Iraq invasion in an interview with radio host Howard Stern. \"Yeah, I guess so,\" Trump responded. \n On March 21, 2003, just days after the invasion began, Trump said it \"looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.\" \n Later that year he began voicing doubts. \n Trump's tax cuts would increase the deficit by $5.3 trillion over 10 years, the group found, while Clinton's proposals would boost the deficit by $200 billion. Those increases are on top of an already-projected increase of about $9 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. By 2026, debt held by the public would total $23.3 trillion under Clinton's plans, and $28.4 trillion under Trump. \n Under former chairman Ben Bernanke and current chairwoman Janet Yellen, the Fed has attracted controversy by pegging the short-term interest rate it controls to nearly zero for seven years. After one increase in December, it is still ultra-low at between 0.25 percent and 0.5 percent, a rate that some economists worry could spark a stock-market bubble or inflation. Bernanke was initially appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, and reappointed by President Barack Obama. \n One reason Yellen is keeping rates low is that, in some ways, she agrees with Trump that hiring needs to keep growing to provide jobs for Americans who want them. \n They would provide vital information about his wealth, taxes paid, tax avoidance efforts, exact amounts of real estate holdings and charitable donations that can't be gleaned from any other source. For these reasons, every major party candidate for the last 40 years has released at least a few years of recent tax returns. \n Clinton flip-flopped into opposing the trade deal in the Democratic primary when facing Bernie Sanders, who was strongly opposed to it. \n He tweeted in January 2014: \"Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!\" \n Trump has declined to provide the IRS' formal notice of audit to The Associated Press and other news outlets. And former IRS officials have expressed skepticism that anyone would be audited so frequently. Trump cites an audit as the reason he won't release his tax returns. \n Under her plan, the government would pay for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities for students from families earning less than $125,000 a year. That would leave students still bearing the cost of room and board, which makes up more than half of the average $18,943 sticker price at a four-year public university, according to the College Board. \n Experts worry about other effects: Will colleges raise tuition once the government starts paying, increasing the cost to taxpayers? Will more students flock to public colleges because of the subsidy, also raising costs? \n Trump and his father fiercely fought a 1973 discrimination lawsuit brought by the Justice Department for their alleged refusal to rent apartments in predominantly white buildings to black tenants. Testimony showed that the applications filed by black apartment seekers were marked with a \"C\" for \"colored.\" A settlement that ended the lawsuit did not require the Trumps to acknowledge that discrimination had occurred. The government's description of the settlement said Trump and his father had \"failed and neglected\" to comply with the Fair Housing Act. \n Trump was wrong to say the suit was brought against many real estate developers \u2014 it was specific to buildings rented by his father and him. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fact Check: Trump, Clinton deny their own words in debate"}

Garcia, is being held pending an initial court appearance on murder, robbery, burglary and weapon charges in the Sunday shooting death of a 41-year-old man at a Starbucks coffee shop in Las Vegas. \n LAS VEGAS \u00bb A Starbucks customer described terrified people dropping to the floor and sobbing after a gunman parked his car and entered the Las Vegas store, shooting a man inside. \n Customer Medin Gebrezgier told police and a television reporter that he saw the gunman, identified today by police as Pedro Jose Garcia, fire twice into the ceiling before shooting a man in the chest. \n Garcia entered the store after his payment card was declined at the drive-thru window, police said. \n \"Terror, it was just terror. We were afraid,\" Gebrezgier told KVVU-TV. He described people crying and hitting the floor when shots were fired a little before 11:30 a.m. Sunday. \n \"We didn't know what was going to happen next. I had no idea what to do,\" he said. \"I heard about this stuff on TV and movies, but it was all the way real.\" \n Garcia, 34, was jailed pending a court appearance on murder, robbery, burglary and weapon charges following his arrest at the Starbucks in a commercial center several miles west of the Las Vegas Strip. \n Despite witness accounts that Garcia was unable to make a purchase, a motive for the shooting remained unclear, police Officer Larry Hadfield said. The victim wasn't identified as a coffee shop employee. \n \"They're investigating whether there was any connection between Garcia and the victim,\" said Hadfield, a department spokesman. \n The name of the 41-year-old man who was pronounced dead at a hospital wasn't immediately made public by the Clark County coroner. \n More than a dozen people were in the store at the time of the shooting, police Lt. Dan McGrath said. \n Starbucks employee Tenaya Zimmerman jumped out the drive-thru window when shots were fired, her mother, Kim Plank, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \n A message left today by The Associated Press at a telephone number associated with Gebrezgier wasn't immediately returned. A call to a number associated with Plank went to an incorrect number. No number was immediately found for Zimmerman. \n McGrath said Garcia tried to blend in and elude police at the scene by calling 911 and describing someone else as the shooter. He was arrested after witnesses identified him to officers arriving to what police initially thought was a hostage situation. \n Parts of the shopping center were evacuated for about two hours while a bomb squad examined a backpack in the Starbucks that Garcia allegedly said contained a bomb. \n Hadfield said there was no device, but police said a .22-caliber handgun was found in the coffee shop. \n Garcia served time in federal and Nevada state prisons for convictions on stolen vehicle, battery, attempted theft, drug and weapon charges, according to court and prison records that showed he was released from federal custody last November. \n It wasn't immediately clear if Garcia had an attorney ahead of his initial court appearance. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Starbucks customer describes shooting: 'It was just terror'"}

She called it \"Trumped-up trickle-down economics.\" \n Her efforts to needle Trump were successful in drawing an angry response from the temperamental GOP nominee, but he also repeatedly put Clinton on the defensive. He painted her as a hopeless bureaucrat who led the country into disastrous trade deals, failed to stop China and Mexico from stealing American jobs and shifted her agenda to suit her ambitions. \n Not even a half-hour into the debate, Clinton was urging voters to go to her website for fact checks, warning that Trump was misleading them as he talked over her to accuse Clinton of decades of failure in leadership. \n \"I have a feeling by the end of this debate I am going to be blamed for everything that ever happened,\" Clinton said. \n \"Why not?\" Trump responded. \n \"Join the debate by saying more crazy things,\" Clinton shot back. \n The debate offered voters a rare moment of focus and clarity as the vastly different styles and approaches of the two nominees were on display. \n Trump, who has notably stinted on detail throughout the race, is a pitch-perfect television performer. But his time onstage offered a chance to address his policy shortcomings while also posing a new challenge: Unlike debates during the Republican primary, when Trump shared time with more than a half-dozen rivals, he was alone onstage with Clinton, unable to recede to the background for long periods as he did during the GOP contest. \n He responded to Clinton's charges about his economic plans with uncharacteristically sharp policy arguments. He peppered his blunt talk about foreign governments taking advantage of the U.S. with details about value-added taxes and policy at the Federal Reserve. \n But he also did not shy away from some of his more colorful lines and throughout his history in business. \n When Clinton accused Trump of being \"one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis\" because it would help his business, Trump replied, \"That's called business.\" \n When Clinton accused Trump of calling climate change a hoax, Trump objected that she was mischaracterizing his past remarks, but he also launched into a blistering critique of Obama administration energy policy. He cited the bankruptcy of solar company Solyndra, which was heavily subsidized by the federal government. \n \"We invested in a solar company, our country, that was a disaster,\" he said. \n Trump deflected persistent questions about whether he would release his tax returns by claiming he was under audit, something he has repeatedly said prevented him from disclosure. Lester Holt, the moderator, pointed out that there was no prohibition on Trump releasing his tax returns during an audit. \n Trump finally said he would release them, over the advice of his attorneys to keep them private, if Clinton would release 33,000 emails she deleted from the private server she used when she was secretary of state. \n Clinton then went on the offensive, accusing Trump of having something to hide and suggesting a number of possibilities: He is not as wealthy as he says; he is not as charitable as he says; he has financial conflicts of interest he does not want to disclose; or he is not paying any income taxes. \n \"That makes me smart,\" Trump said, interrupting Clinton. \n Trump's business record dominated a large portion of the debate, with Clinton eager to engage. \n Trump recounted his success, including what he said was hundreds of millions of dollars in income last year, \"not to be braggadocios,\" he said. \n Clinton pointed to his many business bankruptcies and to stories that he had stiffed contractors. \n \"I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you,\" Clinton said. \n Trump said he was simply taking advantage of the laws and making sure he did not pay for substandard work. \n \"It's all words. Its all sound bites,\" he said, trying to build his case that Clinton was just another politician. \"I built an unbelievable company.\" \n It was unclear whether Trump's performance put to rest the concerns voters continue to have about how his unfiltered and inflammatory statements and shallow policy platform would play in the Oval Office. \n This first debate of the fall general election campaign was preceded by a Super Bowl-level of hype and the audience for the 90-minute session was expected to approach that of the nation's biggest annual television gathering, with perhaps as many as 100 million viewers tuning in. \n History shows that debates tend to reinforce pre-existing perceptions rather than move a mass of voters or cause a significant number to change their minds and switch support. \n Still, in a competitive contest between two candidates who evince passionately held views \u2014 both positive and negative \u2014 the prospect of a direct, face-to-face confrontation produced one of the most widely anticipated political events in memory. The event fell just over six weeks before election day Nov. 8. \n Adding to the drama was the asymmetric nature of the confrontation. \n Clinton, who has spent the better part of four decades in public life, was unquestionably the better-versed in matters of policy and substance. But a large swath of the public views her with suspicion and questions her honesty and openness. \n The challenge for Clinton was to allay those concerns in the relatively brief time allotted and forge the sort of empathetic connection that came so naturally to her husband, Bill Clinton, the former president, but has largely eluded the former first lady throughout her political career. \n Much of the pre-debate focus fell on the moderator, NBC's Lester Holt, and whether he would fact-check the candidates or leave the two to point out each other's falsehoods or hyperbole. Holt generally avoided doing the kind of real-time fact checks that some of the more aggressive moderators attempted during primary debates. Often as he moved to interject, he was drowned out by the candidates arguing. \n Clinton entered the debate in the stronger political position, holding a consistent lead in most national surveys and, more significant, an advantage in the route to 270 electoral college votes. \n The two major independent candidates, Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party's Jill Stein, were excluded from the debate stage, having failed to meet the level of support in polls that was set by the debate organizers as a threshold to participate. \n Clinton and Trump are scheduled to debate twice more, on Oct. 9 in St. Louis and Oct. 19 in Las Vegas. \n Their running mates, Democratic Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, are set to debate a single time, Oct. 4 in Farmville, Va. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n (Barabak reported from San Francisco, Halper from Washington and Finnegan from Hempstead, N.Y.

Six health clinics are working with the Chicago food bank to host a mobile pantry filled with fresh produce. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Carmelita Dorsey looked at fresh fruits and vegetables inside a refrigerator truck at Oak Forest Health Center in Oak Forest, Ill. on Sept. 22. Six health clinics are working with the Chicago food bank to host a mobile pantry filled with fresh produce. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Volunteers handed out fresh produce to a woman inside a refrigerator truck at Oak Forest Health Center in Oak Forest, Ill. on Sept. 22. Six health clinics are working with the Chicago food bank to host a mobile pantry filled with fresh produce. \n OAK FOREST, Ill. \u00bb The idea is simple: Load fresh fruits and vegetables into a refrigerator truck and drive it to a health clinic, then have a doctor write a \"prescription\" for food to improve the diets of low-income people with diabetes and high blood pressure. \n U.S. food banks \u2014 the organizations on the front lines of fighting hunger \u2014 increasingly are promoting \"food as medicine\" strategies designed to address, not exacerbate, the high rate of chronic health problems among the poor. \n One-third of households using food banks are feeding a family member with diabetes, and 58 percent have a family member with high blood pressure, according to a recent survey by Feeding America, a national network of 200 food banks. Meanwhile, 55 percent of people identify fresh fruits and vegetables as the foods they most desire but aren't receiving from their food pantry. \n \"I'm on a very limited income,\" said James Cline, who has diabetes and gets by on $700 a month living with his mother in suburban Chicago. Disabled after an all-terrain vehicle accident, the 53-year-old former loading dock worker knows he should eat more fresh produce. But the cost of a nutritious diet can be out of reach, so he took his doctor's advice and showed up for a recent produce giveaway at Oak Forest Health Center. \n \"It helps a lot,\" he said. \n Since August 2015, six Chicago-area clinics have hosted 26 \"Fresh Truck\" visits by the Greater Chicago Food Depository, providing more than 100,000 pounds of fresh fruit and vegetables to more than 3,200 households. \n Nationally, 30 food banks are working directly with health care providers to identify low-income patients who sometimes run out of food. In Idaho, doctors in Boise and Caldwell plan to add small food pantries to their offices. In Delaware, pediatricians write \"prescriptions\" for fresh produce; a family can get up to 25 pounds each month distributed by the local food bank at clinics. Two hospitals, in Alabama and Florida, collaborated with a Gulf Coast food bank to offer free lunches during the summer to children with hospitalized relatives. \n \"Food banks are trying to do better by providing fewer starches and carbs and more lean proteins, fruits, vegetables and whole grains,\" said Dr. Hilary Seligman, senior medical adviser for Feeding America. \"The nutritious foods that are expensive for our clients are also expensive for food banks. We're figuring out how we can do this and do it better.\" \n Seligman is leading a clinical trial to measure if food banks can help people with diabetes improve their blood sugar levels through education and tailored food packages. Researchers have enrolled 572 food pantry clients in Detroit, Houston and Oakland, California. Results are expected in 2018. \n \"If this works, we'll spread it across the Feeding America network, and if it doesn't, we'll try something else,\" Seligman said. \n Food banks, whose supplies are stocked through purchases and food donations, have hired dietitians to teach classes. Some are barring donations of sweets. \n \"We don't accept candy. We don't accept soda,\" said Kim Turner of the Delaware Food Bank. \"We want to make sure the foods we're giving to low-income people are the best nutrition possible.\" \n Food banks distributed 1.25 billion pounds of fresh produce from July 2015 through June this year. \n \"That's double what it was five years earlier,\" said Ross Fraser of Feeding America, adding that food banks rescue perishable fruits and vegetables with \"cosmetic issues\" otherwise headed for the trash. \"Produce that is too small, too big, too round or not round enough.\" \n Growers have answered the call, said Idaho Food Bank CEO Karen Vauk. \n \"Boy, did they respond,\" Vauk said. \"We have certainly been overwhelmed by the increase in produce. Most of it is right out of the field. And it's not all potatoes. It's peaches and plums. Beautiful produce.\" \n On Thursday, Cline showed a visitor the bananas, onions, cantaloupe, potatoes, kale and other produce in the box he was taking home. \n \"It's a big help,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Doctors 'prescribe' fresh produce with help from food banks"}

Eugene Caughey, 46, was found Sunday at his off-base home in Colorado Springs, city police said. \n Authorities haven't said how he died. \n Caughey was relieved of his duties in June 2015 after the rape investigation began, the Air Force has said. His court-martial was scheduled for Oct. 17. \n The officers who found him dead were responding to a report of a suicide, Colorado Springs police Sgt.

The unit operates military communications and weather satellites, as well as global positioning system satellites, which have broad civilian and military uses. \n Caughey was accused of raping a woman in late 2014 or early 2015. He was also charged with adultery, indecent filming or photography, dereliction of duty and conduct unbecoming an officer. \n Prosecutors accused him of photographing his exposed genitals while in uniform and groping women twice. \n His civilian attorney, Ryan Coward, said Caughey was looking forward to his day in court and had been participating in his defense. \n \"I think this surprised everybody,\" Coward said, adding that his client had served honorably for 20 years. \"This is just a very tragic event that occurred for him and his family.\" \n Caughey's family had no comment, Coward said. \n Caughey joined the Air Force in 1993.

{"date": "September 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People waited in the hall for the presidential debate between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. today. \n HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. \u00bb With millions watching and the American presidency on the line, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are poised for a must-see showdown today, pitting the Democrat's call for steady, experienced leadership against the Republican's pugnacious promises to upend Washington. \n The 90-minute televised debate comes six weeks before Election Day and with early voting already getting underway in some states. Despite Clinton's advantages, including a sophisticated get-out-the-vote operation and a favorable electoral map, the race is exceedingly close. \n For Clinton and Trump, the first of three debates is a crucial moment to boost their standing with voters who view both candidates negatively. Clinton struggles with questions about her trustworthiness, while Trump has yet to prove to some voters that he has the basic qualifications to serve as commander in chief. \n National interest in the race has been intense, and the campaigns are expecting a record-breaking audience to watch today's event at suburban New York's Hofstra University. Both candidates were continuing intensive debate prep nearly until air time. \n Clinton aides spent the days leading up to the debate appealing for the media and voters to hold Trump to a higher standard than they believe he has faced for much of the campaign. Their concern is that if the sometimes-bombastic Trump manages to keep his cool onstage, he'll be rewarded \u2014 even if he fails to flesh out policy specifics or doesn't tell the truth about his record and past statements. \n Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said today that he was \"concerned that Trump is going to continue to lie.\" \n On the other side, Kellyanne Conway, who took over as Trump's campaign manager last month, accused Clinton's team of engaging in \"very public and very coordinated attempts to game the refs.\" She said the effort reflected worries among Clinton supporters about the Democrat's debating skills. \n Trump and Clinton have spent months tangling from afar and are divided on virtually every major issue facing the country. They're sure to face questions about domestic terrorism and police shootings given recent incidents in New York, North Carolina and elsewhere. \n The centerpiece of Trump's campaign has been a push for restrictive immigration measures, including a physical wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and an early proposal to temporarily bar foreign Muslims from coming to the U.S. But he's been less detailed about other ideas, including his plan for stamping out the Islamic State group in the Middle East, and Conway suggested he'd be similarly reticent in the debate. \n \"You will get his view of how best to defeat the enemy \u2014 without telling ISIS specifically what it's going to be,\" Conway said. \n Clinton, a former senator and secretary of state, is banking on voters seeing her as a steady hand who can build on the record of President Barack Obama, whose popularity is rising as he winds down his second term in office. She's called for expanding Obama's executive orders if Congress won't pass legislation to overhaul the nation's immigration system and for broader gun control measures. Overseas, she's called for a no-fly zone in Syria but has vowed to keep the military out of a large-scale ground war to defeat the Islamic State group. \n For Clinton, victory in November largely hinges on rallying the same young and diverse coalition that elected Obama but has yet to fully embrace her. Mook told \"CBS This Morning\" that she understands she still needs to earn voters' trust. \n \"When she's had the opportunity to talk about not just what her plans are to make a difference in people's lives, but how this campaign is really part of a lifelong mission to fight for kids and families, she's done really well,\" Mook said. \n Former President Bill Clinton planned to travel to the debate with his wife, but it was unclear whether he planned to watch the event from inside the debate hall. \n Trump has tapped into deep anxieties among some Americans, particularly white, working-class voters who feel left behind in a changing economy and diversifying nation. While the real estate mogul lacks the experience Americans have traditionally sought in a commander in chief, he's banking on frustration with career politicians and disdain for Clinton to push him over the top on Election Day. \n Trump was often a commanding presence in the Republican primary debates, launching biting personal attacks on his rivals. But at other times, he appeared to fade into the background, especially during more technical policy discussions \u2014 something he'll be unable to do with just two candidates on stage. \n Clinton has debated more than 30 times at the presidential level, including several one-on-one contests against Obama in 2008 and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016. But today's contest will be her first presidential debate against a candidate from the opposing party. \n Associated Press writer Josh Lederman contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton, Trump poised for must-see debate showdown"}

Cetin is being held under a magistrate's warrant which will give Skagit County prosecutors 30 days to file charges in relation to the Cascade Mall shooting that took place on Friday evening. Five people were killed in the shooting, and Cetin is being held on a $2 million bail. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Suspected Cascade Mall shooter Arcan Cetin at Skagit County Jail in Mount Vernon, Wash. on Sept. 24, after his arrest in Oak Harbor, Wash., earlier in the evening. \n MOUNT VERNON, Wash. \u00bb The suspect accused of killing five people at a Macy's department store confessed to police, court documents said, but his motive remained a mystery today as a portrait emerged of him as a mentally troubled young man whose parents said they were trying to help him. \n Arcan Cetin, 20, appeared in court and was officially charged with five counts of first-degree premeditated murder following his arrest over the weekend for the rampage at the Cascade Mall in Burlington, north of Seattle. \n Cetin appeared to express no emotion and said only \"Yes, your honor\" when asked by a judge if he understood his rights. Bail was set at $2 million and his lawyer said nothing about his client in court and did not speak with reporters. \n The hearing followed a terrifying weekend that began Friday night when police say Cetin stormed into the mall and killed five people, leaving Burlington residents panicked for nearly 24 hours until authorities arrested him. \n Cetin, described by acquaintances as socially awkward, has a criminal record going back at least two years and one of his neighbors said he unnerved her so much that she kept a stun gun near her front door. \n Cetin after his arrest admitted when interviewed by detectives he was the man captured on security video carrying a Ruger rifle inside the mall, \"and he did bring the rifle into Macy's and shot all five victims,\" court documents released ahead of Monday's hearing said. \n He shot all five victims in one minute and left the rifle with a 25-round magazine on a cosmetics counter before fleeing, police said in court documents. Four died at the scene and one died in the hospital. \n The victims ranged in age from a teenage girl to a woman in her 90s. \n Authorities have declined to reveal details about their investigation into the motive for the shooting, but Cetin's stepfather David Marshall told reporters after the hearing that his stepson \"has mental health issues\" without elaborating. \n \"The only thing that we want to say at this time is that we both are totally devastated by what happened,\" said Marshall, who attended the hearing with Cetin's mother. \n The court documents appeared to paint a picture of Cetin's stepfather and mother trying to keep their son on track despite his suffering from an unspecified illness and criminal charges he faced for allegedly assaulting Marshall. Cetin came to the U.S. from Turkey and is a permanent legal resident, authorities have said. \n Cetin faced charges last year for allegedly assaulting his stepfather after he caught Cetin smoking marijuana inside the house, according to court records. \n He was told by a judge last December not to possess a gun but Cetin's stepfather urged the judge not to impose a no-contact order, saying his stepson was \"going through a hard time,\" the records said. \n Cetin had been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and has taken unspecified medications in the past, the records show. \n He eventually moved out of his parents' home and the stepfather told detectives after the shooting that he and his wife had helped Cetin with his rent. \n Cetin said his father bought him a laptop, according to the court documents released Monday. His mother visited him regularly at his new apartment and last saw him Wednesday, the documents said. \n Despite their falling out, Cetin ate with his stepfather on the day of the shooting before leaving around 4:30 p.m. to go to work, according to the documents. \n Less than three hours later, police said in court documents, surveillance video showed Cetin enter the mall through a fast food restaurant, walk through the shopping center and leave through the Macy's women's department exit. \n He then moved his car closer to the Macy's entrance and took a rifle out of the car's trunk, the documents said. \n Within moments, surveillance cameras in Macy's captured the shooter entering through the same women's department \u2014 this time with a rifle. \n Cetin first shot and killed a teenage girl near some clothing racks and then walked to the cosmetics counter where he shot a man and three women, the documents said. \n Cetin was arrested late Saturday in Oak Harbor, about 30 miles from the mall, by a sheriff's deputy who recognized him. Cetin's stepfather told detectives that his Ruger rifle and .22-caliber ammunition were missing, documents said. \n Police interviewed the suspect's former girlfriend and said Sunday night she \"has an employment history at Macy's, but not at the Burlington Mall location.\" They did not identify her. \n Amber Cathey, 21, lived in an apartment next to Cetin for three months and said she was so frightened of him that she kept a stun gun handy and complained to apartment management. She said she blocked him on Snapchat after he sent her a photo of his crotch. \n More details emerged Monday about the victims who police have said they will not identify until Tuesday. \n The man who was killed, Chuck Eagen, was set to retire next year after working 41 years for Boeing, his aunt Carol Thrush said in an interview. \n Thrush described Eagan, 61, as kind and generous. \n \"He traveled with Boeing all over the world, doing repairs on airplanes,\" said Thrush, 77. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police: Mall shooting suspect confessed, shot 5 in 1 minute"}

One person was in critical condition and another in serious condition, officials said. \n Houston Homicide Capt. Dwayne Ready and Interim Police Chief Martha Montalvo did not identify the man and did not have information about a motive. A bomb-squad robot examined a Porsche that police said belonged to the gunman; Texas motor vehicle records in a commercially available database showed the car is licensed to Nathan DeSai at an address in the condo complex. \n The property manager of the condo complex also confirmed that police were going through DeSai's residence, where Ready said vintage military items dating to the Civil War and other guns were found in the man's apartment. \n Authorities first received reports of the shootings about 6:30 a.m., and the man began firing at officers when they arrived. The man had two legally purchased guns \u2014 a .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun and a semi-automatic rifle commonly known as a Tommy gun \u2014and an unsheathed knife, Ready said. He also noted that there were 75 spent casings at the scene, which were from officers and the gunman. \n Ready said nine officers \u2014 five with the Houston Police Department and four with two other local agencies \u2014 \"engaged the suspect who was shooting randomly at passersby as well as anybody he could put his sights on.\" \n During the shootout, one driver was shot and one of the officers \"left cover to take that citizen to safety while the other officers engaged the subject,\" he said. \n Mayor Sylvester Turner told KTRK-TV in Houston that DeSai was a lawyer who was \"disgruntled\" and was \"either fired or had a bad relationship with this law firm.\" But DeSai's former law partner, Kenneth McDaniel, disputed that assertion, saying they jointly closed their 12-year-old law firm in February due to economic conditions related to Houston's energy industry downturn. \n McDaniel also said he hadn't had contact with DeSai lately and that police called him this morning to check on his safety, though they didn't explain why. \n \"He went his way with his practice and I went with mine,\" McDaniel said, adding, \"All I can say it's a horrible situation. I'm sad for everyone involved.\" \n Calls placed to phone numbers connected to DeSai and his father were not immediately answered. DeSai's father, Prakash DeSai, told KTRK that his son lived in the condo complex and drives a black Porsche. He also said his son, whom he saw Sunday, was upset because \"his law practice is not going well\" and stays upset \"because of his personal problems.\" \n Perrye Turner, special agent in charge of the FBI's Houston Division, said officials don't believe the incident is tied to terrorism. \n The entrance to the condo complex, which is in southwest Houston near the affluent enclave of West University Place, was blocked off with police tape late this morning. Several cars with bullet holes and shattered windows were at a nearby strip mall. \n Jennifer Molleda and her husband live in the same condo complex as Nathan DeSai. Though she heard gunshots about 6:12 a.m. and called 911, her husband left for work. The 45-year-old called not long after, and he told her, \"I'm hit, I'm hit.\" \n After the shooting stopped at 7:15 a.m., Molleda found her husband, 49-year-old Alan Wakim, several blocks away in the parking lot of a strip mall. His Mustang had two shots that went through the windshield, and he told her that he saw a red laser beam before the shots were fired. He was taken to a hospital to be treated. \n \"He got out of his car, we hugged, we cried,\" Molleda said, adding that after she saw everything, she believes DeSai was \"aiming to kill.\" \n Molleda said she didn't know DeSai very well, and described him as quiet. \"He's a normal, average Joe,\" she said. \n Jason Delgado, the property manager of The Oaks at West University condo complex, said DeSai was involved in two recent incidents at the complex. \n In August, Delgado said, police were called after roofers working in the complex said DeSai pointed an assault-style rifle at them. He says there wasn't enough evidence to move forward with charges because the man contended he didn't point the gun at roofers. Molleda mentioned the same incident. \n Last week, DeSai became upset because of water pressure problems at his home, asked for maintenance help and expressed his displeasure in an email to the management firm that implied he'd \"intimidate his way to getting what he was asking for,\" Delgado said. \n Another witness, 30-year-old Antwon Wilson, inadvertently drove into the shooting scene after dropping off his girlfriend at work and could \"literally hear the gunfire flying.\" He managed to flee and escape injury. \n Lee Williams left his home in the neighborhood upon hearing gunshots and began directing traffic away from the condo complex, noting that people usually cut through the area to avoid some busier intersections. One car ignored him, he said, and was immediately shot at.

{"date": "September 26, 2016", "text": "The number of Hawaii public school students taking Advanced Placement exams continued to climb this year along with the number of students scoring well on the college preparatory tests, according to results released this afternoon. \n The number of students who took at least one AP exam last school year increased to 5,958 students, up by 6 percent, or 327 students, from the year before. In total, these students took 8,972 AP exams, up from 8,270 exams the previous year. \n Hawaii's year-over-year growth exceeded the national public schools average for both number of students taking exams (5.3 percent growth nationally) and total tests taken (5 percent growth nationally). \n All but one of the state's public high schools offer various AP courses, which are modeled after college classes, according to the Department of Education. Students can also take the advanced courses online through the DOE's e-School. \n The corresponding exams for the courses are scored on a five-point scale. Colleges and universities use the scores to determine if a student will receive college credit for the coursework or be allowed to skip the equivalent course once enrolled in college, a practice known as advanced placement. On the test, a 3 signifies \"qualified;\" a 4 signifies \"well qualified;\" and a 5 signifies \"extremely well qualified,\" according to the College Board, which administers the AP program. \n The number of Hawaii students scoring a 3 or higher last school year increased by more than 7 percent to 3,634 students. Nationally, the year-over-year growth was 5 percent among public school students. \n \"That significant increase is a testament to the hard work and commitment of Hawaii's students, parents, teachers, and education leaders, all of whom deserve commendation for this great achievement,\" Scott Hill, a vice president at the College Board, said in a statement. \"We will continue to partner with Hawaii educators to ensure that all students ready for the challenge of AP are able to access those opportunities.\" \n The DOE says the push behind expanding opportunities for students to take AP courses and exams is part of a range of efforts to increase college and career readiness. Over the last four years, the number of exams taken by DOE students has increased by 26 percent, while the number of passing scores has increased by 29 percent. \n \"Growth is crucial for our public schools and these results show promising systemwide improvement as we continue to raise the rigor and prepare our students for post-high school endeavors,\" schools Superintendent Kathryn Matayoshi said in a statement. \"These gains also reflect the hard work and professional development being done by our educators to prepare for and teach these college-level courses.\" \n Since 2012, the state has received grants from the U.S. Department of Education to subsidize test fees for low-income students. The DOE last year received $114,168. \n \"These grants have been a tremendous help in making sure that we are able to provide college and career readiness opportunities for all of our students,\" Matayoshi said. \"For many of them, earning college credits at no cost in high school will help with the financial burden associated with completing a post-secondary degree.\" \n ", "author": "Nanea Kalani", "title": "More Hawaii students faring well in AP college-prep courses"}
