{"date": "September 28, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n More people are seeking or casting early ballots in the critical states of North Carolina and Florida than at this point in 2012, with Hillary Clinton the likely benefactor, as early voting shows signs of surging nationwide. \n WASHINGTON >> More people are seeking or casting early ballots in the critical states of North Carolina and Florida than at this point in 2012, with Hillary Clinton the likely benefactor, as early voting shows signs of surging nationwide. \n Clinton may also benefit from an increase in ballot requests in Georgia, a traditionally Republican state where Democrats have made inroads. But Donald Trump is showing signs of strength in Iowa and parts of Maine, states won by Barack Obama in the last two presidential elections. \n The latest snapshot of ballot data offers a glimpse into a key question: How much of a vote advantage can Clinton run up before Nov. 8, when more Republicans tend to vote? Traditionally Republicans have done better initially with early mail-in ballots, before Democrats surpass them once in-person early voting begins. While the ballot sample to date remains small, Clinton so far is hitting guideposts in several battleground states compared to 2008 and 2012. \n Though preliminary, data compiled by The Associated Press suggest that advance voting could reach 40 percent of all votes cast nationally \u2014 up from 35 percent in 2012. It may also indicate a higher overall turnout in an election that has generated enormous public interest despite \u2014 or because of \u2014 the unpopularity of both major party candidates. \n In Ohio, nearly 806,000 voters had submitted absentee ballot applications. That's up from nearly 723,000 during a similar period in 2012, when a record 1.87 million early ballots ultimately were cast by mail and in person. \n In Greensboro, North Carolina, Brandon Starkes, 28, cited the state's unsuccessful bid to impose a voter ID law in his decision to vote early. The law was struck down as racially discriminatory. \n \"I want to make sure I don't have to deal with issues at the polls on Election Day,\" he said. Starkes plans to vote for Clinton. \n In-person early voting begins Thursday in Iowa, while Florida, Arizona and New Hampshire mail out ballots beginning early next month. \n In North Carolina, a must-win state for Trump, more than 69,150 ballots have been requested and 8,541 have been returned, according to AP data. That's up from 8,326 ballots returned during a similar period in 2012. \n By party, Democrats made up 40 percent of the ballots returned compared to 35 percent for Republicans. At this point in 2012, Republicans had opened a wide lead over Democrats in returned ballots, 49 percent to 32 percent, leading to Mitt Romney's narrow win that state. While Romney was boosted by older whites who voted early by mail, white voters so far have been down this year, to 82 percent from 86 percent of submitted ballots. Black voters, more likely to cast ballots in person, were higher at 12 percent. \n \"Voters appear to be listening and changing behavior in reaction to changes in laws,\" said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who runs the U.S. Election Project. \n Florida doesn't start absentee balloting until Tuesday, but already a record 2.5 million voters have requested ballots. Republicans are ahead in ballot requests, 43 percent to 38 percent. \n That's a much narrower gap than in 2008, the most recent in which comparable data was available. At that time, the Republicans held a solid lead in requests, 51 percent to 32 percent, according to data analyzed for the AP by Catalist, a Democratic firm that helped run data operations for Obama's 2008 race. Obama won the state by 2.8 percentage points. \n The 2016 improvement can't be wholly attributed to fresh Democratic enthusiasm. A change in Florida's laws meant that voters in 2014 who requested absentee ballots could automatically receive them this year. Still, Democrats welcomed early gains, saying it will free them to target more undecided voters. \n Elsewhere, Republicans showed promise. \n In Iowa, Democratic requests for ballots continued to outpace Republicans, 63,880 to 24,700. Despite the 3 to 1 advantage, that's a drop from 2012, when Democrats at this point led 119,318 to 24,909. Clinton plans to visit the state Thursday, the first day of Iowa's early voting. \n \"Democrats need to run up the score in Iowa, and so far they are not,\" said Lindsay Walters, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee. \n In Maine's rural 2nd Congressional District, requests for ballots are down 18 percent, mostly among Democrats. Trump is counting on that district's one electoral vote as part of his narrow path to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. If he succeeds, he would be the first Republican since 1992 to win the district in the mostly Democratic state. Maine and Nebraska are the only states that allocate electoral votes by congressional district. \n In Georgia, the state does not provide breakdowns of ballots by party, but overall ballot requests are up 5 percent to 82,504. \n By race, requests for ballots by whites rose to 62,732 while those from blacks were down slightly to 16,937, according to Catalist's analysis for the AP. However, Asian-Americans, who in recent elections have leaned Democratic, nearly doubled to 1,588. Hispanics were lower at 761. \n Voter modeling by Catalist found that ballots broken down by party were at similar levels to 2012. Obama lost Georgia that year by roughly 8 percentage points. That means to win the state Clinton will have to make up more ground among African-Americans and Hispanics when in-person early voting begins Oct. 17. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Early votes: High interest buoys Clinton in key states"}

{"date": "September 28, 2016", "text": "BANGKOK \u00bb Five months after his landslide election victory, Rodrigo Duterte can't stop campaigning. Yet rather than courting Filipino voters who put him into office, he's now giving out handguns and G-Shock watches to soldiers.  \n Duterte has given almost half his public addresses as president to a military audience \u2014 far more than his predecessors. The 71-year-old leader's refreshed stump speech includes promises to double troop salaries, improve health care for soldiers and secure modern equipment. \n \"Clearly he is trying to curry favor,\" said Joseph Franco, a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore who previously worked for the chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. \"Duterte is aware that toying with the AFP would be a very bad idea.\" \n Duterte's outreach to the military is drawing attention in a country where coup rumors come as regularly as monsoon rains, with political opponents warning of the risk of discontent in an army with deep-rooted links to main security ally the U.S. Ties between the nation's civilian and military leaders, long a source of conflict, are key to prolonging a period of political stability that has made the Philippines one of Asia's fastest-growing economies. \n One senator warning of a military backlash against the president is Antonio Trillanes, a staunch critic of Duterte who was jailed for more than seven years for his involvement as a naval officer in several attempted coups against former President Gloria Arroyo. \n \"The officer corps are quite wary of the statements of President Duterte \u2014 they are not happy with the direction he is taking,\" Trillanes said. \n Still, there are no signs of the kind of instability that led to a popular uprising that toppled former President Joseph Estrada in 2001. Last week, S&P Global Ratings affirmed a stable outlook on the country's BBB rating, the second-lowest investment grade, even as it noted the \"predictability of policy-making\" has diminished under Duterte. \n Duterte isn't worried about any attempts to remove him from office, in part due to his high popularity rating, National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon said in an interview. A poll in July \u2014 the latest one available \u2014 showed he enjoyed the trust of 91 percent of Filipinos. \n Esperon confirmed that the administration has received reports of plots to oust Duterte, but the groups mentioned don't have the capability to topple the government, he said. \n \"If indeed we prove that there is a destabilization attempt, in due time, we will come up with a statement,\" Esperon said. \"In my view, I don't think there's any plot from the military.\" \n The armed forces appreciates Duterte's outreach and hasn't seen any signs of unease among senior officers, spokesman Brigadier General Restituto Padilla said by phone. \n \"We feel honored that he prioritized visiting our men and installations,\" Padilla said of Duterte. \n Duterte's push for closer ties with the military comes as he leans on the police to crack down on drugs, a war that has led to thousands of deaths. The president routinely bolsters his tough-guy image with references to his tenure as mayor in the southern city of Davao, where he admitted to killing people. \n Duterte's frequent outbursts against critics of his lethal anti-drugs campaign \u2014 particularly the U.S. \u2014 have spooked investors. The Philippine peso sank to a seven-year low on Monday and stocks extended declines on Tuesday as global funds sold the nation's stocks for a 24th straight day. \n While Duterte has a tendency to contradict himself at times, his anti-U.S. rhetoric has increased after an expletive-laden tirade against President Barack Obama earlier this month prompted their first-ever meeting to be canceled. The Philippine leader has since called for an end to joint patrols in the South China Sea, and pushed for increased economic and military cooperation with China and Russia. Just this week, he said relations with the U.S. were reaching \"a point of no return.\" \n At home, Duterte has also reached out to communist rebels waging war against the government for almost five decades. He gave Cabinet posts to two political activists nominated by the National Democratic Front, the political wing of the insurgent movement, and freed more than a dozen other members ahead of peace talks that started in Oslo last month. \n \"That issue is very sentimental and emotional to the armed forces because not only resources were spent but also lives of soldiers and assets were lost,\" said Congressman Gary Alejano, who also joined a failed coup against Arroyo in 2003. \"It is dangerous because you are now allowing the enemies of the state inside your house.\" \n Duterte built an important bridge to the military establishment with the July appointment of former president and army chief Fidel Ramos as special envoy over the South China Sea dispute. Ramos, 88, played a crucial role in halting coup attempts against Arroyo and former President Corazon Aquino. \n Yet despite Ramos's pedigree, his influence as a retired general is \"persuasive at best because he had become a politician and he is not in active command,\" said Segundo Romero, professorial lecturer at the Ateneo de Manila University who used to help formulate defense policies for the government. \n \"Military disaffection with Duterte will show if he orders soldiers to participate in the drugs war, sharing the blame for extra-judicial killings with the police,\" Romero said. \"The military will also balk at a sudden shift towards China without due consultation and institutional acceptance.\"  \n Alejano, the congressman and former coup plotter, said \"only time will tell\" whether Duterte can keep the military happy or the threat of a coup will increase. \"If you have to compare the past uprisings and the reasons behind such uprisings, there are bigger issues now compared to before.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n (With assistance from Norman P.

Yuriko Koike looks over a report during an expert panel at the Tokyo Metropolitan government office in Tokyo. \n TOKYO >> An expert panel commissioned by Japan's capital city has warned that the total cost for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics could exceed $30 billion unless drastic cost-cutting measures are taken. \n The panel on Thursday said the ballooning costs reflect an absence of leadership and a lack of governance and awareness of cost control. \n The Olympic investigation panel, led by Shinichi Ueyama, a Keio University public policy professor, was launched by newly elected Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike as part of broader reforms after she raised concerns about ever-growing unofficial cost estimates and the potential burden on the city and its taxpayers. \n The report reviewed three out of seven permanent venues that Tokyo is planning to build, and proposed using existing locations rather than new facilities that could end up being white elephants. \n The estimated 3 trillion yen is more than a four-fold increase from the initial estimate at the time of Tokyo's successful bid for the games in 2013. Organizers have not released their official estimate. \n Tokyo organizing committee president Yoshiro Mori acknowledged in July, 2015 that the total cost could exceed $20 billion, doubling his unofficial estimate a year earlier. \n \"Naturally, anyone who hears these numbers is alarmed,\" Ueyama said. \n The report said facilities based on overestimated capacity for stadiums, use of unnecessarily high-grade equipment and lack of budget ceiling have driven up the scale of design and cost. \n The panel also said legacy use prospects for the big new permanent facilities are also overly optimistic considering Japan's declining population and aging society. \n To cut costs, the report proposed moving the rowing and canoeing venue away from Tokyo and renovating existing facilities for two other sports. \n Preparations for the games have been plagued by a series of scandals, including the new national stadium's high cost and design, and allegations of bribery in the bidding process. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Expert panel warns Tokyo Olympics cost could top $30 billion"}

{"date": "September 28, 2016", "text": "LOS ANGELES TIMES / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n A kindergarten class at Dorris Place Elementary School in Los Angeles in May 2015. A study presented today to a meeting of education policy officials, researchers found that pre-K educators who were prompted to expect trouble in a classroom trained their gaze significantly longer on black students, especially boys. \n For African-American boys, the presumption of guilt starts before they have entered a kindergarten classroom, new research shows.  \n In a study presented today to a meeting of education policy officials, researchers found that pre-K educators who were prompted to expect trouble in a classroom trained their gaze significantly longer on black students, especially boys, than they did on white students. \n When asked which of four videotaped children \u2014 a boy and girl who were black and a pair who were white \u2014 required their closest attention, educators black and white alike chose the study's African-American boy most frequently. The study's white boy came in a distant second and two girls \u2014 one white and one black \u2014 drew the least scrutiny from the teachers. \n But when subjects in the new study were asked to rate the severity of a child's disruptive behavior and recommend consequences for it, race played a more unexpected role: African-American pre-K educators, the study found, judged misbehavior attributed to a black child more harshly than did white educators. And they were more inclined to recommend the child's suspension or expulsion from the classroom. \n The new research, conducted by psychologist Walter S. Gilliam and colleagues at Yale University's Child Study Center, set out to explore the biases, many of them operating beneath a teacher's awareness, that may drive a troubling pattern in elementary and secondary schools across the nation: that African-American students are suspended or expelled at more than twice the rate of children of any other ethnicity. \n At the pre-K level, Gilliam found an even starker pattern in 2005. In state-funded pre-K classrooms, 3- and 4-year-olds were being kicked out of school three times as often as older students. And black children \u2014 boys mostly \u2014 were about twice as likely as Latino and white children to be expelled. \n This nursery-school \"push-out phenomenon\" does more than inconvenience parents and give naughty children a time-out away from classmates: Many researchers suspect it sets up a child early for school failure by eroding his engagement with teachers and classmates and sending the message that the student cannot be redeemed. \n At an annual conference of early care and education professionals, the authors of the new study recruited 132 pre-K educators (67 percent white, 22 percent black and 68 percent of them classroom teachers). First, researchers told the subjects they were trying to understand how teachers detect the first signs of troublesome behavior. Then, they used eye-tracking technology to measure the amount of time that subjects focused their attention on each of four children playing and working together on a videotape \u2014 a white boy, a black boy, a white girl and a black girl. \n As a group, the teachers spent more time watching the videotaped activity of the black male student than any of the others. And black teachers were even more vigilant about their young black charges than were white teachers: Compared to white study participants, black subjects spent more time gazing at black boys and less time gazing at other children. \n In the study's second part, educators read vignettes detailing a child's pattern of extremely disruptive behavior. The researchers manipulated teachers' beliefs about the child's gender and race using different names, such as DeShawn or Latoya to suggest a black boy or girl, and Jake and Emily to suggest a white boy or girl. On a five-point scale, the educators then rated the severity of the misbehavior and the likelihood that they would recommend suspension or expulsion. \n Here, Gilliam and his colleague found a surprising trend: Black educators were sterner in their judgment of such disruptive behavior on the part of a black child than if it was attributed to a white child. The study's white educators rated the severity of the child's disruptive behavior very low when they believed the student was black, and judged it more severely when they believed the child was white. \n This pattern, said Gilliam, suggests two very different assumptions about race and child behavior on the part of white and black educators. While black educators upheld stern \u2014 perhaps unrealistically stern \u2014 expectations of black preschoolers' behavior, he said, the white educators seemed to have far lower expectations. \n In assessing black children's misbehavior, white educators almost seemed to accept \"that this was normal behavior, and this was not normal behavior,\" said Gilliam. These \"shifting standards,\" said Gilliam, are a pernicious cause of what researchers call \"implicit bias.\" \n Further racial differences emerged when the subjects were asked to read a statement about the misbehaving child's home and family situation \u2014 a grim recitation of absent father, overworked mother, few resources and a chaotic household. \n When white teachers read the background statement and believed it described a white child's situation, their judgment of the child's prospects of overcoming disadvantage was kinder and more positive than were their judgments when they thought the child in question was black. \n When black teachers read the background statement and believed it described a black child's situation, they judged the child's prospects more kindly than when they thought the child in question was white. \n Across the divide of \"us\" and \"them,\" said Gilliam, lies a racial empathy gap that needs to be overcome. \n \"We need to help them feel like these children and families are their children and families,\" said Gilliam. Children, and especially African-American children, can be helped by policies and practices aimed in many directions, he added. \n Programs that seek to raise teachers' awareness of their implicit biases and counter them are important, said Gilliam. But practices that increase their empathy for all students will help too, as would any measures that reduce overall stress and chaos in preschool classrooms. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times  \n ", "author": "By Melissa Healy Los Angeles Times", "title": "Eye-tracking technology shows that preschool teachers have implicit bias against black boys"}

Deputies arrived minutes later. \n Brock says he doesn't want the attention. \n He \"wants to remain humble and quiet about it\" as he believes \"he did nothing any of the other volunteer firefighters wouldn't have done,\" said Scott Stoller with Anderson County Emergency Management. \n Regardless, he said, \"Firefighter Brock is absolutely a hero.\" \n Authorities said the shooting spree began at the teen's house about two miles from the school, where he gunned down his 47-year-old father, Jeffrey Osborne. Authorities have not released the suspect's name or age beyond saying he's a teen. \n Crying and upset, the teen called his grandmother's cellphone at 1:44 p.m., Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said. The grandparents couldn't understand what was going on, so they went to his home just 100 yards away. When they got there, they found Osborne dead and their grandson gone. \n About one minute later, authorities received a 911 call from a teacher at the school in this rural town about 110 miles northeast of Atlanta. \n The shooter drove a truck into the school parking lot and immediately started firing as he got out and moved toward the school, Skipper said. He did not know who the truck the teen drove was registered to and declined to say how many shots were fired. \n One student was shot in the leg and the other in the foot, Capt. Garland Major with the Anderson County Sheriff's Office said. Both students were male.

She canceled classes at the school for the rest of the week. \n Television images showed officers swarming the school after the report of an active shooter. Some were on top of the roof while others were walking around the building. Students were driven away on buses to a nearby church accompanied by police officers. \n Authorities said they don't yet know a motive for the shooting and they were not sure if the students and teacher were targeted. The sheriff said the teen had been homeschooled. \n \"There are no racial undertones there. There's no terrorism involved,\" Major said. \"We're confident we have the sole shooter and no one else is involved.\" \n Skipper said the teen's mother was at work at the time of the shooting. \n One of the students and the teacher were released from the hospital Wednesday evening, AnMed Health spokeswoman Juana Slade said. Greenville Health System spokeswoman Sandy Dees said the other student, Jacob Hall, remained in critical condition Wednesday evening. \n The school surrounded by working farms has about 300 students in its pre-kindergarten to sixth-grade classrooms. About 90 percent of the students are white, according to state records. \n \"This is the country,\" Brandi Pierce, the mother of a sixth-grader, told The Associated Press as she began to cry. \"You don't have this in the country.

The 2016 presidential campaign has underscored an economic paradox: Financially, black Americans and Hispanics are far worse off than whites, yet polls show minorities are more likely than whites to believe in the American Dream. And they are less anxious about the outcome of the election. \n KANSAS CITY, Mo. >> Consider two women in their 70s, both residents of the Kansas City area. One is white and affluent; the other is black and working class. \n Guess which one is more optimistic about the country's future and that of their grandchildren? \n More than likely, you guessed wrong. \n This year's presidential campaign has underscored an economic paradox: Financially, black Americans and Hispanics are far worse off than whites, yet polls show minorities are more likely than whites to believe in the American Dream. And they are less anxious about the outcome of the election. \n At 71, Carole Ramsey knows she has long been fortunate. She married a man who became a successful lawyer, raised their children in Kansas City's affluent western suburbs and now enjoys a comfortable retirement full of international travel. \n \"We've lived a very good life,\" Ramsey, who is white, said at an upscale shopping center in Leawood, Kansas. Even so, she says she'll vote for Donald Trump because she fears economic stagnation and global terrorism. \"Our kids will not be able to live the way we did, that's for sure.\" \n Ethel Tuggle, 72, backs Hillary Clinton, and a big reason is that her grandchildren's circumstances show how life has improved for her family. \"They're starting jobs at $15, $20 an hour; I've never seen that sort of money,\" said Tuggle, who is black and worked construction for Kansas City government until injuries forced her to retire early. \n Tuggle says she's amazed at the progress she's witnessed since her childhood in rural Missouri, when she was barred from entering shoe stores and had to trace her foot on a sheet of paper so a salesman inside could fit her for shoes. Her grandchildren live under the nation's first black president. \n One factor in the surprising gap between black optimism and white pessimism is simply partisan politics: Blacks and Hispanics are overwhelmingly Democrats and more likely to feel positive about the future when one of their own is in the White House. \n \"When Bush was in office, Republicans thought the country was headed in the right direction,\" while Democrats did not, said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster. \"Once Democrats took over, that flipped.\" \n Still, there's evidence that the divide goes beyond party and Obama's presidency. In great measure, it has to do with the past, not the future: Minorities who have seen great improvements in their lives are more confident, while whites who have seen disintegration in their lives are more pessimistic. \n The NORC at the University of Chicago has for decades asked Americans whether they think their standard of living will improve. Since 2002 \u2014 well before Obama's 2008 election \u2014 NORC surveys have found that whites across all parties and income levels have been steadily less likely to think their standard of living would improve. Blacks and Hispanics, meanwhile, have increasingly believed their living standards would rise. \n \"This is a racial and ethnic thing \u2014 not something that's based on education, income or party,\" said Jennifer Benz of NORC. \"It's whites' huge decline in optimism that makes the gap between whites and minorities the biggest it's been in a long time.\" \n In a poll conducted for the Atlantic and Aspen Institute last year, minorities were more likely than whites to agree with the statement, \"The American Dream is alive and well.\" \n A Pew Foundation survey found that Hispanics were the least likely ethnic or racial group to be anxious about the outcome of the current presidential race \u2014 even though a centerpiece of Trump's platform is to deport millions of immigrants living in the country illegally and restrict overall immigration. \n In a June AP-NORC poll, 62 percent of blacks said they thought America's best days were ahead. Only 40 percent of whites thought so. Fifty-three percent of blacks and 48 percent of Hispanics called the economy \"good.\" Just 37 percent of whites did. \n The level of optimism among minorities might seem to defy economic realities. Whites have a median household income of $71,300 compared with blacks' median of $43,300. A Pew foundation report found that white households' typical net worth was 13 times that of black households. A separate report from the Institute for Policy Studies has calculated that, at their current rate, it would take blacks 228 years to catch up with the wealth of whites. \n Still, minorities have seen progress, while whites have stalled. \n According to Census data, white men have increased their income by only 3 percent since 1973, while black men have improved theirs by 12 percent. (Incomes for all women have risen sharply since they entered and rose through the workforce since the early 1970s.) \n Many Hispanics have enjoyed solid income gains. The Institute for Policy Studies found that Hispanics' household wealth has risen 69 percent over the past 30 years, albeit to a still-low $98,000 relative to whites' $656,000. \n \"If you're at the bottom moving up, you feel much better about your prospects than if you're at the top moving down,\" Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said. \n There is one area where blacks, especially, register as more pessimistic than whites: Race relations and policing. Blacks particularly have polled as more negative about race relations recently, following a series of high-profile police killings of African-Americans. There is frustration, especially among younger blacks, that the incidents have continued under the nation's first African-American president. \n Yet even the usually peaceful demonstrations against those killings since 2014 could be seen as evidence of optimism, said Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Atlanta's Emory University. \n \"You wouldn't see people taking to the streets and demanding justice if they didn't think they had a greater chance of being able to change things,\" Gillespie said. \n Brandon Dixon's father was asphyxiated by Kansas City police in 2009 during a psychotic episode. The incident shocked Dixon, who gave up his work in construction and decided to plow his family's life's savings into opening a restaurant in the impoverished neighborhood where he grew up. \n Four years after he bought a former beauty salon to convert into an eatery, Dixon has been unable to open the restaurant because of environmental contamination from a neighboring gas station. He's struggling financially but hopes his business will finally open in a few weeks, and that it will help turn around his life and his community. \n \"We've always seen adversity,\" Dixon said. \"You have to not stand still, not be stagnating, keep moving forward.\" \n Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University, noted that people tend to evaluate their own prospects based on their parents' experiences. \n \"When whites look backwards, they compare themselves to a generation that was doing better,\" Cherlin said. \"Blacks and Hispanics,\" who face less overt discrimination today, \"compare themselves to a generation that was doing worse.\" \n As incomes have stagnated for working class whites, their rates of suicide, drug addiction and mortality have surged. Two economists in December 2015 reported that death rates have been rising since 1999 for whites between ages 45 and 54, with the sharpest increase among the least educated. \n By contrast, the suicide rate for black men has dropped since 1999. And the gap between black and white life expectancy is now the lowest in more than a century: 3.4 years. More whites have died than were born since 2011, and the Census Bureau projects that whites will be in the minority by 2060. \n Doug Haag lives in Milwaukee. One of the city's dwindling number of working-class white residents, he feels that the social contract between employers and employees has broken down. \n Haag, 59, doesn't see much job security anymore. He works for the state of Wisconsin, where a recent civil service overhaul makes it easier to fire public employees. Even though he's had a steady job the past 18 years he considers himself \"lower-middle class,\" unable to afford vacations or nights out with friends. He worries about whether he'll be able to retire. \n \"There's no middle class any more \u2014 the true middle class,\" Haag said. \"There's no loyalty from companies any more or from the employees.\" \n A Trump supporter, Haag said he's hopeful that the reality show star can restore the country's position of strength in the world and in the economy. \n \"He's going to be able to do that as a businessman,\" Haag said. \n Adrianne Bockhorst lives in a tonier spot than Haag \u2014 in the upscale Milwaukee suburb of Whitefish Bay. She's a Democrat who plans to vote for Hillary Clinton. But she, too, is worried \u2014 shaken by the scars of the recession, which tossed her family into bankruptcy, and by the vitriol of the presidential campaign. \n Bockhorst, who is white, tries not to even think of the country's economic future. \"I just ignore it because it scares me so much because of the collapse and what it did to us, our dreams,\" she said. \"I'm in total denial that something bad could happen again. We don't have a retirement plan, we don't have a safety net.\" \n Bockhorst lives worlds away from the Milwaukee streets which erupted in riots last month in the wake of the shooting of a 23-year-old black man by police after a traffic stop. Milwaukee has the fifth-worst poverty rate in the nation, based on the most recent Census data. But even there you'll find optimism among minorities. \n \"We used to have slaves, you know?\" said Christine Ricks, whose northside neighborhood was at the center of August's riots. \"There have been improvements. My grandfather and your grandfather used to not be able to drink out of the same fountain.\" \n Ricks grew up next to what Ricks calls \"the biggest dope house in the entire city\"; she works as a substitute teacher and has almost no money. But she's still optimistic that her life will improve, and that Clinton will be elected. \n \"I think it's going to be all right; I just don't know how,\" Ricks said. \"I would describe it as complete faith in God. Literally. From moment to moment.\" \n Jose Estrada, 71, emigrated from Mexico to California in the 1960s. He moved to Milwaukee in 1967, became a citizen 11 years later, and retired in 2003 after working a variety of manufacturing jobs. Estrada describes himself as middle class. \n \"I worked very, very hard to get myself to this point,\" he said. \n While he supports Clinton and fears Trump would damage the country, Estrada is optimistic about America's future regardless. \n \"We will be happy with anyone who gets into that position, and I will respect it,\" Estrada said. \"Whoever it is, I am living in this country, it is a beautiful country and I love it.

So the notion somehow that, 'Well, you know, I'm not as inspired because Barack and Michelle, they're not on the ballot this time, and, you know, maybe we kind of take it easy' \u2014 my legacy's on the ballot. You know, all the work we've done over the last eight years is on the ballot.\" \n In recent weeks, Obama has delivered fiery calls to black voters, urging them to get to the polls and support Clinton. \n \"I will consider it a personal insult \u2014 an insult to my legacy \u2014 if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election,\" he said at a gala hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus this month. \n National and swing state polls show Clinton has strong support among African-American voters. Still, as polls narrow in several swing states, such as Ohio and Florida, Clinton is banking on black voters to help carry those states. \n In 2008 and 2012, turnout among African-Americans reached all-time highs. Democrats' challenge this cycle is to replicate that turnout in November with the nation's first black president absent from the ballot. \n In the interview, which was recorded Tuesday, Obama praised Clinton's performance in the first debate a night earlier, saying she showed that she \"is capable, tough, does her homework, cares about the same things I care about.\" \n \"And then on the other side, you've got Mr. Trump, who is unqualified, doesn't do his homework, doesn't know basic facts that you need to know if you're going to be president,\" he added. \n Obama referred to Trump's comments about the former Miss Universe contestant he criticized after gaining weight, saying that someone who judges a person based on how they look and not based on \"the content of their character \u2026 is not somebody I want in the Oval Office that my daughters are listening to, and that sons are listening to.\" \n \"Across the board, you've got somebody who appears to only care about himself,\" he said. \n \u2014\u2014 \n (Times staff writer Michael A.

Harry Reid of Nev. speaks to reporters during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington on Sept. 13. Democrats opened a last-minute push Tuesday for new talks on must-do legislation to prevent the government from shutting down this weekend, fight the Zika virus and help flood-ravaged Louisiana rebuild. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS / JULY 21 \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., accompanied by, from left, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, listen to a question during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington on July 21. Democrats opened a last-minute push Tuesday for new talks on must-do legislation to prevent the government from shutting down this weekend, fight the Zika virus and help flood-ravaged Louisiana rebuild. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Overcoming its earlier divisions on Zika funding, the Senate today approved $1.1 billion in research and prevention aid as it passed a bigger appropriations bill to fund the federal government into December.  \n Sen. Bill Nelson, aware of a looming potentially divisive House vote later in the day or this week, greeted the Senate's 72-26 vote with guarded optimism. \n \"We had a small victory today in our ongoing fight against the Zika virus,\" said Nelson, a Florida Democrat. \n Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.,, who's made Zika funding his top priority as he runs for re-election against Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy, criticized the \"political games\" that had held it up for seven months. \n \"This anti-Zika package rightfully prioritizes Americans in Florida and Puerto Rico,\" Rubio said. \"I'm encouraged that my calls for action have been answered, and that real assistance from the federal government is finally on its way.\" \n The Zika money is tucked inside a 10-week stopgap funding measure totaling $1.1 trillion. The measure now moves to the House, with a potentially divisive vote looming. The bill must be passed by Friday, the end of the current fiscal year. \n A large chunk of the $1.1 billion for Zika would go to Florida, New York and Puerto Rico, which the virus ravaged during the summer. \n The National Institutes for Health would receive more than $160 million of the Zika funds to continue its recently launched first clinical trial for a vaccine and to conduct other research. \n The virus is carried primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, but it can also be transmitted through sexual intercourse with an infected partner. \n Florida had 904 Zika cases as of Tuesday, 109 of them locally transmitted through mosquitoes. \n Ninety-one of Florida's Zika infections involved pregnant women, an especially vulnerable group because of the birth defects the virus can cause, including microcephaly, which causes infants to be born with abnormally small brains and heads. \n The Senate vote Wednesday represented a turnaround for Zika funds in the higher chamber. In three earlier summertime votes, Senate Democrats, joined by some Republicans, rejected stand-alone Zika bills because of extraneous provisions. \n The most contentious provision sought to deny any of the new Zika money from going to Planned Parenthood partner clinics in Puerto Rico. \n The island has almost 19,500 cases of Zika, some 84 percent of all cases in the United States and far more than any other state or territory. \n The divisive Planned Parenthood clause is no longer part of the Zika funding measure in the overall spending bill. The Puerto Rico clinics will be allowed to seek reimbursement for Zika treatment except for abortions, consistent with four-decade-old federal restrictions. \n The bipartisan split among opponents of the $1.1 trillion bill foreshadowed potential pitfalls in the House, which was expected to take up the appropriations measure later Wednesday. \n About $400 million of the $1.1 billion in Zika funds is offset in spending cuts to a range of other programs supported by Democratic lawmakers. \n The larger appropriations measure also contains $500 million for flood relief to Louisiana and other states devastated by summer storms. \n Democratic Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters of Michigan voted against the larger measure because it did not include $500 million they'd requested to clean contaminated water and replace lead pipes in Flint. \n Negotiators promised to provide $170 million to Flint in a separate water bill moving through Congress, but that didn't satisfy Stabenow and Peters. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 McClatchy Washington Bureau  \n ", "author": "By James Rosen McClatchy Washington Bureau", "title": "Zika money finally gets approved as Senate votes to keep government running"}

Federal regulators have approved a first-of-a-kind \"artificial pancreas,\" a device that can help some diabetes patients manage their disease by constantly monitoring their blood sugar and delivering insulin as needed. The device from Medtronic was approved today for patients with Type 1 diabetes, the kind usually diagnosed during childhood. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Federal regulators have approved a first-of-a-kind \"artificial pancreas,\" a device that can help some diabetes patients manage their disease by constantly monitoring their blood sugar and delivering insulin as needed. \n The device from Medtronic was approved today for patients with Type 1 diabetes, the kind usually diagnosed during childhood. About 5 percent of the nation's 29 million Americans with diabetes have this type. \n Doctors said they have long awaited a device that could help patients around the clock. \n \"I can't wait to get my hands on it because I can think of a lot of our patients who need this,\" said the Cleveland Clinic's Dr. Betul Hatipoglu. \"Now I have a helper who is going to help me to help them.\" \n Type 1 diabetes patients now have to manage their insulin through multiple injections throughout the day or a drug pump that delivers it through a tube. Their own pancreas doesn't make insulin, a hormone needed to turn food into energy. They face increased risks of dangerously high blood-sugar levels, heart disease and many other health problems. \n The new MiniMed 670G consists of a drug pump, a sensor that measures blood sugar and a tube that delivers the insulin. The sensor measures sugar levels every 5 minutes, infusing or withholding insulin as needed. Patients still have to manually increase insulin before meals. \n Medtronic said the device will cost between $6,000 and $9,000, similar to its other insulin pumps. \n Older insulin pumps simply deliver a baseline level of insulin, and patients must monitor their sugar levels and give themselves more insulin to keep their blood sugar from getting too high. A big danger is having too much insulin in the body overnight, when blood-sugar levels naturally fall. People can go into comas, suffer seizures and even die. \n The Food and Drug Administration said it approved the device based on a three-month study of more than 120 patients. The study reported no major adverse events, such as dangerously low blood sugar, showing that the device is safe for those 14 years and up, regulators said in a release. \n The pump is about the size of a deck of cards and can be worn on a belt or carried in a pocket. \n The device \"can provide people with Type 1 diabetes greater freedom to live their lives,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA's device center. \n While the device can currently only be marketed for Type 1, doctors said it could eventually be used by those with Type 2 diabetes, where the body gradually loses the ability to produce or use insulin. Many of those patients are overweight or obese and face increased risk of heart attack, stroke and kidney failure. \n \"Type 2 diabetes is such an overwhelming spectrum of the disease and I think there's a significant slice of that pie that could benefit from the artificial pancreas,\" said Dr. Robert Courgi of Southside Hospital on New York's Long Island. \n The agency said it is requiring Ireland-based device manufacturer Medtronic to further study the implant's performance in patients. The company is also studying the device for potential use in children ages 7 to 13. \n A number of other companies are developing similar products, including Dexcom and Johnson & Johnson. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "FDA approves 'artificial pancreas' to manage diabetes"}

The emotional stories of women who say they were sexually assaulted more than a decade ago by comedian Bill Cosby prompted California state lawmakers to approve a bill to eliminate the state's 10-year limit on filing rape and related charges. \n SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u00bb The emotional stories of women who say they were sexually assaulted more than a decade ago by Bill Cosby prompted California state lawmakers to approve a bill to eliminate the state's 10-year limit on filing rape and related charges. \n Today, Gov. Jerry Brown announced that he has approved the legislation to revoke that limitation. \n Beginning next year, the bill will end the statute of limitations in certain rape and child molestation cases. It will also end the time limit on older cases in which the statute of limitations has not yet expired. \n The new law, SB813, will not, however, help women who made allegations against Cosby dating back more than 10 years, including some from the 1960s. \n Cosby has repeatedly denied the sex abuse allegations made by dozens of women nationwide. He is facing just one criminal case stemming from sex abuse. A trial is set to begin in June in Pennsylvania. \n Defense lawyer Angela Agrusa has said Cosby's accusers have stirred passions even though their stories of abuse have not been investigated by police. \n California lawmakers sent the statute of limitations bill to Brown without a single dissenting vote. \n State Sen. Connie Leyva, D-Chino, credited intense lobbying of lawmakers and the governor by advocates who \"kept the fight alive for the countless rape victims that have already spoken up and also those that have yet to come forward.\" \n The bill's signing \"tells every rape and sexual assault victim in California that they matter and that, regardless of when they are ready to come forward, they will always have an opportunity to seek justice in a court of law,\" she said in a statement. \"Rapists should never be able to evade legal consequences simply because an arbitrary time limit has expired.\" \n Seventeen other states already have no statute of limitations on rape, according to the California Women's Law Center. \n In June, Colorado doubled the amount of time sexual assault victims have to seek charges from 10 to 20 years, a decision also prompted by the Cosby allegations. Nevada extended its time limit from four to 20 years last year after testimony by one of Cosby's accusers. \n Advocates say victims may need years before they can bring themselves to make an allegation to law enforcement. Several women said during a spring legislative hearing on the California bill that they did not come forward sooner because they were traumatized or afraid no one would believe them. \n However, if they wait 10 years, victims find \"the door to the courthouse is slammed in her face,\" said high-profile Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred, who represents 30 women who say they were sexually assaulted more than a decade ago by Cosby. None can bring criminal charges because the time limit has expired. \n Civil rights groups and public defenders countered that extending the time limit could lead to false convictions as evidence disappears and memories fade among victims and witnesses. They say it's not fair to expect a suspect to recall an alibi decades later. \n It could even be counterproductive, California Public Defenders Association representative Carolyn George argued, because the time limit encourages victims to come forward and investigators to move quickly. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "California governor signs bill dumping rape reporting limit"}

Other people dove for cover. \n It wasn't clear from the police report what was said or if the loud exchange the witness reported was between the shooter and the victim. \n Three shots were fired, police said, before the weapon malfunctioned with a bullet stuck in the barrel. \n There was no evidence that Khutsishvili had a weapon, homicide Lt. Dan McGrath said Wednesday, just a cellphone and a laptop computer. \n Khutsishvili, known to friends as \"Sasha,\" didn't talk much about his military experience. But it wouldn't have been like him to be a bystander, said Shtromberg, who emigrated to the U.S. as a refugee in 1992 and lives in Los Angeles. \n The twice-divorced father of three became a U.S. citizen in 2004, Shtromberg said. He worked as a longshoreman, a plumber and a construction worker in Southern California before moving to Las Vegas about three years ago. \n \"Because he was military, he would react,\" the friend told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. He said Khutsishvili also sometimes worked with him at his computer services business in Hollywood. \n \"He's not the type of person to walk away from a fight,\" Shtromberg said, \"or someone else's fight.\" \n Garcia, 34, made an initial court appearance Wednesday on murder and other charges in the slaying. A judge postponed his arraignment until Friday to let the Clark County public defender's office determine if it can represent him. \n Defense attorney Edward Kane said outside court that he expects Garcia will plead not guilty. \n According to a police report, a man who identified himself as Garcia called 911 and said he had shot a person who appeared to have been reaching for something. \n Police later recovered a .22-caliber handgun that witnesses said Garcia used. It had been fired three times, according to police, before malfunctioning \n On the 911 call, a male voice could be heard moaning in the background, according the police report, while Garcia is heard saying, \"Go for it dog, I'm not gonna tell you again, go for it; play cowboy with me dog.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Friend: Starbucks shooting victim became U.S. citizen in 2004"}

Jose Alfredo Suarez de la Cruz grieved as they watched his casket lower into the floor inside Our Lady of Asuncion Church in Paso Blanco, Veracruz state, Mexico on Sept. 21. Mourners packed the church for the funeral Mass in memory of the Roman Catholic priest who was murdered along with another cleric in the troubled Gulf coast state of Veracruz. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Evolution and genetics seem to have baked a certain amount of murder into humans as a species, but civilization has tamed some of the savage beast in us, according to a new study. \n Scientists calculated the rate at which more than 1,000 mammal species kill their own kind, and noticed how closely related species have similar rates of lethal violence. They essentially found that where a species is on evolutionary tree of life tells a lot about how violent the species is to its own kind. And we're in a rough neighborhood. \n Humans are \"in a position within a particularly violent mammalian clade, in which violence seems to have been ancestrally present,\" the study in the journal Nature says. That means that based on other rather murderous species closely related to us, humans have \"inherited their propensity for violence.\" \n As a group, mammals average a lethal violence rate against their own of about three killings of their own species in 1,000 deaths. The \"root\" violence rate of early humans and many of our closer primate cousins is about 20 in 1,000, said study lead author Jose Maria Gomez at the University of Granada in Spain. But in the medieval period, between 700 and 1500 A.D., that deadly rate shot up to about 120 per 1000. \n But we've gotten less murderous. \n On average, modern humans now kill each other on a rate of 13 in 1000, Gomez said, basing his calculations on World Health Organization data. But he says the exact numbers are rough and depend on many technical variables, so what is more accurate is to say \"violence has decreased significantly in the contemporary age.\" \n \"It seems that we are in the present time less violent than we were in the past,\" Gomez said in an email interview. \n While humans are killing each other less than we once did, we are not nearly as peaceful as the killer whale \u2014 which despite the name, has a rate of interpersonal violence of pretty much zero (though Gomez notes that only a small sample of killer whales was examined). Many whale species, bats and anteaters are particularly peaceful to their own kind, the study finds. \n But humans are far less violent than the cougar, certain baboons, lemurs and chinchillas that have murder rates of well over 100 per 1,000. \n The study looks at violence through the lens of phylogenetics \u2014 the study of evolutionary relationships, or how closely related species seem to share common traits. \n \"We found that closely related mammal species tend to have similar levels of violence,\" Gomez said. The more closely related species are, the more similar are their violence levels. \n Gomez and colleagues used 1,044 studies that looked at 1,024 different mammal species, with the causes of death determined for more than 4 million individual mammals. Then for each species, the researchers counted the number of deaths due to a member of the species killing another. They didn't use studies where they couldn't find causes of death. And because of the study's historical nature, Gomez could only examine killings, not wounding. \n Moving up in evolutionary complexity often seems a walk on the wild side, especially in the branches of the tree of life where humans come from. \n If mammals have a three in 1,000 violence rate, a superorder of species called Euarchontogilires that includes our ancestors, hares, and rodents has a violence rate of about 11 in 1000. Further on, the large grouping called Euarchonta that includes us, other primates, tree shrews and flying lemurs has a rate of about 23 per 1,000. It drops to about 18 for great apes. \n It was hard to calculate lethal violence rates for early humans; Gomez examined several thousand prehistoric people's deaths across the globe in archaeological sites. \n Culture, government and other factors tamp down the inherited violence, Gomez and colleagues conclude. \n \"Our study suggests that the level of lethal violence is reversible and can increase or decrease as a consequence of some ecological, social or cultural factors,\" Gomez said. \n These conclusions are similar to what Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker found in his book \"The Better Angels of Our Nature.\" He charted long-term reductions in war, murder, rape and bigotry. \n Pinker praised the Gomez study as creative and thorough. \n \"Based on three biological facts \u2014 we are apes, we are social and we are territorial \u2014 one would predict that humans should engage in lethal violence in our natural conditions,\" Pinker wrote in an email. \"Modern societies have developed, especially the rule of law, that have reduced rates of lethal violence below what would expect for a mammal with our ancestry and ecology.\" \n Harvard biological anthropologist Richard Wrangham, who studies the roots of violence, praised the breadth Gomez study, but said there some issues remain. He's especially concerned about too closely linking primates killing their own, which is more the murdering of infants, to humans whose killing their own mostly involves adults. \n Few species beyond humans and some social territorial carnivores like wolves and lions are part of the \"adult-killing club\" of their own species, Wrangham said. \"Humans really are exceptional.\" \n Online: \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Study: As a species, humans inherit murderous tendencies"}

There were 10,854 air rage incidents reported by airlines worldwide last year, up from 9,316 incidents in 2014, according to the International Air Transport Association. That equates to one incident for every 1,205 flights, an increase from one incident per 1,282 flights the previous year. \n WASHINGTON >> Incidents of unruly passengers on planes are increasing, and more effective deterrents are needed to tackle the problem, a global airline trade group said Wednesday. \n There were 10,854 air rage incidents reported by airlines worldwide last year, up from 9,316 incidents in 2014, according to the International Air Transport Association. That equates to one incident for every 1,205 flights, an increase from one incident per 1,282 flights the previous year. \n Incidents have been rising almost consistently since 2007, when the association began tracking the issue. That year airlines reported 339 incidents to the association. \n A majority of incidents involved verbal abuse, failure to follow crew instructions and other anti-social behavior. Eleven percent included physical aggression toward passengers or crew or damage to the plane. Alcohol or drugs were a factor in 23 percent of the cases. In the vast majority of incidents involving drugs or alcohol, the substances were consumed before boarding or imbibed secretly on board, the association said. \n Training staff in airport bars and duty-free shops to sell alcohol responsibly, including avoiding offers that encourage binge drinking, can cut incidents by half, the association said, citing an initiative by Monarch Airlines at London's Gatwick Airport. \n Airlines already have strong guidelines and crew training on \"the responsible provision of alcohol,\" the association said. \n A woman in England pleaded guilty in June to assaulting an easyJet pilot. Prosecutors said she punched the pilot in the face after he deemed her too intoxicated to fly. In another case, a male passenger allegedly urinated on fellow easyJet passengers as they were waiting to deplane after landing at Edinburgh. \n Six men involved in a drunken brawl during a Jetstar flight from Sydney to Thailand in July were ordered off the plane after it diverted to Indonesia. \n An American Airlines pilot tackled one passenger to the floor after he tried to force his way off the plane as it taxied to the gate in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"You don't put your hands on my flight attendant!\" the pilot can be heard yelling on a video taken by another passenger. The unruly passenger was arrested and charged with being intoxicated and disruptive. \n Charlie Leocha, president of Travelers United, an advocacy group for airline passengers in Washington, said he knows of no changes in the way alcohol is sold in airports or on planes that would account for the increase in the rate of incidents. But he noted that the increases correspond with efforts by airlines to squeeze more passenger seats onto planes by shrinking legroom and seat width. \n \"We've always had alcohol sold at airports, we have always had alcohol served on aircraft,\" he said. \"The only difference today is that people now have less space and they are required to interact more intimately with other passengers.\" \n Other recent incidents include a Los Angeles-bound Delta Air Lines flight diverted to Tucson, Arizona, escorted by two Air Force fighter jets, after a passenger refused to return his seat. The following month, the FBI and Hawaii state sheriffs arrested a 35-year-old man who allegedly bit a flight attendant on a Hawaiian Airlines flight from Pago Pago in American Samoa to Honolulu. \n Airlines also want more countries to ratify a 2014 treaty that closes gaps in laws for dealing with unruly passengers. So far, only six countries \u2014 Bahrain, Congo, Dominican Republic, Gabon, Guyana and Jordan \u2014 have ratified the pact. \n \"More are needed in order to have a consistent global approach to this issue,\" said Alexandre de Juniac, the association's director general. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Air rage incidents reported by airlines on the rise"}

{"date": "September 28, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., spoke during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, following a closed-door meeting of House Republicans. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Congressional leaders have broken a stalemate over money to address the Flint, Michigan, water crisis, clearing the way today for a spending bill needed to keep the government running until December. \n The hybrid spending measure \u2014 the last major item on Capitol Hill's pre-election agenda \u2014 would fund the battle against the mosquito-borne Zika virus and provide rebuilding assistance to flood-ravaged Louisiana. Lawmakers are set to move it forward today as they eye the exits. \n House Speaker Paul Ryan said the breakthrough on Flint \"will help unlock\" the short-term government spending bill, which stalled in the Senate Tuesday over demands by Democrats that the measure include $220 million to help Flint and other cities deal with tainted water. \n Instead, top lawmakers like Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., have agreed to address Flint's water crisis in a separate water development bill slated for a House vote today. The Senate version passed last week and contains $220 million in Flint-related funds. Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell promised the funding would be in the final version of that measure. \n The deal would avert a potential federal shutdown and comes just three days before the midnight deadline to keep the government open. It caps a lengthy battle over Zika spending, a months' long struggle over Flint, and late pressure to provide flood aid to Louisiana. \n The politicking and power plays enormously complicated what should have been a routine measure to avoid an election-eve government shutdown. \n McConnell, R-Ky., said that the long-quarrelling Senate finally has \"a path forward\" on the stopgap spending bill measure. A Senate vote is expected today and a House vote could follow tonight. \n After meeting with McConnell this morning, Reid said, \"I am convinced that there's going to be help for Flint\" in the post-election, lame-duck session and said that the stopgap spending measure should advance. \n The stopgap spending bill would keep the government running through Dec. 9 and provide $1.1 billion in long-delayed funding to fight the spread of the Zika virus and develop a vaccine and improved tests to detect it. Zika can cause grave birth defects. \n On Tuesday, Senate Democrats and a dozen of the chamber's most conservative Republicans joined to block the temporary spending bill. Democrats said help for Flint and its lead-contaminated water had to advance immediately and they were not willing to accept a promise that it will come after the election. \n But the Democratic position softened after negotiations involving Ryan and top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi of California, among others. Republicans also relented and agreed to put the House on record on the Flint measure after denying Democrats a vote on a different version just Tuesday. \n The Flint measure, an amendment to a separate water projects bill, would authorize $170 million to help Flint and other cities with water emergencies. The actual funding would be provided after the election in the final version of the water measure. \n Charges of racism and campaign-season antagonism between Republicans and Democrats had slowed efforts to pass the spending measure. Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee, Flint's congressman, had accused Republicans of ignoring the plight of predominantly black Flint because Republicans would not permit a vote on a Senate aid package to deliver the money now. \n But this morning Kildee issued a statement that called the upcoming vote on the non-binding $170 million promise for Flint \"a step forward to ensuring that Flint families get the resources they need to recover from this crisis.\" The $220 million Senate measure, which passed earlier this month, earmarked $120 million for Flint. \n The amendment represents a bipartisan agreement authorizing the funding, but the actual money would await the final House-Senate version of the bill after the November election. \n The spending bill also contains $500 million to help Louisiana and other states rebuild from recent floods and full-year funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs. \n Democrats argued it's unfair that the water crisis in Flint has gone on for more than a year with no assistance, while Louisiana and other states are getting $500 million for floods that occurred just last month. Democrats have played a strong hand in the negotiations and had leverage because Republicans controlling the House and Senate were eager to avoid a politically harmful shutdown some six weeks to the election. \n McConnell has made numerous concessions in weeks of negotiations, agreeing, for instance, to drop contentious provisions tied to Zika funding that led Democrats to block prior Zika measures. A provision to make Planned Parenthood ineligible for new anti-Zika funding for Puerto Rico was dropped, as was a provision to ease pesticide regulations under the Clean Water Act. Democrats relented and agreed to a $400 million package of spending cuts. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Deal reached to keep U.S. government running, help Flint"}

The Senate is poised to reject President Barack Obama's veto of a bill that would allow the families of Sept. 11 victims to sue the government of Saudi Arabia even as lawmakers express fears the legislation could backfire on the United States. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb In a resounding rebuke, Democrats joined with Republicans today to hand Barack Obama the first veto override of his presidency, voting overwhelmingly to allow families of Sept. 11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia in U.S. courts for its alleged backing of the attackers. \n Both the House and Senate voted decisively to reverse Obama's decision to scuttle the legislation. Democrats in both chambers abandoned the president in large numbers despite warnings from Obama and top national security officials that flaws in the bill could put U.S. interests, troops, and intelligence personnel at risk. \n The Senate vote was 97-1, with only Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., backing the president. The House vote a few hours later was 348-77, with 123 Democrats rebuffing the president and voting to override. Obama said during a CNN interview that overriding his veto was a mistake that may set a \"dangerous precedent.\" \n Lawmakers said their priority wasn't Saudi Arabia, but the 9/11 victims and their families who continue to demand justice 15 years after attackers killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, the Washington, D.C., area, and Pennsylvania. Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudis. \n \"Overriding a presidential veto is something we don't take lightly, but it was important in this case that the families of the victims of 9/11 be allowed to pursue justice, even if that pursuit causes some diplomatic discomforts,\" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a chief sponsor of the bill. \n Speaking at a forum in Washington, CIA Director John Brennan said he was concerned about how Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, would interpret the bill. He said the Saudis provide significant amounts of information to the U.S. to help foil extremist plots. \n \"It would be an absolute shame if this legislation, in any way, influenced the Saudi willingness to continue to be among our best counterterrorism partners,\" Brennan said. \n On CNN, Obama said that a few lawmakers who backed the bill weren't aware of its potential impact. He didn't name them. \"And, frankly, I wish Congress here had done what's hard,\" he said. \"It was, you know, basically a political vote.\" \n But Republicans and Democrats said the White House had been slow to respond to the bill and miscalculated lawmakers' intent to act on the legislation along with the 15th anniversary of the terror attacks. When Obama and senior national security officials such as Defense Secretary Ash Carter finally weighed in, it was too late. \n The Senate passed the bill by voice vote in May. The Obama White House then made the mistake of thinking the bill would stall in the Republican-controlled House. In August, 9/11 families pressured Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., while he was on a campaign swing in New York. \n On Sept. 9, two days before the 15th anniversary of 9/11, the House passed the bill by voice vote with little debate. \n Despite reversing Obama's decision, a bipartisan group of 28 senators led by Bob Corker, R-Tenn., suggested that defects in the bill could open a legal Pandora's box, triggering lawsuits from people in other countries seeking redress for injuries or deaths caused by military actions in which the U.S. may have had a role. \n Corker, the chairman of Foreign Relations Committee, chided the White House for being outraged over the outcome when the administration did so little to sustain the president's veto. \n \"There was zero desire to sit down and talk about a way to get to a better outcome. Zero,\" Corker told The Associated Press. \"To my knowledge, I don't know of a call from Obama to a single senator over this.\" \n In a letter sent Tuesday to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Obama said the bill would erode sovereign immunity principles that prevent foreign litigants \"from second-guessing our counterterrorism operations and other actions that we take every day.\" \n But proponents of the bill dismissed Obama's concerns as unpersuasive. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, and other supporters said the bill is narrowly tailored and applies only to acts of terrorism that occur on U.S. soil. \n Families of the victims and their attorneys dismissed concerns over the legislation as fearmongering. \"We rejoice in this triumph and look forward to our day in court and a time when we may finally get more answers regarding who was truly behind the attacks,\" said Terry Strada, national chair of the 9/11 Families & Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism. \n The legislation gives victims' families the right to sue in U.S. court for any role that elements of the Saudi government may have played in the 2001 attacks. Courts would be permitted to waive a claim of foreign sovereign immunity when an act of terrorism occurred inside U.S. borders, according to the terms of the bill. \n Obama vetoed the measure last week, telling lawmakers the bill would make the U.S. vulnerable to retaliatory litigation. \n In a separate letter sent Monday to a senior House member, Defense Secretary Ash Carter described the potential for foreign litigants to seek classified intelligence data and analysis and sensitive operational information to establish their cases in what could be an \"intrusive discovery process.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Congress rebukes Obama, overrides veto of 9/11 legislation"}

Prosecutors are calling the scourge of sex trafficking a form of modern-day slavery that touches every state in the nation, and they're working to draw connections between active investigations around the globe at a summit in Waikiki. \n STAR-ADVERTISER / JAN. 2016 \n Hoola Napua volunteers Bryan Muoz, left, and Johnny Bitanga held a sign reading, \"Stop sex trafficking on our islands\" at a rally to support Human Trafficking Awareness Day at Tamarind Park in Honolulu on Jan. 11. \n Prosecutors are calling the scourge of sex trafficking a form of modern-day slavery that touches every state in the nation, and they're working to draw connections between active investigations around the globe at a summit in Waikiki. \n Representatives from eight countries and a dozen states met to share details about cases of victims forced into the sex industry, hoping to collaborate on strategies to bring traffickers to justice. \n \"Sex trafficking internationally is somewhere between a $7 billion and $23 billion business,\" said Cyrus Vance Jr., district attorney for New York County. \"It's second to international arms sales in terms of the scope of the crime and the money that's involved with it. So it's huge. And it's in every community in America \u2014 whether we like to acknowledge it or not \u2014 and every country around the world.\" \n Prosecutors form from Canada, China, Japan, Palau, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand attended the summit, along with American prosecutors from Hawaii and states spanning the coasts and the Midwest. \n In New York City, where there's a special court to handle cases involving prostitution or sex trafficking, many young men and women are brought in from other states and forced to work in the sex industry, Vance said. \n California law enforcement officers have encountered victims forced into the sex trade from Mexico, Taiwan and China, but most of the victims were born in the United States, said Michael Ramos, district attorney for San Bernardino County and president of the National District Attorneys Association. \n \"Yes we have a problem internationally \u2026 but we really have a homegrown problem, and we need to take care of that,\" Ramos said. \n Prosecutors in Hawaii have found sex-trafficking victims brought to the U.S. from China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand, Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney Keith Kaneshiro said. In the past year, the prosecutor's office has closed down three massage parlors in Honolulu that involved Asian sex-trafficking victims, including one case where sex workers from China were flown to New York and then Hawaii, he said. \n \"There are a lot of massage parlors proliferating in our community,\" Kaneshiro said. \n The conference, which began today, is being held in Hawaii, which was the last state in the nation to formally ban sex trafficking. \n Kaneshiro, who co-sponsored the summit, said they intend to send a clear message that sex trafficking will not be tolerated. \n Most of the law enforcement conference is closed to the media because prosecutors will be discussing ongoing cases and sharing intelligence, Kaneshiro said. \n \"We have international investigations ongoing, but we have not built those cases to indictment yet,\" Vance said. \"That's the point of this event. I know that there's international traffic coming in from Europe and from Asia. But we need to have the relationships with those governments to help us understand what they're seeing and then build the cases.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Prosecutors work on global sex trafficking cases in Hawaii"}

{"date": "September 28, 2016", "text": "Honolulu \u00bb The Navy has investigated the case of a sailor who didn't salute as the national anthem played during a recent morning flag-raising at Pearl Harbor. \n U.S. Pacific Fleet spokesman Senior Chief Petty Officer Joel Cesar said Tuesday it's up to the sailor's commander whether she faces any punishment for not saluting on Sept. 19. \n The sailor is Petty Officer 2nd Class Janaye Ervin, an intelligence specialist in the Navy Reserve. She was recently in Hawaii for about two weeks for an exercise. \n Erwin is assigned to the Navy Operational Support Center at North Island, California. The command didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. Erwin didn't respond to a message sent to a Facebook account in her name. A phone number for her was not listed. \n The sailor's failure to salute comes after San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick received national attention when he refused to stand for the anthem before NFL preseason games earlier this year. He cited racial injustice and police brutality among the reasons for his actions. \n Since then, other athletes all over the U.S. have engaged in their own protests during the anthem. \n The Navy's protocol handbook says sailors in uniform must salute during the anthem. They must also face the flag, or if a flag is not visible, sailors are required to face the direction of the music. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Navy investigates sailor who didn't salute national anthem"}
