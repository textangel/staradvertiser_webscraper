{"date": "October 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a rally, Saturday, Oct. 1, 2016, in Manheim, Pa. \n WASHINGTON >> Donald Trump's business losses in 1995 were so large that they could have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for as many as 18 years, according to records obtained by The New York Times. \n In a story published online late Saturday, the Times said it anonymously received the first pages of Trump's 1995 state income tax filings in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The filings show a net loss of $915,729,293 in federal taxable income for the year. \n That Trump was losing money during the early to mid-1990s \u2014 a period marked by bankruptcies and poor business decisions \u2014 was already well established. But the records obtained by the Times show losses of such a magnitude that they potentially allowed Trump to avoid paying taxes for years, possibly until the end of the last decade. \n Trump's campaign released a statement on Saturday lashing out at the Times for publishing the records and accused the newspaper of working to benefit the Republican nominee's presidential rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton. \n \"The New York Times, like establishment media in general, is an extension of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party and their global special interests,\" the campaign said, calling Trump \"a highly skilled businessman who has a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required.\" \n The statement added that Trump had paid \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars in other kinds of taxes over the years. \n Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, used the Times story to needle Trump about not releasing his tax returns and contending during his first debate with Clinton that not paying federal income taxes would show he was \"smart.\" \n Mook said in a statement that Trump apparently avoided paying taxes for two decades \"while tens of millions of working families paid theirs. He calls that 'smart.'\" Mook added: \"Now that the gig is up, why doesn't he go ahead and release his returns to show us all how 'smart' he really is?\" \n Since 1976, every major party presidential nominee has released tax returns. Clinton has publicly released nearly 40 years' worth, and Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has released 10 years of his tax returns. \n But after initially saying that he would make his returns public during the course of his campaign, Trump switched course, citing what he said were years of ongoing IRS audits and the advice of his attorneys to keep them private as those audits proceed. \n Former IRS officials have expressed skepticism that anyone would be audited so frequently, and they and other tax experts say there's no prohibition on Trump releasing his returns even if he is. \n In its story, the Times said the three pages of documents were mailed last month to a Times reporter who had written about Trump's finances. A postmark indicated they had been sent from New York City and the return address claimed the envelope had been sent from Trump Tower, the newspaper said. \n Trump's campaign did not directly address the authenticity of the excerpts from Trump's tax filings. Former Trump accountant Jack Mitnick, whose name appears as Trump's tax preparer of the filings, confirmed their authenticity, the newspaper reported. \n On the campaign trail, Trump continued to veer from scripted economic arguments to personal attacks on Clinton. \n At a rally Saturday night, Trump questioned Clinton's loyalty to her husband, adding an explosive personal charge against his Democratic opponent to a turbulent week when he repeatedly veered off script. \n \"Hillary Clinton's only loyalty is to her financial contributors and to herself,\" Trump told thousands gathered in Manheim, Pennsylvania. \"I don't think she's even loyal to Bill if you want to know the truth \u2026 Why should she be, right? Why should she be?\" \n Trump also seized on a leaked recording from a Clinton fundraiser in February, where she expressed empathy for young voters who were siding with her primary opponent, Bernie Sanders, saying that for people who don't see any economic opportunities, the idea that \"you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing.\" The hacked recording was published Tuesday by the Washington Free Beacon \n Clinton called them \"children of the Great Recession\" and added: \"And they are living in their parents' basement. They feel that they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves.\" \n Trump sought to turn her words into a new pitch for Sanders supporters, although Sanders himself has endorsed Clinton and denounced Trump. The businessman contended Saturday that the audio shows Clinton \"demeaning and mocking Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters\" and added: \"To sum up, Hillary Clinton thinks Bernie Sanders supporters are hopeless and ignorant basement dwellers.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump losses may mean he didn't pay taxes for years"}

{"date": "October 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A Filipino trader looks at an electronic board showing the exchange rates and a downward graph during afternoon trading at the Philippine Stock Exchange in the financial district of Makati, south of Manila, Philippines. \n MANILA, Philippines >> Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's bloody anti-drug war and his foul-mouthed outbursts in defense of the campaign have unnerved foreign investors in one of Asia's fastest-growing economies. \n Analysts and businessmen point to uncertainties about Duterte's policies and flip-flopping pronouncements as largely to blame for foreign selling in the stock market and the peso's plunge to a seven-year low, reversing the initial optimism after his June 30 inauguration. \n Some experts say unpredictability is slowing longer-term foreign investment in the Philippines. Photos and reports in the media of killings of suspected drug dealers and users \u2014 more than 3,000 since July 1 \u2014 have contributed to sagging confidence. \n \"We can all deal with risks. We can put measures in place to provide for risks,\" said Guenter Taus, the head of the European Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines. \"But uncertainty is a factor that we do not like in business, and that is exactly what we're experiencing right now because we don't know where we are heading.\" \n Taus said several companies that had intended to establish operations to the Philippines now prefer to wait and see what happens under Duterte. He declined to say which companies had changed their plans. \n He said investors unsure about the Philippines may choose to look at other Southeast Asian countries to gain access to the region's common market of more than 600 million people. \n The American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines said in September that while the country's economic fundamentals are strong and its potential high, there is growing concern that Duterte's policies and behavior could affect long-standing optimism by American businesses in the Philippines. \n The chamber said that the large number of deaths in the anti-drug campaign is harming the Philippines' image, and that some investors are asking if the drug war \"reduces the rule of law.\" \n \"In addition, traditionally excellent bilateral relations between the U.S. and the Philippines have recently been strained by language from Philippine leaders,\" the chamber said. \n Last month, before heading to a regional summit in Laos where he had been scheduled to meet with President Barack Obama, Duterte used the Tagalog phrase for \"son of a bitch\" as he told Philippine reporters he wouldn't accept questions from Obama about extrajudicial killings that have occurred during the drug crackdown. Obama cancelled the meeting. \n After the European Parliament recently called for an end to the drug killings and expressed concern over the scale of deaths, Duterte hit back with a profane insult and raised a fist with his middle finger thrust out. And this week Duterte said U.S.-Philippine joint military exercises end this year, though his foreign minister said later that they will continue until 2017 as previously agreed. \n On several fronts, Duterte has had an uneasy relationship with Western countries, including the United States, an important treaty ally. He has said he's charting a foreign policy that is not dependent on the U.S., and has taken steps to bolster relations with Russia and revive ties with China that had been strained under his predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, over territorial conflicts. \n He said he won't allow government forces to conduct joint patrols of disputed waters near the South China Sea with foreign powers, apparently scrapping a deal Aquino reached with the U.S. military earlier this year. Duterte has also said he wants U.S. forces out of the southern Philippines, saying minority Muslims there resent the presence of American troops. \n All of this has raised concerns about a Philippine economy that grew 7 percent in the second quarter and 6.9 percent over the first half of the year compared to the same periods last year \u2014 among the fastest rates in the region. \n The credit-rating agency S&P Global warned Sept. 20 that the stability and predictability of policymaking in the Philippines \"has diminished somewhat under the new presidency.\" It kept the country's credit rating at investment grade, with a stable outlook, but said that rating was unlikely to rise over the next two years. \n Last Monday, the peso hit its lowest level against the dollar since September 2009. It fell further Friday, closing at 48.50 pesos per U.S. dollar. \n Central bank Deputy Gov. Diwa Guinigundo said foreign direct investment continues to grow. It stood at $4 billion for January to June this year compared to $2.2 billion for the same period a year ago. He noted that while Duterte became president June 30, his election victory came nearly two months earlier. \n \"As far as fundamentals are concerned I think they are outstanding fundamentals, but then the sentiment is something else,\" he told reporters late Wednesday on the sidelines of an economic forum. Sentiment is driven by both external and domestic factors and it's difficult to attribute negative sentiment to a specific factor like Duterte's statements, he added. \n Guinigundo said the government's economic program follows the broad strokes that have produced 70 quarters of economic growth, low and stable inflation and a healthy banking system. \"And yet the stock market is dropping and the exchange rate is moving consecutively down such as we are now the worst-performing currency in the region,\" he said. \n Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said Wednesday that the depreciation of the peso is a result of the strengthening of the dollar more than the weakening of the local currency, and should not be a cause for concern. \n But Joey Cuyegkeng, ING Bank's senior economist in Manila, said the peso was the only Asian currency that slid in the third week of September, despite favorable economic reports, including an increased balance of payment surplus in August. \n Presidential spokesman Martin Andanar said that the fundamentals of the economy are solid and strong, and that the anti-drug campaign will enhance the Philippines' image to attract more foreign investment. \n In a speech to troops the day after the S&P Global warning was released, Duterte shrugged off the agency's remarks. He said if business and the economy are affected, \"so be it.\" \n \"Get out, then we start on our own,\" he said, apparently referring to Western investors. \"I can go to China. I can go to Russia. I had a talk with them. They are waiting for me. So what the hell.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Uncertainty over Philippine president alarms investors"}

{"date": "October 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Thousands of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, from around the world, sing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in the Conference Center during morning session of the two-day Mormon church conference Saturday, Oct. 1, 2016, in Salt Lake City. \n SALT LAKE CITY >> A Mormon leader urged members Saturday during a church conference not to be timid about defending church founder Joseph Smith's story and role as the faith's first prophet despite \"erroneous\" beliefs spread about him. \n Mormons should remember the many benefits that have come in the nearly 200 years since Smith, then a teenager, says he had a vision of God and Jesus Christ in the woods of upstate New York that led to the formation of the church 10 years later, said Craig Christensen, a member of the faith's second-tier worldwide leadership council called the Quorum of the Seventy. \n \"To any who may be questioning their testimony of Joseph Smith or are struggling with erroneous, misleading, or superficial information about his life and ministry, I invite you to consider the fruits \u2014 the many blessings that have come to us through the miraculous mission of Joseph Smith, the prophet of the restoration,\" Christensen said. \n Christensen didn't reference any specific misinformation about Smith, but pointed out that the battle over Smith is not new, with \"antagonists\" long fighting furiously against him and his cause. \n Critics of The Church of Jesus Christs of Latter-day Saints have questioned Smith's accounts of his visions and his account that God helped him translate gold plates engraved with writing in ancient Egyptian into the Book of Mormon. \n Smith's polygamous practices have also fueled criticism. The Mormon church acknowledged in 2014 in an essay that Smith had a teenage bride and was married to other men's wives during the faith's early polygamous days, a recognition of an unflattering part of its roots that historians had chronicled for years. \n The essay was part of a push in recent years for greater transparency about the faith's history, tenets and beliefs that is designed to peel back layers of secrecy and fill a void on the internet for accurate information as curiosity increased while church membership tripled to 15 million over the past three decades. \n The religion has published a series of journals and writings from Smith's vault as part of the drive. Last year, the church published for the first time pictures of a small sacred stone it believes Smith used to help translate the Book of Mormon. \n Christensen harkened back to Smith's experience as a call to modern-day members to use revelation as a way to guide their lives. \n \"Joseph's life stands as a testimony that if any of us lack wisdom, we can ask God in faith and receive answers\u2014sometimes from heavenly beings, but more often by the power of the Holy Ghost, who speaks to us through inspired thoughts and feelings,\" Christensen said. \n The faith believes church presidents are prophets of God, as Abraham, Moses and Isiah were, and receive continuing revelation from God. That has led to fundamental changes. In 1890, the church president at the time said he received a revelation to end the practice of polygamous marriages that were part of the first 60 years of the church. \n Rank-and-file Mormons are also encouraged to use revelation through prayers to help guide them in their decisions. \n Christensen's speech came during a twice-yearly conference in which leaders give speeches of spiritual guidance. More than 100,000 members of the faith are expected to attend five speeches Saturday and Sunday while thousands more will listen or watch in nearly 100 languages around the world on television, radio, satellite and internet broadcasts \n Saturday's speakers mainly focused on imploring members to adhere to the religion's teachings and avoid straying from the righteous path. \n Quentin L. Cook, a member of the church's highest leadership council, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, warned followers not to practice \"gospel extremism\" such as expensive preparations for \"end of days scenarios\" in an apparent reference to preppers. He also singled out as an example people advocating for changes to the faith's health guidelines that include prohibition on drinking coffee or alcohol. \n \"If we turn a health law or any other principle into a form of religious fanaticism, we are looking beyond the mark,\" Cook said. \n Storing away enough food and water in case of disaster, job loss or something worse is part of the fundamental teachings of the religion. The belief that regular history will someday end, bringing a second coming of Jesus, is embedded in the minds of Mormons and the church's official name. \n J. Devn Cornish of the Quorum of the Seventy cautioned members that rebellion would keep them out of heaven, and called \"premeditated sin\" the worst kind. \n D. Todd Christofferson, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, said that while God loves everyone, \"God's greater blessings are conditioned on obedience. \n \"Sinners cannot bend his will to theirs and require him to bless them in sin,\" Christofferson said. \"If they desire to enjoy every bloom in his beautiful bouquet, they must repent.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mormon leader: Defend founder Joseph Smith's story"}

The official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the subject and spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was unclear whether the hackers were foreign or domestic. \n As the Nov. 8 vote nears, there are heightened concerns that foreign hackers might undermine voter confidence in the integrity of U.S. elections. Federal officials and many cybersecurity experts have said it would be nearly impossible for hackers to alter an election's outcome because election systems are decentralized and generally not connected to the internet. \n \"We must remain vigilant and continue to address these challenges head on,\" Johnson said. \"These challenges aren't just in the future.

{"date": "October 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n More than a thousand people gather at an encampment near North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux reservation. \n BISMARCK, N.D. >> The sprawling encampment that's a living protest against the four-state Dakota Access pipeline has most everything it needs to be self-sustaining \u2014 food, firewood, fresh water and shelter. Everything, that is, except permission to be on the federal land in North Dakota. \n Federal officials say they won't evict the Oceti Sakowin, or Seven Council Fires camp, due to free speech reasons, even though it's on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers that many Native Americans believe is still rightfully owned by the Standing Rock Sioux under a nearly 150-year-old treaty. \n \"We're not leaving until we defeat this big black snake,\" camp spokesman Cody Hall said of the pipeline. \n But residents in the area have expressed feeling unsafe and frustrated with how the protest has swelled to scores of self-described \"water protectors\" who have joined the tribe's fight, and Republican U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer \u2014 North Dakota's lone voice in the House \u2014 says the camp is illegal. He blames the agency for looking the other way. \n \"If that camp was full of people advocating for fossil fuels, they would have been removed by now,\" Cramer said. \"There is some discretionary enforcement going on.\" \n The camp is the overflow from smaller private and permitted protest sites nearby and began growing in August. The gathering has been called the largest gathering of Native American tribes in a century, all there to protest Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners' $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline, which tribal officials believe threatens sacred sites and a river that's a source of water for millions. \n Corps spokeswoman Eileen Williamson said the agency is \"encouraging\" people to relocate to areas where there is a permit, such as a nearby smaller camp where demonstrators have been allowed to legally protest on federal lands managed by the agency. \n \"We don't have the physical ability to go out and evict people \u2014 it gives the appearance of not protecting free speech,\" she said. \"Our hands are really tied.\" \n Cramer believes the \"bigger problem\" of the camp is \"the illegal activity that may be orchestrated from there\" \u2014 meaning a base to launch interference with pipeline construction miles away. About 95 people have been arrested in several pipeline protests \u2014 some as far as 70 miles away from the camp \u2014 since early August, but none at the camp itself. Protesters deny state officials' charge, with Hall saying the camp promotes \"peaceful\" protest. \n \"People don't leave from the camp with malicious intent to do harm,\" Hall said. \"There are always going to be a few bad eggs in any group you can't the message to.\" \n Ranchers and farmers in the area are wary of the growing number of protesters and are fearful of damage to their fields and pastures, Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said. \n \"We've had several reports of people down there getting stopped on the road and being intimidated to hay that has been stolen to grazing animals without permission,\" he said. \n Matthew Rebenitsch, who has a ranch just a few miles from the encampment, said he and his neighbors worry about talking publicly about the situation. \n \"To be honest, no one around here wants to say anything because we're afraid they will come and threaten us,\" he said. \"I'll say this, every rancher around here is packing and people are locking their doors \u2014 and no one has ever locked a door in their entire life.\" \n Republican state Rep. James Schmidt, who also farms and ranches nearby, said he and his neighbors are more cautious. \n \"I'm starting to see a lot more guns in the back of pickup trucks. All it is going to take is one incident and emotions are going to overtake the situation,\" he said. \n Complicating the issue is a grazing lease on that land. The renter, David Meyer, is responsible for the condition of the land. He could enforce his lease and have people removed, Williamson said, but hasn't requested any intervention. Meyer recently sold part of his historic Cannonball Ranch to Energy Transfer Partners for an undisclosed price; he hasn't returned telephone calls from The Associated Press seeking comment. \n The Standing Rock Sioux has challenged the Army Corps of Engineers' decision to grant permits for the pipeline that is intended to carry North Dakota oil to Illinois. Due to a federal court decision, construction has stopped within 20 miles on either side of Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir that is near the encampment. The Departments of Justice, Army and Interior also has said it will \"reconsider any of its previous decisions\" on land that borders or is under the lake. \n Hall, a member of South Dakota's Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, said the Sioux \"never ceded\" the land on which they're camping. He said they are preparing to stay through the winter by stockpiling firewood, heating stoves and warmer clothes. But there'll be no permanent structures built, Hall said. \n \"We will leave this camp as we found it,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Feds say they won't evict sprawling pipeline protest camp"}

{"date": "October 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This NOAA satellite image taken Saturday, Oct. 1, 2016 at 12:45 AM EDT shows well defined Hurricane Matthew continuing to slowly move westward at about 7 MPH across the Caribbean. Recent reconnaissance missions have revealed max sustained wind speeds up to 160 MPH, bringing Matthew up to a category 5 hurricane. Some of the outer bands can be seen pushing into Hispaniola, as well as Venezuela and Columbia. Matthew is expected to begin its northward turn over the next few days, largely impacting Jamaica next. \n KINGSTON, Jamaica >> One of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes in recent history weakened a little on Saturday as it drenched coastal Colombia and roared across the Caribbean on a course that still puts Jamaica, Haiti and Cuba in the path of potentially devastating winds and rain. \n Matthew briefly reached the top hurricane classification, Category 5, and was the strongest Atlantic hurricane since Felix in 2007. \n The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said Matthew's winds had slipped from a peak of 160 mph to a still-devastating 145 mph and it was expected to reach the eastern part of Jamaica on Monday. \n The forecast track would carry it across Cuba and into the Bahamas, with an outside chance of a brush with Florida, though that would be several days away. \"It's too early to rule out what impacts, if any, would occur in the United States and Florida,\" said Dennis Feltgen, a spokesman at the Hurricane Center. \n As Matthew skimmed past the northern tip of South America there were reports of heavy flooding and at least one death \u2014 the second attributed to the storm. \n Authorities said at least 18 houses were damaged along the La Guajira peninsula of Colombia, which has been suffering from a multi-year drought. They said a 67-year-old man was swept away to his death by a flash flood in an area where it hadn't rained for four years. \n Local TV broadcast images of cars and tree trunks surging though flooded streets in coastal areas. \n Colombian authorities closed access to beaches and urged residents living near the ocean to move inland in preparation for storm surges that they said would be most intense on Saturday. \n There was also concern that heavy rain across much of the country could dampen turnout for Sunday's nationwide referendum on a historic peace accord between the government and leftist rebels. \n In Jamaica, high surf began pounding the coast and flooding temporarily closed the road linking the capital to its airport. Carl Ferguson, head of the marine police, said people were starting to heed calls to relocate from small islands and areas near rural waterways. \n Many also began stocking up for the emergency. \n \"I left work to pick up a few items, candles, tin stuff, bread,\" 41-year-old Angella Wage said at a crowded store in the Half Way Tree area of the capital, Kingston. \"We can never be too careful.\" \n Feltgen said storm force winds and rain will arrive well before the center of the storm. Jamaicans \"basically have daylight today, they have tonight and they have daylight tomorrow to take care of what needs to be done,\" he said. \n Jamaicans are accustomed to intense storms, but Hurricane Matthew looked particularly threatening. At its peak, it was more powerful than Hurricane Gilbert, which made landfall on the island in September 1988 and was the most destructive storm in the country's modern history. \n \"Hurricane Matthew could rival or possibly exceed Gilbert if the core of the strongest winds does actually move over Jamaica,\" said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist and spokesman for the hurricane center in Miami. \"There is no certainty of that at this point.\" \n Forecasters said rainfall totals could reach 10 to 15 inches (25 to 38 centimeters) with isolated maximum amounts of 25 inches in Jamaica and southwestern Haiti. \n Kingston, in the southeastern corner of Jamaica, is expected to experience flooding. The government issued a hurricane watch on Friday, and a tropical storm watch was issued for Haiti's southwest coast form the southern border it shares with the Dominican Republic to the capital of Port-au-Prince. \n In Haiti, civil protection officials broadcast warnings of a coming storm surge and big waves, saying the country would be \"highly threatened\" from the approaching system over the next 72 hours. They urged families to prepare emergency food and water kits. \n Emergency management authorities banned boating starting Saturday, particularly along the impoverished country's southern coastline, but numerous fishing skiffs could still be seen off the south coast. \n As of 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), the storm was centered about 390 miles southeast of Kingston. It was moving west at 6 mph. \n Hurricane-force winds extended outward up to 45 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles. \n Matthew caused at least one death when it entered the Caribbean on Wednesday.

{"date": "October 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump visits the Kent County Republican Headquarters, Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, in Grand Rapids, Mich. \n GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. >> Donald Trump is encouraging voters to check out a \"sex tape\" featuring the former beauty queen with whom he's feuding. Hillary Clinton's campaign is suggesting that a better rental is the adult film in which Trump himself appears. \n The Republican nominee's pre-dawn Twitter tirade tore into the 1996 Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, a Venezuela-born woman whose weight gain Trump has said created terrible problems for the pageant he owned at the time. Clinton had cited Trump's treatment of Machado near the end of their first debate, and Trump has spent days revisiting his complaints about Machado. \n \"Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?\" read a tweet Trump posted at 5:30 a.m., one in a series of attacks on her. \n The \"sex tape\" tweet apparently referred to footage from a Spanish reality show in 2005 in which Machado was a contestant and appeared on camera in bed with a male contestant. The images are grainy and do not include nudity, though Machado later acknowledged in the Hispanic media that she was having sex in the video. \n Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate? \n Muddying the waters: an explicit 2000 Playboy video with a cameo by Trump. In a short clip posted on the website BuzzFeed, Trump pours a bottle of champagne on a Playboy-branded limo on a New York street, surrounded by a gaggle of women. \n \"There's been a lot of talk about sex tapes today and in a strange turn of events only one adult film has emerged today, and its star is Donald Trump,\" said Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill, adding he hadn't seen the film. \n Meanwhile, Trump's campaign accused the media and Clinton of colluding to set him up for fresh condemnation, to which Clinton retorted, \"His latest twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him.\" \n Machado herself took to Facebook to say Trump's tweets were part of a pattern of \"demoralizing women,\" calling them \"cheap lies with bad intentions.\" Planned Parenthood said it showed that Trump's \"misogyny knows no bounds.\" And Clinton said they showed anew why someone with Trump's temperament \"should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes.\" \n With less than 40 days left in the election, Trump's broadside threw his campaign into a fresh round of second-guessing the candidate's instincts and confusion about what to do next. To believers in traditional political norms, it seemed like the opposite of what was needed to win over females, Hispanics and young Americans whose support could well determine the election. \n Shaming Machado over intimate details from her past could be particularly risky as Trump tries to win over more female voters, many of whom are turned away by such personal attacks. It also risks calling further attention to the thrice-married Trump's own history with women. \n What kind of a man, Clinton asked, \"stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories?\" \n Even Trump's most vocal allies seemed at a loss for words. \n \"He's being Trump. I don't have any comment beyond that,\" said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a top supporter. Generally chatty and occasionally critical of Trump, Gingrich said tersely that Trump sometimes does \"strange things,\" but that Clinton lies. \"I'll let you decide which is worse for America.\" \n But Trump's inner circle followed his lead by refusing to concede any missteps. Trump did not mention the tweets Friday evening as he rallied supporters in Michigan. Instead, he returned to Twitter to invoke Clinton's famous ad from her 2008 campaign portraying her as the best candidate to pick up an urgent call at the White House at 3 a.m. \n \"For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!\" Trump wrote. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Talk of sex tapes takes presidential campaign on sordid turn"}

{"date": "October 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Pope Francis, right, holds his pastoral staff as he celebrates a Mass in Tbilisi's stadium, Georgia, on Saturday, Oct. 1, 2016. The pontiff is traveling to Georgia and Azerbaijan for a three-day visit. \n TBILISI, Georgia >> Pope Francis' efforts to improve relations with the Georgian Orthodox Church suffered a public setback Saturday after the patriarchate decided not to send an official delegation to his Mass and repeated that Orthodox faithful cannot participate in Catholic services. \n Francis nevertheless pressed on with his agenda, insisting that Catholics must never try to convert Orthodox and bowing in prayer alongside the Orthodox patriarch after they both lit a candle in the Orthodox spiritual headquarters. He called for the historical divisions that have \"lacerated\" Christianity to be healed through patience, trust and dialogue. \n Saturday's developments on the second and final day of Francis' visit to Georgia reflected the \"one step forward, two steps back\" progress that often accompanies the Vatican's outreach to Orthodox and other Christian churches. \n On Sunday, Francis heads to largely Shiite Muslim Azerbaijan, where the Catholic Church enjoys good relations with the government despite allegations in the West of human rights abuses and suppression of dissent. \n In the run-up to Francis' Caucasus visit, the Vatican spokesman had said the Georgian Orthodox Patriarchate would send a delegation to the Mass in a Tbilisi sports stadium \"in a sign of the rapport between the two churches\" \u2014 suggesting that the chill that had clouded the 1999 visit of St. John Paul II to Georgia had warmed slightly. \n And Francis received a unexpectedly warm welcome from the Orthodox leader upon his arrival Friday, with Patriarch Ilia calling Francis my \"dear brother\" and toasting him saying: \"May the Lord bless the Catholic Church of Rome.\" \n But Orthodox patriarchate spokeswoman Nato Asatiani said Saturday that the delegation had stayed away \"by mutual agreement.\" The patriarchate updated a statement on its website saying that \"as long as there are dogmatic differences between our churches, Orthodox believers will not participate in their prayers.\" \n The decision apparently came after Francis' arrival Friday in Tbilisi was met with protests of hard-line Orthodox opposed to any ecumenical initiatives by their church. \n On Saturday, about 100 members of the hard-line group Union of Orthodox Parents demonstrated outside the stadium where Francis celebrated Mass. \n \"It's typical proselytizing,\" protester Father David Klividze. \"Can you imagine how it would be if a Sunni preacher came to Shiite Iran and conducted prayers in a stadium or somewhere else? Such a thing could not be. Therefore, we are speaking against this.\" \n Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said the Vatican accepted the Orthodox decision not to attend, which he said had been conveyed to the papal delegation Friday night. Orthodox law didn't allow for the participation of the delegation, he said. \n Francis had been scheduled to personally greet the delegation at the end of the Mass. Instead, Francis thanked \"those Orthodox faithful\" who were present. \n Francis insisted that Catholics must never seek to convert Orthodox, saying they are Catholics' brothers and sisters, children of the same God. \n \"Proselytism is a grave sin against ecumenism,\" Francis told Catholic priests and seminarians after his Mass. \"One must not proselytize the Orthodox.\" \n Organizers had said they expected the Meskhi sports stadium, capacity 27,000, to be full for the Mass, but only a few thousand people took their seats in the stands by the time Francis entered on his popemobile and began the celebration. There was no immediate explanation for the low turnout of Catholic faithful on the brilliantly sunny day. \n Georgia is overwhelmingly Orthodox, with less than 3 percent of the population \u2014 or about 112,000 people \u2014 Catholic, according to Vatican statistics. \n Other than Georgian President Giorgi Margvelashvili, there were no prominent Georgian politicians on hand for the Mass. That suggested that with a parliamentary election next week, politicians might have been reluctant to alienate any hard-line Orthodox voters. \n Francis' main ecumenical event of the day was an evening visit to the seat of the Orthodox church, where he pressed his call for improved Catholic-Orthodox ties. \n The Orthodox cathedral is located in Mtskheta, the spiritual capital of Georgia and where Christianity took root in the 4th century. The 11th-century Svetitskhoveli cathedral, one of three Mtskheta monuments on the UNESCO world heritage list, is said to have housed Christ's tunic. \n Francis referred to the precious relic Saturday in reference to the fibers that bind all Christians. \n \"The holy tunic, a mystery of unity, exhorts us to feel deep pain over the historical divisions which have arisen among Christians: these are the true and real lacerations that wound the Lord's flesh,\" he said in the cathedral. Christian hope, he said, \"gives us the incentive to believe that differences can be healed and obstacles removed; it invites us never to miss opportunities for encounter and dialogue and to protect and together improve what already exists.\" \n While hardliners in the Georgian church opposed the visit, other Orthodox welcomed it. \n \"For the Christian world and not only, the visit of the pope is very significant,\" said Amiran Tsiklauri, a resident of Tbilisi. \"The pope is not only spiritual leader for Catholics but also the person who calls and urges for peace around the world.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Orthodox delegation stays away from pope's Mass"}

Kolff recently appeared in Battery Park at the southern tip of Manhattan, erected a stone's throw from a handful of other somber memorials to soldiers, sailors and mariners lost at sea or on the battlefield. \n But if you can't recall the disaster it could be because the artist behind the memorial, Joseph Reginella, made the whole thing up. \n The 250-pound monument, which depicts a Staten Island ferry being dragged down by giant octopus tentacles, is part of a multi-layered hoax that also includes a sophisticated website, a documentary, fabricated newspaper articles and glossy fliers directing tourists to a phantom Staten Island Ferry Disaster Memorial Museum across the harbor. \n It took Reginella six months to put it together. \n He said the idea for the project came to him while he was taking his 11-year-old nephew from Florida on the ferry between Manhattan and Staten Island. \n \"He was asking me all kinds of crazy questions like if the waters were shark-infested,\" he said. \"I said 'No, but you know what did happen in the '60s? One of these boats got pulled down by a giant octopus.\" \n \"The story just rolled off the top of my head\" and the idea for a mock memorial was born. \n It evolved to become \"a multimedia art project and social experience \u2014 not maliciously \u2014 about how gullible people are,\" said Reginella, who creates artworks for store windows and amusement parks. \n The monument never stays in one spot for more than two days \"because the city will come and take it away,\" he said, adding that it takes two people to break it down. \n \"It's definitely an experience when you see people who don't know about it. They get this strange look on their face, they stare out at the water and walk away,\" he said. \"I sit close by with a fishing pole and fish. I eavesdrop on the conversations.\" \n Sometimes, he said, when he overhears people saying, \"How come nobody has ever heard of this?\" he'll interject, offering that the disaster happened on Nov. 22, 1963, a day that the news was dominated by the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. \n \"It creates a plausibility for them, and they shake their head 'Maybe.'\" \n Puzzled tourists looking for the memorial museum on Staten Island and its supposed collection of wreckage with \"strange suction-cup-shaped marks\" sometimes wonder into the Snug Harbor Cultural Center asking for directions. \n The staff at the nearby Staten Island Museum admits it too was puzzled at first. \n \"We kind of scratched our heads and said we don't know where it is and started looking further into it, and realized it was a hoax,\" said spokeswoman Rachel Somma. \n \"Most people have the feeling that it's not a reality. It's a treasure hunt for them. It's fun. That's what we love about it. \u2026 It's great that it gets people out here,\" she added. \n Melanie Giuliano, who produced a mock documentary for the monument's website, used her father in the role of a maritime expert and her neighbor as an eyewitness. Reginella's wife's co-worker served as the narrator. \n \"I thought it was an insane idea but I thought it was hilarious,\" said the videographer and filmmaker. \n One thing about the preposterous story is real. There really was a Cornelius G. Kolff ferry. It ferried passengers for 36 years before becoming a stationary floating dorm for Rikers Island inmates. It was sold for scrap in 2003. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tall fish tale: Tourists fooled by octopus ferry disaster"}

On Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2016, an El Cajon police officer shot and killed Alfred Olango, a Ugandan refugee who lived in the city. \n El Cajon, Calif. \u00bb The family of an unarmed black man fatally shot by police is like thousands who have transformed the suburban San Diego city of El Cajon: Refugees from a strife-torn country. \n The family of 38-year-old Alfred Olango fled Uganda to a refugee camp and then came to the United States in 1991. On Tuesday, Olango, a father of two girls, was killed by an officer who responded to calls from Olango's sister saying her brother was acting erratically and wandering into traffic. \n He was shot multiple times after police say he pulled something from his pocket that they thought could be a weapon and pointed it at the officer. The object turned out to be a 4-inch electronic cigarette device. \n The killing and subsequent angry protests have brought attention to El Cajon, a diverse, largely blue-collar city of 104,000 people that over the past two decades has absorbed a surge of refugees, many from Iraq and more recently from Syria. \n Some signs on Main Street \u2014 a vibrant mix of furniture stores, clothing shops and restaurants \u2014 are in Arabic. Spanish is the primary language for nearly one of every four students in the Cajon Valley Union School District, while Arabic and Chaldean \u2014 spoken by Iraqi Christians \u2014 is the main language for more than one in 10. \n Rob Goss, part-owner of a boxing gym on Main Street and a city resident for more than 10 years, credits Chaldeans for opening markets, gas stations and other businesses that have fueled economic growth. \n \"We're still in a curve of trying to get people on their own feet but it's happening,\" said Goss, 47. \"They're adapting.\" \n The influx has bred some tension. Mayor Mark Lewis was forced to resign in 2013 for derogatory remarks about Chaldeans. \n \"First time they come over here, it doesn't take them too long to learn where all the freebies are at,\" he said and then later apologized. \n David Carter, a 64-year-old former construction worker who moved from Northern California four years ago to join his sister, is bothered by the subsidies that refugees receive while he struggles with cuts to government-funded health benefits that cover prescription drug, dental and other services. \n \"I don't resent the people but I resent what the government has allowed them,\" Carter said while relaxing outside the public library. \"Our ancestors had to bust their butts to get anything. That's the American dream.\" \n Jaffar Rahem, a 27-year-old Iraqi who works at Wal-Mart, said he came to El Cajon last year with his wife and two children because the U.S. is safer for them. He stayed for about a year in Utah and liked the people but said he moved to El Cajon to follow his father. \n El Cajon, which means \"drawer\" or \"big box\" in Spanish, was incorporated in 1912 and became the largest of a swath of San Diego suburbs known as East County. Located in a valley, the absence of ocean breezes brings sweltering summers but home prices are on the lower end of the San Diego market, making it a draw for many families. Annual per-capita income is $20,430, well below San Diego County's $31,043. \n The city, with a downtown community center named for Ronald Reagan, has long been bedrock Republican but the party's edge over Democrats in voter registration has narrowed to 3 percentage points. \n There is no precise count of Iraqis in El Cajon but they have made San Diego their second-most popular metropolitan destination in the U.S. after Detroit. Whites make up a shrinking majority, while about a quarter of the city's residents are Latino, 6 percent are black, and 4 percent are Asian. \n Refugees take English classes at the Main Street office of the International Rescue Committee, one of nine resettlement organizations in the country. \n David Murphy, the committee's executive director in San Diego, said recently that refugees are often assigned to cities where they have family and friends or where there is an established community of immigrants who share their culture. \n Last month, the 10,000th Syrian to resettle across the U.S. under a year-old program arrived in El Cajon. \n Al Espinosa, a retired carpenter of part-Mexican descent and a resident since 1980, was heartbroken by Olango's death and how it linked the city to other places such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that have seen unrest after police shot and killed black men. \n \"I thought this would never happen here,\" said Espinosa, 69. \"Now we're on the world stage.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police killing shakes diverse San Diego suburb"}

{"date": "October 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore testifies during his ethics trial before the Alabama Court of the Judiciary at the Alabama Judicial Building in Montgomery, Ala., on Wednesday Sept. 28, 2016. He is accused of encouraging judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling legalizing gay marriage. \n Montgomery, Ala. \u00bb Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore was removed from the bench Friday for defying the U.S. Supreme Court on gay marriage, more than a decade after he was ousted for disobeying a federal order to take down a 2 \u00bd-ton monument to the Ten Commandments. \n The nine-member Alabama Court of the Judiciary suspended Moore for the remainder of his term. Although the court stopped short of outright removing him as they did in 2003, the punishment has the same effect, ending his period as Alabama's top jurist. \n The judiciary court ruled that Moore defied law already clearly settled by the high court's Obergefell vs. Hodges ruling when he told Alabama's probate judges six months later that they were still bound by a 2015 state court order to deny marriage licenses to gays and lesbians. \n \"Beyond question, at the time he issued the January 6, 2016, order, Chief Justice Roy Moore knew about Obergefell and its clear holding that the United States Constitution protects the right of same-sex couples to marry,\" the court wrote in the unanimous decision. \n They said Moore also flouted a federal judge's order that enjoined the judges from enforcing Alabama's same-sex marriage ban after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision. \n The 50-page decision indicated that a majority of justices wanted to completely remove Moore, not just suspend him without pay, but they lacked unanimous agreement. \n Moore told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that he was shocked by the decision. \n \"I think it's clear it was politically motivated,\" he said. \n In a separate statement, Moore called his removal \"a politically motivated effort by radical homosexual and transgender groups to remove me as chief justice of the Supreme Court because of outspoken opposition to their immoral agenda.\" \n With Moore's punishment, leaders of two of Alabama's three branches of government have been removed for ethics violations this year, and a third is possible. The Republican House speaker was removed this summer. A legislative committee is weighing whether Gov. Robert Bentley should be impeached over a scandal involving a top aide. \n The president of the civil rights organization that filed complaints against Moore in 2003 and 2016 praised the decision as a victory for the state. \n \"Moore was elected to be a judge, not a preacher. It's something that he never seemed to understand,\" said Richard Cohen, of the Southern Poverty Law Center. \n \"My parting words are good riddance to the Ayatollah of Alabama,\" Cohen said. \n Moore's attorney, Mat Staver of Liberty Counsel, called it a \"miscarriage of justice\" and said they will appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court. \n \"The rule of law should trump political agendas. Sadly, today that is not the case. What this decision tells us today is that Montgomery has a long way to go to weed out abuse of political power and restore the rule of law,\" said Staver, who also represented Kentucky clerk Kim Davis in her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples. \n Moore, 69, had already been suspended from the bench since May, when the state's Judicial Inquiry Commission accused him of violating judicial ethics. By the end of his term in 2019, he'll be beyond the age limit of 70 for judges, unless voters raise the limit in November. \n The Republican judge has long been a polarizing figure, known for conservative legal views that sometimes seem to mix with theology. \n Soon after his first election as chief justice, he installed the boulder-sized Ten Commandments monument in the rotunda of the state judicial building. Moore called the federal judge's order to remove it unlawful and said it infringed on his right to \"acknowledge God.\" \n Moore's stands have won him loyal followers and passionate critics. Supporters gave him a standing ovation as he entered the ornate courtroom to testify on Wednesday, while critics waved rainbow flags and signs outside saying \"Y'all means All,\" and more simply, \"Bye.\" \n Testifying in his defense, Moore contended that his January order merely intended to clarify that the Alabama Supreme Court still had to decide what to do with its earlier order upholding the state's gay marriage ban in light of the Obergefell decision. \n \"All of told them was the order was still in effect,\" Moore said Friday, adding that he \"didn't tell them to disobey\" the federal injunction against Alabama's same-sex marriage ban. \n But lawyers for the Judicial Inquiry Commission told the court that Moore \u2014 who once referred to judicial rulings allowing gay marriage as \"tyranny\" \u2014 had been on a mission to block gay marriage in Alabama. \n \"The Chief Justice learned nothing from his first removal. He continues to defy the law,\" attorney John Carroll argued. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Alabama chief justice suspended for defiance on gay marriage"}

The redrafted regulations will be the subject of a public hearing next Oct. 19 in Sacramento. \n California regulators have changed course and opened a pathway for the public to get self-driving cars of the future that lack a steering wheel or pedals. \n It's not going to happen immediately \u2014 automakers and tech companies are still testing prototypes. \n But, in a shift, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles said in a revision of draft regulations released late Friday that the most advanced self-driving cars would no longer be required to have a licensed driver if federal officials deem them safe enough. \n The redrafted regulations will be the subject of a public hearing Oct. 19 in Sacramento. \n The DMV has been wrestling for several years with how to oversee the emerging technology. \n In December, the agency released an initial draft of self-driving car regulations that required a licensed driver in any self-driving vehicle. The industry reacted with great disappointment, as the ultimate vision of many companies is a car that has no wheel or pedals. That approach is based on the argument that humans are not very good at driving, and anyway cannot be relied on as a backup to a car that typically drives itself but might fail in a way that required a person in the driver's seat who might be distracted or even asleep to snap to attention. \n The DMV's new document coincides with the release last week of a 112-page federal proposal under which any self-driving car should pass a 15-point safety assessment before the public can get ahold of it. Among other things, the safety assessment asks automakers to document how the car detects and avoids objects and pedestrians, how hardened it is against cyberattacks and what how its backup systems will cope should the software fail. In incorporating the federal approach, California dropped a proposal that a third-party company certify the safety of self-driving cars. \n The new draft regulations released Friday include several other new provisions. Among them is wording that would prohibit advertising vehicles with lower levels of automation \u2014 such as Tesla Motors' Autopilot, which on divided highways can keep a car's lane, brake and accelerate on the understanding that a person is paying attention all the time \u2014 from being advertised as \"autonomous\" or \"self-driving.\" \n The company that stands to gain the most from the state's embrace of cars without a wheel or pedals is Alphabet, where the Google self-driving car project envisions cars that allow no human control other than a start and emergency stop button. A spokesman for the Google self-driving car project did not have a comment Friday on the changes to the proposed regulations. \n ___ \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "California opens pathway for cars that lack steering wheel"}
