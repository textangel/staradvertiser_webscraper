{"date": "October 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos delivers a statement to the press after meeting with former President Alvaro Uribe and other opposition leaders at the presidential palace in Bogota, Colombia. \n OSLO, Norway >> Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for his efforts to end a five-decades-long civil war that has killed more than 200,000 people in the South American country. \n The award came just days after Colombian voters narrowly rejected the peace deal that Santos helped bring about, and Nobel authorities conspicuously left out his counterpart, Rodrigo Londono, the leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, from the honor. \n The Norwegian Nobel Committee said that voters' rejection doesn't mean the peace process is dead. \n \"The referendum was not a vote for or against peace,\" it said. \"What the 'No' side rejected was not the desire for peace, but a specific peace agreement.\" \n Santos and Londono, better known by his nom de guerre Timochenko, signed the peace deal last month, ending a half-century of hostilities, only to see a major setback in the shock vote against the agreement in a referendum six days later. \n The Norwegian Nobel Committee said it believes that Santos, \"despite the 'No' majority vote in the referendum, has brought the bloody conflict significantly closer to a peaceful solution.\" \n It said the award should also be seen \"as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the parties who have contributed to the peace process.\" \n The agreement was reached during more than five years of at first secret negotiations in Cuba. \n Santos, 65, is an unlikely peacemaker. The Harvard-educated scion of one of Colombia's wealthiest families, as defense minister a decade ago, he was responsible for some of the FARC's biggest military setbacks. Those included a 2008 cross-border raid into Ecuador that took out a top rebel commander and the stealth rescue of three Americans held captive by the rebels for more than five years. \n Under the peace deal he negotiated, rebels who turn over their weapons and confess to war crimes will be spared time in jail. FARC will also get 10 seats in congress through 2026 to smooth their transition into a political movement. \n Santos and Londono met only twice during the entire peace process: last year when they put the final touches on the most-controversial section of the accord \u2014 the part dealing with how guerrillas would be punished for war crimes \u2014 and again last month to sign the accord before an audience of world leaders and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. \n It was the first time the peace prize went to Latin America since 1992, when the committee awarded Guatemalan human rights activist Rigoberta Menchu. \n A record 376 candidates were nominated for this year's award. \n Last year's peace prize went to Tunisia's National Dialogue Quartet for its efforts to build a pluralistic democracy. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Colombian leader Juan Manuel Santos wins Nobel Peace Prize"}

{"date": "October 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Michael Blackman, left, and Sam Titus board up a bar a few blocks off the beach Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016, in Daytona Beach, Fla. Hurricane Matthew continues to churn its way toward Florida's east coast. The bar is planning on staying open during Matthew. \n TALLAHASSEE, Fla. >> Like other Americans, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are steering clear of battleground Florida, where Hurricane Matthew threatened to wreak havoc on the final stretch of presidential campaigning. \n The campaigns rushed Thursday to move staff and volunteers, close offices and cancel events in the path of the storm. And as many Floridians heeded calls to evacuate, both candidates began the delicate and difficult task of pursuing votes during a crisis. \n \"Even if you want to do politics, no one is there to listen,\" said Steve Schale, a Democratic consultant who directed or advised Barack Obama's campaigns in the state in 2008 and 2012. \n Clinton's campaign asked the state for more time to register voters \u2014 a request Florida Gov. Rick Scott rejected \u2014 and the Trump team pulled its negative TV ads. \n \"Please know that we are praying for you and everyone in the path,\" Trump said Thursday night at a town hall event in New Hampshire. \"You've got to take care of yourself, you've got to get out of the area, you've got to listen.\" \n The hurricane is expected to hit Trump's prized Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Trump had spoken with employees to ensure they are safe and are following instructions from local officials. \n Clinton, who was speaking at fundraisers in New York, tweeted: \"Hurricane Matthew is a major storm. \u2026 Stay safe Florida.\" \n Both stayed far away, preparing for their second debate, a town hall-style faceoff on Sunday in St. Louis. \n Along the Southeast coast, Matthew was expected to bring dangerous conditions to Georgia, South Carolina and, possibly, North Carolina. But it was the impact on vote-rich Florida, a must-win state for Trump, that had the campaigns on high alert. The hurricane closed in just as both sides ramped up their early-vote push and just days before a voter registration deadline. \n Vote-by-mail ballots are being sent to voters across the state this week, leaving the potential for ballots to arrive just as voters temporarily abandon their homes. So far, a record 2.5 million people \u2014 nearly one-third of those who voted in 2012 \u2014 have made requests for the early ballots. \n Scott said Thursday evening that he would not consider extending the Oct. 11 voter registration deadline. \n \"Everyone has had a lot of time to register,\" Scott said, adding, \"I don't intend to make any changes.\" \n Scott, a Republican, is a strong supporter of Trump and chairman of a super PAC running Clinton-bashing television ads. \n Officials said they were hoping that any disruption to voting would be less severe than with Superstorm Sandy, which struck New Jersey and New York just before the 2012 presidential election and kept many voters away from polls. \n At least half of Florida voters typically cast ballots early, either by mail or in person, compared with just a fraction in New York and New Jersey. \n Still, disruptions in Florida campaigning were immediate. \n In Palm Beach County, local Republican Chairman Michael Barnett said Matthew already had forced cancellations, including phone-bank operations and an event where Ivanka Trump was to have been the headliner. Local GOP officials also will miss an opportunity for outreach to Latino leaders, because an annual gala of a local Hispanic civic group was canceled. \n \"There is no good time, but this is just the worst time,\" Barnett said. \"Whatever happens, I think we can make up for the lost time, as long as we are not cleaning ourselves out from under a catastrophic mess.\" \n Democrats, too, prepared for high-power campaigning to grind to a halt in affected areas. Television advertising often fails to reach voters preoccupied by an impending storm and the aftermath. \n How and where to advertise became an immediate flashpoint between the campaigns. After Clinton ads were spotted on the Weather Channel, the Trump campaign accused her of a \"tone deaf\" attempt to capitalize on the situation. \n A Clinton spokesman said ads had been scheduled on local Weather Channel stations in Florida and other states. But the storm's potential severity prompted the campaign to cancel the Florida portion. \n The storm posed unusual challenges and opportunities for the candidates, particularly Trump, who is trying to prove his leadership. \n The New York businessman has sometimes appeared clumsy in his response to crises \u2014 including sending out tweets in which he seemed to pat himself on the back for predicting terror attacks. \n In the aftermath of the flooding in Louisiana earlier this year, Trump and his running mate, Mike Pence, rushed to the Baton Rouge area to tour the damage. During the trip, Trump criticized the president and later Clinton for failing to do the same, despite request from local officials for them to steer clear of the area. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump, Clinton campaigns watch for Matthew's impact on Fla."}

{"date": "October 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Marines from the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade wade through a creek after taking part in the joint US-Philippines amphibious landing exercise dubbed PHIBLEX Friday at Naval Education Training Command in San Antonio township, Zambales province northwest of Manila. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Tuesday photo, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, center, gestures as he poses with Philippine Army officers during his visit to the Army headquarters in suburban Taguig city, east of Manila, Philippines as U.S. and Philippine forces opened their first large scale combat exercises. \n MANILA, Philippines >> The Philippine defense chief said he told the U.S. military that plans for joint patrols and naval exercises in the disputed South China Sea have been put on hold, the first concrete break in defense cooperation after months of increasingly strident comments by the country's new president. \n Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana also said that 107 U.S. troops involved in operating surveillance drones against Muslim militants would be asked to leave the southern part of the country once the Philippines acquires those intelligence-gathering capabilities in the near future. \n President Rodrigo Duterte also wants to halt the 28 military exercises that are carried out with U.S. forces each year, Lorenzana said. Duterte has said he wants an ongoing U.S.-Philippine amphibious beach landing exercise to be the last in his six-year presidency as he backs away from what he views as too much dependence on the U.S. \n \"This year would be the last,\" Duterte said of military exercises involving the Americans in a speech Friday in southern Davao city where he lashed out at the U.S. anew and repeated his readiness to be ousted from office for his hard-line stance. \n \"For as long as I am there, do not treat us like a doormat because you'll be sorry for it,\" Duterte said. \"I will not speak with you. I can always go to China.\" \n In Washington, State Department spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. government is not aware of any official notification on curtailing military exercises. He said the U.S. remains focused on its security commitments to Philippines, with which it has a mutual defense treaty. \n \"We think comments like this, whether they are or will be backed up by actual action or not, are really at odds with the closeness of the relationships that we have with the people of the Philippines and which we fully intend to continue,\" Kirby told reporters. \n Duterte, who took office in June and describes himself as a leftist politician, has had an uneasy relationship with the U.S., his country's former colonial master. \n Duterte has lashed out against U.S. government criticism of his deadly crackdown against illegal drugs, which has left more than 3,600 suspects dead in just three months, alarming Western governments and human rights groups. \n But while some Filipino officials have walked back on Duterte's sometimes crude anti-U.S. pronouncements \u2014 early this week he told President Barack Obama \"to go to hell\" \u2014 Lorenzana's comments show for the first time that the Duterte administration will act by rolling back cooperation with the U.S. military. \n With the turquoise backdrop of the South China Sea, U.S. Marines and allied Filipino combat forces barged ashore Friday on amphibious vessels in a mock assault on a Philippine beach in San Antonio town in northwestern Zambales province. \n Pounding rain prevented military aircraft from joining the beach assault drills, but the U.S. and Filipino forces managed to rapidly come on shore to take out a \"notional target,\" said Maj. Roger Hollenbeck, a U.S. military spokesman for the drills. \n Asked to comment on the possibility that the joint maneuvers will be the last under Duterte, Hollenbeck replied, \"If it's the last, so be it.\" \n \"I have nothing to do with that and we are going to continue to work together, we've got a great relationship,\" he said. \n Lorenzana said some U.S. military officials have expressed concern about where the countries' 65-year-old treaty alliance is headed under Duterte. \n Duterte's moves to limit the presence of visiting American troops will impede Washington's plans to expand the footprint of U.S. forces in Southeast Asia to counter China. \n \"President Duterte's shoot-from-the-hip style of parochial democracy is deeply troubling,\" said Carl Thayer, an expert on the South China Sea. \"If Duterte moves to curtail U.S. rotational military presence from bases in the Philippines, this would undermine the U.S. ability to deter China not only in defense of Philippines sovereignty but regional security as well.\" \n Despite the difficult stage in the countries' relations, Lorenzana remained optimistic that those ties would eventually bounce back. \n \"I think it's just going through these bumps on the road,\" Lorenzana told a news conference. \"Relationships sometimes go to this stage \u2026 but over time it will be patched up.\" \n Duterte's falling out with Washington will not necessarily spread to U.S. allies such as Japan, for example, which has committed to deliver patrol ships for the Philippine coast guard and has signed a deal to lease five small surveillance planes the country can use to bolster its territorial defense. The planes may arrive as early as next month, Lorenzana said. \n The U.S. and Japan have helped the Philippines develop its capabilities to safeguard and defend its territorial waters amid China's increasingly aggressive actions in the South China Sea. Under Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, the U.S. and Philippine militaries twice staged naval exercises near the disputed waters. \n While taking a critical stance on U.S. security policies, Duterte has reached out to China and Russia. Lorenzana said he has been ordered by Duterte to travel to Beijing and Moscow to discuss what defense equipment the Philippines can acquire from them. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philippines says no to U.S. patrols, will ask China for military aid"}

{"date": "October 6, 2016", "text": "THE FREE LANCE-STAR VIA AP / 2014 \n Josh Hardy hides his cards while playing Go Fish with his brothers Jude and Joe at the family's Fredericksburg home on Jan. 2, 2014. Hardy came home from the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. Nov. 18 after battling a deadly infection he developed after a bone marrow transplant. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb At age 7, Josh Hardy became the poster child for a movement to help desperately ill or dying patients access experimental therapies which, they hope, will save their lives. \n People around the world rallied 21/2 years ago when a small biotech company refused to provide the Fredericksburg, Va., boy, who had battled cancer since infancy, with an experimental drug that doctors believed could save Josh from a life-threatening infection. Within days, a social media campaign called #SaveJosh, sparked by his mother's anguished Facebook post and propelled by well-connected supporters, spurred thousands of people to contact the company, Chimerix Inc. of North Carolina, prompting it to release the drug. \n For a time, Josh recovered. But his body remained weakened by disease, and Josh died last month at age 10. \n Yet the #SaveJosh campaign has had an enduring effect on efforts to expand \"compassionate use\" of experimental therapies. \n Josh's story \u2014 and the plight of thousands of others facing life-threatening diseases with no government-approved therapies \u2014 has inspired multiple, sometimes conflicting efforts by government, industry and activists to make experimental medications more widely available. \n The Food and Drug Administration, whose staff initiated the clinical trial that provided Josh his medication, has reduced the time that doctors spend requesting an unapproved drug to just 45 minutes. The agency says it approves 99 percent of such applications, granting most requests in four days and emergency requests within hours. The agency is even considering hiring \"navigators\" to walk doctors through the process. \n Nonetheless, some patient advocates are leading a drive to provide access to experimental drugs without the FDA's help. \n Thirty-two states have passed laws designed to give patients the \"right to try\" an unapproved medication, by protecting doctors who provide such therapies from losing their state medical licenses. Republicans have included the right to try unapproved drugs in their national presidential platform. \n Christina Sandefur, executive vice president at the libertarian Goldwater Institute, which has coordinated right-to-try efforts, said terminally ill patients shouldn't have to ask for a \"permission slip\" from the FDA. \"If you are dying and you've exhausted all other options and this medication has passed basic safety testing, you should be able to work directly with the drug companies and your doctor without having to go through the FDA.\" \n Yet even some supporters of the right to try acknowledge the state laws have helped relatively few patients. \n Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, introduced a federal right-to-try bill in May as a way to bolster the state initiatives. At a hearing in September, Johnson said his bill \"simply says patients, who have no alternative and are facing death, should have the right to try to save their own lives \u2014 and the right to hope.\" \n The renewed interest in compassionate use \u2014 which first emerged as a national issue during the AIDS crisis of the 1980s \u2014 also has spurred pharmaceutical companies to ramp up \"expanded access\" programs. \n Some are concerned that social media campaigns give unfair advantages to families who are well-connected and media-savvy. Minorities, immigrants and people who aren't fluent in English could be less able to mount effective campaigns, said Alison Bateman-House, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Medical Center. She's been working with Johnson & Johnson to help ensure its compassionate use system allocates drugs fairly. \n Marathon Pharmaceuticals, which is developing a steroid to treat a fatal disease called Duchenne muscular dystrophy, has been working with patient advocacy groups to enroll patients in its compassionate use program. The Illinois company anticipates enrolling 800 patients by February in its expanded access program for the steroid, called deflazacort. \n While some drug developers were moved by Josh's plight, others were motivated by a fear of negative publicity, Bateman-House said. Almost overnight, Chimerix became a symbol of corporate indifference. Critics posted the home address of Chimerix executives online, and some received death threats. The company replaced its CEO within a month of the controversy. \n \"The majority of the pharmaceutical industry suddenly got terrified that they were going to be the next Chimerix,\" Bateman-House said. \n And while drug companies tend to look like the bad guys when they deny drug access, Bateman-House said there are legitimate reasons for caution. Experimental medications haven't been fully tested for safety and could make people with terminal illnesses die faster and in more pain. \n \"Companies worry about the risk,\" said Richard Klein, director of the FDA's patient liaison program. His story was \"really public and really in the limelight. If he had not done well, what would have happened to that tiny little company? They would have been at a tremendous disadvantage.\" \n Advocates for people with life-threatening illnesses disagree about the best way to expand access to experimental therapies. \n Laura McLinn, an Indianapolis mother whose 7-year-old suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, supports right-to-try laws. She championed Indiana's right-to-try legislation, and her son, Jordan, stood next to Gov. Mike Pence when he signed the bill into law. \n Although Jordan looks perpetually cheerful, dressed for public photographs in a firefighter costume and helmet, he's already beginning to decline. Jordan gets tired faster than he used to. He cries at night when his body hurts. He falls and can't keep up with his friends. \"He can't do the things they are dong at recess and he doesn't understand why,\" McLinn told a Senate committee in February. \n In spite of the McLinn family's support for the right-to-try movement, Indiana's law hasn't helped Jordan access any experimental therapies. \n Although Jordan is taking an unapproved steroid, McLinn hasn't accessed it through right-to-try laws. She orders the medication through the mail from an overseas manufacturer. The FDA permits these orders under certain circumstances, such as when patients with serious disease have no alternatives. \n McLinn said Jordan's best hope for a medical breakthrough will come from a traditional clinical trial, overseen by the FDA and run by a Massachusetts pharmaceutical company, Sarepta Therapeutics, which won approval in September for another muscular dystrophy drug. McLinn said she hopes her son will begin the trial within months. \n Some say right-to-try laws have accomplished little in the past two years.  \n \"The right-to-try laws are something that a lot of families and patients are interested in, but they don't really have any teeth in them,\" said Dr. Valerie Cwik, executive vice president and chief medical and scientific officer at the Muscular Dystrophy Association. \n Right-to-try laws wouldn't have helped Josh Hardy, because the laws don't require drug developers to actually make their medications available, Bateman-House said. The laws also don't require that insurance companies pay for the treatments. The movement's main intent is to undermine the FDA, Bateman-House said.  \n \"The cruel reality with the right-to-try legislation is that it will not grant patients the immediate access to treatments they desperately need,\" said Andrew McFadyen, executive director of the Isaac Foundation, a nonprofit based in Ontario, Canada, that funds research to fight MPS, the fatal genetic disease that afflicts his 12-year-old son. \n The first doctor to openly acknowledge using a state right-to-try law, Houston cancer specialist Ebrahim Delpassand, came forward in September at Johnson's hearing, where he testified via video. Delpassand said that he has given an unapproved drug, LU-177, to 78 patients with advanced neuroendocrine cancers under Texas's right-to-try law. \n Those numbers are dwarfed by the number granted expanded access by the FDA, which last year approved 1,262 requests for all drugs. The actual number of patients included in these FDA requests is much larger, because some requests were made on behalf of trials that include hundreds or even thousands of patients. \n For example, about 35,000 patients received the lung cancer drug Iressa through expanded access before that drug was approved, said Klein. \n At the Senate hearing, Johnson acknowledged that state right-to-try laws haven't produced as many big wins as supporters had hoped. \n Although state right-to-try laws protect doctors from losing their licenses if they prescribe unapproved drugs, physicians may be reluctant to use the laws, for fear of violating federal regulations, Johnson said. \n Even in a right-to-try state, doctors such as Delpassand \"are taking a huge risk\" in providing unapproved treatments, Johnson said. \"We need the federal law for the state laws to kick in. Until the federal government acts, the state laws are not effective.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n (Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service.

{"date": "October 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Traffic stacks up on I-75 North fleeing the coast and Hurricane Matthew on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016, near McDonough. \n CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. >> Hurricane Matthew's howling wind and driving rain pummeled Florida early Friday, starting what's expected to be a ruinous, dayslong battering of the Southeast coast. The strongest winds of 120 mph were just offshore, but Matthew's wrath still menaced more than 500 miles of coastline. \n Two million people were warned to flee inland as the most powerful storm to threaten the Atlantic coast in more than a decade charged toward Florida. Matthew left more than 280 dead in its wake across the Caribbean. \n \"This storm's a monster,\" Florida Gov. Rick Scott warned as Matthew started lashing the state. \"I'm going to pray for everybody's safety.\" \n The number of homes and businesses without power jumped by the hour as the storm edged closer to the coast. More than 200,000 were in the dark by early Friday. \n The winds picked up along Vero Beach, midway between West Palm Beach and Cape Canaveral, stripping away palm fronds, ripping awnings and blowing sand that stung the face. Waves crashed on the beach, and rain came in short bursts. \n As it moved north Thursday evening, Matthew stayed about 100 miles or more off South Florida, sparing the 4.4 million people in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas from its most punishing effects. \n The hurricane was expected to blow ashore \u2014 or come dangerously close to doing so \u2014 early Friday north of West Palm Beach, and then slowly push north for the next 12 hours along the Interstate 95 corridor, through Cape Canaveral and Jacksonville, according to the National Hurricane Center. \n Forecasters said it would then probably hug the coast of Georgia and South Carolina over the weekend before veering out to sea \u2014 perhaps even looping back toward Florida in the middle of next week as a tropical storm. \n Millions of people in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina were told to evacuate their homes, and interstate highways were turned into one-way routes to speed the exodus. Florida alone accounted for about 1.5 million of those told to clear out. \n \"The storm has already killed people. We should expect the same impact in Florida,\" the governor warned. \n The hurricane had been a potentially catastrophic Category 4 storm, but weakened slightly early Friday to a Category 3. Forecasters said it could dump up to 15 inches of rain in some spots and cause a storm surge of 9 feet or more. \n They said the major threat to the Southeast would not be the winds \u2014 which newer buildings can withstand \u2014 but the massive surge of seawater that could wash over coastal communities along a 500-mile stretch from South Florida to the Charleston, South Carolina, area. \n President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency for Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, freeing up federal money and personnel to protect lives and property. \n The Fort Lauderdale airport shut down, and the Orlando airport planned to do so as well. The Palm Beach International Airport reported a wind gust of 50 mph with the center of the storm 70 miles offshore, the National Hurricane Center said. Airlines canceled more than 3,000 flights Thursday and Friday, many of them in or out of Miami and Fort Lauderdale. \n Amtrak suspended train service between Miami and New York, and cruise lines rerouted ships to avoid the storm, which in some cases will mean more days at sea. \n Orlando's world-famous theme parks \u2014 Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld \u2014 all closed. \n \"I never get time off. I'm a little sad,\" tourist Amber Klinkel, 25, of Battle Creek, Michigan, lamented at Universal. \n Patients were transferred from two Florida waterfront hospitals and a nursing home near Daytona Beach to safer locations. \n Thousands of people hunkered down in schools converted to shelters, and inland hotels in places such as Charlotte, North Carolina, reported brisk business. \n At the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, NASA no longer has to worry about rolling space shuttles back from the launch pad to the hangar because of hurricanes, since the shuttle fleet is now retired. But the spaceflight company SpaceX was concerned about the storm's effect on its leased seaside pad. \n The last Category 3 storm or higher to hit the U.S. was Wilma in October 2005. It sliced across Florida with 120 mph winds, killing five people and causing an estimated $21 billion in damage. \n The coordinator for Haiti's Interior Ministry in the area hit hardest by Hurricane Matthew said the confirmed death toll in that southwestern zone was 283. Emmanuel Pierre told The Associated Press late Thursday that he expects the toll to rise as authorities reach remote places that were left isolated by the storm. \n Bodies have started to appear as waters recede in some areas two days after Matthew smashed concrete walls, flattened palm trees and tore roofs off homes. \n In the Bahamas, authorities reported many downed trees and power lines but no immediate deaths. \n As of 2 a.m. EDT, Matthew was about 45 miles east of Vero Beach and moving toward the northwest at about 14 mph. With hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 60 miles, Matthew could wreak havoc along the coast even if its center stayed offshore. \n Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal ordered an evacuation of the entire Georgia coast, covering more than a half-million people. It was the first hurricane evacuation along the Georgia coast since 1999, when the state narrowly escaped Floyd. \n \"We have a house that sits right here on the water and we kind of said goodbye to it thinking that, you know, the house \u2026 might not be here when we get back,\" said Jennifer Banker, a resident of Georgia's dangerously exposed St. Simons Island. \"You know, we pray a lot and trust God to provide.\" \n Some coastal residents in Georgia and beyond decided to take their chances and stay. \n Darcy O'Connor, a restaurant owner who lives in a rowhouse in Savannah, Georgia, a historic city of many beautifully maintained homes from the 18th and 19th century, said she and most of her neighbors were sticking around. \n O'Connor noted that her home, built in 1883, has weathered hurricanes before: \"Half the windows, if you look, still have the original glass. So that tells you something.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Matthew hammers Florida, begins dayslong beating of coast"}

{"date": "October 6, 2016", "text": "PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n Bill Cosby, left, is led out of Courtroom A on the Montgomery County Courthouse after the pre-trial conference on Sept. 6 in Norristown, Pa. \n Bill Cosby's lawyers have launched their most comprehensive effort to date to have the sexual assault charges against him dropped, arguing that various factors \"created a perfect storm of prejudice, bias and delay\" that requires the dismissal of the charges against the entertainer. \n The motion, filed today in the Pennsylvania court where Cosby is facing trial for a 2004 incident involving then-Temple University basketball staffer Andrea Constand, argues that the delay in bringing charges has prejudiced the jury and violated Cosby's due-process rights. \n It also cites what the defense alleges was an agreement made more than a decade ago by a former Montgomery County district attorney not to prosecute Cosby, while simultaneously alleging that civil trial documents that help fuel the prosecution's case were improperly unsealed. \n The combination of those factors demands that the \"stale charges against Bill Cosby\" be dropped says the motion, penned by lead Cosby attorney Brian McMonagle and running some 30 pages. \n But whether the attempt will succeed remains to be seen. Despite the extensive nature of the motion, much of its content has been argued \u2014 and denied \u2014 in one form or another before. \n The motion laid out the yearslong inaction of the former district attorney, Bruce Castor, and also said that Cosby testified at the civil trial under the belief he held criminal immunity. \n Enumerating a rather exhaustive timeline of events, it focuses specifically on the July 2015 unsealing of a civil trial deposition by a judge, Eduardo C. Robreno, and the subsequent publication of its contents by The Associated Press. The details became front-page news and, the defense argues, prejudiced the jury pool by revealing \"vivid, unforgettable information\" \u2014 a standard for fair celebrity trials established by a Supreme Court case involving a former Enron executive. \n A news release from Cosby's team announcing the motion decried \"a combination of serious prosecutorial and judicial impropriety that have deprived him of his right to a fair trial.\" \n However, an attempt by the defense to dismiss the charges because of an alleged Castor nonprosecution agreement was rejected by the judge in the case in February. That judge, Steven T. O'Neill, has thus far generally been intent on pushing forward and has waved aside a number of the defense's attempts at delay or dismissal. Many experts believe the trial will proceed. \n Cosby is facing three felony counts of aggravated indecent assault stemming from an incident of sexual contact with Constand, whom he supplied with wine and a pill at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. \n Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele, elected last year in part on a pledge to prosecute Cosby, filed the charges in December just before the statute of limitations was set to expire. Cosby has since been in court numerous times, with a May pretrial hearing determining the case will move forward. Last month, O'Neil set a trial date for early June. \n The case has brought together issues of celebrity, the criminal justice system and gender politics in a way rarely seen in the U.S. At issue for many in the matter is whether a famous entertainer used his power to lure women and then compel them to have sex with him, as Cosby critics argue, or whether these were consensual encounters between a celebrity and partners who sought his company, as his defenders say. \n Cosby's lawyers on Thursday cited his place in the pop-culture firmament. \n \"Bill Cosby has lived an extraordinary and exemplary public life for well over 50 years \u2014 not only as a comedian and TV star, but also as an educator, philanthropist, author, producer, commercial pitchman and civil rights advocate,\" McMonagle and co-counsel Angela Agrusa said. \"Unfortunately, that legacy has been hijacked by the Montgomery County's D.A. office.\" \n The Constand case has also become a flashpoint for the dozens of women who say they have been sexually assaulted by Cosby. Nearly all of the incidents have reached their statute of limitations, turning the Pennsylvania proceedings into what victims-rights advocates say is a kind of vicarious pursuit of justice. Last month, Steele filed a motion to allow 13 women who say they were assaulted by Cosby to testify in the case on the grounds that they can demonstrate a \"pertinent trait\" on the defendant's part. \n The prosecution, meanwhile, has sought to portray many of these instances as self-serving. The motion cited the involvement of high-profile attorney Gloria Allred with alleged victims and decried what it says is a media circus more than a legal proceeding. \"The time has come to put an end to this tempest,\" the motion said. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Los Angeles Times  \n ", "author": "By Steven Zeitchik Los Angeles Times", "title": "Bill Cosby seeks to have sexual assault charges dropped, citing prejudice and bias"}

{"date": "October 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Royal Canadian Mounted Police, members of the RCMP go through a decontamination procedure in Vancouver after intercepting a package containing approximately 2.2 pounds of the powerful opioid carfentanil imported from China. \n SHANGHAI >> It's one of the strongest opioids in circulation, so deadly an amount smaller than a poppy seed can kill a person. Until July, when drug users in the United States started overdosing on carfentanil, the substance was best known for knocking out moose and elephants \u2014 or as a chemical weapon. \n Despite the dangers, Chinese vendors offer to sell carfentanil openly online, for worldwide export, no questions asked, an Associated Press investigation has found. The AP identified 12 Chinese businesses that said they would export carfentanil to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium and Australia for as little as $2,750 a kilogram. \n Carfentanil burst into view this summer as the latest scourge in an epidemic of opioid abuse that has killed tens of thousands in the U.S. alone. In China, the top global source of synthetic drugs, carfentanil is not a controlled substance. The U.S. government is pressing China to blacklist it, but Beijing has yet to act. \n \"We can supply carfentanil . for sure,\" a saleswoman from Jilin Tely Import and Export Co. wrote in broken English in a September email. \"And it's one of our hot sales product.\" \n The AP did not actually order any drugs, or test whether the products on offer were genuine. \n China's Ministry of Public Security declined multiple requests for comment. \n For decades before being discovered by drug dealers, carfentanil and substances like it were researched as chemical weapons by the U.S., U.K., Russia, Israel, China, the Czech Republic and India, according to publicly available documents. They are banned from the battlefield under the Chemical Weapons Convention. \n \"It's a weapon,\" said Andrew Weber, assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs from 2009 to 2014. \"Companies shouldn't be just sending it to anybody.\" \n Carfentanil is 100 times more powerful than fentanyl, a related drug that is itself up to 50 times stronger than heroin. \n Forms of fentanyl are suspected in an unsuccessful 1997 attempt by Mossad agents to kill a Hamas leader in Jordan, and were used to lethal effect by Russian forces against Chechen separatists who took hundreds of hostages at a Moscow theater in 2002. \n The theater siege prompted the U.S. to develop strategies to counter carfentanil's potential use as a tool of war or terrorism, according to Weber. \"Countries that we are concerned about were interested in using it for offensive purposes,\" he said. \"We are also concerned that groups like ISIS could order it commercially.\" \n Later, dealers discovered that vast profits could be made by cutting fentanyls into illicit drugs. In fiscal year 2014, U.S. authorities seized just 3.7 kilograms (8.1 pounds) of fentanyl. This fiscal year, through just mid-July, they seized 134.1 kilograms (295 pounds), Customs and Border Protection data show. Overdose rates have been skyrocketing. \n The DEA has \"shared intelligence and scientific data\" with China about controlling carfentanil, according to Russell Baer, a DEA special agent in Washington. \n \"I know China is looking at it very closely,\" he said. Delegations of top Chinese and U.S. drug enforcement officials met in August and September to discuss opioids, but failed to produce a substantive announcement on carfentanil. \n China is not blind to the key role its chemists play in the opioid supply chain. Most synthetic drugs that end up in the United States come from China, according to the DEA. \n China already has controlled fentanyl and 18 related compounds, but despite periodic crackdowns, people willing to skirt the law are easy to find in China's vast, freewheeling chemicals industry. Vendors said they lied on customs forms, guaranteed delivery to countries where carfentanil is banned and volunteered strategic advice on sneaking packages past law enforcement. \n \"The government should impose very serious limits, but in reality in China it's so difficult to control because if I produce 1 or 2 kilograms, how will anyone know?\" said Xu Liqun, president of Hangzhou Reward Technology, which offered to produce carfentanil to order. \"They cannot control you, so many products, so many labs.\" \n Last October, China added 116 synthetic drugs to its controlled substances list. Acetylfentanyl, a weak fentanyl variant, was among them. Six months later, monthly seizures of acetylfentanyl in the U.S. were down 60 percent, DEA data obtained by the AP shows. \n Several vendors contacted in September were willing to export carfentanil but refused to provide the far less potent acetylfentanyl. \n Seven companies, however, offered to sell acetylfentanyl despite the ban. Five offered fentanyl and two offered alpha-PVP, commonly known as flakka, which are also controlled substances in China. \n Several vendors recommended shipping by EMS, the express mail service of state-owned China Postal Express & Logistics Co. \n \"EMS is a little slow than Fedex or DHL but very safe, more than 99% pass rate,\" a Yuntu Chemical Co. representative wrote in an email. \n EMS declined comment. A Yuntu representative hung up the phone when contacted by the AP and did not reply to emails. Soon after, the company's website vanished. \n \u2014\u2014 \n Butler reported from Washington.

Eriksson was the first woman to have a baby after receiving a womb transplant from her mother, a revolutionary operation that links three generations of their family. \n BERGSHAMRA, Sweden \u00bb Emelie Eriksson has a bond with her son that hardly seems possible: She and her son were born from the same womb. \n Eriksson was the first woman to have a baby after receiving a uterus from her mother, in a revolutionary operation that links three generations of their family. \n \"It's like science fiction,\" Eriksson, 30, told the Associated Press in an exclusive interview at her home just north of Stockholm. \"This is something that you read in history books and now in the future when you read about this, it's about me.\" \n Eriksson's son Albin is now nearly two. She agreed to share her story with the AP because she hopes other women who need help having a child will be encouraged and inspired by her family's extraordinary womb transplantation experience. \n \"I hope this will be a reality for everyone that needs it,\" she said. \n Her operation was performed by Mats Brannstrom, a Swedish doctor who is the only person in the world to deliver babies \u2014 five so far \u2014 from women with donated wombs. Brannstom believes the operation will one day be common, and he is working with doctors elsewhere, including at Harvard Medical School and the Mayo Clinic in the U.S., to perfect the procedure. \n Two of his former team members were involved in four womb transplants at Baylor University in Texas that were announced this week. One was successful but the patient is not yet ready to attempt a pregnancy. \n Eriksson was 15 when she began wondering why she hadn't gotten her period; a doctor discovered she had been born without a womb and explained that she would never be able to carry her own children. \n In her early 20s, Eriksson began reading about scientists attempting to create organs from stem cells and was told about the womb transplant research being pursued by Brannstrom. \n She described the novel project to her mother one Sunday evening in Stockholm. \n \"I thought this was something that could only happen (far) in the future,\" said Marie Eriksson, 53. \"But then I said to Emelie, 'I'm so old, I don't need my womb and I don't want any more children,\" she said. \"This is your only chance to have a child and you should take it.\" \n Eriksson emailed Brannstrom and after several trips to Gothenburg and dozens of medical tests for both Ericksson and her mother, they were accepted into his trial testing the pioneering transplant. \n \"I'd known all my life that I wouldn't be able to be pregnant,\" Eriksson said. \"But maybe now there was a small, small chance for me.\" \n Eriksson's husband, Daniel Chrysong, agreed to go ahead after meeting Brannstrom and being reassured he wasn't \"some lunatic doctor.\" Still, he doubted it would succeed. \n \"I thought (we had) a bigger chance of winning the lottery,\" he said. \n The night before her and her mother's operations, Eriksson said, was the first time that she was genuinely afraid, mostly because her mother was terrified of the anesthesia. \n \"I thought, 'what if it doesn't work and my mom still has to do this surgery?'\" Eriksson said. \n She had two mild rejection episodes in the months after the surgery, but doses of steroids helped them pass. After a year, Eriksson was finally ready to attempt to get pregnant. Brannstrom's team transferred a single embryo into her womb, which Eriksson and Chrysong had created during in-vitro fertilization. \n The first pregnancy test was negative. Eriksson was discouraged, but took another test a week later: that one was positive. \n \"When I called my mom to tell her, she was like, 'I knew it!'\" Eriksson said. She said her mother told her, \"I knew I had a good womb.\" \n Eriksson was only convinced they had succeeded when she heard her newborn son scream in the delivery room. \n \"I realized that everything had worked,\" she said. \n Chrysong was so overcome that he fainted and had to be watched over by the anesthesiology nurse on the floor of the hospital room. \n Eriksson said that she and Chrysong intend to explain to Albin exactly how he was born, one day. \"I'm not sure he will understand exactly everything that me and my mom had to go through,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mom and son born through same womb, 'like science fiction'"}

{"date": "October 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Massive lots for sale south of the Strip in Las Vegas and east of Interstate 15. Real estate investors have been scooping up land across the Las Vegas Valley for new projects, from apartment sites in Henderson to housing tracts in Summerlin. But theyre largely avoiding one area in particular, the lifeblood of southern Nevadas economy, no less: Las Vegas Boulevard. \n LAS VEGAS >> Real estate investors have been scooping up land across the Las Vegas Valley for new projects, from apartment sites in Henderson to housing tracts in Summerlin. \n But they're largely avoiding one area in particular, the lifeblood of southern Nevada's economy, no less: Las Vegas Boulevard. \n Land sales have climbed from the depths of the recession in Las Vegas, reported the Las Vegas Review-Journal (http://bit.ly/2cKR3K6), but few people are buying the vacant parcels for sale on the Strip and south of the resort corridor. Prices are too high, parcels are too big, and large-scale developments aren't feasible today, brokers and investors say. \n The lack of sales can crimp construction, but it also shows that the go-go days of last decade's real estate bubble haven't come back and probably won't anytime soon \u2014 which might be a good thing, given how badly it all ended. \n Offerings south of the Strip include roughly 110 acres priced at $200 million, 56.6 acres for sale at $40 million and 108.7 acres listed for $70.6 million. On the Strip, roughly 5.5 acres is priced above $160 million, according to listings and brokers. \n Parcels aren't selling for key reasons, Land Advisors Organization broker Rick Hildreth said. \n \"They're way overpriced, and there's really just no demand,\" he said. \n Khusrow Roohani, owner of Seven Valleys Realty & Construction, was among those who sold big before the crash. He and partner Daniel Kramer bought 31.6 acres at Robindale Road, south of the Strip, in 2004 for $26 million and sold two years later for $103 million, according to Clark County records. \n In 2009, that parcel and others nearby were acquired through foreclosure. Roohani's group, it turned out, sold around the peak of the bubble. \n \"Otherwise,\" he said, \"we would be like everybody else \u2013 in trouble today.\" \n BUBBLE-ERA PRICES GONE \n Before the market tanked, property on Las Vegas Boulevard \u2013 at least from the tourist district to suburban St. Rose Parkway \u2013 sold for amounts that seem all but impossible today. Investors also built or drew up plans for condo towers, megaresorts or other super-sized projects that developers largely aren't pursuing anymore. \n Many of the still-vacant parcels weren't supposed to stay empty. Projects that went nowhere include a roughly 25-story resort condo tower on the south Strip; Urban Village Las Vegas, a 50-acre, $1.5 billion mixed-use project at Pyle Avenue south of the Strip; and 14 towers with 2,760 condos at Starr Avenue. \n On the Strip, available parcels aren't all especially big, but prices are steep. \n Developer Triple Five is asking $30 million per acre, or more than $160 million, for property next to the Peppermill restaurant. Owners of the boarded-up White Sands Motel, across from the Luxor, have listed the 1.1-acre site for $25 million. \n And investor Howard Bulloch has been trying to sell 38.5 acres, including his failed, partially built SkyVue observation-wheel project across from Mandalay Bay. Brokers said last fall that he wanted more than $10 million an acre, or more than $385 million. \n At such prices, industry pros say, buyers might have to build an expensive, high-density project with potential for big revenue, like a condo tower or casino-resort, to make a profit. But even if they got financing to buy the land \u2014 itself no guarantee \u2014 it's not easy getting construction funding. \n Las Vegas' once-battered economy is on stronger footing, but with easy money no longer sloshing around, the market for mega-projects is nowhere near what it used to be. No one is building condo towers in Las Vegas today, and two resorts underway on the Strip, Resorts World and Alon, have shown little to no progress getting built despite being on the drawing board for a few years. \n As it stands, Las Vegas doesn't need \"additional hotel supply,\" and the condo market \"still hasn't recovered to a point where it makes sense\" to build more towers, as developers can't fetch high-enough prices, said broker Michael Parks, of CBRE Group's global gaming group. \n On the Strip, most parcels for sale are at the south edge. Broker Curt Allsop of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank figures buyers would pay $2 million per acre there, \"maybe\" $4 million, but \"a lot of that dirt is probably listed for about twice what the market will pay.\" \n Also, some owners on the Strip want bubble-era prices. \n The White Sands' ownership, Parks recently told the Las Vegas Sun, is asking \"a ridiculously high price that they'll never get.\" \n John Knott, head of CBRE's global gaming group, said of Triple Five's price tag: \"There's no market support for that price whatsoever.\" \n BIG AND EXPENSIVE \n South of the Strip, stretches of land are up for grabs on Las Vegas Boulevard, but they're too big and too expensive, brokers say. \n Apartment developers might need 15 to 20 acres for a project, not 100, and homebuilders don't need that much for a subdivision either. \n Moreover, three big casino-resorts are on or near the boulevard south of the Strip \u2014 Silverton, South Point and M Resort \u2014 and it seems no one expects another one anytime soon. \n \"You have all these large pieces of property and what can you build on them?\" one broker said. \n Perhaps the biggest sale by acreage in recent years was homebuilder D.R. Horton's purchase in 2013 of about 40 acres at Starr Avenue, for $14.25 million. \n \"All these guys are holding out for the next megaresort,\" Allsop said of landowners. \n One issue, brokers say, is that some owners refuse to sell big holdings in pieces. \n Swedish furniture chain Ikea was looking to buy 30 acres on Las Vegas Boulevard near Warm Springs Road for $30 million. But investment firm Lone Star Funds, which owns about 110 acres there and is trying to sell for $200 million, wanted to unload the whole site, not just a portion of it, according to people familiar with the matter. \n Ikea ended up buying 26 acres at Sunset Road and Durango Drive in late 2014 and opened its 351,000-square-foot store this past May. \n Ikea spokesman Joseph Roth said the retailer was \"in a variety of discussions about various sites\" along Interstate 15 and the 215 Beltway, and it \"decided to pursue the opportunity\" in southwest Las Vegas \"due to location, access and visibility.\" \n Lone Star declined to comment. \n All told, plenty of landowners spent a fortune for their property. But many who can't come to terms with today's sharply reduced values are \"still looking in the rear-view mirror,\" Allsop said, to a time of overblown prices and super-sized projects. \n \"Sorry,\" he said, \"those days are gone.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Las Vegas Boulevard parcels left out of land-buying boom"}

{"date": "October 6, 2016", "text": "NTSB VIA AP \n This Oct. 1 file photo provided by the National Transportation Safety Board shows damage done to the Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, N.J., after a commuter train crash. \n Federal investigators released new information today gleaned from a data recorder and video from a forward-facing camera in the front of the train, but a final report on what caused the crash could take a year or longer to complete. \n According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the train sped up and was going twice the 10 mph speed limit just before it slammed into a bumping post at the end of the rail line, went airborne and hurtled into the station's waiting area on Sept. 29. \n The train was traveling at 8 mph and the throttle was in the idle position less than a minute before the crash. Approximately 38 seconds before the crash, the throttle was increased and reached a maximum of about 21 mph, the NTSB said. The throttle went back to idle and the engineer hit the emergency brake less than a second before the crash, investigators said. \n NJ Transit trains have an in-cab system designed to alert engineers with a loud alarm and stop locomotives when they go over 20 mph, according to an NJ Transit engineer who wasn't authorized to discuss the accident and spoke on the condition of anonymity. \n The engineer said the throttles have eight slots, putting the fourth spot at about half power. The engineer said the throttle should be set to idle, or the first and slowest speed spot, when entering Hoboken Terminal. The tracks into the station run slightly downhill, so there would be no need to push the throttle any higher, the engineer said. \n An NTSB spokesman said he didn't know if the alert system went off. He said it's being looked at as part of the investigation. \n Video from the train's forward-facing camera showed the front of the train smashing into and overriding the bumper at the end of the track, causing a large flash, investigators wrote. \n Thursday's report contained no analysis of the data retrieved and no explanation for why the train increased speed. NTSB technical experts and the parties to the investigation are scheduled to meet in Washington, D.C., next Tuesday to continue reviewing the data and video from the train. \n Also Thursday, New Jersey Transit implemented a new rule for pulling into two of its stations. \n The conductor must join the engineer whenever a train pulls into Hoboken Terminal or its Atlantic City station, NJ Transit spokeswoman Jennifer Nelson said. That means a second set of eyes will be watching as a train enters the final phase of its trip at stations where there are platforms at the end of the rails. The New York Times first reported the policy. \n The engineer was alone when the train crashed into the Hoboken station. He has told federal investigators he has no memory of the crash. \n Some rail safety experts caution that having a second person in a cab isn't automatically safer, since crew members can sometimes distract each other. In 1996 outside Washington, D.C., a commuter train engineer was thought to have been distracted by a conversation with a crew member, causing a crash with an Amtrak train that killed 11 people. \n Investigators recovered the data recorder, a video recorder and the engineer's cellphone from the front car of the NJ Transit train on Tuesday. The equipment was sent to an agency lab in Washington for analysis. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "NTSB: Train in New Jersey crash was going twice speed limit"}

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) \n ASSOCIATED PRESS / JAN. 2016 \n In this Jan. 4 file photo, a U.S. Border Patrol agent drives near the U.S.-Mexico border fence in Sunland Park, N.M. U.S. immigration authorities caught barely half the people who illegally entered the country from Mexico last year, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security report that offers one of the most detailed assessments of U.S. border security ever compiled. \n SAN DIEGO \u00bb Immigration authorities caught just over half of the people who illegally entered the U.S. from Mexico last year, according to a report commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security that offers one of the most detailed assessments of border security ever compiled. \n The report found that 54 percent of people who entered illegally between border crossings got caught in the 2015 fiscal year. That's much lower than the 81 percent success rate that Homeland Security cited publicly using a different counting method. \n The 98-page report was completed in May, and Homeland Security officials have declined to release it, despite urging from some members of Congress. The Associated Press obtained a copy from a government official involved in border issues who acted on condition of anonymity because the department has not made the report public. \n The department said Thursday that the report was \"one building block provided by a research organization\" toward developing more reliable measures of border security and that its methodology needed refinement. \n \"DHS does not believe it is in the public interest to release, and it would be irresponsible to make policy or other judgments on the basis of analysis that is incomplete and remains a work in progress,\" spokeswoman Marsha Catron said. \n The report offers some of most detailed measures yet of how secure the border with Mexico is \u2014 a major issue in a presidential campaign that features Republican nominee Donald Trump calling for a wall along the entire 1,954-mile border. The report includes enough material to argue that the government has made big strides or that it is falling woefully short. \n In terms of people, 170,000 eluded capture during the 2015 fiscal year, 210,000 the previous year, and 1.7 million in 2005. The number of people who eluded capture is larger when including those who escaped detection at border crossings or who entered by sea, which is the responsibility of Homeland Security agencies outside the Border Patrol. Adding those, 200,000 people got away last year, 260,000 in 2014, and 1.9 million in 2005. \n The huge drop in illegal entries over the last decade coincides with major increases in border security spending, which has reached $14 billion annually. The report notes more serious consequences imposed on illegal crossers during that period, which include jail time. \n Immigration experts have also cited the significant decline in job opportunities after the Great Recession that began at the end of 2007. Still, sharp declines in illegal entries have continued in recent years as the economy improved. \n \"This is the first solid evidence we have that the border buildup of the last 20 years has indeed made some significant difference in deterring and reducing illegal entries across the southern border,\" said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \n The Border Patrol's capture rate on the Mexican border was 55 percent in 2014 and 36 percent in 2005, according to the report prepared for Homeland Security by the Institute for Defense Analyses, a federally funded research organization. The Border Patrol achieved an 11-point improvement in 2014 after years of slow but steady gains. The report does not offer an explanation for the sudden improvement. \n The report, which includes an appendix of more than 100 pages on methodology and a review of previous efforts to count border crossers, offers detailed analysis going back to 2000, shortly before the U.S. erected hundreds of miles of fences along the Mexican border, added surveillance gear and doubled the number of Border Patrol agents. Homeland Security has been under pressure to show if those multibillion-dollar investments yielded results. \n The primary measure that Homeland Security has released for public consumption is the number of Border Patrol arrests, which tells how many people got caught but not how many got away. Arrests dropped to the lowest level in 44 years in 2015, down 80 percent from a peak of nearly 1.7 million in 2000. \n For the last two years, the department has released an \"interdiction effectiveness rate\" that measures the percentage of people who got caught among all who attempted to enter between crossings on the Mexican border. The figure includes those who set foot in the U.S. and turned around and asylum-seekers. It was 81 percent in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2015. \n The report obtained by the AP takes a different approach. It does not credit the government for people who turn around or turn themselves in to agents to seek asylum, a common occurrence among Central American women and children who have entered the country in large numbers over the last five years, many of them fleeing drug-fueled violence. \n The report says there were 140,000 asylum seekers on the Mexican border last year and 170,000 in 2014, compared to about 20,000 a year a decade ago. Homeland Security's practice of counting those as captures goes a long way toward explaining why its success rate was so much higher. \n The report also counts people who entered the country illegally at border crossings \u2014 typically by presenting fake or stolen documents to immigration inspectors. Homeland Security does not publish those numbers. The report says 28,000 escaped detection last year, down from 46,000 in 2014. The capture rate improved to 39 percent from 29 percent. \n Counting border crossers who elude capture is a mammoth and imprecise task but one that many experts believe is necessary to judge whether the border is secure. Homeland Security approaches the job by tracking physical evidence, such as footprints in the desert and other signs of human presence, and by agent sightings. The internal report uses that information, along with migrant surveys and techniques developed by social scientists. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Barely half of illegal border crossers caught"}

Loretta Sanchez has tried for months to generate buzz in her uphill U.S. Senate campaign against Attorney General Kamala Harris. She finally did, but not for anything she said. \n Sanchez capped an hour-long debate with her fellow Democrat on Wednesday by mimicking a celebratory gesture popularized by NFL star Cam Newton, known as \"the dab.\" Standing behind a lectern, she suddenly thrust out her left arm, while tucking her head into the crook of right arm, then holding the pose for a moment before picking her head up with a flourish. \n Her rival Harris initially looked puzzled, then a smile gradually creased her face and she began laughing. \n \"So there's a clear difference between the candidates in this race,\" Harris chuckled. \n \"There definitely is,\" Sanchez snapped back, in a rare moment of agreement in the debate. \n Snapshots of Sanchez's pose and video clips of the scene made the rounds on social media and websites Thursday. \n In an email, campaign spokesman Luis Vizcaino dubbed the gesture the \"debate dab.\" \n THE GOP TO THE RESCUE?  \n Harris has been the undisputed favorite of the Democratic establishment, piling up endorsements from President Barack Obama, Gov. Jerry Brown and U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. Boxed out in her own party, Sanchez has been making open appeals for Republican support in a race where only two Democrats will appear on the ballot. \n Sanchez never made a direct appeal for GOP votes during the debate but did mention issues that typically resonate with Republicans, including concern over the state's rising violent crime rate, regulating medical marijuana dispensaries and her experience in military affairs on Capitol Hill. She noted she has worked across party lines. \n And she embraced her role as the outsider. \n Alluding to Harris' support in the Democratic Party, Sanchez said, \"Don't vote for the establishment\" and also referred to Harris and \"her cronies.\" \n WHERE'S LORETTA?  \n Sanchez's spotty voting record in Washington, compiled in the midst of the Senate campaign, was a target for Harris. \"I think it is important that you show up, and that's the kind of leadership California wants,\" Harris said. \n Sanchez argued that her attendance record, prior to her Senate campaign, was 95 percent. \"To do democracy in a large state like California, something's got to give. But I have never missed a close, crucial vote,\" Sanchez responded. \n WORRISOME CRIME RATES  \n California has witnessed an increase in violent crime rates in 2015, according to FBI data. Sanchez faults Harris for the jump, arguing that the increases occurred while the attorney general was campaigning. Referring to the rising numbers, Sanchez said, \"That is a report card you do not want to show to your dad.\" Harris did not directly address the state crime data. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lagging California Senate candidate gets buzz with 'debate dab'"}

CLOUD TIMES VIA AP \n St. Cloud Police Chief Blair Anderson talks about evidence photos of the knives used during stabbings at Crossroads Center at a press conference today at the St. Cloud Police station. Dahir Aidan, 20, was shot by an off-duty police officer after stabbing 10 people in the mall. \n ST. CLOUD TIMES VIA AP \n St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis speaks during a press conference today at the St. Cloud Police station, in St. Cloud, Minn. Kleis asked that people continue to think about those who were injured in last month's stabbing at a Minnesota mall, as well as those who saw the attack. \n ST. CLOUD, Minn. \u00bb The man who stabbed 10 people at a Minnesota mall had become interested in Islam in the last several months, withdrew from his friends and encouraged female relatives to be more religious, the FBI said today. \n \"We were told (he) had not previously shown an interest in religion,\" but after 20-year-old Dahir Ahmed Adan did, he went from being a high academic performer to failing out of college \"almost overnight,\" Minneapolis FBI Special Agent in Charge Rick Thornton said at a news conference in which authorities gave the public its first look at surveillance video of some of the Sept. 17 attacks. \n \"The totality of Dahir Adan's behavior and the actions suggest he may have been radicalized either with the influence of others or on his own,\" Thornton said. \n The attorney for Adan's family, Abdulwahid Osman, said his parents and close family members did not see the behavioral changes that investigators described. \"They believed he was doing as good as he used to do,\" Osman said. \"That is not the son they knew.\" \n Witnesses told the FBI that Adan, who was armed with two steak knives and later shot and killed, referenced Islam during the attack at Crossroads Center mall. \n \"We have numerous credible witness accounts of him asking victims during the attack if they were Muslim and at least one instance yelling 'Allahu akbar' while stabbing one of his victims and others heard him yelling \"Islam Islam\" during the attack,\" Thornton said, adding that it appeared to be premeditated. \n Aside from Adan's supposed increased interest in the religion, Thornton offered no other evidence linking Adan, who was Somali-American, to extremist groups. Right after the attacks, an Islamic State-run news agency claimed Adan was a \"soldier of the Islamic State\" who had heeded the group's calls for attacks in countries that are part of a U.S.-led anti-IS coalition. \n Thornton also said investigators are looking at Adan's digital footprint, including social media accounts, and are assessing \"legal and technical options\" to unlock his iPhone. He didn't elaborate, and agency spokesman Kyle Loven said he couldn't comment further because of the ongoing investigation. \n The FBI hired an outside company to help it hack into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook, who with his wife killed 14 people at a 2015 holiday work gathering. Apple had rejected the government's demand that it create software to bypass the phone's security features. The FBI has refused to name the company that developed the tool or say how much it paid for it. \n The mall videos shown at the news conference showed Adan swinging wildly at an electronics store clerk and stabbing him at least once before the man scrambled away, as well as customers running from a candy store and the store's clerk pulling down a barrier just as Adan approached. \n Another graphic video showed a bloody Adan crawling and trying to get up after he was shot six times by an off-duty officer. \n Law enforcement shared the videos with the family today, Osman said. \n \"They continue to mourn and grieve for the loss in their family and express profound sympathy to the victims,\" he said. \n In arguing that it appeared the attack was premeditated, Thornton said compelling evidence included Adan not changing out of his security guard uniform between shifts as he usually did, telling his family he had \"work to do tonight.\" He then texted his boss to say he was not coming to work. \n Less than a half-hour before the attack, he went to a convenience store. When the clerk said he would see Adan later, Adan replied: \"You won't be seeing me again,\" Thornton said. \n Minnesota has the nation's largest Somali community, with census numbers placing the population at about 57,000. Young Somalis have been a target for terror recruiters. Since 2007, more than 20 young men have joined the militant group al-Shabab in Somalia. In addition, roughly a dozen people have left to join militants in Syria, and nine Minnesota men face sentencing on terror charges for plotting to join the Islamic State group. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "FBI: Minnesota mall attacker newly interested in Islam"}

{"date": "October 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n After hearing a report that a clown was sighted at Old Main, students started rushing towards Old Main lawn in search of the clown on Monday in State College, Pa. \n Honolulu police say there are no reports of threats or suspicious activity locally involving people dressed up as clowns, as a nationwide hysteria over scary clowns continued to lead to arrests and charges. \n Clown incidents have been reported this week at schools around the U.S., including Penn State University, where police said more than 500 students showed up early Tuesday to hunt for clowns. \n In Oregon, two men wearing clown masks in two different Oregon locations were arrested for behavior that caused concern to citizens this morning and overnight. And in Maryland, police charged four 13-year-old boys they say were involved in clown-themed social media threats against middle school students. \n \"The Honolulu Police Department is aware of recent social media posts highlighting clowns,\" a police spokeswoman said in an e-mailed statement.\"As of this time, there have been no reports of threats or suspicious activity locally. Anyone with information on actual threats or incidents should call 911 immediately.\" \n The clown situations \"waste valuable resources and can lead to injuries to both first responders and members of the public,\" Connecticut state police said. The pranks \"can cause major disruptions leading to schools, businesses and neighborhoods being placed into lockdown unnecessarily.\" \n Sociologists say the panic over clowns, which may seem silly from a distance, is actually a new twist on a phenomenon as old as witch hunts. \n \"There is a sense that there is some evil force out there that we have to organize together to attack,\" said Dustin Kidd, a sociologist and pop culture expert at Temple University. \"If anything, it's just distracting us from the real ordinary threats that we face in our everyday lives.\" \n Rich Hanley, a journalism professor and social media expert at Quinnipiac University, which also had a clown scare this week, said coulrophobia, the fear of clowns, is easily spread on social media. \n Posts on Twitter, Instagram and other sites, he said, often contain videos, images and statements that lack any context, factual filters or important details that would be in an actual news report. In a closed social situation, such as a school or university campus, that can easily lead to a less than rational response, he said. \n Hanley compared the situation to a \"Twilight Zone\" episode titled \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street,\" in which \"the monsters were all in peoples' heads,\" he said. \"People respond, looking for pitchforks to get the monsters.\" \n Because of that type of attention from the community, Hanley said, law enforcement must take the issue seriously. \n \"I don't think they have a choice,\" he said. He compared it to the practice known as \"swatting,\" in which someone calls 911 to report that a person is being held hostage at an address. Even though it's a hoax, police, sometimes including SWAT teams, respond in force. \n And it's not just at colleges. A false report last month of a clown grabbing a woman by the throat and threatening Reading, Ohio, schools led to classes being canceled for the day. \n A 13-year-old student at Utley Middle School in Rockwall, Texas, was charged this week with making a terroristic threat after posting a purported clown's hit list. Police told Dallas-Fort Worth television station KDFW that the student put herself on the list and told authorities she was only trying to stop any \"real\" clowns from attacking her school. \n Several teenagers in Connecticut were arrested Wednesday on charges of making threats, accused of posting clown hoaxes on Instagram that led to extra security at several school districts. \n Police also warned that anyone making credible threats could be charged with a more serious felony under a law passed this year in response to the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre. The law calls for up to 10 years in prison for anyone intending to cause the evacuation of a school or school grounds with a threat. \n New Haven public schools banned clown costumes this Halloween season after an Instagram account emerged with pictures of menacing clowns and captions telling several area schools to \"watch out\" and \"wait and see\" whether the threats are fake. \n School Superintendent Garth Harries said Tuesday that the posts have been disruptive to learning and to the school's sense of security. \n \"There is no question that whoever is promulgating this is making threats,\" Harries said. \"We don't believe there is any credible threat of violence, but they are still making people uncomfortable.\" \n ", "author": "By Star-Advertiser staff & Associated Press", "title": "Honolulu police: No clown threats here as coulrophobia spreads"}

It includes conflicting statements that Lewis made to investigators explaining the outings, and on several occasions quotes his acknowledgement that he was drunk or drank to \"more than moderation.\" \n Lewis, whom Carter fired nearly a year ago, submitted a written rebuttal slamming the investigation, saying the IG assembled an inaccurate and inflammatory case based on innuendo and had failed to \"find the truth.\" \n The inspector general's report says Lewis improperly used his credit card, lied to a bank to get charges removed and said he was guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer, a violation of the code of military justice. \n In the rebuttal, which was obtained by the AP, Lewis denied that the bar he went to in Rome was a strip club and denied that he went to a strip or gentleman's club in Seoul, South Korea, in an area of the city that the report calls \"Hooker Hill.\" Many clubs in that area are considered off-limits for U.S. military, according to the report. \n The report also details several inappropriate interactions Lewis had with women, including one late-night incident in his hotel room when he was drinking with a female enlisted service member who later told investigators he tried to kiss her. According to the report, a female Defense Department staff member who saw Lewis and the woman alone in the room, told him, \"Sir, respectfully, you're being really stupid. Don't do this. She needs to come and stay in my room.\" \n Carter issued a statement today saying he was briefed on the investigation but would defer comment pending an Army review. He added, \"I expect the highest possible standards of conduct from the men and women in this department particularly from those serving in the most senior positions. There is no exception.\" \n The report said Carter was unaware of Lewis's conduct until he was told about it. The report will go to Army leaders who will determine what, if any, punishment is required and at what rank Lewis would be able to retire. \n Lewis took responsibility for several inappropriate actions, including charging nearly $1,800 on his government credit card at what he called a \"dance club\" in Rome. In an embarrassing set of circumstances, Lewis said, he tried to use his personal debit card at the club, but it didn't work, so he had to walk back to his hotel with a female employee of the club, and wake up a Defense Department staff member to get his government card to pay the bill. He said he paid back the charges when he returned to the U.S. \n The report identified the club as Cica Cica Boom, a club whose sign advertises lap dances, but Lewis said that's not the club he went to. He said he went to \"Verafollia Srl\" a \"high-end establishment with a respectable clientele that had a DJ, a bar area and a dance floor where couples were dancing.\" \n Investigators, including local law enforcement, visited the club and provided photos showing stripper poles and a \"lap dance chair.\" The report said the club manager said the name \"Verafollia Srl\" is used on credit card receipts \"to conceal any link to the Cica Cica Boom club for patrons who frequent the establishment.\" \n Lewis, in the report, explained the high prices charged to his credit card by saying he ordered \"two or three bottles of champagne, lots of drinks.\" \n Lewis had shot up the promotional ladder, and his job with Carter stemmed from their close professional relationship. He had served as an aide to Carter when Carter was deputy defense secretary. \n In Korea, the report said, Lewis went to a gentleman's club called the Candy Bar. Lewis denied going there as well, but acknowledged being in a commercial area of Seoul. He said that when he returned to Washington and saw two charges on his credit card totally about $1,100, he called the bank to have them removed, and the bank agreed. \n Investigators presented him with two receipts from the club bearing the name \"Candy.\" Both receipts show only a short pen mark in the signature area, and do not show his written name. \n The report says investigators, after getting Lewis' rebuttal, went back to check their information, and said they stand by their findings. It adds that a representative from the Candy Bar club told an investigator that she recognized Lewis, but could not recall any details. \n The report portrays Lewis as a senior officer who often went out alone on overseas trips, and who sometimes drank to excess. It said his behavior concerned some staff members and at times was a topic of conversation. \n In the incident involving the enlisted service member, Lewis said another staff member was in the hotel room for much of the time, and that even when he was alone with the enlisted service member \"our discussions remained the type of conversation a command team would engage in.\" \n The report does not suggest that Lewis had an extramarital affair or that he had sex with any of the women. And Lewis, in his rebuttal, criticizes the report for relying on insinuations and statements from people who may have distorted the facts or didn't actually see what happened. \n Officials with knowledge of the matter said the allegations of misconduct, which first surfaced after the November overseas trip with Carter, stunned the secretary and sent shockwaves through the Pentagon. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the case publicly. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Report: Top Pentagon aide used work credit card to pay strip club tabs"}

Konashenkov strongly warned the United States against striking Syrian government forces and issued a thinly-veiled threat to use Russian air defense assets to protect them. \n MOSCOW \u00bb The Russian military today strongly warned the United States against striking the Syrian army, noting that its air defense weapons in Syria stand ready to fend off any attack. \n The statement underlined high tensions between Moscow and Washington after the collapse of a U.S.-Russia-brokered Syria truce and the Syrian army's offensive on Aleppo backed by Russian warplanes. \n Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said any U.S. strikes on areas controlled by Syrian President Bashar Assad's government could jeopardize the lives of Russian servicemen. \n He said Moscow was worried by media reports alleging that Washington was pondering the possibility of striking Syrian army positions. \n \"I would recommend our colleagues in Washington to carefully weigh possible consequences of the fulfillment of such plans,\" Konashenkov said. \n Russia responded with dismay to the U.S.-led coalition's air raid on Syrian army positions near Deir el-Zour that killed 60 Syrian soldiers on Sept. 17, rejecting the U.S. explanation that the attack was a mistake. \n Konashenkov said \"we have taken all the necessary measures to prevent any such 'mistakes' with regard to Russian servicemen and military facilities in Syria.\" \n He said the range of Russia's S-300 and S-400 air defense missile systems deployed to Syria would be a \"surprise\" to any country operating its aircraft over the country. Konashenkov added that the Syrian army also has various Soviet- and Russian-built air defense missile systems, which have undergone modernization over the past year. \n Since Russia has launched its air campaign in Syria in support of Assad's forces a year ago, the Russia and the U.S. militaries have maintained contacts to prevent any midair incidents between Russian warplanes and the aircraft from the U.S.-led coalition in the skies over Syria. \n Konashenkov warned, however, that the Russian military won't have time to use the hotline if it sees missiles on their way to targets in Syria. \n \"It must be understood that Russian air defense missile crews will unlikely have time to clarify via the hotline the exact flight program of the missiles or the ownership of their carriers,\" he added. \n In an apparent hint at the U.S. stealth aircraft, he added that any \"dilettante illusions about stealth planes could collide with disappointing realities.\" \n The Russian military announced Tuesday that a battery of the S-300 air defense missile systems had been sent to Syria to protect a Russian facility in the Syrian port of Tartus and Russian navy ships off the Mediterranean coast. \n Tartus is the only naval supply facility Russia has outside the former Soviet Union. \n The deployment has added more punch to the Russian military force in Syria, which already includes long-range S-400 missile defense systems and an array of other surface-to-air missiles at the Hemeimeem air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia. \n Russia has conducted an air campaign in support of Assad since Sept. 30, 2015, saving his army from imminent defeat and helping it win key ground. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Russia warns U.S. against striking Syrian military"}

Two million people across the Southeast were warned to flee inland. \n It was the most powerful storm to threaten the U.S. Atlantic coast in more than a decade, and had already left more than 280 dead in its wake across the Caribbean. \n \"This storm's a monster,\" Gov. Rick Scott warned as it started lashing the state with periodic heavy rains and squalls around nightfall. He added: \"I'm going to pray for everybody's safety.\" \n As it moved north in the evening, Matthew stayed about 100 miles or more off South Florida, sparing the 4.4 million people in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas from its most punishing effects. \n By Thursday night, more than 60,000 homes and businesses were without power. Streets in Vero Beach were partially covered with water, and hotel guests in Orlando were told to stay inside, though a few sneaked out to smoke or watch the rain. \n The lobby of the Loews Sapphire Falls Resort was crowded with people and pets, including dogs occasionally snapping at each other. Some meals were served buffet style while other people waited more than 2 hours for a pizza delivery. \n The hurricane was expected to blow ashore \u2014 or come dangerously close to doing so \u2014 early Friday north of Palm Beach County, which has about 1.4 million people, and then slowly push north for the next 12 hours along the Interstate 95 corridor, through Cape Canaveral and Jacksonville, according to the National Hurricane Center. \n Forecasters said it would then probably hug the coast of Georgia and South Carolina over the weekend before veering out to sea \u2014 perhaps even looping back toward Florida in the middle of next week as a tropical storm. \n Millions of people in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina were told to evacuate their homes, and interstate highways were turned into one-way routes to speed the exodus. Florida alone accounted for about 1.5 million of those told to clear out. \n \"The storm has already killed people. We should expect the same impact in Florida,\" the governor warned. \n Many boarded up their homes and businesses and left them to the mercy of the storm. \n \"We're not going to take any chances on this one,\" said Daniel Myras, who struggled to find enough plywood to protect his restaurant, the Cruisin Cafe, two blocks from the Daytona Beach boardwalk. \n He added: \"A lot of people here, they laugh, and say they've been through storms before and they're not worried. But I think this is the one that's going to give us a wake-up call.\" \n The hurricane picked up wind speed as it closed in, growing from a possibly devastating Category 3 storm to a potentially catastrophic Category 4. Forecasters said it could dump up to 15 inches of rain in some spots and cause a storm surge of 9 feet or more. \n They said the major threat to the Southeast would not be the winds \u2014 which newer buildings can withstand \u2014 but the massive surge of seawater that could wash over coastal communities along a 500-mile stretch from South Florida to the Charleston, South Carolina, area. \n President Barack Obama declared a state of emergency for Florida and South Carolina, freeing up federal money and personnel to protect lives and property. \n The Fort Lauderdale airport shut down, and the Orlando airport planned to do so as well. The Palm Beach International Airport reported a wind gust of 50 mph with the center of the storm 70 miles offshore, the National Hurricane Center said. Airlines canceled more than 3,000 flights Thursday and Friday, many of them in or out of Miami and Fort Lauderdale. \n Amtrak suspended train service between Miami and New York, and cruise lines rerouted ships to avoid the storm, which in some cases will mean more days at sea. \n Orlando's world-famous theme parks \u2014 Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld \u2014 all closed. \n \"I never get time off. I'm a little sad,\" tourist Amber Klinkel, 25, of Battle Creek, Michigan, lamented at Universal. \n Patients were transferred from two Florida waterfront hospitals and a nursing home near Daytona Beach to safer locations. \n Thousands of people hunkered down in schools converted to shelters, and inland hotels in places such as Charlotte, North Carolina, reported brisk business. \n At the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, NASA no longer has to worry about rolling space shuttles back from the launch pad to the hangar because of hurricanes, since the shuttle fleet is now retired. But the spaceflight company SpaceX was concerned about the storm's effect on its leased seaside pad. \n As evening fell, the winds picked up along Vero Beach, midway between West Palm Beach and Cape Canaveral, stripping away palm fronds, ripping awnings and blowing sand that stung the face. Waves crashed on the beach, and rain came in short bursts. About 30,000 homes and businesses were in the dark. \n The last Category 3 storm or higher to hit the U.S. was Wilma in October 2005. It sliced across Florida with 120 mph winds, killing five people and causing an estimated $21 billion in damage. \n As people hurried to higher ground, authorities in South Carolina said a motorist died on Wednesday after being shot by deputies in a gun battle that erupted when he sped away from a checkpoint along an evacuation route. \n The coordinator for Haiti's Interior Ministry in the area hit hardest by Hurricane Matthew said the confirmed death toll in that southwestern zone was 283. Emmanuel Pierre told The Associated Press late Thursday that he expects the toll to rise as authorities reach remote places that were left isolated by the storm. \n Bodies have started to appear as waters recede in some areas two days after Matthew smashed concrete walls, flattened palm trees and tore roofs off homes. \n In the Bahamas, authorities reported many downed trees and power lines but no immediate deaths. \n As of 9 p.m. EDT, Matthew was about 70 miles east of West Palm Beach, moving toward the northwest at about 13 mph. With hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 60 miles, Matthew could wreak havoc along the coast even if its center stayed offshore. \n Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal ordered an evacuation of the entire Georgia coast, covering more than a half-million people. It was the first hurricane evacuation along the Georgia coast since 1999, when the state narrowly escaped Floyd. \n \"We have a house that sits right here on the water and we kind of said goodbye to it thinking that, you know, the house \u2026 might not be here when we get back,\" said Jennifer Banker, a resident of Georgia's dangerously exposed St. Simons Island. \"You know, we pray a lot and trust God to provide.\" \n Some coastal residents in Georgia and beyond decided to take their chances and stay. \n Darcy O'Connor, a restaurant owner who lives in a rowhouse in Savannah, Georgia, a historic city of many beautifully maintained homes from the 18th and 19th century, said she and her most of her neighbors were sticking around. \n O'Connor noted that her home, built in 1883, has weathered hurricanes before: \"Half the windows, if you look, still have the original glass.

Brian Lewis escorted the casket before the Mass of remembrance for Chaplain Aloysius Schmitt on Wednesday, at St. Luke's Church in St. Lucas, Iowa. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Lewis Wagoner. Seventy-five years after Wagoner was killed during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Navy seaman's remains are returning to Kansas. \n KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u00bb Three-quarters of a century after he was killed during the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the remains of a young Navy sailor finally are heading home to Kansas. \n Lewis Lowell Wagoner was a 20-year-old Navy seaman second class when he perished and was declared missing after the Dec. 7, 1941, attack that propelled the United States into World War II. Wagoner was aboard the USS Oklahoma when that battleship, along with other U.S. warships, was doomed by torpedoes while helplessly moored in Pearl Harbor. \n Wagoner's body, unidentified at the time, eventually was recovered, along with several hundred fellow shipmates. All of them were buried as \"unknowns\" in a Hawaii cemetery. But last year, the U.S. military dug up the mass graves and began a painstaking push by special military laboratories to put names to the remains, using pre-war dental records and modern advances in DNA testing. \n Wagoner's remains are to be flown Friday to Wichita, Kansas, a day before a memorial service and interment with military honors at a family plot in Harvey County's Whitewater Cemetery. A bronze grave marker \u2014 noting the Missouri-born serviceman's status as a Purple Heart recipient \u2014 already awaits him in a row of final resting places for three of his seven brothers. Just one brother, 87-year-old Carl Wagoner of Syracuse, Utah, is still living. \n While saying \"it's a joy that we're finally able to bring Uncle Lewis home,\" 70-year-old Wichita niece Linda Guinn called it bittersweet in that only one sibling is able see it happen. \n \"When his brothers all were younger, they were always talking about Lewis and wondering if he could ever be brought home,\" said Doris Wagoner, Lewis Wagoner's sister-in-law. Her husband \u2014 Merle Wagoner, a Navy veteran of the Korean War \u2014 died three years ago at the age of 79. \n Japanese planes hit the Oklahoma with a blitz of torpedoes, quickly capsizing the battleship. Thirty-two men were rescued via holes cut through the hull, but 415 sailors and 14 Marines didn't make it. \n All told, more than 2,400 sailors, Marines and soldiers died in the Pearl Harbor attack that sank or damaged 21 U.S. vessels. The Oklahoma's casualties were second only to the USS Arizona, which lost 1,177 men. \n The Pentagon has offered no public account about how Wagoner died, though Guinn said a shipmate friend of Wagoner's has said the two men dove off the torpedo-ravaged ship into the water ablaze with leaking oil and fuel. The friend survived and since has died; Wagoner was \"not a good swimmer\" and was never seen alive again, Guinn said. \n The Navy spent more than two years recovering remains from the Oklahoma, eventually laying them to rest in mass graves in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in an extinct volcanic crater known as Punchbowl. But last year, the Pentagon's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency began unearthing the remains from 45 gravesites, disinterring 61 caskets, many containing comingled remains of multiple people. \n On Sept. 30, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that scientists identified Wagoner's remains through dental comparisons and DNA that matched two brothers, who relatives said supplied genetic samples to the military about a decade ago. \n The same day, the agency also announced it had identified the remains of Navy Lt. j.g. Aloysius Schmitt of St. Lucas, Iowa, who was also aboard the Oklahoma. A visitation was held for the chaplain Wednesday in his hometown and a burial will be held in Dubuque, Iowa, on Saturday, The Telegraph Herald newspaper reported. \n Schmitt was among a group of sailors who discovered a small porthole as the ship was filling with water. He had the chance to escape but refused and hoisted others through the porthole and out to safety, according to the newspaper. \n By 2020, the accounting agency expects to identify 80 percent of the Oklahoma's unknown. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "75 years later, seaman killed in Pearl Harbor to return home"}

{"date": "October 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Phan \"Sandy\" Phan-Gillis. The husband of U.S. citizen Phan \"Sandy\" Phan-Gillis, who has been charged in China with spying, has spent months trying to prove his wife's innocence with the little information he had. He has collected documents and letters that he hopes can be used as evidence for her defense. \n BEIJING >> Nine days had passed since Jeff Gillis, at home in Houston, Texas, had last heard from his wife. During that phone call, she told Gillis she was extending her business trip in China, but he grew anxious. He filed a missing person's report with U.S. consular officials whose response left him flabbergasted: His wife, a business consultant, had been detained by Chinese state security agents almost two weeks earlier. \n Now, 18 months later, Phan Phan-Gillis is still detained, charged with spying and awaiting trial in China, consigned to an unknown fate in a highly opaque and impenetrable legal system in which even the charges brought against her remain cloudy. Gillis says that his wife appears to have been accused of spying against China two decades ago, although even her Chinese lawyer says he has been barred by Chinese law from providing details. \n Despite the scant information, Gillis has set about trying to prove his 56-year-old wife's innocence. He hopes documents he has uncovered will help free Phan-Gillis, known as Sandy to friends. Her lawyer says her trial has been postponed indefinitely from its original Sept. 19 court date. \n The case speaks to both rising suspicion between Beijing and Washington and China's drive to pursue those accused of crimes occurring outside its borders. Gillis says part of the charge relates to alleged spying carried out within the United States. \n \"China probably is now more aggressive in pursuing anyone who can be regarded as harming China's interests,\" said Fu Hualing, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong. \n \"If they think there's a violation of Chinese criminal law and the impact is felt within China they are willing to pursue that and they think that they probably have the capacity to do that now,\" he said. \"Imagine: The case happened in the '90s. It's not like it happened recently.\" \n Phan-Gillis' lawyer, Shang Baojun, said the American is charged with spying, but that he could not provide details because the case involves state secrets. The maximum sentence for spying is the death penalty. \n The court in Nanning, a city in southern China near the Vietnamese border, also refused to release specifics about the case. \n \"It is a closed trial because it involves state secrets, so it is inappropriate for us to release information \u2026 including the date of the trial,\" said Tang Xingzhong, administrative head at the Nanning Intermediate People's Court. Calls to the prosecutor in charge of the case rang unanswered. \n Jeff Gillis, 54, said the charge relates to \"beyond ridiculous\" allegations that Phan-Gillis went on a spy mission to Nanning in 1996, then returned to the U.S. and recruited Chinese citizens to work for a foreign spy organization within the United States in 1997 and 1998. He says the foreign spy organization is alleged to be the FBI. The bureau's press office declined to comment. \n Nanning is the capital of Guangxi, a poor farming region neighboring Guangdong province, where Phan-Gillis' family has its roots. Ethnically Chinese, Phan-Gillis was born in Vietnam and left that country as a teenager after the end of the Vietnam War, ending up via a harrowing boat journey in a refugee camp in Malaysia. She became an American citizen, met Gillis in 2001 and married him a year later. \n Gillis said his wife, a consultant who matched investors with projects, traveled to China numerous times on business and as a volunteer to promote cultural and business exchanges and better health care. Most of her trips have been to the southern business centers of Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Gillis said he had never heard his wife mention Guangxi until she brought it up in a phone call during her detention \u2014 his first clue in his quest to free her. \n Phan-Gillis was detained in March 2015; that September, Gillis quit his job as a U.S. production services manager for an oilfield services company to focus full time on freeing her. He remains in Houston; lawyers told him he should not come to China for the trial. \n Gillis started reading up on how Chinese cases work, and knew that he and the lawyers would only have a short window to prepare a defense once charges were filed and revealed to them. \n Lawyer Shang said they could read Phan-Gillis' case file only in early September \u2014 more than six weeks after she was indicted. Her legal team is not allowed to photocopy or take photos of the hundreds of pages. \n \"We can only copy it by hand,\" Shang said. \n Gillis knew virtually nothing about why his wife was in custody before he received an unexpected phone call about a year ago. At the time, Chinese President Xi Jinping was in the U.S. meeting President Barack Obama, and Gillis had just started a media campaign to coincide with Xi's visit. \n It was his wife. She frantically asked him to stop. \n \"She was pretty much begging me to tell the people who were on the phone in the room with her that I was going to stop the media campaign,\" Gillis said by phone from Houston. But she was also allowed to tell him that \"the case involved some people who she had known from Guangxi over 20 years ago.\" \n Soon, he was digging through his wife's old files, sorting them by year. When he learned more about the accusations he went straight to the boxes labeled \"1996,\" \"1997\" and \"1998.\" \n \"The house still looks like a warehouse. I have boxes stacked everywhere,\" he said. \n Gillis is thankful for his wife's tendency to hoard, because she left behind documents that show she couldn't have been present for the offenses he says she is accused of committing. \n \"I have the passport that shows that she didn't even have a visa in '96, no entries or exits. I have her pay stubs that show that she was not off on extended leave.\" \n He has found old receipts and a newspaper article with a photograph of Phan-Gillis attending a horse event in Houston when she is alleged to have been in China. He has submitted the documents to his wife's lawyers, and has pressed politicians to write letters on her behalf. \n U.S. consular officials are allowed to visit Phan-Gillis once a month. Gillis said she told them that threats and relentless interrogation sessions caused her to suffer a heart attack. \n \"Hearing how they had treated her, it made me cry,\" he said. \n U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said that China \"continues to withhold many details of the case.\" \n \"We remain deeply concerned about Ms. Phan-Gillis' welfare and continue to monitor her case closely,\" he said in a statement. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Husband fights for evidence to help U.S. wife accused in China"}

{"date": "October 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Georgia Rep. Terry England, speaks on the House floor in Atlanta. The Republican legislator is among those still dubious about expanding Medicaid. He said the health care system in the U.S. is broken. \n ATLANTA >> The cost of expanding Medicaid under President Barack Obama's health care overhaul is rising faster than expected in many states, causing budget anxieties and political misgivings. \n Far more people than projected are signing up under the new, more relaxed eligibility requirements, and their health care costs are running higher than anticipated, in part because the new enrollees are apparently sicker than expected. Rising drug prices may also be a factor. \n As a result, at least three expansion states, Arkansas, Kentucky and Ohio, have been pushing to require Medicaid recipients to pay more toward their health insurance \u2014 a step that some experts say could lead tens of thousands of poor people who can't afford the extra cost to drop off the Medicaid rolls and go without coverage. Contrary to common perceptions, Medicaid coverage isn't always free \u2014 many states require modest copayments. \n The soaring tab for the state-federal program could also harden opposition to expansion in the 19 states that have yet to sign up. The situation will be one of the thorny issues the next president will have to address, with the health care of millions of Americans hanging in the balance. \n Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have opted to expand the program for poor and lower-income Americans as part of the Affordable Care Act, helping to greatly reduce the number of people without coverage. The federal government has been picking up the entire tab for the new enrollees, but states will begin paying a 5 percent share in January, and that will rise to 10 percent by 2020. \n While that may not sound like a lot, it can add up to tens of millions of dollars per state. Health care is already the second-biggest state expense, behind public schools, and a number of states have yet to see their tax revenue fully rebound from the Great Recession. \n Arkansas \u2014 where more than 307,000 people have signed up for the expansion, exceeding the projected 250,000 \u2014 is asking the federal government for permission to charge some new Medicaid recipients premiums to help cover the costs. Some lawmakers want to kill the expansion altogether. \n \"The facts are, it is what every other (Medicaid) program has been \u2014 a fiscal failure,\" said state Sen. Bart Hester, a Republican. \n In Kentucky, a state struggling to manage its pension debt, Republican Gov. Matt Bevin is asking for federal authorization to charge Medicaid enrollees up to $15 a month. He also wants to require some of them to perform \"community engagement,\" which would include working or volunteering. \n Some 400,000 Kentuckians have enrolled in Medicaid under the expansion, more than double the initial projections, prompting officials to allocate over $257 million for fiscal years 2017 and 2018. That's well beyond the initial estimate of $107 million. \n \"At the end of the day, there needs to be the ability to pay for this,\" Bevin, who like the state of Arkansas is waiting for an answer from Washington, said last month. \"Why trick people, why lie to people, which is what we would be doing if we were to promise something that there was not the ability to pay for?\" \n Kentucky officials have estimated the proposed changes could result in at least 86,000 people dropping off the Medicaid rolls by 2021. One of them is Steve Olshewsky. \n He makes about $9,000 a year teaching online classes and said he could not afford a monthly premium. He has struggled with depression and said he is doing better since he enrolled in Medicaid. \n \"I'm happy with my life,\" he said. \"But if you pull this rug out from under me, that's the end of that story.\" \n Under the Affordable Care Act, states have the option of expanding Medicaid by loosening the eligibility requirements to include all adults with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or roughly $16,390 for an individual. \n The Associated Press reported last year that more than a dozen states that opted to expand Medicaid had seen enrollments and costs surge beyond their expectations. In a report to Congress over the summer, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the cost of expansion was $6,366 per person in 2015, about 49 percent higher than anticipated. \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has promised that if elected she would work to expand Medicaid in the remaining 19 states. She is proposing an incentive for states that are holding back: three years of full federal financing. Republican Donald Trump has said he would repeal the federal health care law and supports turning Medicaid over to the states and limiting federal financing. \n In Ohio, nearly 715,000 people had enrolled under the expansion as of August, way beyond the original estimates of roughly 447,000 by fiscal year 2020. Ohio ended up budgeting more than double the $55.5 million it estimated the new enrollees would cost in the coming fiscal year. \n The situation took on more urgency after federal officials last month rejected Ohio's proposal to charge some recipients as much as $99 a year. \n Lawmakers in some states that have refused to expand Medicaid continue debating it, with some opposed for financial reasons, philosophical ones or both. \n In Georgia, the state Chamber of Commerce recently produced three options for expansion. Each includes charging premiums. \n Republican state Rep. Terry England, chairman of the House budget committee, is among those still dubious about expanding Medicaid. He said the health care system in the U.S. is broken. \n \"I'm a pretty firm believer that throwing more money at it doesn't fix it,\" England said. \"You just prolong the agony until you sit down and fix the problem.\" \n ", "author": "", "title": "Rising cost of Medicaid expansion is unnerving some states"}
