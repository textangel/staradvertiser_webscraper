{"date": "October 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Relatives and friends grieve at the funeral of an alleged drug suspect Robert Manuel Jr. at the Manila's North Cemetery, Philippines after Manuel was killed with two others during a buy-bust police operation as part of the continuing \"War on Drugs\" campaign of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. \n MANILA, Philippines >> In just 100 days in office, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has stirred a hornet's nest by picking a fight with Barack Obama, the United Nations, the European Union and others who have criticized his brutal crackdown against drugs that has left more than 3,600 suspects dead. \n In another defining aspect of his unorthodox rule, the 71-year-old Duterte has pushed back his country's 65-year treaty alliance with the United States while reaching out to China and Russia. \n A look at the highlights of the first 100 days of Duterte's turbulent presidency. \n ANTI-DRUG WAR \n Duterte's obsessive focus on his deadly crackdown on illegal drugs, a hallmark of his three-decade political career, has single-handedly defined his early days in the presidency. It has become his boon and bane and earned widespread condemnations when he compared it to the Holocaust under Hitler. A rough estimate puts the death toll at about 3,600, including more than 1,300 suspects killed in gunbattles with police \u2014 an average of 36 killings a day since he took office on June 30. \n The scale of the crackdown has been unprecedented, with the police launching more than 23,500 raids so far and arresting 22,500 suspected drug dealers and addicts. More than 1.6 million houses of drug suspects have been visited by police to invite them to surrender and stop using drugs or disengage from the drug trade. About 732,000 addicts and dealers have surrendered, apparently for fear of being killed, overwhelming Duterte and the national police, and prompting them to scramble for land and money to build rehabilitation centers. \n Duterte's public threats to kill criminals, especially drug dealers, have helped considerably reduce the crime rate, according to police. A poll by the independent Social Weather Stations last month showed 84 percent of adult Filipinos were satisfied with his war on drugs, but 94 percent felt it was important for police to arrest suspects alive, underscoring public worry over the growing body count even in a crime- and insurgency-plagued country long accustomed to deadly violence. \n Western governments led by the U.S., the EU, the U.N. and human rights watchdogs are alarmed. Amnesty International says Duterte's \"first 100 days as president have been marked by state-sanctioned violence on a truly shocking scale.\" \n Uncertainty over the killings, Duterte's SOB-laced verbal assaults on President Barack Obama, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and other critics, along with flip-flopping government pronouncements, have been partly blamed for foreign selling in the stock market and the peso's plunge to a seven-year low. \n FRAYING U.S. ALLIANCE \n An emerging casualty under the Duterte presidency is the country's 65-year treaty alliance with the United States, which has been a constant target of his foul tongue. He has had a falling out with Obama, who along with the State Department raised concerns over the widespread drug killings, earning Duterte's wrath. In a speech this week, he told Obama \"to go to hell.\" \n While critical of the U.S., Duterte has reached out to China and Russia. \n Labeling himself as leftist, Duterte wants U.S. counterterrorism forces to leave his country's south, saying their presence was helping inflame restiveness among minority Muslims and they could be targeted by extremists. He ordered the military not to join the U.S. Navy in planned joint patrols in the disputed South China Sea, and said that an ongoing combat drill by U.S. Marines and their local counterparts, one of 28 joint exercises by the allies each year, would be the last of his six-year presidency. \n The U.S. has generally played down the effect of Duterte's remarks and underscored the Filipinos' long affinity with America, although Philippine officials have said that some of their U.S. counterparts have privately been concerned about where Washington's alliance with the Philippines is headed. \n Duterte's moves to limit engagements with visiting American troops will impede Washington's plans to expand the footprint of U.S. forces in Southeast Asia to serve as a counterweight to China, including in the South China Sea. \n TAMING DECADESLONG REBELLIONS \n Duterte's effort to resume peace talks with communist insurgents who are waging one of Asia's longest rebellions has led to cease-fire declarations by both sides. With a cease-fire accord forged under his predecessor with the largest Muslim rebel group, the easing of violence involving the communist insurgents has freed up thousands of troops who were redeployed to execute the president's order to destroy the brutal Abu Sayyaf group, notorious for kidnapping and beheading Western tourists. \n Duterte, however, walks a tightrope in handing concessions to the communists, including the release of long-detained insurgent leaders, without unsettling a military that's in the front line of a bloody conflict that has left between 30,000 to 40,000 combatants and civilians dead in nearly half a century. He has made whirlwind visits to at least 22 military and police camps to explain his counterinsurgency strategy, raffle off pistols and update them on a pledge to double their salaries and improve medical care for combat troops. \n A Sept. 2 bomb attack that killed 15 people at a night market in Duterte's southern hometown of Davao prompted him to declare a \"state of lawlessness\" to empower the government to harness troops in countering militant threats in urban areas. The attack was a reality check on the complexity of fighting the restiveness that Duterte blames on atrocities against local Muslims by American colonial forces around the early 1900s. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "A look at the 1st 100 days of Duterte's turbulent rule"}

{"date": "October 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Billy Bush appears on the \"Today\" show in New York. Bush says he's \"embarrassed and ashamed\" by a 2005 conversation he had with Donald Trump in which Trump made lewd comments about women. \n LOS ANGELES >> First it was Ryan Lochte lying about being robbed in Rio, and now it's Donald Trump's startlingly lewd videotaped comments. For the second time in less than two months, TV personality Billy Bush is part of a major news story \u2014 but this time, he's coming under fire. \n Although Bush was working for entertainment news show \"Access Hollywood\" when he and Trump exchanged crass, caught-on-video remarks about women in 2005, he's now a co-host of NBC News' \"Today\" and, observers say, may have violated standards of journalism as well as civility. \n At a minimum, the network should bar Bush from covering Trump and the presidential race, said Mark Feldstein, a former broadcast journalist and now a professor at the University of Maryland. If Bush failed to disclose the Trump exchange to his NBC News bosses, then more is demanded, he said. \n \"If he actively covered up information that he knew would embarrass a presidential candidate,\" that is a \"firing offense\" for a journalist whose job is to inform the public, Feldstein said. \n Even as a host on \"Access Hollywood,\" Bush should have known better, said Jonathan Handel, an entertainment industry lawyer and teacher at the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law. \n \"Someone in even a faux-journalist position has a lot of power to influence attitudes and behavior,\" Handel said. \"This isn't so much about journalist ethics as it is the line between respectful behavior and vulgar behavior.\" \n Bush should recuse himself from election coverage because it would be inappropriate to have him report on \"a campaign where his attitude toward women and the candidate (Trump) is compromised,\" he said. \n NBC did not respond Friday when asked whether the incident would affect Bush's role on \"Today,\" which he's had since August. He is co-host of the morning show's third hour, which tends to focus on lighter stories. Bush's interview with Lochte at Brazil's Summer Olympics, in which the swimmer first claimed he was a crime victim, was an atypical news story for Bush. \n The Trump video, which immediately swamped media headlines and drew rare apologies from Trump, stemmed from a visit that he and Bush paid to a soap opera set a decade ago. \n In the video, which was first published by The Washington Post, Trump brags to Bush about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife. Trump was apparently unaware that a live microphone caught the exchange. \n In a statement released by NBC News, Bush apologized Friday for his part in the encounter. \n \"Obviously I'm embarrassed and ashamed. It's no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago \u2014 I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I'm very sorry,\" he said. \n Bush, 44, has his own political connection: His father, Jonathan Bush, is the brother of former President George H.W. Bush. According to Billy Bush's NBC News biography posted online, he earned a bachelor's degree in international studies and government from Colby College in Maine. \n He and Trump spoke as the future Republican presidential candidate prepared to tape a cameo on the daytime soap \"Days of Our Lives.\" As they arrived at the studio, Bush spotted an actress, Arianne Zucker, who was to accompany them onto the set. \n \"Sheesh, your girl's hot as (expletive). In the purple,\" Bush said, referring to the color of Zucker's dress. \"Whoa, the Donald is good! Whoa, my man!\" \n \"I've gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,\" Trump said. \"You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful \u2026 I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\" \n \"Grab them by the p\u2014\u2014. You can do anything,\" Trump added. \n The two men then greet Zucker, and Bush plays matchmaker. \n \"How about a little hug for the Donald?\" he says to the actress, adding, \"How about a little hug for the Bushy?\" \n \"Access Hollywood\" said Friday its producers examined the show's hundreds of Trump interviews following an Associated Press story earlier this week in which former cast and crew members of \"The Apprentice\" recounted lewd and sexist comments made by Trump. \n There were seven other people on the bus with Trump and Bush at the time, including \"Access Hollywood\" staffers, members of Trump's staff and a bus driver. The crew left the bus to film Trump and Bush exiting it, but their microphones were left on recording their conversation. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Billy Bush under fire along with Trump for lewd comments"}

{"date": "October 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Mike Pendergrast moves a wagon down 41st Ave. full of sand to fill with sand bags around his home on the Isle of Palms as Hurricane Matthew approaches the Isle of Palms, S.C. \n CHARLESTON, S.C. >> A fast-weakening Hurricane Matthew continued its march along the Atlantic coast Saturday, lashing two of the South's most historic cities and some of its most popular resort islands, flattening trees, swamping streets and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands. \n The storm was blamed for at least four deaths in the U.S., all in Florida. In its long wake, it also left at least 470 dead in Haiti in one hard-hit district alone, according to officials, with other stricken areas still unreachable four days after the disaster struck. \n Matthew raked Georgia and South Carolina with torrential rain and stiff winds, and \u2014 for the first time in its run up the U.S. coastline \u2014 its storm center blew ashore, making landfall north of Charleston, near the town of McClellanville, where it caused serious flooding. \n Up until then, the center, or eye, mercifully stayed just far enough out at sea that coastal communities didn't feel the full force of Matthew's winds. As the storm passed one city after another, the reaction was relief that things were nowhere near as bad as many feared. \n \"We are all blessed that Matthew stayed off our coast,\" Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. \"We are blessed that we didn't have a direct hit.\" \n As of 11 a.m., Matthew \u2014 by some measures the most powerful hurricane to menace the U.S. in more than a decade \u2014 was just barely a hurricane, with winds of 75 mph. That was down from 145 mph when the storm roared into Haiti. \n Among the cities bracing for its effects later in the day were Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. From there, the storm was expected to veer out to sea and loop back around through the Bahamas and toward Florida again, though as a barely noticeable wave. \n North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory warned people not to let their guard down just because Matthew was losing steam. \n As the hurricane began making its exit, it looked as if forecasters had gotten it right. Matthew stayed near the middle of the National Hurricane Center map's \"cone of uncertainty\" as it scraped the coast. Forecasters defended the large-scale evacuations. \n \"What would you rather have as the alternative?\" said Colorado State University meteorology professor Phil Klotzbach. \n In Savannah, Georgia, a historic town of moss-draped squares and antebellum mansions, floodwaters several feet deep submerged a long stretch of President Street, which links downtown to the highway to Georgia's Tybee Island. A homeless woman was seen staggering through waters up to her neck. \n The shivering woman made it to the water's edge. A bystander handed her a sheet, which she wrapped around her neck. \n Matthew also brought some of the highest tides on record along the South Carolina coast. Streets in Charleston \u2014 a city of handsome pre-Civil War homes, church steeples and romantic carriage rides \u2014 were flooded. \n Leigh Webber watched the torrential rains from the porch of her home in the city's historic district. \n \"It's not as bad as maybe I was expecting,\" she said. \n \"I feel badly for a lot of the businesses downtown that have been closed since Wednesday,\" she added. \"I noticed a lot of hotels were completely closed. I know some weddings were canceled and it was a huge financial loss for a lot of people.\" \n South Carolina's golf-and-tennis resort Hilton Head Island also took a blow as the eye of the storm passed 20 miles to the east. At least one gust of 87 mph was recorded at Hilton Head. \n The two roads onto the island of 40,000 people were blocked by fallen pine trees, and many roads were under water. Signs were blown over, and power was out across the island. \n Chandler Brunson and was among those trying to go back to her home after evacuating, but found her path blocked. \n \"I think we're going to have a pine tree splitting our house,\" she said. \"That's what I'm afraid of.\" \n Residents of Brunswick, Georgia, woke to roads covered by water or fallen trees and power lines. All access points to nearby St. Simons Island from the mainland were blocked. Tybee Island also took a beating, with gusts clocked at 93 mph. \n Nearly a half-million electric customers in South Carolina were left without power, and 250,000 were in the dark in coastal Georgia. \n Matthew set off alarms as it closed in on the U.S., triggering evacuation orders covering at least 2 million people. But in the end, the hurricane skirted Florida's heavily populated Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach area and sideswiped cities farther north, including Daytona Beach, Vero Beach, Cape Canaveral and Jacksonville, without its center ever actually coming ashore in Florida. \n The damage consisted largely of fallen trees and power lines, eroded beaches and flooded roads. In northeastern Florida, the storm gouged out several large sections of the coastal A1A highway north of Daytona Beach. \n Well south of the storm, things quickly began returning to normal Saturday, with all three of Orlando's main theme parks \u2014 Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld \u2014 reopening in the morning. And the power began coming back on for the 1 million people in Florida who lost it. \n The deaths in Florida included an elderly St. Lucie County couple who died from carbon monoxide fumes while running a generator in their garage and two women who were killed when trees fell on a home and a camper. \n Fire Chief Don Petito said waves and storm surge flattened sand dunes and allowed water to inundate a community in Florida's Flagler County. At one point, he said, rescuers getting people out of homes saw a shark in the water. No one was hurt. \n The storm raked yet another historic Southern city on its way up the coast: St. Augustine, Florida, which was founded by the Spanish in the 1500s and includes a 17th-century stone fortress and many historic homes turned into bed-and-breakfasts. The city was left awash in rain and gray seawater, though the floodwaters had mostly receded by Saturday morning. \n Property manager Nick Trunck was in the city's historic district to check on several stores and apartments. He said he was prepared for the worst, but the damage consisted of little more than several lost shingles, a lost awning and water seeping into one area. \n Trunck had arranged for 10 men to come from Connecticut to help with the cleanup, but after getting a look at the aftermath, he said he didn't think he needed anything but \"a couple of guys and a mop.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "A weakening Matthew rakes Atlantic coast; U.S. death toll at 4"}

{"date": "October 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama speaks to members of the military community on Sept. 28 in Fort Lee, Va. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Amanda Nguyen remembers watching the reactions of lawmakers as they listened to women from their states and districts who had been sexually assaulted \u2014 and family members of victims who had been killed.  \n That's when she realized change was still possible, even in Washington's era of dysfunction. \n Nguyen can also recall the crowded crisis center waiting room, a few years earlier, where she found herself after being sexually assaulted. It was there, she said, that she first realized she was part of a struggle larger than her own personal tragedy. \n Not long after the attack, she came to Washington. There, she found Democratic and Republican allies. And just over a year after taking the fight to Capitol Hill, Nguyen used her own account to alter federal law. A bill that received zero votes in opposition in either chamber known as the \"Survivor's Bill of Rights\" became law Friday when President Barack Obama signed it. \n Nguyen had fought to ensure the rape kit used to collect evidence after her assault would not be destroyed. After looking into it, she realized states and commonwealths treated the materials \u2014 and the rights of victims \u2014 differently. \n \"Justice depends on geography,\" she said. \n She wasn't satisfied with the status quo. What she decided to do was rooted in her belief in \"equality under the law.\" That, she said, is what \"everyone teaches you our country is built on.\" \n Nguyen could have been silent. She could have remained anonymous, as many victims of sexual assaults do each year. \n Instead, she opted to fight. But not via a criminal justice system she views as broken. Nguyen chose a different path, one that led her to traverse the halls of Congress looking for lawmakers willing to help her make a stand by giving sexual assault survivors more rights. \n \"It really came down to realizing the struggles I was dealing with in the criminal justice system were not exclusive to me,\" she told Roll Call on Friday. \n Fighting back tears There were hard times as she and other members of a coalition called Rise used a $60,000 budget to push members. \n \"I cannot count how many times I have had to sit there trying to suppress my tears when there were staffers or others who wanted to debate my own civil rights in front of my face,\" she said. \"Some even went so far as to threaten me for trying to get this passed.\" \n Staffers told her their bosses were focused on re-election campaigns or simply that \"this isn't something that my member cares about or prioritizes.\" \n \"That's not uncommon for citizen advocates to hear,\" Nguyen said. \n Her voice grew more serious as she shared an insight many in Washington well beyond their mid-20s have yet to learn: \n \"But legislation isn't dead until it's truly dead.\" \n She and her Rise colleagues kept going. And in the end, they defied substantial odds. Data experts ran the numbers and told the coalition that of the substantive bills that both the House and Senate have passed since 1989 via a recorded tally, only 0.016 percent were approved unanimously. \n Nguyen said she was raped in Massachusetts in 2013. So far, her contact with the criminal justice system has focused on preserving her rape kit. \n Nguyen does not discuss specifics, a Rise spokeswoman said Friday. One reason is she doesn't want to dissuade other victims from contacting law enforcement officials. \n The spokeswoman said Nguyen has not yet pursued criminal charges, heeding the advice of her counsel that a criminal trial could take up to two years \u2014 and legal bills. She did not feel in a personal or professional position to commit that kind of time or resources to a lengthy criminal proceeding, the spokeswoman said. \n Part of the reason, according to interviews Nguyen has done, is she works a hectic full-time job in Washington as deputy White House liaison to the State Department. \n Congressional aides say Nguyen began walking the halls of congressional office buildings in 2013, legislation in hand, looking for someone to take up the cause of ensuring evidence collected from rape victims is not destroyed after six months. \n Eventually, she headed to the Hart Senate Office Building on the Senate side, and found her way into the office of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. She first met with an aide to the New Hampshire Democrat, who quickly recognized the issue was worthy of quick action and one that could likely be shepherded to the president's desk for his signature. \n Soon after, Nguyen met with Shaheen, who has written that she was \"deeply moved\" by the 24-year-old's story. \n \"The trauma of the assault was made worse by what came next as she sought justice. After reporting her assault, she experienced a criminal justice system that was working against her, not for her,\" Shaheen wrote in a Medium post. \"Amanda, and so many survivors like her, have to navigate a complex and cryptic maze of policies and laws that differ from state to state, jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\" \n Six months after meeting with Nguyen \u2014 a relative blink of an eye when it comes to moving legislation \u2014 Shaheen and fellow Democrats Judiciary ranking member Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut introduced an early version of the legislation. \n Between those first July 2015 meetings and the bill's introduction in February, aides say it underwent a thorough process that included numerous drafts. \n The measure throws federal law behind survivors of alleged sexual assaults by giving them the right to use them in federal court. The law will make available so-called \"rape kits,\" or the items used to collect and preserve physical evidence in sexual assault cases. \n The law will also hand assault survivors the ability to say whether they want the kits preserved through the statute of limitation, and ensure they don't have to pay. \n Formally called the Survivors' Bill of Rights Act, the measure passed the House 399-0 in early September. The Senate followed with its own unanimous approval Sept. 28. \n \"It's been just over a year since Amanda Nguyen walked into my office recounting the heartbreaking story of what happened after she reported her assault,\" Shaheen said in a statement.  \n \"Survivors of sexual assault like Amanda need to know the government and justice system are on their side, and with a unanimous vote in Congress, we have sent a strong signal to survivors across the country: We are committed to changing the culture around how survivors will be treated in our criminal justice system,\" Shaheen said. \n Across the Capitol, Democratic Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida and Zoe Lofgren of California, and GOP Rep. Mimi Walters of California pushed a nearly identical initial version through the House. Technical differences were then worked out before both chambers sent the final version to Obama's desk. \n \u2014\u2014  \n (Bridget Bowman contributed to this report.)  \n \u2014\u2014  \n \u00a92016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved  \n ", "author": "By John T.

{"date": "October 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Sept. 26 photo, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shake hands during the presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb The first debate's lingering impressions of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump: He's outrageous, and she knows her stuff. \n Second debates, which Trump and Clinton will have Sunday, have a history of either confirming or correcting first debate impressions. \n In 2012, President Barack Obama seemed languid and the GOP's Mitt Romney got a boost. Obama came back strong in the second debate, and was on his way to re-election. \n Most notably, President Ronald Reagan in 1984 ended the first debate with Democrat Walter Mondale with a long, rambling monologue. Questions were raised whether the 73-year-old president was up to the job; Reagan quickly erased those doubts in the second debate. \n Now it's Trump's turn to overcome the brash, even offensive and rude image he projected when he and Clinton first met. Clinton has a mission, too, voters said: Continue to project competence and confidence and somehow give people reasons to trust her. \n Paul Levinson, a New York-based author who has written extensively on media, predicts Sunday's audience could swell to 90 million to 95 million. \n That's more than the first debate's 84 million. \n \"Trump is a bigger-than-life entertainment figure \u2014 his penchant for saying outlandish things, behaving like an oaf, impulsively verbally attacking people \u2014 all of that will attract viewers hoping for a circus performance,\" Levinson said.  \n And that could sour the shrinking pool of undecided voters on Trump, once and for all. They currently make up roughly 6 percent of the electorate, a significant number in a campaign that polls find is close. \n Polling finds that 12 states with 140 electoral votes remain too close to call. A total of 270 electoral votes are needed to win. The biggest remaining prizes include Florida, with 29 electoral votes, Pennsylvania, with 20, and North Carolina, with 15. Clinton is ahead in all three, but not by much. \n \"He's got to stay on point,\" said Evelyn Murray, a Raleigh, N.C., hardware store owner and Trump supporter. \n Pollster Patrick Murray explained why. \"There's no question that the first debate moved the needle. But those gains are not locked in,\" said the director of the nonpartisan Monmouth University Polling Institute. \"The second debate will determine that.\" \n \"I consider this Game 2 of a three-game series and Clinton won Game 1,\" said Frank Sadler, a Republican strategist. \"The only difference is we know they'll play Game 3 but it won't matter if Trump doesn't win Game 2.\" \n Kae Roberts, a Charlotte, N.C., school media specialist, is an unaffiliated voter who backed Romney in 2012. \n \"The last debate convinced me Trump's pretty unstable in certain areas,\" she said. \n But she's still not in Clinton's corner. Clinton, she said, keeps reciting the same Democratic platform and \"all she'd do is create more big government.\" \n Roberts is not optimistic that Sunday's debate will make up her mind. \"I'm looking for someone to convince me they'll do something intelligent,\" she said. \"But that seems to be an oxymoron in this election.\" \n Here are some questions that voters in two swing states, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, are looking for the candidates to address.  \n Can Trump be more statesmanlike?  \n \"Talk about matters at hand,\" said Marissa Ritter, a motor truck service adviser from Lake Ariel, Pa. She echoed the sentiment of several voters who want to see how Trump would operate as president. \n Murray expects Clinton to keep bringing up Trump's insults and stumbles; she wants the Republican to keep talking about policy. The town hall format should help his informal style, supporters say, but he has to fill in lots of blanks on policy. \n Her recommendation: Show how he'd get rid of Obamacare. Murray and her daughter pay $850 a month for health insurance coverage. Last year they paid $700. \"It's unaffordable now,\" Murray said. \n Can Clinton motivate my friends and me to turn out?  \n Veronica Weyhrauch, a Penn State student majoring in international politics and economics, is a big Clinton fan. But she understands why many her age are not. \n \"A lot of young people don't think the system works for them, and they see her as symbolic of that,\" Weyhrauch said. \n Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, got an overwhelming majority among voters 29 and under in the Democratic primary, and the question now is not so much whether they'll turn to Trump \u2014 polls say they won't \u2014 but whether they'll vote at all. \n This debate is important in convincing them, Weyhrauch said. \"They think she's more of the same,\" she said, \"and they need to see and hear that that's not true.\" \n Is Gary Johnson a viable alternative?  \n The Libertarian did not poll well enough to be included Sunday, but disgusted voters are weighing supporting him if they continue not to like what they see. \n \"I want another choice,\" said John Fitzgerald, an unaffiliated voter from Charlotte. \n He finds that Trump \"clearly articulates a message and direction that is best for the country, but is way too erratic and socially unaware to be commander in chief or head of state. Hillary has the experience, but represents a continuation of the policies practiced by both parties for over 20 years.\" \n To Hank Federal, a registered Republican from Charlotte, it's up to Trump. He thought Trump's performance at the first debate was \"bombastic.\" \n Sunday, he said, \"I want to see if, in any way, Trump shows leadership qualities in the town hall format. If not, then I'll keep moving to Johnson.\" \n Will there be more detail about precisely where Clinton and Trump stand?  \n \"Talk about immigration and what's going on with that,\" said Tara Glenny, a practical nursing student at Central Pennsylvania Institute of Science and Technology who backs Trump. \"If we keep accepting illegal immigrants, where are the jobs for us?\" \n Michael Straw, who heads the Penn State College Republicans, is undecided. He wants to hear more about Russia. Trump has cited Russian leader Vladimir Putin for his strength, while Clinton has warned that Putin is a dangerous dictator. \n \"If I see Donald Trump more friendly to Russia, it would confirm my impression I should be worried about him,\" Straw said. \n His impressions from the debate, as with other voters, will be crucial. \n Addressing an issue substantively will matter, Straw said. \"Standing on the debate stage, there's less confusion,\" he said. \"You can say where you stand, and then it becomes hard to go back on that issue.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 McClatchy Washington Bureau  \n ", "author": "By David Lightman McClatchy Washington Bureau", "title": "What voters hope to learn from Sunday's presidential debate showdown"}

Krasinski then attempted to begin Affleck's role of Hunting's wise-cracking friend, when he appeared. \n The crowd screamed and gave a standing ovation and Krasinski took over the duty of narrator. \n The reading went off script a few times, like when Krasinski would jokingly protest to Blunt and Damon's portrayal of lovers and when Affleck and Damon pointed out inside jokes. A few lines were flubbed, but the theater was silent when Martindale recited Williams' dialogue in an emotional scene. \n \"Good Will Hunting\" won Damon and Affleck the Oscar for best writing of an original screenplay in 1997.

{"date": "October 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks in Harrisburg, Pa. on Tuesday. For Clinton, October is the month when she's likely to win or lose the election, not the official Election Day on Nov. 8. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Excerpts of Hillary Clinton's paid speeches, including those to Wall Street, were leaked today, a revelation that may perpetuate criticism that she is an out-of-touch Washington insider and could create trouble for her in the final weeks of her campaign for president. \n \"Obviously, I'm kind of far removed because the life I've lived and the economic, you know, fortunes that my husband and I now enjoy, but I haven't forgotten it,\" Clinton told Goldman-Black Rock on Feb. 4, 2014. \n In the transcripts, Clinton acknowledges that she can't relate to everyday Americans and admits she's created a public personality separate from who she is in private. She discusses her positions on trade, health care and Wall Street. \n \"Politics is like sausage being made,\" Clinton told the National Multi-Housing Council on April 24, 2013. \"It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.\" \n The partial transcripts of the speeches were published by the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks as part of a leak of more than 2,000 emails belonging to her campaign chairman, John Podesta. McClatchy could not verify the authenticity of the emails, and Clinton's campaign declined to confirm their authenticity. \n The release came on the same day that the Obama administration accused Russia of being behind the hacking of Democratic National Committee computers in June, and four days after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said he would begin 10 weeks of releases of what he said would be more than 1 million documents. \n \"Earlier today the U.S. government removed any reasonable doubt that the Kremlin has weaponized WikiLeaks to meddle in our election and benefit Donald Trump's candidacy,\" Clinton campaign spokesman Glen Caplin said. \"We are not going to confirm the authenticity of stolen documents released by Julian Assange, who has made no secret of his desire to damage Hillary Clinton.\" \n Caplin said other hackers have already proven the warnings of top national security officials that \"documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated Russian misinformation campaign.\" \n Clinton has repeatedly refused to release transcripts of her speeches, a position that became a fierce point of contention with her opponent in the primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose campaign focused on assertions that Clinton was part of the moneyed Washington establishment. Clinton made about $21.5 million on speeches after she resigned as secretary of state in early 2013 and before she launched her presidential campaign in the spring of 2015. \n Sanders' demands for the speeches struck a nerve with Democratic Party officials, the leaked emails suggest. In one email, dated Jan. 25, 2016, Clinton research director Tony Carrk sent 25 excerpts from the speeches to several party officials, including Podesta. The subject line was \"HRC Paid Speeches.\" \n \"Team, attached are the flags from HRC's paid speeches we have from HWA. I put some highlights below. There is a lot of policy positions that we should give an extra scrub with policy,\" he wrote. \n Some of Clinton's speeches would have been campaign fodder for Sanders. \n In a speech to a symposium hosted by the investment bank Goldman Sachs on Oct. 24, 2013, Clinton indicated that Wall Street insiders knew best what sort of regulations the markets needed. \n \"There's nothing magic about regulations, too much is bad, too little is bad. How do you get to the golden key, how do we figure out what works? And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry,\" Clinton said. \n And in a speech at the University of Connecticut on April 23, 2014, Clinton voiced deep awareness that foreign governments were intercepting State Department communications and personal emails. \n \"At the State Department we were attacked every hour, more than once an hour by incoming efforts to penetrate everything we had. And that was true across the U.S. government,\" Clinton said. \"And we knew it was going on when I would go to China, or I would go to Russia, we would leave all of our electronic equipment on the plane, with the batteries out, because this is a new frontier. And they're trying to find out not just about what we do in our government. They're trying to find out about what a lot of companies do and they were going after the personal emails of people who worked in the State Department.\" \n According to the email, in a Jan. 6, 2014, speech to General Electric's Global Leadership Meeting in Boca Raton, Fla., Clinton also lamented the high cost of campaigns as \"so ridiculous\" and described it as a \"kind of free for all\" that the Supreme Court allowed. \n \"So we're kind of in the wild west, and, you know, it would be very difficult to run for president without raising a huge amount of money and without having other people supporting you because your opponent will have their supporters. So I think as hard as it was when I ran, I think it's even harder now,\" Clinton said. \n \"With today's WikiLeaks revelations we are finding out who Hillary Clinton really is, and it's not hard to see why she fought so hard to keep her transcripts of speeches to Wall Street banks paying her millions of dollars secret,\" Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, said in a statement. \"The truth that has been exposed here is that the persona Hillary Clinton has adopted for her campaign is a complete and utter fraud. How can Bernie Sanders and many like-minded Democrats continue to support her candidacy in light of these revelations?\" \n Analysts doubted that the excerpts would have much effect now. In New Hampshire, where the race is too close to call and Sanders still has a strong following, pollster Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, said the Clinton news wouldn't make much difference. \"Most of this is already baked into the cake,\" he said.  \n In North Carolina, Jason Husser, director of the Elon University Poll, agreed the effect would be minimal. \"While some of Clinton's quotes certainly aren't helpful to her,\" Husser said, \"they largely confirm suspicions that many in the Sanders' coalition already begrudgingly accepted as they switched to Clinton over Trump.\" \n In California, Democratic consultant Bob Mulholland agreed the Clinton news would not hurt her. \"With only 33 days left, most voters have concluded the candidates have warts,\" he said, and have made their decisions with that in mind. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 McClatchy Washington Bureau  \n ", "author": "By Anita Kumar, Tim Johnson and David Lightman McClatchy Washington Bureau", "title": "WikiLeaks email dump reveals parts of Clinton's speeches to Wall Street"}

{"date": "October 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This photo released by the Texas Office of the Attorney General shows Carl Ferrer. \n HOUSTON \u00bb Handcuffed and dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit, the chief executive of an internet site authorities accuse of being \"a hub for the illegal sex trade\" waived extradition to California today, and his attorney vowed to fight the \"trumped up\" sex trafficking and money laundering charges he faces. \n Backpage.com Chief Executive Officer Carl Ferrer was arrested Thursday and his Dallas headquarters was raided after officials in California accused him of felony pimping a minor, pimping, and conspiracy to commit pimping. Under California law, felony pimping is defined as making money off prostitutes or soliciting customers for prostitution. Texas' state attorney general's office added money-laundering to the list of alleged crimes. \n Ferrer, 55, was arrested after arriving in Houston on a flight from Amsterdam. Backpage.com is a Dutch-owned limited liability corporation. Ferrer was expected to be flown to California later Friday. \n Ferrer, wearing glasses, said very little during his brief court hearing, acknowledging he was waiving extradition. \n \"Mr. Ferrer looks forward to vigorously fighting these charges that we believe are trumped up,\" Ferrer's attorney, Philip Hilder, said after Friday's extradition hearing. Hilder declined to comment on further questions related to the charges. \n Authorities also issued arrest warrants for Backpage's controlling shareholders: Michael Lacey, 68, and James Larkin, 67. It wasn't immediately clear Friday whether the men, who live in Arizona, had been taken into custody. \n Lacey and Larkin are former owners of the Village Voice and the Phoenix New Times. It wasn't clear if they had attorneys. An attorney who previously represented the two men, Michael Manning, said he was not representing them in this case. \n Cindy McCain, the wife of Arizona U.S. Sen. John McCain and who has been leading efforts for several years to fight human trafficking, called Ferrer's arrest a \"huge game-changer\" in the efforts to crack down on the trafficking of young girls and boys for sex. \n Texas state agents raided Backpage's Dallas offices following allegations that adult and child sex-trafficking victims were forced into prostitution through escort ads posted on the site. \n Backpage.com advertises a wide range of services, but California officials said the site collects fees from users who use coded language and nearly nude photos to offer sex for money. A California court affidavit says that Ferrer expanded Backpage.com's share of online sex marketing by creating affiliated sites including EvilEmpire.com and BigCity.com with related content. \n The ad portal received more than 90 percent of its revenue from the adult escort ad portion of its classified advertising business, according to a search warrant affidavit filed by the Texas Attorney General's office. In California, that amounted to about $50 million between January 2013 and May 2015, or between $1.5 million and $2.5 million a month, it said. \n Ferrer was told directly by law enforcement officials about prostitution on the site \"and is regularly copied on the hundreds of law enforcement subpoenas and requests that Backpage.com receives each year related to prostitution and sex trafficking of both adults and minors on the website,\" according to the affidavit. \n The California complaint alleges that rather than merely being a conduit for the ads, Ferrer \"developed and oversaw a process to screen escort ads on Backpage.com.\" By charging for the ads, the state charges that he and his co-defendants violated the state's law against pimping, defined as making money off prostitutes or soliciting customers for prostitution. \n California authorities said the state's three-year investigation found many of the ads involve victims of sex trafficking including children under the age of 18. \n One of the advertisers, identified only as 15-year-old \"E.S.,\" \"was forced into prostitution at the age of 13 by her pimp,\" according to an affidavit filed with the complaint. She used other online advertising services until they were shut down, the court filing says, when she turned to Backpage.com. \n The criminal charges, like a lawsuit pending in Washington state, skirt free-speech and federal internet immunity protections by alleging that Backpage profited by directly participating in sex trafficking, including of minors. \n In a statement Friday, Liz McDougall, Backpage.com general counsel, called the raid and Ferrer's arrest \"an election-year stunt, not a good-faith action by law enforcement.\" \n She said prostitution ads violate Backpage.com's policies against illegal content, that the company blocked the posting of ads using terms that violated those policies and also removed ads when contacted by law enforcement \n \"The actions of the California and Texas Attorneys General are flatly illegal. They ignore the holdings of numerous federal courts that the First Amendment protects the ads on Backpage.com,\" McDougall said. She also contended that they also violate the U.S. Communications Decency Act \"pre-empting state actions such as this one and immunizing web hosts of third-party created content.\" \n However, the criminal complaint and affidavit, like the Washington lawsuit filed on behalf of three underage girls, contend that Backstage actively coached advertisers in how to write advertisements in ways that would stay within legal limits while still encouraging commercial sex. \n Backpage has argued that it merely publishes advertisements that are created and provided by others, but the Washington Supreme Court ruled last year that the company didn't just host the ads, but helped develop the content. \n The girls' civil attorney, Erik Bauer, said at the time that the three were in the seventh and ninth grades when adult professional sex traffickers sold them as prostitutes on Backpage. \n Kristin Ford, a spokeswoman for the California attorney general, declined comment on the company's statement. A message to a spokeswoman for the Texas attorney general drew no response. \n California officials said their investigation was prompted in part by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which reported 2,900 instances to California authorities since 2012 when suspected child sex trafficking occurred using Backpage.com. \n The charges against Ferrer could bring him nearly 22 years in prison, while Larkin and Lacey face a maximum six years. \n A U.S. Senate subcommittee that has investigated the company estimated its annual revenue at more than $150 million. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers David Warren in Dallas, Don Thompson in Sacramento, California, and Bob Christie in Phoenix contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Juan A.

{"date": "October 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a town hall in Sandown, N.H. Trump made a series of lewd and sexually charged comments about women as he waited to make a cameo appearance on a soap opera in 2005. The Republican presidential nominee issued a rare apology Friday, \"if anyone was offended.\" \n NEW YORK \u00bb Caught on tape making shockingly crude comments about a married woman he tried to seduce, Donald Trump declared in a midnight video, \"I was wrong and I apologize.\" Yet even as he did so, he claimed the astonishing recording was \"nothing more than a distraction\" and argued his words were not nearly as egregious as former President Bill Clinton's marital affairs. \n \"I've said some foolish things,\" the Republican presidential nominee said in a taped apology posted on his Facebook page early Saturday morning. \"But there's a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women.\" \n Turning to his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, Trump accused her of having \"bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated\" her husband's \"victims.\" \n Trump's 90-second statement capped a jarring day that threatened to sink his presidential campaign and sent Republicans into a panic with early voting well underway in several states and a little more than a month until Election Day. \n On Friday afternoon, The Washington Post and NBC News released a 2005 video on which Trump describes trying to have sex with a married woman. He also brags about women letting him kiss and grab them because he is famous. \n \"When you're a star they let you do it,\" Trump says. \"You can do anything.\" \n He adds seconds later, \"Grab them by the p\u2014\u2014. You can do anything.\" \n Within hours, the shock of the video led to widespread condemnation from inside Trump's own party. House Speaker Paul Ryan said he was sickened by Trump's comments, while a one-sentence response from GOP's chairman was devastating. \n \"No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever,\" said Reince Priebus, who had stood by Trump through his past provocative comments. \n Ryan added tartly that Trump was \"no longer attending\" a joint campaign appearance set for Saturday in Wisconsin. Trump himself later said in a statement that he would be preparing for Sunday night's debate instead. \n Other Republicans, painfully aware of Trump's possible impact on their own political fates, were quick to chime in. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is locked in a close race, called his comments \"totally inappropriate and offensive.\" \n By the time Trump posted his video apology, three Republican members of Congress had called on Trump to abandon the race. Among them was Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who called Trump's words \"some of the most abhorrent and offensive comments that you can possibly imagine.\" \n Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, was \"beside himself\" and his wife was furious, according to a person familiar with their thinking. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity, because they were not authorized to share the private discussion. \n On the tape, Trump is caught on a live microphone while talking with Billy Bush of \"Access Hollywood.\" The candidate is heard saying \"I did try and f\u2014- her. She was married.\" He also uses graphic terms to describe the woman's body and says he frequently tries to kiss beautiful women. \n \"Access Hollywood\" said a recent Associated Press story about Trump's lewd behind-the-scenes comments as star of \"The Apprentice\" led it to dig through its archives and turn up the previously unaired tape. It was recorded during a bus ride while Trump was on his way to appear in an episode of the soap opera \"Days of Our Lives.\" \n Trump offered a half-hearted apology shortly after the video was released, saying he was sorry \"if anyone was offended.\" Only hours later, after the scope of the damage became clear, did he release the video statement. \n Trump appears alone in the video and appears to be reading off a script. He closes the video by suggesting he'll raise Bill Clinton's affairs again in the coming days. \n \"See you at the debate,\" he says. \n Hillary Clinton seized on Trump's quotes from the 2005 video, calling them \"horrific.\" She said in a Twitter message: \"We cannot allow this man to become president.\" \n But she had her own problems Friday with sudden revelations. \n The WikiLeaks organization posted what it said were thousands of emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, including some with excerpts from speeches she gave to Wall Street executives and others \u2014 speeches she has declined to release despite demands from Trump. \n The excerpts include Clinton seeming to put herself in the free trade camp, a position she has retreated from. In a talk to a Brazilian bank in 2013, she said her dream was \"a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.\" \n Trump strongly opposes current U.S. trade deals and insists Clinton is too cozy with Wall Street to reform it. \n Friday's developments came two days before Trump and Clinton are to meet in the second presidential debate, with the Republican urgently in need of a strong performance. After his uneven showing in the first contest, public opinion polls have showed Clinton pulling ahead in nearly all battleground states, some of which are already in the midst of early voting. \n There were plenty of other problems for Trump on what surely was one of the worst days of his two-year drive for the White House. \n His advisers planned for him to spend a quiet Friday preparing for the debate and meeting with border security officials. But the day was quickly consumed by a series of controversies, including Trump's unsubstantiated claim about immigrants in the U.S. illegally voting in the election and his questioning the innocence of five black teenagers exonerated in a 1989 rape case. \n Then, there were new signs of unusual links between Trump and Russia. For the first time, the U.S. publicly blamed the Russian government for hacking the Democratic National Committee and accused Moscow of trying to interfere with the American election. Diplomats also told the AP that Russia had lodged a formal complaint with the United Nations over a U.N. official's condemnations of Trump. \n Also in the mix Friday: New questions about the Trump campaign's finances. With roughly a month until Election Day, the campaign has yet to schedule the $100 million in television advertising that his campaign boasted about just two weeks ago. \n The campaign has just half that amount scheduled, and late this week shifted ad money around rather than increasing its overall investment, suggesting a bit of penny-pinching even as the clock winds down. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump apologizes, but also calls crude remarks a distraction"}

AUGUSTINE, Fla. \u00bb Hurricane Matthew spared Florida's most heavily populated stretch from a catastrophic blow Friday but threatened some of the South's most historic and picturesque cities with ruinous flooding and wind damage as it pushed its way up the coastline. \n Among the cities in the crosshairs were St. Augustine, Florida; Savannah, Georgia; and Charleston, South Carolina. \n \"There are houses that will probably not ever be the same again or not even be there,\" St. Augustine Mayor Nancy Shaver lamented as battleship-gray floodwaters coursed through the streets of the 451-year-old city founded by the Spanish. \n Matthew \u2014 the most powerful hurricane to threaten the Atlantic Seaboard in over a decade \u2014 set off alarm as it closed in on the U.S., having left more than 300 people dead in Haiti. \n In the end, it sideswiped Florida's Atlantic coast early Friday, swamping streets, toppling trees onto homes and knocking out power to more than 1 million people. But it stayed just far enough offshore to prevent major damage to cities like Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. And the coast never felt the full force of its 120 mph winds. \n \"It looks like we've dodged a bullet,\" said Rep. Patrick Murphy, a Democrat whose district includes Martin County, just north of West Palm Beach. \n At least four people died in Florida. An elderly St. Lucie County couple died from carbon monoxide fumes while running a generator in their garage and two women were killed in separate events when trees fell on a home and a camper. \n While the hurricane was weakening quickly, several northeastern Florida cities, including Jacksonville, were still in harm's way, along with communities farther up the coast. Authorities warned that not only could Matthew easily turn toward land, it could also cause deadly flooding with its surge of seawater. \n The storm gouged out several large sections of the coastal A1A highway north of Daytona Beach, and had nearly completely washed out the northbound lane for about a mile at Flagler Beach. \n \"It's pretty bad, it's jagged all over the place,\" said Oliver Shields, whose two-story house is within sight of the highway. \n About 500,000 people were under evacuation orders in the Jacksonville area, along with another half-million on the Georgia coast. More than 300,000 fled their homes in South Carolina. The latest forecast showed the storm could also scrape the North Carolina coast. \n \"If you're hoping it's just going to pass far enough offshore that this isn't a problem anymore \u2014 that is a very, very big mistake that you could make that could cost you your life,\" National Hurricane Center Director Rick Knabb warned. \n St. Augustine, which is the nation's oldest permanently occupied European settlement and includes a 17th-century Spanish fortress and many historic homes turned into bed-and-breakfasts, was awash in rain and seawater that authorities said could top 8 feet. \n \"It's a really serious devastating situation,\" the mayor of the city of 14,000 said. \"The flooding is just going to get higher and higher and higher.\" \n Historic downtown Charleston, usually bustling with tourists who flock to see the city's beautifully maintained antebellum homes, was eerily quiet, with many stores and shops boarded up with plywood and protected by stacks of sandbags. \n The city announced a midnight-to-6 a.m. curfew Saturday, around the time the coast was expected to take the brunt of the storm. \n Matthew's outer bands began lashing Savannah, a city that was settled in 1733 and has a handsome historic district of moss-draped trees, brick and cobblestone streets, Greek Revival mansions and other 18th- and 19th-century homes. \n Matthew was expected to bring winds of 50 to 60 mph that could snap branches from the burly live oaks and damage the historic homes. And 8 to 14 inches of rain could bring some street flooding. \n Savannah-Chatham County Police Chief Jack Lumpkin said officers will enforce a dusk-until-dawn curfew. \n A small crew of workers Thursday set out to button up the Owens-Thomas house, one of Savannah's architectural gems. The 1819 Greek Revival mansion serves as a museum. \n Sonja Wallen, a curator, said antique rugs and furniture were moved away from the home's more than 40 windows, many of them still with their original glass. Windows were fitted with plywood and other coverings, while sandbags were stacked at the basement entrance. \n \"It's basically a lot of little details \u2014 sandbags and duct tape around doorways where water can get in,\" Wallen said. \"It's pretty much the same stuff you would do for any home.\" \n Some of Georgia's resort islands were expected to take the brunt of Matthew's storm surge, including St. Simons and Tybee. \n On Tybee Island, where most of the 3,000 residents were evacuated, Jeff Dickey held out hope that the storm might shift and spare his home. But as the rain picked up, he decided staying wasn't worth the risk. \n \"We kind of tried to wait to see if it will tilt more to the east,\" Dickey said. \"But it's go time.\" \n Mayor Jason Buelterman personally called some of the holdouts, hoping to persuade them to move inland. \n \"This is what happens when you don't have a hurricane for 100 years,\" he said. \"People get complacent.\" \n At 9 p.m. EDT, Matthew was centered about 50 miles southeast of St. Simons Island, Georgia, and was moving north at 12 mph. Its wind speed had dropped to 110 mph, down from a terrifying 145 mph when it smashed into Haiti. \n Airlines canceled at least 5,000 flights Wednesday through Saturday, including many in and out of Orlando, where all three of the resort city's world-famous theme parks \u2014 Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld \u2014 closed because of the storm. \n But things began getting back to normal, with flights resuming in Miami and other South Florida airports. \n In areas the storm had already passed, residents and officials began to assess the damage. \n Robert Tyler had feared the storm surge would flood his street two blocks from the Cape Canaveral beach. Tree branches fell, he could hear transformers exploding overnight, and the windows seemed as if they were about to blow in, despite the plywood over them. \n But in the morning, there wasn't much water, his home didn't appear to be damaged on first inspection, and his vehicles were unharmed. \n \"Overnight, it was scary as heck,\" Tyler said. \"That description of a freight train is pretty accurate.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hurricane Matthew threatens some of South's most storied cities"}

{"date": "October 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Secretary of State John Kerry spoke in New York on Sept. 22. Kerry called today for Russia and Syria to face a war crimes investigation for their attacks on Syrian civilians. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Secretary of State John Kerry called today for Russia and Syria to face a war crimes investigation for their attacks on Syrian civilians, further illustrating the downward spiral in relations between Washington and Moscow. \n Kerry said Syrian forces hit a hospital overnight, killing 20 people and wounding 100, describing what would be the latest strike by Moscow or its ally in Damascus on a civilian target. \n \"Russia and the regime owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals, and medical facilities, and women and children,\" Kerry told reporters alongside French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, who arrived in Washington directly from meeting Russian officials in Moscow. \n Kerry said such acts \"beg for an appropriate investigation of war crimes.\" \n \"They are beyond the accidental now, way beyond,\" Kerry said in some of his toughest criticism to date. He accused Russia and Syria of undertaking a targeted strategy to \"terrorize civilians.\" \n Ayrault, for his part, spoke of a new French effort for a cease-fire in Syria. But it's unclear what advantages his plan would have over the U.S.-Russian led process that collapsed last month. \n Kerry's Sept. 9 agreement with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov would have created a new counterterrorism alliance in Syria, had fighting stopped for a week and aid deliveries been permitted to reach desperate civilians in rebel-held parts of Aleppo and other besieged areas. \n Neither condition was ever met. \n The truce then broke completely when Syria and Russia renewed their military offensive in Aleppo. Kerry ended bilateral discussions with Russia on the military partnership earlier this week. \n The war has killed as many as a half-million people since 2011, contributed to Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II and allowed the Islamic State group to carve out territory for itself and emerge as a global terror threat. \n As Kerry and Ayrault spoke at the State Department, Russia's lower house of parliament ratified a new treaty with Syria that would allow Russia's military to remain indefinitely in the Arab country. The vote was unanimous, a show of support for Syrian President Bashar Assad's government. \n Russia launched its air campaign in Syria a year ago, reversing the tide of war and helping Assad's forces make significant territorial gains. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Kerry says Russia, Syria should face war crimes probe"}
