{"date": "October 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A Donald Trump supporter heckles House Speaker Paul Ryan as he speaks during the 1st Congressional District Republican Party of Wisconsin's annual Fall Fest in Elkhorn. \n WASHINGTON >> Damaged but defiant, Donald Trump is limping toward a critical presidential debate against Hillary Clinton absent the backing of a growing group of Republican leaders. Trump insists he will \"never\" abandon his White House bid despite calls for him to step aside after his vulgar descriptions of sexual advances on women were revealed. \n Trump's task in Sunday's faceoff is enormous, and perhaps insurmountable. Even before the recording of his remarks were made public, the businessman was lagging behind Clinton after an undisciplined first debate and struggling to overcome deep skepticism among women about his temperament and qualifications to be commander in chief. \n Ohio Republican Party Chairman Matt Borges said that for Trump, \"The debate is now everything.\" \n Trump has hinted he may turn the debate into a referendum on Clinton's marriage, namely her husband's extramarital affairs and her treatment of the women who were involved. In what was billed as a videotaped apology for his actions, Trump said \"Bill Clinton has actually abused women\" and Hillary Clinton \"bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated\" her husband's \"victims.\" \n Outside Trump's small cadre of advisers, support for the businessman was scarce following Friday's release of the 2005 videotape in which he can be heard detailing his attempts to have sex with a married woman. In an extraordinary rebuke, Trump's own running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, declared he could neither condone nor defend the remarks. \n \"We pray for his family,\" Pence said in a statement after canceling a Wisconsin appearance scheduled with House Speaker Paul Ryan and the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, both of whom had condemned Trump's remarks but stopped short of withdrawing support altogether. \n Several other Republicans did take the extraordinary step of revoking support for their party's nominee one month from Election Day and with early voting already underway in some key states. \n Among them: Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte \u2014 both are running for re-election \u2014 and the party's 2008 nominee, Arizona Sen. John McCain, who had stood by Trump even after the billionaire questioned whether the former POW should be considered a war hero because he got \"captured.\" \n McCain, who is also facing a challenge in November, said Trump's behavior made it \"impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy.\" \n Many went further and called on Trump to quit the race altogether. \n \"I thought supporting the nominee was the best thing for our country and our party,\" Alabama Rep. Martha Roby said in a statement. \"Now, it is abundantly clear that the best thing for our country and our party is for Trump to step aside and allow a responsible, respectable Republican to lead the ticket.\" \n Republican leaders have scheduled a Monday morning conference call for House GOP lawmakers, who are out of town for Congress' election recess. The email obtained by The Associated Press doesn't specify the topic for the 11 a.m. EDT call, but rank-and-file lawmakers believe it's about Trump. Such calls are rare and usually held to discuss important matters. \n Trump, who spent Saturday hunkered down in his New York skyscraper, tweeted that he would not yield the GOP nomination under any circumstances: \"The media and establishment want me out of the race so badly \u2013 I WILL NEVER DROP OUT OF THE RACE, WILL NEVER LET MY SUPPORTERS DOWN!\" \n Indeed, many Trump voters remained loyal to the political outsider. Wisconsin voter Jean Stanley donned a shirt proclaiming \"Wisconsin Women Love Trump\" and called Ryan a \"traitor\" for denouncing the presidential contender's comments. \n \"He's a real human,\" Stanley said of the New York businessman, surrounded by Trump supporters at the Wisconsin rally where he was set to appear before the videotape emerged. \n The political firestorm was sparked by a 2005 video obtained and released Friday by The Washington Post and NBC News. In the video, Trump, who was married to his current wife at the time, is heard describing attempts to have sex with a married woman. He also brags about women letting him kiss them and grab their genitals because he is famous. \n \"When you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything,\" Trump says in the video. He adds seconds later: \"Grab them by the p\u2014\u2014. You can do anything.\" He said of his impulse to kiss beautiful women: \"I don't even wait.\" \n While still publicly backing Trump, the Republican National Committee is considering how to move forward. \n One possibility: re-directing its expansive political operation away from Trump and toward helping vulnerable Senate and House candidates. Such a move would leave Trump with virtually no political infrastructure in swing states to identify his supporters and ensure they vote. \n \"We are working to evaluate the appropriate messaging going forward,\" said RNC chief strategist Sean Spicer. \n Election law experts suggest it would be logistically impossible to replace Trump on the ballot altogether, with early voting underway in some states and overseas ballots already distributed to military servicemen and others. \n Ryan fundraising chief Spencer Zwick, however, said he's been fielding calls from donors who \"want help putting money together to fund a new person to be the GOP nominee.\" \n Zwick told the AP that a write-in or \"sticker campaign\" relying on social media could \"actually work.\" While there has never been a winning write-in campaign in a U.S. presidential contest, such an effort could make it harder for Trump to win. \n The release of the recording and ensuing backlash almost completely overshadowed the release of hacked emails from inside the Clinton campaign that revealed the contents of some of her previously secret paid speeches to Wall Street. \n The Democratic nominee told bankers behind closed doors that she favored \"open trade and open borders\" and said Wall Street executives were best-positioned to help overhaul the U.S. financial sector. Such comments were distinctively at odds with her tough talk about trade and Wall Street during the primary campaign. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire and Jill Colvin in New York, Bill Barrow in Atlanta, Julie Bykowicz and Alan Fram in Washington, and Scott Bauer in Elkhorn, Wisconsin, contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Julie Pace and Steve Peoples on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and http://twitter.com/sppeoples \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Damaged but defiant, Trump limps toward debate with Clinton"}

{"date": "October 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Relatives of Ukrainian prisoners of war hold their portraits at a rally outside the German embassy in Kiev, Ukraine. \n KIEV, Ukraine >> Just three days after Ukrainian soldier Oleksandr Lazarenko was taken prisoner in the war in Ukraine's east, a peace agreement was signed under which the sides agreed to an \"all-for-all\" prisoner exchange. A year and a half later, his wife still waits desperately for his return. \n The so-called Minsk Agreement on ending the war between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces is floundering on many issues, but prisoner releases appear to be one of the most intractable. \n Amnesty International and Human Rights watch allege that both sides have arbitrarily detained civilians, sometimes holding them incommunicado for months in prisons that authorities don't acknowledge exist. \n The sides cite widely varying figures for how many prisoners they're holding. Both appear to be holding the issue over the other's head to force concessions on other topics, which include holding elections in Ukraine's separatist region and restoring Ukraine's full control over its border with Russia. \n \"Our expectations have been thwarted by politicians' plans,\" Lazarenko's wife, Natalya, told The Associated Press. \"After Minsk, the prisoners became an instrument of political trading, they're seen as political commodities.\" \n Even that frustration and anxiety is something of an improvement. For three months after her husband was seized, she had no information on whether he was dead or alive. Lazarenko was captured by a Cossack formation that was not under the rebels' control. Eventually, he and 12 others were found by the rebel government's Committee on POWs and transferred to a detention facility in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, the rebels' main stronghold. \n Finally allowed to call his wife, Lazarenko said the Cossacks had held him in a windowless basement where he could only lie down on sacks of potatoes. He told her that he and the other prisoners were beaten and fed scraps. \n \"Sasha simply ceased to exist,\" his wife said. \n Although the numbers held by each side are in dispute, it's clear that the pace of releases has slowed markedly for Ukrainians held by the rebels. Since the Minsk agreement was signed in February 2015, 83 Ukrainian prisoners have been released, but only 12 of them were freed this year. \n Before the agreement, prisoners were handed over more freely. Yuri Tandyt, an adviser to Ukraine's national security service, told Ukrainian media in August that a total of 3,080 Ukrainian prisoners had been released by rebels or had been located since the beginning of fighting in April 2014. Ukraine now lists 112 names as soldiers held by the rebels, suggesting that thousands had been released prior to the Minsk agreement. \n The separatists acknowledge only holding less than half that many. Irina Gerashchenko, Ukraine's deputy parliament speaker and a key figure in negotiations to implement the Minsk agreement, says the rebels admit to holding 47 and \"we don't know where the other hostages are held.\" \n Rebel officials said last month they had reached a tentative agreement with Ukraine to release 47 prisoners, in exchange for Ukraine freeing 618. \n Who those 618 might be is uncertain. Rebel military spokesman Eduard Basurin told the AP that Ukraine is holding 962 easterners, of whom 316 are fighters and the rest are either political prisoners or civilians with no connection to the conflict. Ukraine in turn says it is holding about 500 people in connection with the war. \n Vadim Karasev, a Ukrainian political analyst, suggests that many of those held by the Ukrainian side are not combatants. \n \"Kiev is seeking to increase its weight in the negotiations by the count of separatists detained,\" he said. \"Simply disgruntled citizens often end up (in that category), and then are proposed for exchange.\" \n \"In many cases, the only reason for the detention of prisoners may be to use them as bargaining chips,\" said Oksana Pokalchuk, Amnesty International's executive director for Ukraine. \n The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the mediator in the peace process, \"does not have the instruments to force the exchange of prisoners. Kiev and the separatists cannot even agree on the prisoner lists. The OSCE cannot do this work for them,\" Karasev said. \n Nikolai Vakaruk, a 34-year-old coal miner, says he was a blameless civilian improperly held in detention by Ukraine for a year and half. \n He told the AP he was seized during a search of his home in the front-line town of Ukrainsk and held in the security-service detention facility in Kharkiv, where he was repeatedly beaten in an attempt to get him to confess to being a separatist. \n \"I was beaten and tortured but they could not turn me into a separatist,\" said Vakaruk, who believes he was detained for being a critic of the Ukrainian authorities. Amnesty International says Vakaruk was one of 13 prisoners released from the Kharkiv facility in July following the group's report on war prisoners. \n Vakaruk also said when international groups came to Ukraine's security services building, he and other prisoners held in connection with the war were spirited away to other locations. \n \"I realized that in the new Ukraine, I can disappear just because I think differently,\" he said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Jim Heintz in Moscow contributed to this story. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ukrainian war prisoners languish in limbo on both sides"}

{"date": "October 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this aerial photo, portions of SR A1A are washed out from Hurricane Matthew, Saturday, Oct. 8, 2016, in Flagler Beach, Fla. The damage from Matthew caused beach erosion, washed out some roads and knocked out power for more than 1 million customers in several coastal counties. \n CHARLESTON, S.C. >> A weakening Hurricane Matthew lashed Georgia and the Carolinas on Saturday in what appeared to be the last leg of its march up the East Coast, leaving in its wake millions of Americans relieved that one of the most fearsome storms on record in the U.S. wasn't that bad after all. \n The hurricane was blamed for at least 10 deaths in the U.S., including that of a 68-year-old Georgia man who died when two trees fell on his home. And hundreds were left dead in Matthew's wake in Haiti. \n By Saturday night, North Carolina felt the brunt of Matthew, with more than a foot of rain falling in the southeastern part of the state, causing life-threatening flash flooding, forecasters said. Homes, businesses and roads as far west as Raleigh were also damaged by the deluge. \n But in many places along the Southeast coast, the damage consisted mostly of flooded streets, blown-down signs and awnings, flattened trees and power outages. \n As the storm passed and the skies cleared, many people were already cleaning up, reopening their businesses or hitting the beach. The power started coming back on. And all three major theme parks in Orlando, Florida, including Walt Disney World, were up and running. \n \"We are all blessed that Matthew stayed off our coast,\" Florida Gov. Rick Scott said. \"We are blessed that we didn't have a direct hit.\" \n On Saturday, Matthew sideswiped two of the South's oldest and most historic cities \u2014 Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina \u2014 and also brought torrential rain and stiff wind to places like Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. \n From there, it was expected to veer out to sea, lose steam and loop back around toward the Bahamas and Florida, too feeble to cause any trouble. \n For nearly its entire run up the coast from Florida, Matthew hung just far enough offshore that communities did not feel the full force of its winds. \n Its storm center, or eye, finally blew ashore just north of Charleston on Saturday, but only briefly. And by that time, Matthew was just barely a hurricane, with winds of just 75 mph. \n Within an hour of residents being allowed to return Saturday to Jacksonville Beach, Florida, David Villmow had fired up the two pizza ovens at his beachfront restaurant, The Art of Pizza. He was hoping to start serving customers in a few hours. \n \"We got really lucky,\" he said. \"We could be looking at a whole lot worse. All you see are downed signs, downed fences, a few gas station sign letters missing.\" \n Matthew's deadly potential was made all too clear in Haiti, where the hurricane roared ashore on Tuesday with terrifying 145 mph winds. At least 470 people were reported dead in one hard-hit district alone, with other devastated areas still unreachable four days later. \n An estimated 2 million people in the Southeast were ordered to evacuate their homes as Matthew closed in. By hugging the coast, the storm pretty much behaved as forecasters predicted. A shift of just 20 or 30 miles could have meant widespread devastation. \n \"People got incredibly lucky,\" Colorado State University meteorology professor Phil Klotzbach. \"It was a super close call.\" \n While Matthew's wind speed had dropped considerably by the time it hit the Southeast coast, the storm will still go down as one of the most potent hurricanes on record, based on such factors as wind energy and longevity, and one of the most long-lived major hurricanes, too. \n It was a major hurricane \u2014 that is, with winds of at least 110 mph \u2014 for 7.25 days. \n The storm swamped the streets of Savannah, a historic town of moss-draped squares and antebellum mansions. A homeless woman was seen staggering through waters up to her neck. She made it across safely. \n A Coast Guard helicopter crew also rescued a man stranded on a sailboat in a river near Georgia's Tybee Island. And North Carolina officials said they had to rescue numerous people from cars and homes. \n The streets of Charleston \u2014 a city of handsome pre-Civil War homes, church steeples and romantic carriage rides \u2014 were also flooded. \n \"It's not as bad as maybe I was expecting,\" said Leigh Webber, who watched from her porch in the city's historic district. \n \"I feel badly for a lot of the businesses downtown that have been closed since Wednesday,\" she added. \"I noticed a lot of hotels were completely closed. I know some weddings were canceled and it was a huge financial loss for a lot of people.\" \n South Carolina's golf-and-tennis resort Hilton Head Island also took a blow as the eye of the storm passed 20 miles to the east. At least one gust of 87 mph was recorded at Hilton Head. \n The two roads onto the island of 40,000 people were blocked by fallen pine trees, and many roads were under water. \n All access points to Georgia's St. Simons Island from the mainland were blocked. Tybee Island also took a beating, with gusts clocked at 93 mph. \n Three-quarters of a million people in South Carolina were left without electricity, and 250,000 were in the dark in coastal Georgia. About 1 million people in Florida lost power. \n Four deaths were blamed on the storm in Florida, three in Georgia and three in North Carolina. The deaths included an elderly Florida couple who died from carbon monoxide fumes while running a generator in their garage and two women who were killed when trees fell on a home and a camper. \n The storm raked yet another historic Southern city on its way up the coast: St. Augustine, Florida, which was founded by the Spanish in the 1500s and includes many historic homes. The city was left awash in rain and gray seawater Friday. \n Property manager Nick Trunck went to check on check on several stores and apartments. He said the damage consisted of little more than several lost shingles, a lost awning and water seeping into one area. \n Trunck had arranged for 10 men to come from Connecticut to help with the cleanup, but after getting a look at the damage, he said he could probably get by with \"a couple of guys and a mop.\" \n Property data firm CoreLogic projected the storm would cause $4 billion to $6 billion in insured losses on home and commercial properties. That compares with Hurricane Katrina's $40 billion and Superstorm Sandy's $20 billion. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hurricane's blow was less than feared; 'We are blessed'"}

{"date": "October 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n UNICEF representative in Syria Hanaa Singer, speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in Beirut, Lebanon, Saturday, Oct. 8, 2016. The representative of the U.N. Children agency is calling for an immediate end to the violence that has beset the northern city of Aleppo, saying UN agencies are on \"standby\" to deliver needed assistance. \n BEIRUT >> UNICEF's representative in Syria called Saturday for an end to the violence that has beset northern Aleppo, causing \"dire\" humanitarian and psychological impacts on both sides of the divided city. \n U.N. agencies are on \"standby\" to deliver needed assistance, Hanaa Singer of the U.N.'s children agency told The Associated Press. \n With the key powers deeply divided, the U.N. Security Council on Saturday once again failed to agree on the course of action in war-ravaged Aleppo, and Syria in general. Russia vetoed a resolution drafted by France demanding an immediate halt to the bombing of Aleppo. A resolution put forward by Russia that called for a separation of moderate and extremist forces in Syria but making no mention of a bombing halt in Aleppo failed to get the minimum nine \"yes\" votes required for passage. \n Also on Saturday, Syrian state media and a Syria monitoring group said pro-government troops advanced in a northern district of eastern Aleppo, wrestling control from rebel fighters in their latest push into the besieged area. \n Singer said conditions in besieged Aleppo are \"terribly dire,\" with hospitals hit, doctors overwhelmed, and over 100 children killed in bombings since Sept. 19. Conditions for thousands of displaced in the government-held part of the city are also deteriorating, with some of them being displaced for up to six times in the last three years, she said. \n Singer returned earlier this week from a week-long trip to the government-held part of Aleppo where she was visiting thousands of displaced Syrians. Most are crammed in makeshift shelters, mosques, parks and churches after recently fleeing clashes on the frontline between rebels and pro-government forces. In one case, a mother so desperate from the continuous displacement, stabbed her baby girl thinking she will save her the misery of living on handouts and without a home, Singer said. \n Describing the dramatic situation for thousands of families living in shelters in government-controlled Aleppo, Singer said: \"These (are) the horrors in western Aleppo. God knows what is happening, (in the case of) mental health or the psychological situation on the eastern (rebel-held) side.\" \n Western Aleppo, controlled by the government, is separated from eastern rebel-held Aleppo by a few meters, sometimes by a single plastic sheet or pockmarked building. An estimated 275,000 people are living in the rebel-held part of Aleppo, with no international aid reaching the area since the first week of July. Besides the scarce assistance, it is also difficult to assess the needs with the ever-evolving violent situation, and lack of access for international aid groups, she said. \n \"I think we all agree, and especially if you have been so close in the area there and seeing the dire situation in the west, hearing about the horrible situation in the east, all we need now is (for) the violence to stop,\" Singer said. \"The violence has to stop and once the violence stops, the U.N., we absolutely stand ready. We are ready. We are actually on standby.\" \n Singer says U.N. plans are in place for government-held Aleppo to accommodate residents that may evacuate the besieged part of the city if a cease-fire takes effect. \n According to medical charity Doctors Without borders, hospitals in the eastern side of Syria's Aleppo have been attacked 23 times since July, damaging all eight facilities that have not yet been shuttered or destroyed. Since the U.S-Russian cease-fire broke down on Sept. 19, the situation in besieged Aleppo has immensely deteriorated under a relentless bombardment campaign. Water stations and civil defense centers have also been hit, while over 320 people have been killed in eastern Aleppo in nearly three weeks of violence. \n \"In eastern Aleppo, the situation is terribly dire. Lots of schools and of hospitals have been hit we understand that there are only 30 doctors there. We have information that at least over 100 children have been killed. We hear that because of the lack of services and lack of health facilities that some children, that doctors can't cope with all the cases, and some children in dire situation are left to die,\" Singer said. \n On Saturday, amid intensive air raids, pro-government forces seized the al-Awijeh district in northeastern rebel-controlled Aleppo, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Observatory also reported clashes on the southern edge of the rebel-held area. There was no immediate word on casualties. \n Syrian State TV reported that government and allied troops took control of al-Awijeh, moving toward the Jandoul roundabout and getting closer to crowded residential areas in Aleppo's rebel-controlled eastern districts. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "UNICEF calls for end to 'dire' situation in Aleppo"}

Polls show Proposition 64 with more than the 50 percent of voter support needed to pass. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> For the second time in six years, California voters will consider legalizing recreational use of marijuana. \n This time, supporters of the move have much more financial backing and professional campaign help than they did in 2010. \n And polls show Proposition 64 with more than the 50 percent of voter support needed to pass. \n Silicon Valley billionaires and wealthy backers from the already legal medicinal marijuana industry are among the top financial supporters, contributing a combined $21 million. \n Opponents have raised about $2.5 million, with $1.4 million coming from Pennsylvania anti-drug crusader Julie Schauer. \n California voters rejected a similar measure in 2010 after campaign leaders struggled to raise money and support for the lengthy ballot measure that was hastily written by the owner of a small medicinal marijuana store. \n Four states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana in recent years, and 25 states currently allow medicinal pot, including California. \n The drug remains illegal under federal law. \n People on both sides say passage of Proposition 64 would likely ignite similar movements in other states and exert significant pressure on federal authorities to reconsider the federal prohibition. \n \"As California goes, so goes the nation,\" said University of California, Berkeley political science professor Alan Ross. \n Proposition 64 would allow people 21 and older to legally possess up to an ounce of weed and grow six marijuana plants at home. Varying tax rates would be levied on sales, with the money deposited into the state's Marijuana Tax Fund. \n The measure also would allow cities and counties to pass their own regulations and taxes. \n Most of the money would be spent on substance abuse education and treatment. Some would go to repair damage done to the environment by illegal marijuana growers. Funds would also be allocated to train police to detect when people are driving under the influence of pot. \n California's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office estimated that state could collect up to $1 billion in taxes a year. \n \"It's a huge deal and it's long overdue,\" said Steven DeAngelo, a Proposition 64 supporter who owns one of the nation's largest medicinal marijuana dispensaries. \n Opponents argue the measure will open marijuana markets now dominated by small farmers to corporate interests and lead to children using the drug through pot-laced sweets, cookies and brownies. \n \"Proposition 64 favors the interests of wealthy corporations over the good of the everyday consumer, adopting policies that work against public health,\" said Kevin Sabet, co-founder of the California-based nonprofit group Smart Approaches to Marijuana. \n His group contributed $890,000 to the campaign to defeat Proposition 64. \n Backers counter that Proposition 64 includes measures to protect small farmers and will further regulate a growing industry that is still largely illegal. \n However, some medical marijuana advocates fear the supply of pot for patients could be threatened if Proposition 64 passes because of new regulations it would impose on growers. \n Several law enforcement agencies have donated a combined $250,000 to defeat the measure, and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein announced her opposition in July. \n The 62-page ballot measure was crafted by political professionals and has the backing of many elected officials, including Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2018. Gov. Jerry Brown said he's close to announcing his position. \n Napster founder and early Facebook investor Sean Parker has contributed nearly $9 million to the legalization effort, which has also attracted sizable contributions from an organization backed by billionaire George Soros and another supported by Weedmaps, which rates pot stores throughout the state. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "California voters once again eye legalizing recreational pot"}

He is vowing to impose penalty tariffs if those practices are not halted. \n The British vote sent shockwaves through financial markets this summer, and there were further troubles Friday when the British pound plunged by 6 percent against the dollar before recovering. Investors worry whether there will be more turbulence if the British exit proves to be messy and prolonged. \n IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said \"growth has been too low for too long, benefiting too few,\" and that's what officials need to address. \n French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said global leaders must address concerns of inequality and injustice caused by globalization, such as tax evasion by big corporations and job losses by workers. \n \"We must fight against this immorality of globalization, this inequality, to again give our people the taste for openness and multilateralism,\" Sapin told reporters. \"There can be an unhappy globalization and we must fight against it.\" \n In their statement, IMF officials committed to designing and putting in place policies \"to address the concerns of those who have been left behind and to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from globalization and technological change.\" \n The IMF, however, did not spell out what actions countries would be willing to take. In an era of budgetary constraints, it is unclear how governments will find the resources to expand education and job training programs and strengthen social safety nets. \n Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, told reporters that even with the turbulence linked to Britain's exit vote, he felt the short-term consequences had not been as dramatic as some had predicted but \"to think that there won't be any consequences would be probably too hopeful.\" \n Draghi said a lot will depend on how prolonged the post-Brexit uncertainty lasts as Britain and the EU negotiate next year over the terms of separation. \"It's a matter of this political uncertainty that clouds the outlook for growth,\" Draghi said. \n U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew urged the IMF to \"more boldly and forcefully\" push member countries to pursue all economic policy options to spur growth. \n The Obama administration has appealed to countries such as Germany, which are running budget or trade surpluses, to increase spending and stimulate global demand. \n \"We must not close ourselves off to the world, but rather redouble our commitment to ensuring shared growth,\" Lew said. \n Various finance officials said the decades-long effort to tear down trade barriers had lifted millions of people in poor nations out of poverty. But they said not enough has been done to protect workers who have lost jobs due to increased global competition. \n Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters that free trade is crucial to driving global growth. \n \"If we really want jobs and higher income, if we care about poverty reduction and economic fairness \u2026 if we care about growth, then we need to be serious about fostering global trade and about making sure that global trade works for all,\" Lagarde said. \n World Bank President Jim Yong Kim noted the \"tremendous anger against trade.\" But, he said, \"We are here because we believe in our mission of ending extreme poverty,\" Kim said. \"We are not going to do it without more robust trade.\" \n Kim said support also needs to be increased for countries that are welcoming refugees fleeing conflict zones. He cited Lebanon and Jordan, which are taking in refugees from Syria. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "World finance officials pledge more resources to aid growth"}

{"date": "October 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican vice presidential candidate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence speaks during a campaign stop at the the Rossford Recreation Center in Rossford, Ohio. \n INDIANAPOLIS >> Mike Pence has long described himself as a \"Christian, a conservative and a Republican in that order.\" \n Now, the GOP vice presidential nominee and his priorities are facing a critical test as Donald Trump, staggered by his recorded vulgarities about women, careens toward Sunday's presidential debate against Democrat Hillary Clinton. \n Trump has vowed to stay in the race. \n Pence's advocacy for Trump came to a screeching, perhaps temporary, halt Saturday in the hours after Trump released a video apologizing for 2005 remarks in which he describes his aggressive conduct toward women. \n Pence said in a statement about Trump that he won't \"condone his remarks and cannot defend them.\" \n \"We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night,\" the Indiana governor said. \n It's more evidence of the trials facing the GOP's No. 2 that could serve Pence well if he runs for the top spot in 2020. \n Pence dare not speak about that possibility. To do so would assume Clinton prevails on Nov. 8. \n But plenty of people are engaging in presidential talk about Pence, including Republican member of Congress, former presidential candidates and more. \n Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Mike Crapo of Idaho are calling on Trump to quit the campaign so Pence can lead the ticket. Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire says she'll write in Pence's name on the ballot \u2014 not Trump's. \n Pence canceled his appearance at a Wisconsin rally Saturday with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Pence would have been expected to advocate for Trump. \n \"I'm sure he's horrified,\" said Mike Murphy, an Indiana public relations strategist who's known Pence for more than two decades. \"We impeached Bill Clinton and we cannot impeach Trump off the ballot. But I wish there was a mechanism to do so.\" \n Pence raised his political stock Monday night during the only debate against Democrat Tim Kaine. During the 90-minute event, Pence managed to not defend Trump's indefensible behavior, yet still sound supportive and show off his own expertise on foreign policy. \n The performance highlighted the gulf in political sophistication between Trump and his running mate. \n Pence addressed the awkwardness with a savvy statement acknowledging his own performance and preserving his alliance with Trump. \n \"People are saying that I won the debate,\" he said Wednesday in Harrisonburg, Virginia. \"From where I sat, Donald Trump's vision to make America great won the debate.\" \n But on Friday, Trump's behavior put Pence to an even tougher test. \n The Washington Post and NBC broke the story of Trump's words about women as Pence advocated for Trump him in Ohio. \n \"With Donald Trump as president, we'll have a president of the United States who respects all the American people,\" Pence said as news of Trump's comments was breaking. \n Pence went on to defend, as he has previously, Trump's outspoken nature as a refusal to \"tiptoe around those thousands of rules of political correctness.\" \n Pence ignored shouted questions about Trump, and he was quickly whisked out of reach of the news media. \n What followed: Pence's silence, the scrapping his Wisconsin appearance and finally, his statement. \n An influential Indiana conservative, Jim Bopp, who helped draft this year's Republican Party platform, said Pence \"should stay the course.\" \n Trump's words are \"ill-considered and crude,\" Bopp said, and also \"statements Mike Pence would never make.\" \n The election is bigger than that, said Bopp, a lawyer from Terre Haute, Indiana. \n \"In the grand scheme of things, this is trivia vs. real life-and-death problems that we face in our foreign policy and the serious challenges that everyday Americans face because of the Obama-Clinton economy.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's crude remarks put running mate Pence in awkward spot"}

{"date": "October 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016 photo, shows a statue of Gene Autry at the entrance to the Autry Museum of the American West in Los Angeles. \n LOS ANGELES >> The American West, Gene Autry knew, was much more than the ridin', ropin' and singin' he enthralled audiences with in scores of movies and songs, earning the title \"The Singing Cowboy.\" It was a point he strived to drive home when he opened a museum in Los Angeles in 1988. \n Autry's vision takes a great leap forward Sunday when the Autry Museum of the American West expands to include a garden of native Western flora, as well as new galleries showcasing hundreds of Native American works, some from present day, others centuries old, many never seen publicly. \n The expansion, named California Continued, adds 20,000 square feet of gallery and garden space to the museum that, with its red-tiled courtyard and distinctive beige bell tower, evokes images of an 18th century, Spanish-styled California mission \u2014 albeit one sandwiched between a zoo and a busy freeway. \n Along with many sculptures depicting the Old West and works by prominent artists such as Georgia O'Keeffe and Frederic Remington, museum officials say visitors will now see one of the largest collections of Native American artifacts found anywhere. \n Also included will be more than 70 plants native to California \u2014 many medicinal and some endangered \u2014 as well as new displays that include Western mixed-media paintings and interactive works showing such sights as California from the highest point in the continental United States (Mount Whitney in the state's midsection) to its lowest (Death Valley on the Nevada border). \n Because it's the Autry Museum, visitors also will still see such venerable Hollywood artifacts as the Singin' Cowboy's Martin guitar, TV Lone Ranger Clayton Moore's mask and a wealth of silent cowboy star Tom Mix memorabilia. Visitors arriving in the courtyard are still greeted by a life-size sculpture of Autry holding his guitar and flanked by his horse, both perched on a base inscribed with the words to his signature song, \"Back in the Saddle Again.\" \n But the museum's president, W. Richard West Jr., is quick to point out that Hollywood cowboy memorabilia is, and always has been, a small part of what he declares a world-class museum. \n \"Gene's vision, in his own words, was the institution he was establishing should reflect and represent the impact of the American West on this country and on the world. Now that's fairly ambitious, and that goes far beyond film cowboys,\" West said with a chuckle as he looked over the new exhibits earlier this week. \n An avid collector of Western artifacts, Autry opened the museum on a 13-acre patch of Los Angeles' sprawling Griffith Park, a stone's throw from the Los Angeles Zoo and backed up against Interstate 5. \n He died at age 91 in 1998, just a few years before his ambitious vision for the museum's future began to take shape with its 2003 merger with Los Angeles' Southwest Museum of the American Indian. \n That museum's stately, century-old building had fallen on hard times, including being badly damaged by the region's 1994 earthquake. While officials work to restore the building, they have moved about 300,000 artifacts to the Autry. \n \"This collection that is now in the Autry Museum is a native collection of the very same rank, and in some quarters even better, than the Smithsonian's,\" said West, who was founding director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian. \n Some of the best of the collection on display is contained in the exhibition \"The Life and Work of Mabel McKay,\" a Pomo Indian basket weaver, healer, civil rights activist and person believed to be the last speaker of her tribal language when she died in 1993. \n Her intricately woven, often colorful baskets are accompanied by a recreation of her workroom, narration by her son and other works. \n In the nearby \"Human Nature\" gallery, items range from intricately woven baskets the size of a pinhead to a 1,200-year-old carved bone fishhook recovered from the Channel Islands off California's coast to mixed-media paintings by contemporary artist Harry Fonseca depicting the California Gold Rush. \n The garden contains native plants that caretaker Nicholas Hummingbird hopes will make people realize there is more to Western flora than cactus and sagebrush. \n \"The goal is to really open people's minds to the beauty of what California plants are,\" he said as he strolled among vines of medicinal plants like creosote and yerba santa as a towering native oak helped drown out sounds from the freeway. \n The overall goal, says West, is to show visitors there are many facets to the American West they might not have considered. \n \"This museum is not a science museum,\" he said. \"It's a museum of cultural history.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Singing Cowboy's museum expands, adds Native American art"}

{"date": "October 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made a series of lewd and sexually charged comments about women as he waited to make a cameo appearance on a soap opera in 2005. The Republican presidential nominee issued a rare apology Friday, \"if anyone was offended.\" \n NEW YORK >> A defiant Donald Trump insisted Saturday he would \"never\" abandon his White House bid, facing an intensifying backlash from Republican leaders across the nation who called on him to quit the race following the release of his vulgar and sexually charged comments caught on tape. \n With Republicans from Utah to Alabama to New Hampshire turning their back on their nominee, GOP loyalists like House Speaker Paul Ryan refused to give up on Trump, who has long faced criticism from within his own party, but never to this degree. Frustration turned to panic across the GOP with early voting already underway in some states and Election Day one month away. \n \"As disappointed as I've been with his antics throughout this campaign, I thought supporting the nominee was the best thing for our country and our party,\" Alabama Rep. Martha Roby said in a statement. \"Now, it is abundantly clear that the best thing for our country and our party is for Trump to step aside and allow a responsible, respectable Republican to lead the ticket.\" \n Trump declared he would not yield the GOP nomination under any circumstances. \"Zero chance I'll quit,\" he told The Wall Street Journal. He told The Washington Post: \"I'd never withdraw. I've never withdrawn in my life.\" He claimed to have \"tremendous support.\" \n In a videotaped midnight apology, Trump declared \"I was wrong and I apologize\" after being caught on tape bragging about aggressively groping women in 2005. He also defiantly dismissed the revelations as \"nothing more than a distraction\" from a decade ago and signaled he would press his presidential campaign by arguing that rival Hillary Clinton has committed greater sins against women. \n \"I've said some foolish things,\" Trump said in a video posted on his Facebook page early Saturday. \"But there's a big difference between the words and actions of other people. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.\" \n Trump addressed what was arguably the most difficult day of his candidacy on Twitter later in the morning: \"Certainly has been an interesting 24 hours!\" \n The latest explosive revelation marked a tipping point for some party loyalists, while forcing vulnerable Republican candidates to answer a painful question: Even if they condemn Trump's vulgar comments, will they still vote for him? \n New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte answered the question with a loud No on Saturday, reversing her previous position that she would vote for Trump even though she declined to endorse him. \n \"I'm a mom and an American first, and I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women,\" Ayotte said. \"I will not be voting for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton and instead will be writing in Gov. Pence for president on Election Day.\" \n The release of the videotape almost completely overshadowed the release of hacked emails from inside the Hillary Clinton campaign that revealed the contents of some of her previously secret paid speeches to Wall Street. \n The Democratic nominee told bankers behind closed doors that she favored \"open trade and open borders\" and said Wall Street executives were best-positioned to help overhaul the U.S. financial sector. Such comments were distinctively at odds with her tough talk about trade and Wall Street during the primary campaign, when she catered to the party's left under pressure from rival Bernie Sanders. \n Republican strategist Terry Sullivan, who previously led Marco Rubio's presidential campaign, predicted Trump's defeat. \"It's over,\" he said. \"The only good news is that in 30 days Trump will be back to being just a former reality TV star like the Kardashians, and Republican candidates across America will no longer be asked to respond to his stupid remarks.\" \n Some Trump loyalists defiantly defended their nominee. \n \"I still have my Trump sign on my yard and everybody on my street does too,\" said Pennsylvania GOP chairman Rob Gleason. \"It's business as usual, with door-knocking today.\" \n He went on: \"I don't agree with what was said \u2014 it's not a good thing to be saying.\" But he added: \"campaigns are filled with lots of ups and downs.\" \n One by one, outraged GOP lawmakers have condemned Trump's comments in a 2005 video obtained and released Friday by The Washington Post and NBC News. In the video, Trump is heard describing attempts to have sex with a married woman. He also brags about women letting him kiss and grab them because he is famous. \n \"When you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything,\" Trump says in the previously unaired comments. He adds seconds later: \"Grab them by the p\u2014\u2014. You can do anything.\" \n House Speaker Ryan said Friday was \"sickened\" by Trump's remarks. Ryan revoked an invitation for Trump to appear at a GOP event Saturday in Wisconsin. But Ryan did not pull his endorsement. \n Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho did, however. \n \"This is not a decision that I have reached lightly, but his pattern of behavior left me no choice,\" the Republican senator said in a statement. \n Meanwhile, Ryan fundraising chief Spencer Zwick said he's been fielding calls from donors who \"want help putting money together to fund a new person to be the GOP nominee.\" \n Zwick told The Associated Press that a write-in or \"sticker campaign\" relying on social media could \"actually work.\" \n While there has never been a winning write-in campaign in a U.S. presidential contest, such an effort could make it harder for Trump to win. Zwick did not identify which \"new person\" might be the focus of a write-in campaign, although he was briefly supportive of a third run for Mitt Romney, the 2012 nominee, last year. \n While funding another candidate could siphon votes away from Trump, the GOP's biggest donors have little leverage even if they threaten to withhold money for the rest of the campaign. Trump's campaign has relied far more on small contributors across the country than from the party's stalwart donors who write the biggest checks possible. \n Utah Sen. Mike Lee, like Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, said Trump had finally gone too far. \n \"You, sir, are the distraction,\" Lee said in a video posted to his Facebook page after Trump's apology. \n Lee called on Trump to abandon his campaign, saying it was time for the Republican Party to \"expect more. There is no need for us to settle.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump dismisses GOP calls to quit race: 'Never'"}

{"date": "October 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2016 \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton \n Washington \u00bb Hillary Clinton told bankers behind closed doors that she favored \"open trade and open borders\" and said Wall Street executives were best-positioned to help reform the U.S. financial sector, according to transcripts of her private, paid speeches leaked Friday. \n The leaks were the result of another email hacking intended to influence the presidential election. \n Excerpts of the speeches given in the years before her 2016 presidential campaign included some blunt and unguarded remarks to her private audiences, which collectively had paid her at least $26.1 million in speaking fees. Clinton had refused to release transcripts of the speeches, despite repeated calls to do so by her primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders. \n The excerpts were included in emails exchanged among her political staff, including Campaign Chairman John Podesta, whose email account was hacked. The WikiLeaks organization posted what it said were thousands of Podesta's emails. It wasn't immediately clear who had hacked Podesta's emails, though the breach appeared to cover years of messages, some sent as recently as last month. \n Among the emails was a compilation of excerpts from Clinton's paid speeches in 2013 and 2014. It appeared campaign staff had read all Clinton's speeches and identified passages that could be potentially problematic for the candidate if they were to become public. \n One excerpt put Clinton squarely in the free-trade camp, a position she has retreated on significantly during the 2016 election. In a talk to a Brazilian bank in 2013, she said her \"dream\" is \"a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders\" and asked her audience to think of what doubling American trade with Latin America \"would mean for everybody in this room.\" \n Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has made opposition to trade deals a cornerstone of his campaign. \n Podesta posted a series of tweets Friday night, calling the disclosures a Russian hack and raising questions about whether some of the documents could have been altered. \n \"I'm not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump,\" Podesta wrote. \"Don't have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked.\" \n Podesta's comments came just hours after U.S. officials publicly accused the Russian government of directing cyberattacks on political organizations and American citizens in an attempt to interfere with U.S. elections. \n The joint statement from the office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Homeland Security Department cited disclosures of \"alleged hacked emails\" on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks as being \"consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.\" \n The statement didn't refer by name to the affected political institutions, but federal authorities are investigating cyberattacks on the computer systems of the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \n Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement, \"It's not hard to see why she fought so hard to keep her transcripts of speeches to Wall Street banks paying her millions of dollars secret.\" \n The emails released Friday included exchanges between Podesta and other Clinton insiders, including campaign manager Robby Mook. Most were routine, including drafts of Clinton speeches, suggested talking points for campaign surrogates and suggested tweets to be sent out from Clinton's account. \n The excerpts include quotes from an October 2013 speech at an event sponsored by Goldman Sachs, in which Clinton conceded that presidential candidates need the financial backing of Wall Street to mount a competitive national campaign. \n \"Running for office in our country takes a lot of money, and candidates have to go out and raise it,\" Clinton said. \"New York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle, and it's also our economic center. And there are a lot of people here who should ask some tough questions before handing over campaign contributions to people who were really playing chicken with our whole economy.\" \n In the same speech, Clinton was also deferential to the New York finance industry, exhorting wealthy donors to use their political clout for patriotic rather than personal benefit. She also spoke of the need to include Wall Street perspectives in financial reform. \n \"The people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry,\" Clinton said. \n In an April 2013 speech to the National Multifamily Housing Council, Clinton said politicians must balance \"both a public and a private position\" while making deals. Clinton gave an example from the movie \"Lincoln,\" and the deal-making that went into passage of the 13th Amendment, a process she compared to sausage-making. \n \"It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be,\" Clinton said. \"But if everybody's watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.\" \n Clinton's speeches often touched on technology and privacy. In an April 2014 speech to JPMorgan, she denounced National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden for going abroad, saying, \"if he really cared about raising some of these issues and stayed right here in the United States, there's a lot of whistleblower protections.\" \n But she told her audience that her time in the public eye left her sympathetic to privacy concerns. \n \"As somebody who has had my privacy scrutinized and violated for decades, I'm all for privacy, believe me,\" she said. \n Speaking on international affairs, Clinton's comments were largely in line with her positions as secretary of state, if sometimes more blunt. \n \"The Saudis have exported more extreme ideology than any other place on Earth over the course of the last 30 years,\" she told the Jewish United Fund at a 2013 dinner. \n The speech transcripts were produced under an agreement Clinton routinely imposed on any organization that hired her to speak. The contracts, such as ones crafted by the Harry Walker Agency, required the organizations to hire, at their own expense, a stenographer who would provide the transcripts to Clinton and not keep copies for themselves. \n In some cases, the contracts themselves were obtained by news organizations under public records laws because Clinton was being paid to speak by public universities or colleges. \n ___ \n Associated Press writers Ted Bridis and Stephen Braun contributed to this report. \n ___ \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Private Clinton speeches leaked in hacking blamed on Russia"}
