VIA AP \n In this July 27 file frame from video provided by Vayu, Inc., residents from Ranomafana, Madagascar, watch before a drone containing medical samples takes off on a test flight from their remote village, which can only be reached on foot. \n JOHANNESBURG \u00bb At first, the drone took some explaining. Anxious villagers buzzed with rumors of a new blood-sucking thing that would fly above their homes. Witchcraft, some said.  \n The truth was more practical: A United Nations project would explore whether a small unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV, could deliver HIV test samples more efficiently than land transport in rural Malawi. \n Once understanding dawned and work began, young students and their teachers would spill out of the nearby school, cheering, each time they heard the drone approaching. \"It was very exciting,\" UNICEF official Judith Sherman said. \n As drones quickly pick up momentum around the world in everything from military strikes to pizza delivery, Africa, the continent with some of the most entrenched humanitarian crises, hopes the technology will bring progress. \n This second-largest continent, with harsh landscapes of desert and rain forest and extremes of rainy seasons and drought, is burdened with what the World Bank has called \"the worst infrastructure endowment of any developing region today.\" Rural highways, often unpaved, disintegrate. In many countries, access to electricity has actually declined. Taking to the air to soar over such challenges, much as Africa embraced mobile phones to bypass often dismal landline service, is a tempting goal. \n Those trying out drones for humanitarian uses in Africa warn that the technology is no quick fix, but several new projects are exploring what can be achieved. \n The highest-profile one yet begins this week in Rwanda, as the government and U.S. company Zipline launch a drone network to deliver blood supplies and medicines to remote hospitals and clinics. Even in one of Africa's smallest countries, such deliveries can take weeks by land. With drones, it will take hours. \n The speed and limited space of drones have focused aid groups and businesses on how to deliver small, sensitive and potentially life-saving cargo. Earlier this year, a partnership was announced between Zipline and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization. \n Off Africa's eastern coast in Madagascar, another U.S. company, Vayu, has completed drone flights to deliver blood and stool samples from rural villages with support from the U.S. Agency for International Development. \n Africa has certain benefits for such projects, said Sid Rupani, who from his South Africa office studies how drones could be used effectively in supply chains. His U.S.-based employer, Llamasoft, has run a virtual pilot for Zipline in Tanzania. \n \"It's not crowded airspace. Not many urban areas to deal with,\" Rupani said. Already, drones are being used in parts of the continent as visual aids in mapping and anti-poaching. \n Drones also face multiple challenges. Some models are limited in range or need frequent recharging. If they crash, retrieval in remote areas can be difficult. Some governments are wary of the technology as a possible invasion of their sovereignty, or they have no regulations in place. \n Even aid workers have reservations. In a survey of workers in 61 countries released last month by the Humanitarian UAV Network and other groups, the majority saw drones as positive, but 22 percent did not. \n A top concern was that people on the ground would think they were under attack. \n \"Whether we like it or not, UAVs are confused with weaponized drones,\" one Congo aid worker told the survey, pointing out the use of drones by the U.N. peacekeeping mission there. \n Cost is another issue. The United Nations' test early this year in Malawi with the help of U.S. company Matternet found that using motorcycles was cheaper as they could carry other cargo, said Sherman, UNICEF's HIV and AIDS chief there. \n But she still sees drones as \"a leapfrog technology that has great potential, some we might not have thought of yet.\" \n Aid organizations are pushing for new breakthroughs. The Netherlands-based Wings for Aid is working on a drone prototype to carry more and go farther: Up to 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of cargo could be delivered to several points within 500 kilometers (310 miles), said Wesley Kreft, director of business development and innovation. \n \"The holy grail is to have a network of autonomous drones that do their work independently, with a human supervising numerous deliveries at once,\" said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College in New York. \n It could take a couple of years before such drones could be entrusted with critical deliveries in challenging rural areas like Africa, he said, but the technology is there. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Drones carrying medicines, blood face top challenge: Africa"}

As for numbers of Arab-Americans state to state, AAI's estimates are higher than census figures. The institute contends the government undercounts Arab-Americans because of ambiguity in the census question on ancestry, and \"distrust/misunderstanding of government surveys among recent immigrants.\" \n Yalla Vote's organizers say they are promoting voting, not candidates, and that their mission is to use the power of the ballot box to put Arab Americans at the forefront of national conversations on such topics as surveillance, profiling, immigration, and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. \n \"With an estimated population of over 180,000, the Arab-American community in Pennsylvania could be a swing constituency\" on Election Day, said Yalla Vote's Pennsylvania field coordinator, Summar Elgogari of Reading, a Temple University senior majoring in secondary education and social studies.  \n Since late July, a grassroots interfaith group in Philadelphia has heeded the call of some of its Muslim members and has circulated fliers \u2014 \"As-salamu alaykum!

{"date": "October 9, 2016", "text": "THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS / TRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE \n A New Haven, Conn., city street leads to the Yale campus. Some states and cities are considering a property tax on nonprofits like Yale and other universities. \n NEW HAVEN, Conn. \u00bb When New Haven Mayor Toni Harp looks out her office windows, she can see across the street to Yale University's buildings and grounds \u2014 none of which are on her city's property tax rolls.  \n Yale, a nonprofit despite its $25 billion endowment and sprawling property (it owns about half the land in the city, Harp says), doesn't pay property taxes. And some officials in Connecticut, including Harp, would like to see that change. \n City and state officials in other parts of the country, including Maine, Massachusetts and New Jersey, also are questioning whether they can continue to allow wealthy schools like Yale, or big nonprofit hospitals, to remain off tax rolls while they scramble for money to pay for police, fire, streets and other infrastructure and services. \n In some cases, they are looking for ways of taxing what until now have been tax-exempt sacred cows. \n \"They do some wonderful things for our community,\" Harp said of Yale. \"They have a world-class art gallery, they have the fourth-oldest symphony in the United States \u2026 they have a scholarship program for (city) high school seniors. They do a lot, but we still have to run a city.\" \n New Haven and Connecticut are in difficult financial condition this year. And that's why the tax-exempt status of Yale, the nation's third-oldest university, with the nation's second-largest college endowment, is under more scrutiny. \n The state's most recent budget had a deficit of $960 million, prompting broad cuts in spending, including cuts in payments to localities like New Haven, which got $8 million less than it expected. \n \"What is the purpose of a tax exemption, for public policy purposes, if that exemption is not generating something that is a net positive to the public?\" said Connecticut state Rep. Roland Lemar, Democratic vice chairman of the House budget committee. \n Lemar sponsored bills this year that would have taxed returns on the Ivy League school's endowment, or portions of university property used for commercial research or other business-related operations. The bills didn't pass. But legislators agreed to create a task force to study taxing the university. \n David Thompson, vice president of public policy at the National Council of Nonprofits, attributes the growing movement in Connecticut and other parts of the country to tax nonprofits to tight city and state budgets. \n \"The recession never ended\" in some places, he said. \"States still have budget shortfalls. The states are cutting what they pay down to cities. Cities have shrinking tax bases. So they ask, 'How do we expand our tax base?' \" \n But that question often ignores the social services that nonprofits provide and the other good they do in the community, which governments don't have to pay for, Thompson said. \"People who only look at the budget see nonprofits as a cost item.\" \n Yale and New Haven businessmen fought Lemar's proposals, particularly a taxation bill that, they said, would have stifled academic research that later leads to commercial applications. \n \"Taxing Yale's academic property won't help us get there. It could discourage donors from giving to Yale if they learn that academic laboratories could be taxed,\" said Yale President Peter Salovey. The bill, he said, \"also sends a bad signal to investors and other partners necessary for New Haven to prosper more.\" \n Salovey said New Haven stands out as a Connecticut city that has added jobs and residents, increasing its tax base, in the past decade. Most of Connecticut has not grown in both population and jobs during that time. \n Yale and many other large nonprofits often don't get off free. Many make what are called payments in lieu of taxes, or PILOT, to acknowledge the services that cities and states provide. Yale makes an annual $8 million PILOT to the city. \n That's nice to have, Harp said, but the problem is the payment is voluntary and comes when the university sends it, not necessarily when the city's bills are due. \n \"It's not enough, and certainly wouldn't be what we would get if we taxed that property,\" she said. \n Yale's payment didn't arrive this year at the anticipated date, she said, due to a minor political spat, and that \"created a problem in our budget.\"  \n \"I was really worried that we were not going to get the payment,\" Harp said. \"That's the problem with it being voluntary.\" \n In other cities and states, too, the issue of tax exemption and of the PILOTs that schools make has led to growing concerns. \n In Massachusetts, for example, Boston reported collecting $15.3 million less than the $47.4 million it asked for in PILOTs from tax-exempt institutions for the most recent fiscal year. \n Among the nonprofits that contributed less than requested were Boston College, Boston University and Harvard University. \n But Jim Klocke, CEO of the Massachusetts Nonprofits Network, said those numbers don't take into account the in-kind contributions, such as college scholarships or free hospital care, that nonprofits provide communities. \n \"Some institutions' community benefits are eight to 10 times larger than the requested cash amount,\" he said. \n The Massachusetts Legislature considered several bills on taxing nonprofits during its recently completed session. One would have imposed a new tax on property being bought by the Lowell branch of the University of Massachusetts, thereby adding to the city's property tax revenue.  \n The bill died in conference committee. But since then, the city and the university have agreed on some payments from the university to the city, including $3 million for bridge repairs and $1.6 million for fixes to a parking garage. \n The bill's sponsor, Democratic state Rep. David Nangle of Lowell, doubts that the payments are the final word on nonprofits' tax-exempt status in the state. Proponents of the bill expect it to resurface in the Legislature. \n The Rhode Island Legislature this year considered a measure that would have let local governments tax a nonprofit up to 50 percent of what its property tax bill would be if it was a commercial enterprise, before rejecting it. \n In New Jersey, Republican Gov. Chris Christie rejected a bill this year that would have required all nonprofit hospitals in the state to pay fees for the first time, to help cover the costs of police and other local services. \n The bill was a response to a tax court ruling last year, which found Morristown Medical Center operated largely as a for-profit hospital, making it subject to property taxes. The two sides settled on an agreement that requires the hospital's owner to pay the town $15.5 million over the next 10 years. \n In Princeton, N.J., a few neighbors of the prestigious university that shares the municipality's name filed suit in 2011, claiming that they were paying more property taxes than they should, partly because Princeton doesn't pay any. \n New Jersey has the highest property taxes in the nation, and Princeton some of the highest in New Jersey. Princeton, whose endowment is $23 billion, provides benefits to the municipality, just as Yale does, including free events and transportation. \n The university agreed in 2014 to make a $2.8 million PILOT to the municipality, and to increase the payment by 4 percent annually through 2020. \n Jim Firestone, a semi-retired real estate agent in Princeton who helped spark the suit, said it is not fair that his neighbors pay such high taxes while the university gets by with relatively little. \n Firestone doesn't buy the argument that the in-kind contributions the university provides the municipality offset the lack of taxes. \n \"Every other person who's a citizen of our town does that\" through volunteering, he said. \"Who do they think they are? Albert Einstein did work at Princeton University and look what he brought to the town. He shouldn't pay taxes?\" \n Einstein lived in Princeton from 1935, two years after he emigrated to the U.S. from Germany, until his death in 1955. \n The Yale Political Union, a debating society, took up the issue in scholarly fashion recently with a debate called \"Resolved: Tax Yale.\" The featured guest speaker was Mark Schneider, vice president at the American Institutes for Research, a social science institution.  \n Schneider, who has studied the tax-exempt status of universities, has concluded that the tax break afforded rich universities does not benefit taxpayers or help low-income students. \n \"Yale's tax exemption is not an act of God,\" Schneider said. \"It is an act of legislation. And it can have only one justification: to advance the public welfare.\" \n He pointed to Harvard's nation-leading endowment of $36 billion, and noted that dozens of university endowments exceed $1 billion. \n The gifts donors make to the endowments are deductible from their income taxes, Schneider said. And the investment income earned by the endowments is tax-free. As a result, he said, \"the public subsidizes these universities.\" \n \"Are these mega-endowments really serving the public good?\" Schneider said. \n The Political Union invited a university administrator to the debate to counter Schneider's comments, but Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said the administration was unable to send someone. So it was left to several students to disagree with Schneider. \n One of them, Thomas Gould, a sophomore from Poughkeepsie, N.Y., said Yale does a good job of taking care of the city. \n \"Yale does more for New Haven than New Haven does for New Haven, as a government,\" he said to hisses from one side of the room and noisy applause from Fthe other. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 Stateline.org  \n ", "author": "By Elaine S.

Police said Felix suddenly pulled out a gun and opened fire on the officers who had responded to a family disturbance call Saturday. \n PALM SPRINGS, Calif. \u00bb In the minutes before two Palm Springs officers were fatally shot and a third wounded, the suspected gunman's father told a neighbor his son was armed, \"acting crazy\" and wanted to shoot police. \n John Felix, 26, was apprehended early Sunday after a lengthy standoff and will be charged this week with murder. \n Police said Felix finally emerged wearing soft body armor and carrying ammunition but no weapon after police shot a chemical agent into the home where he had holed up. Investigators were trying to piece together what led up to a 911 call about a family disturbance that preceded the cold-blooded killings. \n A neighbor, Frances Serrano, told The Associated Press that the suspect's panicked father, Santos Felix, earlier said his son, an admitted gang member, had a gun. \n \"My son is inside and we're scared, he's acting crazy,\" Serrano said the older Felix told her. When it was suggested they call the police he said, \"Yeah, he already knows they are coming, and he is going to shoot them.\" \n Serrano said she went back inside her house and within minutes police cars arrived and gunfire erupted. \n Police said John Felix suddenly pulled out a gun and opened fire on the officers who had responded to a disturbance call Saturday afternoon at the home he shared with his parents in a quiet neighborhood of single-story ranch homes in this desert resort city. \n Palm Springs police Chief Bryan Reyes identified the slain officers as Jose \"Gil\" Gilbert Vega, 63, and Lesley Zerebny, 27. \n Zerebny had been with the department for about 18 months and recently returned early from maternity leave after giving birth to a daughter. Vega, a married father of eight, was a 35-year veteran who planned to retire in December. He had been working overtime Saturday on his scheduled day off. \n A vigil was held outside police headquarters Sunday night to honor the two slain officers. Mourners created a makeshift memorial that included flower bouquets, written messages and candles. \n \"When this is all over, don't just turn around and walk away. Take the time to introduce yourself to each other, because this is the community we live in,\" Palm Springs police chief Bryan Reyes told the mourners Sunday, according to the Desert Sun (http://tinyurl.com/h5bx5lw). \"We will all get through this together, and I'm going to heavily count on all of you.\" \n The wounded officer's name was not released, but Reyes said he was alert, speaking with investigators and was expected to be released from a hospital later Sunday. \n Police arrested John Felix after shooting him with non-lethal rounds when he exited through the back door. SWAT officers using bullhorns and other methods had tried through the night to establish contact with him, but got no response. He was taken to a hospital for treatment of injuries that did not appear to be life-threatening. \n District Attorney Michael Hestrin said John Felix would be charged Tuesday with first degree murder and several other felony counts. Prosecutors would decide within two weeks whether he could face the death penalty, Hestrin said. It wasn't known Sunday if John Felix has an attorney. \n Documents also show John Felix was the subject of a forceful arrest three years ago at the same house where Saturday's shootings occurred. \n Reyes indicated police had previous dealings with the suspect, but he declined to answer questions about whether responding officers were prepared to deal with someone with a violent criminal past. The chief would not characterize the content of the 911 call or say who made it. \n It had been 54 years since an on-duty uniformed police officer was killed in Palm Springs, a city of 45,000 residents about 100 miles east of Los Angeles, known for its desert views, boutique hotels and golf courses. \n In front of police headquarters, scores of local residents gathered to leave flowers, balloons and cards. \n Vega had submitted his paperwork to retire at the end of the year after a long and decorated career, Reyes said. \n \"Here he is, 35 years in, still pushing a patrol car for our community to make it better \u2014 on a day he wasn't even scheduled to work,\" the chief said. \n Reyes said Zerebny \"pressed forward every day to make it better for everybody else.\" She and her husband, a sheriff's deputy, were new parents to a four-month-old baby. \n \"To see her laying down with her eyes open and to witness her husband in full Riverside County sheriff's uniform \u2026 kiss her on the forehead for the last time\u2026 it's tough,\" Reyes said, fighting back tears. \n At Vega's house in nearby Cathedral City, family members prepared to attend a Sunday evening candlelight vigil at the police station. \n His brother-in-law, Jose Barron, said Vega was a family man and a dedicated officer who always spent a little extra time with teenagers he met while on patrol. \n \"He would always tell them: 'You always have to look for the future,'\" Barron said. \"He was very responsible.\" \n Palm Springs resident Heidi Thompson called the killings \"vicious and cruel.\" \n \"These officers are responding to a domestic call for somebody in need that they don't even know. They put their life on the line for us, the community,\" Thompson said. \"I don't understand it.\" \n The slayings come amid a tense year for police, when officers have been shot to death in other cities including Dallas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. \n The Palm Springs shooting occurred just three days after a popular Los Angeles County sheriff's sergeant was shot and killed in the high desert town of Lancaster. Sgt. Steve Owen was answering a burglary when he was shot.

Trump told his 12.2 million Twitter followers to check out a sex tape as he criticized a former Miss Universe. \n In the early morning hours of Sept. 30, Trump tweeted, \"Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?\" \n Trump's tweet was an attack on former 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado, a woman who Clinton brought up in the last presidential debate as an example of Trump's derogatory comments about women. The video Trump appeared to be referencing was from a Spanish reality show. In 2005, Machado, who was a contestant on the show, was filmed in bed, under the covers with a male contestant and speaking sexually about his body parts. The grainy footage doesn't show any nudity, though Machado has said that she was having sex in the footage. \n Machado, a Venezuela-born woman who is now a U.S. citizen, has publicly supported Clinton and criticized Trump for body-shaming her, including calling her \"Miss Piggy\" and threatening to take away her crown for gaining weight. Trump has stood by his criticisms of Machado's weight, saying in a recent interview with Fox News: \"She gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.\" \n Trump on support for Iraq war \n DONALD TRUMP: \"I would not have had our troops in Iraq.\" \n Trump has repeatedly said in the campaign he opposed the Iraq War before it started. But the facts are clear: He did not. \n There is no evidence Trump expressed public opposition to the war before the U.S. invaded. Rather, he offered lukewarm support. The billionaire businessman only began to voice doubts about the conflict well after it began in March 2003. \n Trump's first known public comment on the topic came on Sept. 11, 2002, when he was asked whether he supported a potential Iraq invasion in an interview with radio host Howard Stern. \"Yeah, I guess so,\" Trump responded. During a Fox News Channel interview with Neil Cavuto in January 2003, Trump suggested the economy and threats from North Korea posed greater problems for then-President George W. Bush than Iraq, but he did not say he opposed a possible invasion. \n On March 21, 2003, just days after the invasion began, Trump told Cavuto on his show that the invasion \"looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.\" \n Trump bolsters his position by pointing to an interview he did with Esquire. He was quoted as saying he opposed the war, saying he \"would never have handled it that way.\" He made that comment, however, 16 months after the invasion began. \n Clinton says the U.S. is energy independent \n CLINTON: \"We are now, for the first time ever, energy independent.\" \n THE FACTS: Clinton overstates the case. For the first time in decades the United States gets more energy domestically than it imports, but it is not yet entirely energy independent. Oil still is imported, from the Mideast and elsewhere. Estimates vary as to when the U.S. might achieve full energy independence. \n Domestic oil production has greatly increased in recent years and oil imports as a percentage of consumption have dropped, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Oil imports have dropped from 3.58 billion barrels in 2008 to 2.68 billion barrels in 2015. \n Clinton cited Lincoln on political deals \n HILLARY CLINTON, in response to a question about her saying that politicians need to have \"both a public and a private position\" in a 2013 paid speech, said, \"As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called Lincoln. It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.\" \n DONALD TRUMP replied, \"She lied. Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.\" \n THE FACTS: Clinton's recollection is correct. \n Clinton invoked the movie \"Lincoln,\" and the deal-making that went into passage of the 13th Amendment, which outlawed slavery, in an April 2013 speech to the National Multifamily Housing Council. \n According to excerpts of the speech included in hacked emails published last week by WikiLeaks, Clinton said politicians must balance \"both a public and a private position\" while making deals, a process she said was like making sausage. \n \"It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be,\" Clinton said according to the excerpts. \"But if everybody's watching, you know, all of the backroom discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.\" \n Trump overstates cost of Obama's health plan \n DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare \"is going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.\" \n THE FACTS: Trump vastly exaggerates the cost of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. The cost of the coverage expansion in Obama's health care law is nowhere near what the government spends on Medicare and Medicaid, for example. \n According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the government will spend $110 billion this year on \"Obamacare\" coverage. By comparison, Medicare will cost an estimated $590 billion, and the federal share of Medicaid will amount to $370 billion. \n Trump wrong on Clinton and health care \n DONALD TRUMP: \"She (Clinton) wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster\u2026she wants to go to single-payer, which means the government basically rules everything.\" \n THE FACTS: It's Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 not Clinton \u2014 who supports a Canada-style government-run health care system. \n While Clinton's health care proposals would expand the government's role in the health care system, she's not talking about dismantling the current system, which is a hybrid of employer-sponsored coverage, government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and individually purchased insurance. \n As president, Clinton would push for a government-sponsored insurance plan in the health care markets created by President Barack Obama's health care law, as an alternative to private insurance. But those markets currently cover about 11 million people, while about 155 million have job-based coverage. \n Trump says Clinton laughed at rape case \n DONALD TRUMP: When Hillary Clinton defended an accused child-rapist in court, she \"got him off, and she's seen on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.\" \n THE FACTS: Trump's depiction of Clinton laughing at a child rape victim is false, and his statement that she got the man off the hook isn't quite right. \n Clinton defended the man in 1975 at the demand of the judge in the case. \n According to both Clinton in a recorded interview and later statements by the prosecutor who handled the case, Clinton asked not to be assigned to defend the attacker of Kathy Shelton, but ultimately Clinton agreed to defend the man at the judge's insistence. \n According to audio of an interview Clinton gave to a reporter one decade later, Clinton suggested she believed her client, Thomas Alfred Taylor, was guilty, saying that his successful questioning under a polygraph test \"forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.\" \n Despite her discomfort with the case, Clinton aggressively defended her client. In an affidavit to the court, she said a child psychologist had told her that children \"from disorganized families,\" such as the victim, \"tend to exaggerate or romanticize sexual experiences.\" \n But it was a misstep by the prosecution that broke in favor of Clinton's client. The crime lab in the case lost a swatch of the victim's underwear that the prosecution had said contained Taylor's semen and the victim's blood. Clinton seized on the mistake, arguing that the absence of evidence fatally undermined the prosecution's case \u2014 prompting the prosecutor to offer Clinton's client a plea deal to a lesser charge, \"unlawful fondling of a child.\" \n In the recorded interview, Clinton never laughed at Shelton, calling it a \"terrible\" case and saying it was sad that prosecutors had lost the evidence against her client. But she did laugh at procedural errors in the case, and the judge's request to speak privately with her client at one point. \n Clinton on email security \n CLINTON: \"After a yearlong investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using, and there is no evidence that anyone can point to, at all \u2026 that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.\" \n THE FACTS: Maybe, maybe not. While there's indeed no direct, explicit evidence that classified information was leaked or that her server was breached, it was nevertheless connected to the internet in ways that made it more vulnerable to hackers \u2014 and the public may never know who saw them. \n The Associated Press previously discovered that her private server, which has been a major campaign issue for Clinton and the focus of U.S. investigations, appeared to allow users to connect to it openly over the internet and control it remotely. That practice, experts said, wasn't intended to be used without additional protective measures, and was the subject of U.S. government warnings at the time over attacks from even amateur hackers. \n Since the AP in early 2013 traced her server to her home in Chappaqua, New York, Clinton hasn't fully explained who administered her server, if it received software updates to plug security holes or if it was monitored for unauthorized access. It's also unclear what, if any, encryption software Clinton's server may have used to communicate with official U.S. government email accounts. \n Meanwhile, FBI Director James Comey has said Clinton and her staff \"were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\" But he said the FBI won't recommend criminal charges against Clinton for use of the server while she was secretary of state and closed the investigation. \n No evidence Trump sexually assaulted women \n DONALD TRUMP, asked whether he had ever sexually assaulted a women, said: \"No, I have not.\" \n THE FACTS: There's no proof that Trump sexually assaulted women, but he's been accused of it before. \n Trump's first wife, Ivana Trump, accused him of rape in a deposition in the early 1990s. She later said she didn't mean it literally, but rather that she felt violated. Trump was also sued for sexual harassment in 1997 by Jill Harth, a woman who, along with her romantic partner, was pitching Trump to get involved in a pin-up competition in the early 1990s. \n In a recent interview with The New York Times, Harth said Trump ran his hands up her skirt during dinner in 1992, and on another occasion, she said Trump tried to force himself on her in his daughter Ivanka's bedroom. \"Next thing I know he's pushing me against a wall and has his hands all over me,\" Harth told the newspaper. Harth dropped her harassment lawsuit against Trump after he settled a separate breach of contract lawsuit. Trump has denied Harth's allegations. \n Trump says Bill Clinton lost law license \n DONALD TRUMP described the consequences of a sexual harassment lawsuit against former President Bill Clinton: \"He lost his license. He had to pay an $850,000 fine.\" \n THE FACTS: Trump's facts are, at best, jumbled. In 1998, lawyers for Bill Clinton settled with former Arkansas state employee Paul Jones for $850,000 in her four-year lawsuit alleging sexual harassment. Clinton did not acknowledge wrongdoing in the settlement. But Trump erred in describing the legal consequences of that case. In a related case before the Arkansas State Supreme Court, Clinton was fined $25,000 and his Arkansas law license was suspended for five years. Clinton also faced disbarment before the U.S. Supreme Court, but he opted to resign from the court's practice instead of facing any penalties. \n Trump disputes describing sex assaults \n DONALD TRUMP, when asked whether his words captured in video footage from 2005, in which he made sexually predatory and crude comments about women, amounted to a description of sexual assault, said, \"No, I didn't say that at all.\" \n THE FACTS: Trump clearly described groping women without their permission in a footage captured by \"Access Hollywood.\" And Trump said he would automatically kiss women he considered beautiful. \n \"I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\" Trump said. \"Grab them by the p\u2014\u2014. You can do anything.\" \n In the audio, first reported by The Washington Post, Trump also described his sexual advances toward a married woman. \"I moved on her like a b\u2014\u2014. But I couldn't get there. And she was married.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fact checks: Trump, Clinton and their debate claims"}

{"date": "October 9, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speak during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump stands next to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton arrives at Lambert\u2013St. Louis International Airport in St. Louis today for the second presidential debate. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump looks on as Juanita Broaddrick speaks before the second presidential debate with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at Washington University today in St. Louis. \n ST. LOUIS \u00bb In a bitter debate filled with tension and insult, Hillary Clinton declared that Donald Trump's vulgar comments about women reveal \"exactly who he is\" and prove his unsuitability to be president. Firing back, he accused her of attacking women involved in Bill Clinton's extramarital affairs and promised she would \"be in jail\" if he were president. \n Trump, who entered Sunday night's debate desperate to steady his floundering campaign, unleashed a barrage of attacks and continually interrupted Clinton. He repeatedly called her a \"liar,\" labeled her the \"devil\" and contended she had \"tremendous hate in her heart.\" \n On one substantive matter, he acknowledged for the first time that he had paid no federal income taxes for many years. \n The debate was the culmination of a stunning stretch in the race for the White House, which began with the release of a new video in which Trump is heard bragging about how his fame allowed him to \"do anything\" to women. Many Republicans rushed to revoke their support, with some calling for him to drop out of the race. \n Answering for his words for the first time, Trump denied he had ever kissed and grabbed women without their consent. He said repeatedly that his words in 2005 were merely \"locker room talk\" and paled in comparison to what he called Bill Clinton's abuse of women. \n \"She should be ashamed of herself,\" Trump declared. Ahead of the debate, the businessman met with three women who accused the former president of sexual harassment and even rape, then invited them to sit in the debate hall. \n Bill Clinton never faced any criminal charges in relation to the allegations, and a lawsuit over an alleged rape was dismissed. He did settle a lawsuit with one of the women who claimed harassment. \n On the debate stage, Clinton did not respond directly to Trump's accusations about her husband or her own role, but was blistering in her condemnation of his predatory comments about women in the tape released Friday. \n \"I think it's clear to anyone who heard him that it represents exactly who he is,\" she said, adding that she did not believe Trump had the \"fitness to serve\" as commander in chief. \n The second debate was a town hall format, with several undecided voters sitting on stage with the candidates. The voters, all from the St. Louis area, were selected by Gallup. \n The tension between Trump and Clinton was palpable from the start of their 90-minute debate, the second time they have faced off in the presidential campaign. They did not shake hands as they met at center stage. \n Trump, who is several inches taller than Clinton, stood close behind her as she answered questions from the voters. At other times, he paced the stage, repeatedly interrupting her and criticizing the moderators. \n Trump struggled at times to articulate detailed policy proposals, repeatedly dancing around questions about how he would replace President Barack Obama's health care law, a measure he has vowed to repeal. But he leveled several charges against Clinton that will likely energize his supporters, including saying she should have been criminally charged for her controversial email practices at the State Department. \n In a rare public break with his running mate, Trump made clear he did not agree with Mike Pence on how to deal with war-torn Syria. Last week, Pence said the U.S. military should be ready to strike Syrian military targets that are under the command of President Bashar Assad. The threat of military action against the Russia-backed Assad government marks a departure from Trump's preference for a focus on Islamic State targets. \n Said Trump, \"He and I haven't spoken and I disagree.\" \n Trump's campaign was already struggling before the new video was released, due in part to his uneven performance in the first presidential debate. Many Republicans saw Sunday's showdown as his last best chance to salvage his campaign. \n It was unclear whether Trump's performance did anything to expand his support beyond his core backers. He did repeatedly cast Clinton as a career politician who had accomplished little during her years in Washington and would be incapable of bringing about change, one of his strongest arguments in a campaign that has highlighted American's deep frustration. \n \"With her, it's all talk and no action,\" Trump said. \n The new revelations about Trump overshadowed potentially damaging revelations about Clinton's paid speeches to Wall Street firms. Emails released by WikiLeaks last week showed Clinton told a group that it's acceptable for a president to project differing positions in public and private. \n Asked in the debate whether that's \"two-faced,\" Clinton pointed to Abraham Lincoln, saying he did whatever he could to get the 13th Amendment passed, allowing emancipation of the slaves, by lawmakers who did not support African-American equality. \n \"I was making the point it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want them to do. That was a great display of presidential leadership.\" \n Rolling his eyes, Trump said, \"Now she's blaming the late, great Abraham Lincoln.\" \n The political firestorm that preceded the debate was sparked by a video obtained and released Friday by The Washington Post and NBC News. In the video, Trump, who was married to his current wife at the time, is heard describing attempts to have sex with a married woman. He also brags to Billy Bush of \"Access Hollywood\" about women letting him kiss them and grab their genitals because he is famous. \n Trump used the revelations as an opening to make good on his repeated promises to throw Bill Clinton's sexual history into the center of his campaign against his wife. Less than two hours before the debate, he brazenly met publicly in a hotel conference room with three women \u2014 Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey \u2014 who have accused Bill Clinton of unwanted sexual advances and even rape. Kathy Shelton, a fourth woman who appeared with Trump, was a 12-year-old Arkansas sexual assault victim whose alleged assailant was defended by Hillary Clinton. \n Trump refused to answer questions from reporters about his own aggressive sexual remarks about women during the meeting. \n In the heated debate's final moments, the candidates briefly put aside their animosity when asked by a voter if they respected anything about each other. \n Clinton said she respected Trump's children, calling them \"incredibly able and devoted.\" \n Trump, as if pulling a line directly from the Clinton campaign, called his Democratic opponent a \"fighter.\" \n \"She doesn't quit, she doesn't give up,\" he said. \"I respect that.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "90 minutes of fire: Trump, Clinton trade charges, insults"}

{"date": "October 9, 2016", "text": "NBC VIA AP \n Co-host Billy Bush appears on the \"Today\" show in New York on Sept. 26. \n NEW YORK \u00bb NBC on Sunday suspended \"Today\" show personality Billy Bush indefinitely after he was caught on a videotape from 2005 in a crude conversation about women with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.  \n \"Today\" Executive Producer Noah Oppenheim said in a memo today that \"there is simply no excuse for Billy's language and behavior on that tape.\" Bush, who hosts the third hour of the \"Today\" show, has been suspended \"pending further review of the matter,\" Oppenheim said. \n NBC announced its decision two days after the videotape from the \"Access Hollywood\" archives surfaced. Bush was a host for that show in 2005, and he was taped in a hot-mic discussion with Trump when the future presidential nominee was on a Hollywood set to make an appearance on a soap opera. \n On the tape, Trump brags about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife. Bush joins in, laughing at some of Trump's comments and later encouraging an actress to hug Trump. \n Bush, 44, has been brutalized on his own Facebook page since the tape surfaced. Hundreds of hostile comments were attached to Bush's last posting Friday \u2014 of him distributing a plate of bacon to \"Today\" viewers outside of the show's studio. \"You are sickening!\" one woman wrote, in a comment that nearly 5,000 had \"liked\" through Sunday afternoon. \n Angering women viewers of a show as important to NBC's bottom line as \"Today\" is no small matter. Many viewers upset by 2012's messy dumping of Ann Curry as \"Today\" host took it out on colleague Matt Lauer; the show's ratings still haven't recovered. Women make up the majority of \"Today\" viewers, particularly in the last two hours. \n Bush has only been at \"Today\" for two months, where he's had a rocky start. He was the reporter to whom American swimmer Ryan Lochte lied about being robbed at the Olympics. When Bush later tried to defend Lochte on \"Today,\" he was dressed down by colleague Al Roker. \n The \"Access Hollywood\" tape was an embarrassment on multiple levels for NBC News. The news division for days had been aware of the tape from the NBC-owned entertainment show, but was scooped by The Washington Post on Friday when the newspaper was tipped off about its existence and got a story out within hours. \n Bush issued a statement Friday apologizing for his actions. \n The tape showed Bush and Trump speaking as the Republican was about to appear on the daytime drama \"Days of Our Lives.\" From the bus they had ridden to the set, Bush pointed out to Trump an actress, Arianne Zucker, who was there to greet them. \n Bush called the actress \"hot,\" adding an expletive. \n \"I've gotta use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,\" Trump said. \"You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful \u2026 I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\" \n \"Grab them by the p\u2014\u2014. You can do anything,\" Trump added. \n After getting off the bus, Bush asks the actress to hug Trump, then adds, \"How about a little hug for the Bushy?\" \n The married father of three is the nephew of former President George H.W.

{"date": "October 9, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this photo taken on Wednesday, Oct. 5, 2016, a visitor looks at the smartphone cases of Samsung Electronics's Galaxy Note 7 at a shop in Seoul, South Korea. Samsung Electronics Co. estimated its profit rose more than expected in the July-September quarter despite the unprecedented recall of its flagship smartphones. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> Samsung Electronics seemed to have its smartphone troubles under control \u2014 until authorities had to evacuate a Southwest Airlines flight in Kentucky last week for an incident that involved a replacement phone. \n The reason: Authorities said a Samsung smartphone started smoking and making \"popping\" noises, just moments after its owner had boarded the plane and turned off the device. \n Passenger Brian Green, 43, says the device was a Galaxy Note 7 he had picked up from an authorized AT&T retailer Sept. 21 as a replacement for another Note 7 phone he returned when Samsung announced a global recall a week earlier. The recall came after a series of incidents last month in which Note 7 batteries overheated or caught fire. But Samsung had promised that the replacement models were safe. \n Now the South Korean tech giant is facing more scrutiny, after earlier criticism for being slow to react and sending confusing signals in the first days of the recall. \n \"They're in a really tricky spot,\" said Ben Bajarin, a tech industry analyst with the Creative Strategies research firm. \"There's such a stigma around this device now that it's hard to see how sales can do well going forward.\" \n Consider Green's reaction: \"I really liked the device. It had a lot of nice features,\" he told The Associated Press in an interview Friday. But after the incident on the plane, he bought a new iPhone 7 from Apple, rather than take his chances with yet another Samsung Note. \"At this point, I don't want to mess with it anymore.\" \n Authorities haven't confirmed what model of Samsung phone was involved in last week's incident. A spokeswoman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Friday that her agency is still investigating and had no further information. \n AT&T, one of the nation's largest phone retailers, said Sunday that it will stop giving customers the replacement phones. \n \"We're no longer exchanging new Note 7s at this time, pending further investigation of these reported incidents,\" A&T said in a statement. \n AT&T encouraged customers with Note 7 phones to exchange them for other products. The company says it hasn't sold Note 7 phones since the initial recall was announced. \n Verizon, another major seller of smartphones, said it doesn't have any Note 7 phones but they are on back order. Sprint said customers can exchange their replacement Note 7 phones for any other device while the situation is being investigated. \n Meanwhile, other customers have reported problems with their replacement phones. On Saturday, Michael Klering, a Kentucky resident, said his exchanged Note 7 phone caught fire. Klering wrote on Facebook that he and his wife woke up because their bedroom was filling with smoke, and they feared that their children were in danger. \n \"The phone did not seem to actually produce a lot of flame but was hot enough to melt the case it was in and burn my nightstand,\" he said. \"It also created enough smoke to fill my room.\" \n Klering wrote that he and his wife now have bronchitis and are being treated. He said he doesn't feel the company is taking the situation seriously enough and wondered whether it plans to act on his report. \n Commission officials and Samsung announced a formal recall Sept. 15 after authorities said they received 92 reports of Note 7 batteries overheating in the U.S., including 26 reports of burns and 55 cases of property damage. Authorities urged consumers to turn off the phones and return them for a refund or replacement. Samsung said replacement models that were free of defects became available in this country Sept. 21. \n After the Southwest Airlines incident, representatives of the four leading U.S. wireless carriers said customers who had already received replacement Note 7 phones could return those new devices if they have concerns. \n The Galaxy Note 7, which sells for $850 to $890, competes in the high-end smartphone market with Apple, which recently released a new iPhone 7, and other premium brands such as Google's new Pixel phones. \n Samsung says it has recalled about 2.5 million Note 7 devices around the world since problems emerged last month. Analysts estimated the recall would cost the South Korean tech giant as much as $1.8 billion. \n Still, the company said Friday that its third-quarter profit still rose 6 percent, to about $7 billion, on total sales of $43.9 billion \u2014 thanks to income from Samsung's other products, which include advanced computer chips and high-end smartphone displays. \n The Note 7 isn't Samsung's biggest seller. The company sold 76 million smartphones in the second quarter of 2016, most of them lower-priced models. Among higher-priced models, Bajarin estimated Samsung sold well over 10 million Galaxy S7 phones, or four times as many as the Note 7, which has a digital stylus and other distinctive features. \n But Bajarin said he's heard some independent manufacturers may cut production of cases and accessories for the Note 7, in light of slipping sales. He also suggested some wireless carriers may be hesitant to promote the Note 7 heavily in their retail stores. \n \"If your aggressive sales pitch causes a consumer to suffer property damage, you've just damaged your relationship with this customer,\" he said. \n Samsung has shown no signs of backing away from its product, or halting production, Bajarin noted. But if more troubling incidents arise, he said the company might have to reconsider. \n As for Green, the Indiana businessman told The Associated Press that he had checked to make sure the phone he got on Sept. 21 had the packaging marks and a green battery indicator that Samsung said would show it wasn't subject to the recall. \n \"I don't know what else you're supposed to do,\" he said. \n A photo of the phone's packaging, which Green provided to The Associated Press, shows a black square on the label, which Samsung has said would indicate a non-defective phone. The label also has an identifying number that, when typed into Samsung's recall website, returns a message that says, \"Great News! Your device is NOT in the list of affected devices.\" \n Green said he had no problems with the replacement until Oct. 5, when the smoke caused him to pull the device from the front pocket of his jeans. After authorities ordered everyone off the plane, Green said he later saw singe marks on his jeans. An airline representative said the phone scorched the carpet where Green left the device on the airplane floor. \n After speaking with authorities by phone last week, Green said he had an appointment to meet with them Monday. In a statement last week, Samsung said there was \"no evidence that this incident is related to the new Note7.\" Samsung and AT&T representatives didn't respond Friday to a reporter's questions about how a defective phone might have been provided as a replacement after the recall. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n AP writers Tali Arbel, David Koenig and Marley Jay also contributed. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New incidents defy Samsung's efforts to end smartphone woes"}

The new exhibition, which opened Saturday, features artifacts that have rarely been publicly displayed. \n NATICK, Mass. \u00bb President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared it a \"date which will live in infamy\" \u2013 and three-quarters of a century later, relics from that audacious attack still conjure strong emotions. \n A new exhibition commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack that drew the United States into World War II is opening at a private, nonprofit museum west of Boston that's open to the public by appointment. \n The Natick-based Museum of World War II's \"Why We Still Remember\" display chronicles the mood in the U.S. and Japan leading up to and after the Dec. 7, 1941, attack by Japan. \n Museum founder Kenneth Rendell suggests the themes \u2013 including the rising nationalism in Japan and the complacency in the U.S. to the growing threat in a part of the world few Americans understood \u2013 should resonate today in the times of the Islamic State group and other foes. \n \"We underestimated the Japanese terribly. Everyone was paying attention to Europe, no one was paying attention to Asia,\" he says. \"It explains a lot about why we were caught flat-footed. That's the importance of learning from history. It's having respect for the enemy.\" \n The exhibition, which opened Saturday and runs through Jan. 7, 2017, features artifacts evoking the imperialistic ambitions of Japan in the years leading up to the attack, when Japanese news accounts and propaganda celebrated victories over China in the two nations' battles in the 1930s. \n Those pieces are contrasted with the island paradise of hula girls and sandy beaches captured in photographs taken by U.S. servicemen stationed at Pearl Harbor, which is located just west of Honolulu, Hawaii, and is the headquarters of the Pacific Fleet. \n Then there is the attack itself. It involved more than 300 Japanese fighter planes and bombers and killed more than 2,000 Americans, wounded more than 1,000 others, and destroyed or damaged scores of U.S. warships and aircraft. \n A glass display holds a small piece of a Japanese plane shot down in the battle, as well as a copy of the first hastily typed distress message sent out from the naval base. \n \"AIRRAID ON PEARL HARBOR X THIS IS NO DRILL,\" it reads. \n Other items on display include a large pair of binoculars from the bridge of the USS Arizona. The badly bombed battleship sank in the attack, killing more than 1,000 officers and crew members. \n On the exhibition walls, the outrage and sorrow of U.S. newspaper headlines is contrasted with the euphoria and exultation expressed in Japanese postcards, photos and newspapers at the time. \n The exhibition also reflects on the heightened fear and anger over Japanese living in America, and the experiences of Japanese families forced into internment camps. \n Through photos, letters and other personal effects, it spotlights the story of Tom Kasai, a Los Angeles-area resident who served in the U.S. Army while his wife and parents were relocated to a camp in Arizona. \n Kasai was wounded serving in France and awarded the Purple Heart, which is included in the display along with his uniform and other medals. \n As visitors complete the exhibition, they're confronted with an assortment of buttons, pins, stamps and other keepsakes produced in the wake of the attack. \n All bear the national rallying cry: \"Remember Pearl Harbor.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Display of rare items marks 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor"}

Jeremie appears to be the epicenter of the country's growing humanitarian crisis in the wake of the storm. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Residents pray at a church that was destroyed by hurricane Matthew in Jeremie, Haiti on Sunday. An international response is finally getting underway as Haitian authorities try to gauge the full extent of the staggering blow delivered by Hurricane Matthew, including hundreds dead and tens of thousands of homes obliterated. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Residents pray at a church that was destroyed by hurricane Matthew in Jeremie, Haiti. Jeremie appears to be the epicenter of the country's growing humanitarian crisis in the wake of the storm. \n JEREMIE, Haiti \u00bb Survivors of Hurricane Matthew put on their Sunday finest and picked their way through downed power lines to sing praise and pray in ruined churches, while desperation grew in other parts of devastated Haiti and international rescue efforts began ramping up. \n Haitian authorities were still unsure of the extent of the disaster, with some communities still cut off. But tens of thousands of homes were obliterated and the dead number in the hundreds. \n Guillaume Silvera, a senior official with the Civil Protection Agency in the storm-blasted Grand-Anse Department, which includes Jeremie, said at least 522 deaths were confirmed there alone \u2014 not including people in several remote communities still cut off by collapsed roads and bridges. \n National Civil Protection headquarters in Port-au-Prince, meanwhile, said Saturday its official count for the whole country was 336, which included 191 deaths in Grand-Anse. \n Despite the loss, families packed what remained the city's churches, many seated in pews under open sky because Matthew ripped away roofs and even walls of the sanctuaries. At least one was so badly damaged that worshippers set up an altar and prayed outside. \n Elise Pierre, who said she was about 80, said she believed it was a divine miracle that she and her loved ones survived. \n \"If God wasn't protecting us we'd all be gone today, blown into the ocean or up into the mountains,\" said Pierre, whose straw hat almost concealed a gash on her forehead she sustained when her sheet metal roof collapsed during the height of Matthew's fury. \n The sound of hammering could be heard on nearly every street in Jeremie, a city near the tip of Haiti's southwest peninsula, as people patched their roofs as best as they could. \n On one corner, Jameson Pierre was mixing cement and making them into blocks. The 22-year-old storm refugee whose family was stuck in an emergency shelter, saw at least one bright side. \n \"There will be lots and lots of jobs since so many homes were knocked down. I've been working for the last three days straight,\" he said in the fierce morning sun. He said he was getting about a dollar a day. \n The first three of five cargo planes of humanitarian aid from the United States have arrived at the Toussaint Louverture airport in the capital Port of Prince. They were carrying 480 metric tons of relief supplies, including 20,000 hygiene kits, 18,000 sets of kitchen utensils for cooking, 40,000 blankets and 500 rolls of plastic sheeting. \n The airstrip in Jeremie is unable to accommodate large cargo planes, so relief was being ferried to the devastated city by helicopter. Three of nine U.S. helicopters had arrived in Jeremie by Sunday, bringing rice and cooking oil, among other things. \n \"I lost everything I own in this hurricane. I just came here to get some help,\" said subsistence farmer Markus Bagard, one of roughly 200 Haitians standing outside the airstrip watching the helicopters be unloaded. \n Many of the villages in the southwestern peninsula are difficult to reach. And people are growing increasingly desperate after losing everything when the storm ripped through the area on Tuesday. \n Dony St. Germain, an official with El Shaddai Ministries International, said young men in villages off the road between the southern city of Les Cayes and Jeremie were starting to put up blockades of rocks and broken branches to halt the convoys. \n \"They are seeing these convoys coming through with supplies and they aren't stopping. They are hungry and thirsty and some are getting angry,\" said St. Germain. \n A civil protection convoy carrying food, water and medication from Les Cayes to Jeremie was attacked by gunmen in a remote valley where there had been a bad mudslide, Frednel Kedler, the coordinator for the Civil Protection Agency in Grand-Anse, said on Sunday. The convoy's driver was pistol whipped and all the relief supplies stolen. \n Kedler attributed the armed robbery to desperation in many rural communities that have not yet received aid. He said that authorities will try to reach marooned communities west of Jeremie on Monday. \n Government officials estimate that at least 350,000 people need assistance, and concern was growing over an increase in cholera cases following widespread flooding unleashed by Matthew. An ongoing cholera outbreak has already killed roughly 10,000 people and sickened more than 800,000 since 2010, when the infectious disease was introduced into the country's biggest river from a U.N. base where Nepalese peacekeepers were deployed. \n Maria Sofia Sanon, a health worker overseeing the open-air cholera treatment center in a corner of Jeremie's main hospital, said they were ill-equipped to deal with patients. The area was strewn with broken tree branches, and a group of young mothers sat outside holding up the arms of their glassy-eyed children being rehydrated via IVs. \n \"They're not supposed to be in the sun, but we have no more beds,\" Sanon said. \n The World Food Program says there has been massive destruction of crops. Hospitals and clinics have been damaged or destroyed as they struggle to deal with an increase in patients with injuries sustained during the storm as well as an apparent increase in cholera. UNICEF said that in Grand-Anse alone there were 66,000 houses destroyed and 20,000 heavily damaged. \n \"Information gathered from various sources in the field suggests that the human toll (dead and injured) will be heavier than the current official figures,\" the agency said in a report. \n Jocelyne Saint Preux was part of the crowd that lined up in an orderly fashion to get food as aid began. \n The mother of three children whose home was destroyed said officials were handing out wheat, beans, oil and salt. \n \"Yes, they brought food, but it's not sufficient,\" she said. \"There's no water. There's no charcoal.\" \n People in Les Cayes, as well as the southern community of Port Salut, said little to no aid has reached them. \n Fisherman Dominique Pomper said the mayor came to distribute some rice but that was it. Among other things, he said people here need power restored and water. The ocean has intruded into their wells and made their own supplies undrinkable. Many don't want to drink water from other sources because of fears of cholera. \n Pomper said he tried to stay at home with his family during the storm but they eventually fled as the water rushed into their house. The 61-year-old said it was the worst night of his life but that he would never leave his seaside village. \n \"We are fishermen here, our job is the water. We can't run away from the water,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Haitians worship among devastation caused by hurricane"}

{"date": "October 9, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. troops will be engaged more closely than ever in fighting against Islamic State group militants as they back Iraqi forces in the long-anticipated assault on Mosul. The assault caps an increasing American role in Iraq over the past two years, with nearly 6,000 U.S. troops on the ground, including special forces in combat on the front-lines. \n CAMP SWIFT, Iraq >> Thirteen years ago, Chase Snow's father was among the American troops who moved into the Iraqi city of Mosul during the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Now Snow, a U.S. Army specialist, is deployed in Iraq to help in the fight to retake the city from the Islamic State group. \n The assault on Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is bringing American forces into their most significant role in Iraq in years, in terms of numbers and presence on the front lines. \n The lead-up to the assault has already brought some U.S. forces into combat with the militants. Special forces carry out raids alongside Iraqi troops inside IS-held territory around Mosul. And now as Iraqi forces prepare for the operation to retake the city, those raids have increased in frequency, according to a coalition official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to brief the media. \n The U.S. has also sent Apache helicopters to aid in the Mosul fight, according to the Pentagon, a step that was not taken when Iraqi forces retook the western cities of Ramadi and Fallujah. \n The number of U.S. troops in Iraq has steadily grown over the past two years to now nearly 6,000 service members, up from almost none following the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq. The latest group, numbering nearly 600, began to deploy in September to Qayara air base, the facility 30 miles south of Mosul that is to be the main staging ground for the assault on the city. Trucks have been rolling in the base for weeks with supplies and equipment, preparing it so coalition warplanes will be able to operate there. \n \"You've got to look at Mosul as the crown jewel right now,\" said Maj. Gen. Gary Volesky, the head of U.S ground forces in Iraq, regarding the build-up of forces. The deployments have \"all been targeted to assist in the Mosul attack.\" \n Besides the hundreds of special forces, most of the American personnel operate back from the front lines, coordinating coalition airstrikes, tracking Iraqi ground troops, sharing intelligence and helping plan operations. \n Snow, from Nashville, Tennessee, with the 101st Airborne Division, is advising Iraqi officers carrying out the Mosul operation. His father was also with the 101st in Mosul in 2003. Now on Snow's Iraq deployment, he carries the same American flag his father kept with him on all of his tours and his father's good luck charm: a St. Michael prayer card. \n \"I know my father never thought I would be coming to Iraq,\" Snow said \n U.S. presence at bases closer to Mosul in the lead up to operation is \"essential\" to the advise-and-assist mission, said U.S. Army Col. Brett Sylvia, the commanding officer at Camp Swift, a small coalition base outside Makhmour, some 73 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of Mosul. \n \"If you're not there, then you don't have a voice,\" Sylvia said, standing in front of the bank of televisions and desktop monitors that he says constitutes the forward edge of the battle for his men. \n As of last week, there were 4,565 U.S. troops in Iraq, according to the Pentagon. That doesn't include another 1,500 troops considered there \"on temporary duty,\" whose number changes daily, according to the U.S. officials \n U.S. troop levels in Iraq peaked at 157,800 during the 2008 surge under then-President George W. Bush, according to the Pentagon. More than 140,000 U.S. troops were in Iraq when President Barack Obama took office in 2009. Obama drew down the forces until the complete withdrawal of late 2011 removed all combat troops from the country, leaving behind only a few hundred U.S. trainers, mainly civilians, to assist Iraqi security forces. \n U.S. forces began returning after the Islamic State group overran Mosul in the summer of 2014 and blitzed across much of northern, central and western Iraq, joining it to territory it holds in Syria. Weeks later, President Barack Obama announced the start of the air campaign against the Islamic State. At the time, he underlined that he will not allow the U.S. \"to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq.\" \n But the U.S. role has steadily grown as Iraqi and Kurdish forces continue to rely heavily on coalition airpower and support in taking back the territory the militant group overran in 2014. \n Over the past year, three American service members have been killed by IS in Iraq, revealing the increasingly active role of U.S. forces in a fight the Pentagon initially refused to describe as combat. \n In October 2015, Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler was killed as he and dozens of other U.S. special forces participated in a raid alongside Iraqi Kurdish forces to free IS-held prisoners. \n At the time, Defense secretary Ash Carter said it hadn't been part of the plan for U.S. forces to engage in combat during that raid and that Wheeler had \"rushed to help\" when the Kurdish fighters he was with came under attack. \n Months later, Marine Staff Sgt. Louis Cardin was killed when IS fighters attacked a fire base near Camp Swift. \n By the time of the third American death \u2014 Navy SEAL Charles Keating, who was killed in May \u2014 Carter immediately described it as a combat death. \"He was in a firefight and he died in combat,\" he said. \n Carter noted that while the coalition's overall approach is to enable local forces, \"that doesn't mean we aren't going to do any fighting at all.\" \n Iraqi commanders say despite months of training, their men are still almost entirely dependent on coalition airpower and intelligence to retake territory. \n \"If we didn't have airstrikes we wouldn't be able to advance,\" Iraqi Army Capt. Riad Ghafil with the Nineveh Operation Command admitted. \n On a recent day at the Basmaya base outside Baghdad, Snow attended a graduation ceremony for 1,000 Iraqi soldiers who finished training and will be deployed in the north against IS. About halfway through the long series of speeches, the graduates began falling out of formation and slipping away from the ceremony to escape the midday sun. Coalition trainers at the event shook their heads in dismay, explaining that discipline was one of the skills the course focused on. \n Throughout the steady intensification of the U.S. war in Iraq over the past two years, coalition and U.S. officials maintained that ultimately a lasting solution will only come from political change and reconciliation among Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and other communities. But Iraqi political leadership has repeatedly failed to meet benchmarks for political reconciliation. \n At Camp Swift, Sylvia said that after his last tour in Baghdad in 2008 he said he never thought he'd be back again. He said he hopes the U.S. doesn't fully withdraw from Iraq a second time. \n \"I would like us to have a long-term, engaging relationship with our Iraqi partners,\" he said. \n \"I think there is some admission (among some Iraqis) that it was a mistake for us to leave.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. forces increasing Iraq footprint ahead of Mosul operation"}

{"date": "October 9, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Pope Francis waves to faithful as leaves at the end of a jubilee mass he celebrated in St. Peter's Square, at the Vatican on Sunday. Pope Francis has named 17 new cardinals 13 of them under age 80 and thus eligible to vote in a conclave to elect his successor. \n VATICAN CITY >> Pope Francis named 17 new cardinals Sunday \u2014 three of them American moderates, including Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich and Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin \u2014 in a clear signal to the conservative U.S. church hierarchy that he values pastors focused more on mercy than morals. \n Tobin's nomination also carries a political message ahead of the U.S. election next month, given that he openly opposed a request from Indiana Gov. Michael Pence, now the running mate of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, to not settle Syrian refugees in the state. \n \"I am shocked beyond words by the decision of the Holy Father,\" Tobin tweeted. \"Please pray for me.\" \n Thirteen of the new cardinals, including all the Americans, are under age 80 and thus eligible to vote in a future conclave to elect Francis' successor, the key job of a cardinal. \n As is Francis' tradition, the new cardinals hail from some of the most far-flung and peripheral corners of the globe, with Africa, Asia, South America and Oceania getting far more representation in this round than Europe, which has long dominated the College of Cardinals. \n New \"princes\" of the church include bishops from Bangui, Central African Republic; Port Louis, Mauritius and Tlalnepantla, Mexico. In all, seven countries that have never had a cardinal are getting one in this, the third batch of red-hatted churchmen named by Latin America's first-ever pope. Despite the new nominations, though, Europe still has the most voting-age cardinals with 54. \n Significantly only one Italian elector was named: Francis' ambassador to \"the beloved and martyred Syria,\" Cardinal-elect Mario Zenari. \n And one of the over-80 cardinals is a clear sentimental favorite: the Rev. Ernest Troshani Simoni of Albania. \n Simoni, who turns 88 later this month, brought Francis to tears when he recounted his life story to the pope during Francis' 2014 visit to Tirana: the two decades he spent imprisoned, tortured and sentenced to forced labor for refusing to speak out against the Catholic Church during Albania's brutal communist rule. \n The third American, Cardinal-elect Kevin Farrell, the outgoing bishop of Dallas, was an expected nomination. Francis in August named him to head the big new Vatican department for laity, family and life issues. \n Speaking Sunday at the end of a special Mass on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica, Francis said the 17 would be elevated at a consistory on Nov. 19, on the eve of the close to his Holy Year of Mercy. \n \"Their provenance from 11 nations expresses the universality of the church that announces and is witness to the good news of the mercy of God in every corner of the world,\" Francis said. \n Their elevation will bring the number of voting-age cardinals to 120 by the end of November, the maximum allowed under current rules. With the non-voting cardinals included, the college by that time will number 228. With Sunday's appointees, Francis will have appointed 44 cardinal electors and 11 non-electors. \n Of the new cardinals, Cupich is very much a pastor in Francis' likeness, emphasizing the merciful and welcoming side of the church \u2014 somewhat to the dismay of U.S. conservative Catholics. His nomination as Chicago archbishop was Francis' first major U.S. appointment and he was a papal appointee at the pope's big family synod last year. \n In a statement, Cupich said his appointment was \"humbling and encouraging\" and said he hoped that despite the new responsibilities, he and his flock would \"continue the task we have begun of renewing the church in the archdiocese and preparing it to thrive in the decades ahead.\" \n The nomination for Tobin is significant both for the U.S. church and the U.S. election and reflects Francis' ongoing concern for refugees. \n A U.S. federal appeals court recently used stinging language in a ruling that will keep Pence from barring Syrian refugee resettlement in Indiana for now. Trump, the Republican nominee for president and Pence's running mate, has proposed deporting millions of immigrants and banning the entry of Muslims from other countries. \n \"You can find a political message\" in the Tobin appointment, said Massimo Faggioli, a Villanova University expert on the Vatican. \n Tobin's nomination could also indicate Francis' appreciation of his support for American nuns. Tobin had been the No. 2 in the Vatican office for religious orders for only two years when in 2012, then-Pope Benedict XVI sent him back to the U.S. to head the Indianapolis archdiocese, which has fewer than 230,000 parishioners. \n The transfer was seen in some Vatican circles as being tied to Tobin's efforts to promote dialogue and resolve tensions between the Vatican and U.S. nuns who were subject of two separate Holy See investigations at the time. \n After Francis was elected, both investigations were concluded with Vatican praise for the work of the sisters. \n Francis has made it a point to no longer automatically name cardinals from big dioceses as had been the practice for centuries. The Italian cities of Venice and Turin, for example, have been without cardinals for several years. \n The same goes for the U.S., where such staunchly Catholic archdioceses as Philadelphia, which hosted Francis last year at the Catholic Church's big family rally, was passed over again. Philadelphia is headed by the conservative Archbishop Charles Chaput, who has insisted on traditional church doctrine on issues such as whether civilly remarried couples can receive Communion \u2014 areas where Francis has sought greater flexibility. \n \"It's a clear message to the United States Catholic bishops about the kind of church Francis has in mind,\" Faggioli said. \n The geographic distribution of electors still heavily favors Europe, which has 54 voting-age cardinals. The Americas come next with 34 cardinals in North, South and Central America. Africa has 15, Asia 14 and Oceania four. On Nov. 28, Cardinal Theodore-Adrien Sarr of Senegal will turn 80, bringing the voting number down to 120. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n AP Religion Writer Rachel Zoll in New York contributed. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n This version corrects the spelling of Blase Cupich sted Blaise. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pope Francis names 17 cardinals: 3 of them USA moderates"}

The death toll in the U.S. climbed to at least 15, nearly half of them in North Carolina. \n The storm was stripped of hurricane status just before daybreak, but the crisis \u2014 set off by downpours of more than a foot \u2014 was far from over. \n \"As the sun rises in North Carolina and the blue sky returns, our state is facing major destruction and, sadly, loss of life,\" Gov. Pat McCrory said as the effects of Saturday's deluge became clearer at daylight. \n Rivers and creeks overflowed, driving people from their homes and trapping others as much as 100 miles inland. The unofficial rainfall totals were staggering: 18 inches in Wilmington, 14 inches in Fayetteville and 8 inches in Raleigh. \n McCrory said police and emergency crews had made more than 880 water rescues. In the Fayetteville area alone, rescue crews saved nearly 600 people from the rapidly rising floodwaters, officials said. \n The governor said that four people were missing in the Fayetteville area and that the full scale of the disaster was not yet known because the flooding continued overnight and there were many places that search teams had not yet reached. \n \"There could be some backroads where we had people swept away. I'm praying that is not going to be,\" McCrory said. \n Most of the deaths happened when vehicles were swept away by floodwaters. \n About 100 guests and workers had to be evacuated from a Comfort Inn motel in the North Carolina coastal town of Southport after the hurricane cracked a wall and left the roof in danger of collapse, authorities said. And dramatic video showed Fayetteville police rescuing a woman and her small child from their car as rising waters swallowed it. \n Shortly before daybreak, the hurricane was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone. As of 8 a.m. EDT, the storm was centered about 60 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, moving out to sea. It still had hurricane-force winds of 75 mph. \n Forecasters said North Carolina and Virginia could get even more rain and warned of the danger of life-threatening flooding through Monday night. \n \"Stay home. Most of your church services have been cancelled. There's no reason to go out. Take the day off,\" Fayetteville Mayor Nat Robertson said. \n Matthew killed more than 500 people in Haiti last week, plowing into the desperately poor country at 145 mph. The fearsome storm then sideswiped hundreds of miles of the U.S. coastline from Florida through Georgia and the Carolinas, its eye staying far enough offshore that the damage in many places was relatively modest, consisting mostly of flooded streets, flattened trees and blown-down signs and awnings. \n Up until Saturday night and Sunday morning, it appeared that the U.S. might pull through without the catastrophic damage that forecasters said was possible. Many people counted themselves lucky. \n Along the main drag in Daytona Beach, Florida, the Silver Diner had all of its shiny metal siding ripped off the front and sides, leaving only a wood frame exposed. Next door, the window of a souvenir shop had been blown out and the roof and ceiling torn through, leaving pink insulation dangling. \n David Beasley, president of Insurance Recovery Inc., surveyed the damage and said that although it looked bad, the main strip was hit harder by Hurricanes Charley and Frances in 2004. \n \"This is not much compared to those two,\" he said. \n An estimated 2 million people in the Southeast were ordered to evacuate their homes as Matthew closed in. By hugging the coast, the storm behaved pretty much as forecasters predicted. A shift of just 20 or 30 miles could have meant widespread devastation. \n \"People got incredibly lucky,\" Colorado State University meteorology professor Phil Klotzbach. \"It was a super close call.\" \n While Matthew's wind speed had dropped considerably by the time it hit the Southeast coast, the storm will rank as one of the most powerful hurricanes on record, based on such factors as wind energy and longevity, and as one of the most long-lived major hurricanes, too. \n It was a major hurricane \u2014 that is, with winds of at least 110 mph \u2014 for just over seven days. \n Three-quarters of a million people lost power in North Carolina, according to the governor, along with a similar number in South Carolina, 250,000 in Georgia and about 1 million in Florida. \n In addition to the seven deaths in North Carolina, there were four in Florida, three in Georgia and one in South Carolina. Some were killed by falling trees, others by carbon monoxide fumes from a generator. \n Property data firm CoreLogic projected that insured losses on home and commercial properties would amount to $4 billion to $6 billion, well below Hurricane Katrina's $40 billion and Superstorm Sandy's $20 billion. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Matthew triggers severe flooding in North Carolina; U.S. death toll at 15"}

LOUIS \u00bb Donald Trump, on the defensive since a video came out depicting him using vulgar language about women and seeming to condone sexual assault, held a pre-debate appearance Sunday with women who accused Bill Clinton of rape and unwanted sexual advances. \n Trump has telegraphed for days that he was going to make the accusations against the former president a part of his White House campaign. It was a strategy he raised in his taped apology, posted hours after Friday's leak of the video from 2005 that has rocked his campaign and caused dozens of Republican lawmakers to abandon their support of his candidacy. \n Trump refused to take questions when he appeared with Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey at the St. Louis hotel where he was preparing for the debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton. The meeting was posted on his Facebook page. The four women also were invited by Trump to watch the debate inside the debate hall. \n \"Mr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me and Hillary Clinton threatened me,\" Broaddrick said. \"I don't think there's any comparison.\" \n Broaddrick, a former Arkansas nursing home administrator, first claimed 17 years ago that Bill Clinton raped her during a meeting in Little Rock in 1978. She sued Bill Clinton in 1999; the case was dismissed in 2001. A Twitter account that claimed to be that of Broaddrick revived the allegations on Saturday and was retweeted by Trump. Bill Clinton has long denied her account. \n Jones, a former Arkansas state worker, alleged in 1991 that Bill Clinton propositioned and exposed himself to her. In 1994, she filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him. Bill Clinton's lawyers tried to have the suit dismissed. In November 1998, he paid Jones $850,000 to settle the case without apologizing or acknowledging culpability. \n \"I think they should all look at the fact that (Trump) is a good person,\" Jones said. \"He's not what other people have been saying he's been, like Hillary. He's going to make America great again.\" \n Willey, a former White House volunteer, is using a website to again accuse Bill Clinton of forcing himself on her in 1993. He denied her charge and an independent prosecutor later concluded there was no evidence to doubt that denial. \n Kathy Shelton, a fourth woman who appeared with Trump at the hotel conference room, was an Arkansas sexual assault victim whose assailant was defended by Hillary Clinton. \n In 1975, at age 12, Shelton was sexually assaulted in northwest Arkansas. Clinton was asked by a judge overseeing the case to represent Shelton's alleged attacker. After the prosecution lost key evidence, Clinton's client entered a plea to a lesser charge. In an interview a decade later, Clinton expressed horror at the crime, but was recorded on tape laughing about procedural details of the case. The audio has been seized on by conservative groups looking to attack Clinton's presidential candidacy. \n On Friday, The Washington Post and NBC released a video of Trump, unaware he was on a hot microphone, suggesting that he forced himself on women to \"grab them by the p\u2014\u2014\" and that \"when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\" \n The comments have prompted a number of prominent Republicans to un-endorse the celebrity businessman. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump, before debate, appears with Bill Clinton's accusers"}

{"date": "October 9, 2016", "text": "San Francisco \u00bb A boat capsized in the San Francisco Bay sending five adults and three children, including two in critical condition, to a hospital, officials said. \n The boat carrying 27 adults and three children capsized for unknown reasons Saturday afternoon about 100 yards off Pier 45, said San Francisco Police Officer Giselle Talkoff. \n One 5-year-old boy, who was unconscious and not breathing when he was pulled out of the water, was eventually revived and expected to make a full recovery, according to Jonathan Baxter, a public info officer for San Francisco Fire Department. Another 5-year-old boy was also initially listed in critical condition but was later downgraded to stable, he added. \n All eight people who were hospitalized were expected to survive, Baxter said. \n Photographs posted on social media showed youths and adults barefoot and wrapped in thick gray blankets on shore after being rescued. The boat was fully submerged in the water. \n Fisherman David Griffiths told the San Francisco Chronicle he tossed life jackets to the people in the water. He was taking off his shoes and getting ready to jump in when the first rescue teams arrived, Griffiths said. \n Fire Department Assistant Chief Bob Postel said rescue teams from the fire and police departments and the U.S. Coast Guard all rushed to the scene. \n \"There were lots of rescue boats on the water because of Fleet Week, so we were fortunate,\" he said. \"We were able to get everybody out and accounted for quickly.\" \n A good Samaritan performed CPR on the boy who wasn't breathing until a police officer was able to take over, Talkoff said. \n Griffiths said it was jarring to see the boat upend during what had been an otherwise beautiful day on the water. \n \"Seeing the bottom of it, that's not a normal thing,\" he said. \n Authorities were investigating the cause of the accident. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "5-year-old boy revived after boat capsizes off San Francisco"}
