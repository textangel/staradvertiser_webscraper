The hotel will include a fourth-floor pool deck and its design will reflect the site's history. \n Plans to convert the King Kalakaua Plaza retail site into a seven-story, 230-room hotel tower received strong support from the Waikiki Neighborhood Board tonight. \n An unsuccessful four-story retail building, which is owned by California-based Robertson Properties Group, currently sits on the redevelopment site fronting Kalakaua and Kuhio avenues between Olohana and Kalaimoku streets. The structure includes two levels of basement parking with more than 200 stalls. \n New renovation plans will remove the building's existing roof and add three new floors increasing the total building height from 65 feet to 100 feet, Tom Schnell, principal PBR Hawaii, the planning and landscape architecture company hired by Robertson Properties Group, told the board during its monthly meeting. \n \"It's actually an adaptive reuse of the existing building, which is much more environmentally friendly. It's a wide building, so we can get to 230 rooms without going as high as what is allowed,\" Schnell said. \n The height limit in the Waikiki Resort Mixed-use Precinct is 300 feet, but buildings up to 350 feet are allowed if approved by the Honolulu City Council, he said. \n The hotel will include a fourth-floor pool deck and its design will reflect the site's history, which Schnell said included a vast reserve of royal fish ponds. The mid-priced hotel will be aimed at attracting extended stay travelers, Schnell said. \n Waikiki Neighborhood Board Member Jo-Ann Adams said she favored seeing the building turned into something more viable. \n \"I have no idea why the tourists could not cross the street, but they could not cross the street and use (the building),\" Adams said. \"Extended stay is something new in the portfolio for Waikiki.\" \n Built in 1998 for nearly $45 million , the King Kalakaua Plaza was formerly home to Nike Town, Banana Republic, and The All Star Caf\u00e9, a sports restaurant and bar. That unsuccessful development sat on a 1.05 acre, two-parcel site that once housed the Kuhio Theaters. \n \"It wasn't a great location for them. It was a challenge to attract retail tenants to that end of Kalakaua and the building remained vacant for many years,\" \n The project is undergoing an environmental assessment, which is expected to be published in late December. A public comment period is expected to run until late January, he said. \n Some Waikiki residents questioned whether the project would strain the dense neighborhood's infrastructure. However, others applauded when Waikiki Neighborhood Board Vice Chairman Louis Erteschik offered preliminary support for the project. \n \"They aren't trying to bust the zoning code or build another monstrosity. What you've got here they can build to 300 feet and they are only going to build to 100 feet. That's a real gift,\" Erteschik said. \"They do comply with every facet of the law and we should appreciate and reward a developer or project manager that actually doesn't want to have a high impact building.\" \n Waikiki Neighborhood Board Member Mark Smith concurred. \n \"I think the neighborhood is getting a real bargain, they could go a lot higher,\" Smith said. \n ", "author": "By Allison Schaefers aschaefers@staradvertiser.com", "title": "King Kalakaua Plaza hotel gets support"}

{"date": "October 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former President Bill Clinton pauses for a selfie with a supporter at a coffee shop while campaigning for his wife, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in Los Angeles. \n ATHENS, Ohio >> Ignoring his own sexually aggressive predilections, Donald Trump wants voters to see Bill Clinton as a scandal-plagued cad whose history with women should disqualify Hillary Clinton from the presidency. \n The argument doesn't seem to resonate with America's youngest voters, who know the 70-year-old former president as a figure out of history books and don't seem to care about his Oval Office affair with Monica Lewinsky or other marital infidelities. Many of them describe the white-topped, bespectacled grandfather more as Hillary's famous husband than a central figure to consider as they weigh their 2016 ballot. \n \"I'm here for Hillary, not for Bill,\" said 19-year-old Rachel Onusko, an Ohio University sophomore who attended the former president's recent campaign appearance at the Athens campus. \"It's great that he's supporting his wife,\" Onusko continued, \"but the main factor is not, 'Oh, her husband was the president.' For me, the message is, 'Hillary is a strong woman and this is what she stands for.'\" \n To be sure, millennials have yet to embrace Hillary Clinton fully, even as they reject Trump. A national GenForward survey in September found 54 percent of adults age 18-30 had a negative view of Clinton, with 75 percent feeling the same about Trump. And Bill Clinton isn't necessarily the best Hillary Clinton supporter to convert skeptics: President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, the only White House couple the youngest voters have followed closely, are the ones who draw massive, shrieking crowds of young people. \n Hillary Clinton's campaign implicitly concedes the point, with Bill Clinton's recent and coming schedules in Ohio, Florida, Iowa and other battlegrounds tilted to union groups and African-American audiences. Still, an August Gallup poll found the former president with a 56 percent approval rating among adults ages 18-29. \n Perhaps most encouraging for Bill Clinton in the millennial pursuit \u2014 and ominous for Trump \u2014 is that Onusko and many of her contemporaries express bewilderment and even disdain over the Republican nominee's broadsides about the ex-president's sexual history and Hillary Clinton's actions in the political fallout. \n \"Bill Clinton was abusive to women,\" Trump said in the second presidential debate, as three of the women who allege unwanted sexual encounters with Clinton sat in the audience at Trump's invitation. \"Hillary Clinton attacked those same women, and attacked them viciously.\" He'd raised that subject intermittently before. \n Hillary Clinton did not directly address Trump's accusations that she had taken part in aggressive efforts by Clinton associates to discredit women who had gone public with allegations about her husband. \n Even before the disclosure of an explosive 2005 tape in which Trump boasted in vulgar terms about imposing himself on women at will, young people hardly regarded the billionaire as a man who respects women. \n \"The only people I know who support Trump are men, mostly older men,\" said Selena Peterson, 19, of Canton, Ohio, who voted for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary but has no qualms about voting for Clinton over Trump. \n Dominic Detwiler, 18, from Lancaster, Ohio, was a Sanders supporter who is deciding between Clinton and the Green Party's Jill Stein \u2014 but not because he's contemplating Bill Clinton's treatment of women. \"I'm over the whole Monica Lewinsky thing,\" he said of the White House intern at the center of the 42nd president's 1998 impeachment. \"I mean, would I have divorced him if he'd done that to me? Sure. But that wasn't my decision; it was Hillary's.\" \n It's certainly not that young voters aren't familiar with Bill Clinton's transgressions, confirmed or alleged. \"Impeachment was one of the first things we learned about him in school,\" said Peterson, \"and, of course, people in history class would make the Monica jokes.\" \n Will Maher, 25, of Fort Collins, Colorado, was 7 years old in 1998. \"I remember my parents turning off the television during the news and saying, 'We're not going to discuss that,'\" he said. Maher, who hasn't decided how to vote, says: \"If he was running again, maybe that would matter.\" As for Hillary Clinton, \"I judge her as her own candidate, in the present.\" \n Madison Sloat, a 19-year-old from Pittsburgh who has backed Hillary Clinton from the beginning, agreed. \"It shouldn't be an issue that impacts her at all. It makes me mad that he wants American citizens to blame Hillary for all of that.\" \n That attitude suits the former president fine. \"He's been making those attacks since the beginning of this campaign, so I don't think there's anything new,\" Bill Clinton told reporters in Ohio. Days later, he sat silently in his wife's VIP box, feet from the debate stage where Trump bellowed, \"There's never been anyone in the history of politics \u2026 so abusive to women.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Barrow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/BillBarrowAP . \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Young voters not swayed by Bill Clinton's history"}

Non-Prime members will pay $10 a month, the same monthly fee charged by Spotify and Apple Music. \n NEW YORK >> Amazon is launching a paid streaming music service, the latest entry in an increasingly crowded field. \n Amazon Music Unlimited is being positioned to compete against existing services such as Spotify and Apple Music. It will cost $8 per month, or $80 a year, for members of Amazon's $99-a-year Prime loyalty program. Non-Prime members will pay $10 a month, the same monthly fee charged by Spotify and Apple Music. \n Owners of Amazon's Echo smart speaker, meanwhile, will be able to get the unlimited music service on one device for $4 per month. \n The steaming service is one more perk \u2014 like two-day free shipping and Amazon Video \u2014 that the Seattle-based company hopes will attract people to its Prime program and thus encourage them to spend more on its flagship site. Amazon already offers Amazon Prime Music for free to Prime members, but that includes about two million songs, while the new service boasts a catalog of \"tens of millions\" of songs. \n \"Think of this as two different levels: Prime is now the introductory service and Unlimited is the full service,\" said Steve Boom, Amazon's vice president of digital music. \n The service's launch comes as the way people listen to music is changing. According to Nielsen , during the first half of 2016, digital purchasing of single tracks was down 24 percent and digital albums were down 18 percent, while streaming was up 59 percent, compared with the same period a year ago. \n \"The recorded music industry has been fumbling for a digital business model that really works, and I think streaming has come into its own,\" said eMarketer analyst Paul Verna. \n In fact, streaming of audio has eclipsed video streaming, according to Nielsen. Audio's share of streaming is 54 percent as of June 30, compared with 44 percent a year earlier. \n But it still faces the music industry's problem of low margins, Verna said. \n \"There is definitely room to grow the pie simply because more and more music consumers are choosing this way of accessing their music,\" he said. \"But the potential rewards are not huge and infinite, they're sort of modest and there are already quite a few players in the space.\" \n Most streaming services now offer similar catalogues of music and pricing is about the same. So services have differentiated by user interface, Verna said. \n One way Amazon is hoping to stand out is with its Alexa voice control, via the Echo or other Alexa-enabled devices. Users can ask the Echo to play a certain song or playlist, but can also search for music just by saying they want to hear the \"new\" song by any artist, a genre of music from a certain decade, or by saying the lyrics of a song if they can't remember the name. \n The service is available starting Wednesday in the U.S. and in the U.K., Germany and Austria this year. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Amazon launches for-pay streaming music service"}

{"date": "October 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former Albuquerque Detective Keith Sandy, left, and Officer Dominique Perez speak with attorneys during a preliminary hearing in Albuquerque, N.M. \n ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. >> A nearly three-week murder trial that scrutinized the shooting death of a homeless man by Albuquerque police fell short of settling the fates of the two former officers, with jurors saying they were deadlocked on second-degree murder charges against the men. \n Nine jurors wanted to acquit Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez in the March 2014 shooting that touched off protests in New Mexico's largest city, and three were holding out for a guilty verdict, leading Judge Alisa Hadfield to declare a mistrial Tuesday after more than two days of deliberations. \n \"These officers followed their training to a 'T',\" said defense attorney Sam Bregman. \"When cops follow their training they shouldn't be prosecuted for it.\" \n The case in Albuquerque marked a rare effort by prosecutors to bring murder charges against officers, coming at a time when police shootings have rocked cities nationwide. Sandy and Perez shot James Boyd near his Albuquerque campsite, with three bullets striking him in the arms and back at the end of an hourslong standoff. \n The trial's outcome means a decision on whether to retry the case will likely be in the hands of Raul Torrez, a Democrat and former federal prosecutor who is running unopposed for the district attorney position in Albuquerque. He said he would not make a decision on how to proceed until after a detailed review of evidence and consulting with the case's special prosecutor. \n He's expected in January to replace the outgoing district attorney, who was removed from the case because of a conflict of interest with police. \n \"This is an extremely important case for our community and we must not rush a decision about how best to proceed,\" Torrez said. \n Bregman said he hopes Torrez considers the jury split in favor of acquittal and decides to not pursue another trial, which would allow the two officers to get on with their lives. \n Sandy, a detective who took an early retirement after the shooting, collects a pension of more than $3,000 per month. He is 41. \n Perez, who is 35 and a former SWAT officer, was fired from the Albuquerque Police Department under a city policy after he was charged and is petitioning to get his job back. \n Both could have faced up to 15 years in prison for second-degree murder if they had been convicted. \n The mistrial in their case followed 12 days of testimony that included the two former officers taking the witness stand to defend their actions and prosecutors outlining a series of fateful moves by police that she says escalated the encounter before Boyd's death. \n The courtroom was silent as the judge announced the mistrial, and the defendants left court without making a comment. Albuquerque police union members were seen tapping other officers on the shoulder and hugging each other after the news. \n \"What is there left to say?\" said Luis Robles, the attorney for Perez. \"Two and a half weeks were devoted to an incident that spanned only three and a half hours. Of the twelve people who mattered, nine jurors agreed with our message.\" \n The defendants said they opened fire because Boyd had two pocket knives and they believed he posed a deadly threat to a K-9 handler who had lost control of his police service dog and chased the animal, bringing him within 10 feet of Boyd. \n Sandy and Perez were among 19 officers who swarmed a hillside where Boyd was camping illegally over the course of several hours on March 16, 2014. The camper had pulled a pair of pocket knives on the first two officers to respond to complaints about his presence several hundred feet behind an Albuquerque neighborhood, prompting them to call for help. \n By the time the standoff ended, officers had brought rifles and handguns, tactical gear, flash grenades, stun guns and K-9 units \u2014 a show of force that the prosecutor questioned throughout the trial. Sandy was blamed by the prosecution for taking a central role in decisions that escalated the encounter and agitated Boyd, including a move to interrupt a crisis intervention officer's negotiations aimed at trying to get him to abandon his knives. \n Sandy was a detective on a team responding to the Boyd encounter that came under harsh criticism soon after the fatal shooting by the federal investigators over what they found to be a \"culture of aggression\" within the Albuquerque Police Department. Known as the Repeat Offenders Project, Sandy's unit was dismantled after the Justice Department investigation and he retired. \n The shooting encapsulated the Albuquerque department's troubles in the past several years. The U.S. Justice Department investigated more than 20 deadly police shootings between 2010 and 2014, leading to court-ordered reforms that included a new use-of-force policy and SWAT and crisis intervention training. The department also was found to have poor policies and training for officers encountering suspects who are mentally ill. \n Defense attorneys argued the case was not about how police handled the encounter but whether Sandy and Perez were justified in shooting Boyd, saying they were at the mercy of decisions made by higher-ranking officers and a system that had made them into default mental health professionals. \n Special prosecutor Randi McGinn said she was not surprised that the 12-person jury was deadlocked, considering the shooting has divided the broader community in Albuquerque. She hopes the case leaves a lasting legacy, regardless of the next step. \n \"I think the discussion we have to have as a community is do we want Dirty Harry or do we want a peace officer,\" she said. \"I think we are beyond the Dirty Harry days.\" \n About two dozen activists arrived at the courthouse Tuesday to protest the mistrial, including one who carried a \"wanted\" poster for Sandy. They called for the case to be retried. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mistrial declared in Albuquerque police shooting trial"}

{"date": "October 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Hillary Clinton's campaign manager John Podesta, second from right, pauses while speaking with senior aide Huma Abedin aboard Clinton's campaign plane while traveling to Miami, Tuesday, Oct. 11, 2016, for a rally. \n WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. >> A top adviser to Hillary Clinton on Tuesday accused a longtime Donald Trump aide of receiving \"advance warning\" about WikiLeaks' plans to publish thousands of hacked emails and suggested the Republican candidate is aiding the unprecedented Russian interference in American politics. \n Clinton adviser John Podesta pointed the finger at Trump adviser Roger Stone, who he said has been in touch with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Podesta also raised as evidence an August tweet in which Stone said Podesta's \"time in the barrel\" was coming. The tweet was sent shortly after WikiLeaks published scores of hacked emails from other Democratic officials. \n \"I think it's a reasonable assumption, or at least a reasonable conclusion, that Mr. Stone and the Trump campaign had advance warning about what Assange was going to do,\" Podesta told reporters aboard the Clinton campaign plane. Podesta acknowledged the evidence was \"circumstantial.\" \n Stone, in an email to The Associated Press late Tuesday, called Podesta's assertion \"categorically false\" and \"without foundation.\" \n Podesta confirmed that the FBI is investigating the hack of his private email account as part of the ongoing probe in other Democratic Party hackings by groups with Russian ties. Last week, intelligence officials said they believe the individuals responsible are working for Russian intelligence and coordinating with Assange on the political hacking. \n Podesta said Russia's actions may be driven by Trump's policy positions, which he said are more in line with Russian foreign policy than U.S. foreign policy. But he also suggested the driving force could be \"Mr. Trump's deep engagement and ties with Russian interests in his business affairs.\" \n Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak dismissed the accusations as untrue. \n \"We are watching very carefully the election campaign in this country,\" Kislyak said Tuesday at a discussion of bilateral affairs at Johns Hopkins University's campus in Washington. \"We don't interfere (in) the internal affairs of the United States, neither by my statements nor by electronic or other means.\" \n Clinton has repeatedly accused her opponent as being soft on Russia, pointing to his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader, his suggestion that he would rethink sanctions against Russian officials, his sharp criticism of NATO and other policy positions. \n While Podesta didn't directly accuse Trump of assisting with Russia's meddling with American campaigns, he suggested Trump was either \"willfully ignoring\" intelligence officials' warnings about Russian government involvement or \"an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation.\" \n The Clinton campaign would not confirm the authenticity of Podesta's leaked emails, noting that Russian hackers often fabricate documents. \n \"The pattern is they hack, they leak truthful things, and then they build up to leaking documents that are either doctored or wholly fabricated,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director. \n Trump seized on the hacked emails at a rally Tuesday night in Florida, alleging the documents show that \"Clinton is the vessel (of) a corrupt global establishment that's raiding our country and surrounding the sovereignty of our nation.\" \n Also citing WikiLeaks, Trump said: \"The Department of Justice fed information to the Clinton campaign about the email investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up for her crimes. What is going on?\" \n In May 2015, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon alerted staffers that the Justice Department was proposing to publish Clinton's work-related emails by January in response to requests by news organizations. Fallon, a former Justice Department spokesman, wrote that unspecified \"DOJ folks\" told him there was a court hearing planned soon in the case. \n The dates of court hearings would have been publicly posted in advance on the court's docket. Fallon did not respond to a request for comment from AP. The Justice Department declined to discuss Fallon's email. \n Still, Trump said, \"This is collusion and corruption of the highest order and is one more reason why l will ask my attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor,\" following up on his debate threat to put Clinton in jail. \n WikiLeaks dropped the first batch of Podesta's emails shortly after news organizations released a video in which Trump is heard making sexually predatory comments about women. That video has deeply damaged Trump's campaign, leading several Republicans to revoke their support for the businessman. \n Podesta said Tuesday the timing of his emails' release was an \"awfully curious coincidence.\" \n \"Mr. Assange wanted to change the subject,\" Podesta said. \"He didn't succeed in doing that.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton adviser Podesta connects Trump campaign to WikiLeaks"}

{"date": "October 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Lisa Ladd, left, and her son, Corey, with his daughter, Charlee, at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in St. Gabriel, La. Ladd, who \u2014 because he had two prior drug arrests \u2014 is serving a 17-year sentence in Louisiana for possessing a half-ounce of marijuana. He has never seen Charlee outside prison; she's being raised by her grandmother. \n NEW YORK >> As Americans debate the expanding campaign to legalize marijuana, two of the nation's most prominent human rights organizations are urging a far bolder step \u2014 the decriminalization of possession and personal use of all illicit drugs. \n Human Rights Watch and the American Civil Liberties Union jointly issued the call Wednesday in a detailed report contending that enforcement of drug laws has unjustifiably ruined lives, torn families apart and fueled racial discrimination while failing to curtail rampant drug abuse in the U.S. \n \"Every 25 seconds someone is funneled into the criminal justice system, accused of nothing more than possessing drugs for personal use,\" said Tess Borden, the report's author. \"These wide-scale arrests have destroyed countless lives while doing nothing to help people who struggle with dependence.\" \n Borden acknowledged that broad decriminalization of drug use, whether by Congress or state-by-state, is unlikely in the near future. She hopes the report will spur action at the state and federal level to invest more funds in treatment programs and to reclassify drug use and possession as misdemeanors rather than felonies. \n Though four states have legalized recreational marijuana use, and five more will vote on that step next month, no state has decriminalized personal use of other common illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin. Possession of them is often classified as a felony. \n According to the new report, state law enforcement agencies make more than 1.25 million drug possession arrests per year \u2014 one of every nine arrests nationwide. Regarding racial disparities, the report said black adults use drugs at similar or even lower rates than white adults, yet are more than twice as likely to be arrested for possession. \n The report argues that the decades-long \"war on drugs\" has failed, with rates of drug abuse still high. It says criminalization of drugs tends to drive people who use them underground, making it less likely they will get treatment and more likely they will be at risk of disease and overdoses. \n However, Michael Ramos, district attorney of San Bernardino County in California, said decriminalization would pose \"huge dangers.\" \n He predicted that property crime would increase as drug users carried out thefts to maintain their habits. He also said rehabilitation programs would wither if drug abusers no longer had the threat of incarceration as an incentive to participate. \n \"Once you legalize all drugs, there's no motive for those people to get help,\" he said. \n However, Ramos acknowledged that most state prisons and jails should be doing a far better job of providing effective rehabilitation programs for convicted drug users. \n \"Right now, what we're doing is putting them in and turning the key,\" he said. \"There's not much help there.\" \n In compiling their report, Human Rights Watch and the ACLU said they interviewed 149 people prosecuted for using drugs in Louisiana, Texas, Florida and New York, 64 of them in custody. \n Among them was Corey Ladd, who \u2014 because he had two prior drug arrests \u2014 is serving a 17-year sentence in Louisiana for possessing a half-ounce of marijuana. He has a 4-year-old daughter who has never seen him outside prison; she's being raised by her grandmother. \n \"The sheer harshness of the sentence shocks the conscience,\" Louisiana's appeals court wrote in April, when it asked that Ladd be resentenced to a lesser term. But prosecutors held firm and appealed that ruling; Ladd's case is now headed to the state Supreme Court. \n Ladd's public defender, Kenneth Hardin, said Louisiana's highest-in-the-nation incarceration rate stems directly from its hardline approach to drug abusers. \n \"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result,\" he said. \"We've been throwing these drug users in jail. Has that made the streets feel safer? Has that changed the crime rate?\" \n Mario Moreno, spokesman for the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said the Obama administration favors a balanced approach that would divert non-violent drug offenders into treatment programs rather than prisons. \n \"We cannot arrest our way out of the drug problem,\" he said in an email. \n One such diversion program is being launched in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by Rob Reardon, a former director of corrections in nearby Lafayette Parish. \n \"If we're able to engage with these people before entanglement with the criminal justice system, everybody's a winner,\" he said. \"Some people have to go to jail because they are dangerous \u2014 but the vast majority are there because they're poor decision-makers.\" \n In Western Europe, many countries have adopted approaches to drug abuse that are less punitive than in America. Portugal has gone the furthest, deciding in 2001 to decriminalize the acquisition, use and possession of illicit drugs in quantities up to a 10-day supply. Rather than facing prosecution, drug abusers are likely to be referred to treatment programs. \n According to various evaluations, including a United Nations study, the policy has been a success, lowering the number of overdose fatalities, encouraging more people to seek treatment, and reducing the financial toll of drug abuse. \n However, Steven Belenko a professor of criminal justice at Temple University, noted that the U.S. differs dramatically from Portugal, where there was a consensus in favor of decriminalization that spanned much of the political spectrum and extended to law enforcement agencies. \n \"We don't have a consensus,\" said Belenko, though he suggested that an increasing number of Americans were questioning the efficacy of a punitive approach to drug abuse. \n \"We've got to see it more as public health problem, not as a crime problem,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Major rights groups: Decriminalize use of all illicit drugs"}

The Hawaii Department of Agriculture was notified at approximately 5:45 a.m. \n It took Aloha Air Cargo employees and customers, Hawaiian Airlines Cargo employees, a field crew of the Kauai Invasive Species Committee and agriculture department personnel to capture the mongoose at 8:15 a.m. \n Collaboration really made the capture successful, said Rachel Smith, outreach specialist of the Kauai Invasive Species Committee. \"If we didn't have anyone report it, we wouldn't have known about it.\" \n The animal, determined to be a juvenile, was euthanized in accordance with standards established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. \n It was the first live mongoose captured on Kauai since 2012, when one was found at Young Brothers' port at Nawiliwili Harbor and the another at Marriot's Kauai Lagoons resort in Lihue. \n The Kauai Invasive Species Committee said both Kauai and Lanai are the only islands without known breeding mongoose populations, which pose a threat to native and endangered ground nesting birds. \n The weasel-like mongoose is native to India \u2014 introduced to Hawaii island, Maui, Molokai and Oahu in 1883 by the sugar industry to control rats in sugarcane fields.

The delivery marked the first time the neighborhood had received any help since Hurricane Matthew hit on Oct. 4. \n \"Life is completely destroyed here,\" Cambry said. \"It will take 20 years to get it all back.\" \n Haitians helped each other regain some semblance of their pre-hurricane lives as they awaited the arrival of more aid. \n A community group that formed in the southern coastal village of Les Anglais cleared tree limbs from streets and placed them into piles while others gathered scraps of wood to start rebuilding homes. \n Meanwhile, more than a dozen people gathered inside a neighbor's general store in the western coastal town of Anse-d'Hainault that was serving as a makeshift shelter. The store had a small generator that provided a little light and power to charge phones. \n \"We're looking out for each other,\" said Walna Gevere, who traveled to her hometown from the capital of Port-au-Prince to be with her family. \n Those who survived the storm have faced great challenges, including going days without food. The prices of bottled water, bleach and other vital items have jumped by as much as 25 percent amid worsening shortages. \n Elancie Moise, an agronomist and director for the Department of Agriculture in southern Haiti, said between 80 and 100 percent of crops have been lost across the southern peninsula. \n \"Crisis is not the word to describe it,\" he said. \"You need a stronger word. It is much worse. There is no food for people to eat.\" \n In addition, there have been reports of assaults on women gathered in shelters, said Yolette Etienne, director for the U.K.-based group ActionAid in Haiti. \n She traveled to the department of Grand-Anse in Haiti's southwest peninsula to assess the damage when she was told about the assaults. \n \"Fortunately, the women organized themselves to capture the men and call the police,\" she said, adding that shelters are taking more preventive measures. \n The United Nations has called for $120 million in aid, noting that about 750,000 people in southwest Haiti alone will need \"life-saving assistance and protection\" in the next three months. Overall, at least 1.4 million people need assistance, the U.N. said. \n Meanwhile, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says the storm's impact has put on hold a new policy of deporting Haitians in the United States without permission, but the government intends to resume it in the future. He said U.S. officials will have to \"be sympathetic to the plight of the people of Haiti as a result.\" But after conditions change, \"we intend to resume the policy.\" \n The National Civil Protection headquarters in Port-au-Prince raised the official nationwide death toll to 473, which included at least 244 deaths in Grand-Anse. But local officials have said the toll in Grand-Anse alone tops 500. \n Concern also was growing about an increase in cases of cholera, which has already killed roughly 10,000 people and sickened more than 800,000 since 2010. \n The World Health Organization pledged to send 1 million doses of cholera vaccine to Haiti, where water and sanitation infrastructure has been severely damaged. Sandra Honore, the U.N. envoy for Haiti, said the health impact of Hurricane Matthew \"cannot be overestimated.\" \n Cholera cases were rising in towns such as Anse-d'Hainault, where 2-year-old Dabens Desrosiers received rehydration fluid from an IV. \n \"Daddy, take me home,\" he repeatedly murmured to his father, 31-year-old Gerson Desrosiers. \n After three days of treatment, the boy was about to be discharged, but there was no home to return as the family's wooden shack was flattened by Hurricane Matthew. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Haitians rebuild lives as food, water, supplies arrive"}

Some 250 communities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 19 tribal nations have their own \"My Brother's Keeper\" programs, the White House said. \n Before leaving Washington, the White House announced that Sprint Corp. will do its part to help close the digital divide by providing free tablets, smartphones and other mobile devices, along with four years of service, to 1 million low-income, high-school students who can't get on the internet at home. \n Obama also praised the value of the nation's historically black colleges and universities during the forum, which was taped at North Carolina A&T State University, an HBCU with a highly regarded engineering program. The event was hosted by \"The Undefeated,\" an ESPN website that explores the intersection of race, sports and culture. ESPN broadcast the forum Tuesday night. \n Obama pushed back against the notion that his administration has been insufficiently supportive of historically black colleges, which are under enormous financial pressure. \n He called HBCUs a \"foundation stone\" for building the black middle class and black wealth, and said he had increased federal funding to them to $4 billion annually. Obama said these schools are facing difficult financial decisions, as are non-HBCUs, because states are cutting funding for higher education. \n The president urged students worried about the cost of a college education to vote. \"If you don't vote, then you will not have any say in the decisions that are made in state capitals or in Congress about the kind of support that you receive,\" he said. \"You don't have to be an engineering major to figure out the math on this one.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama: 'My Brother's Keeper' will benefit U.S. economy"}

Samsung is asking owners of its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 to do something crazy: \"power down and stop using the device.\" \n In an age when smartphones have become extensions of ourselves, the last thing we look at before falling asleep and the first thing we grab in the morning, this is all but unthinkable, even at the dinner table, even on the toilet. \n Risking a battery fire might seem like a small price to pay for obsessively checking your latest Instagram \"likes,\" catching up on email, Skyping your grandkids across the country, getting directions, confirming your travel itinerary, reading the news, searching for a dinner recipe, hailing a ride and so on. \n For those traveling with children, a long flight without a smartphone to serve as distraction is akin to torture. \n Power down and stop using the device? You might as well go live in a cave in a distant mountain (if you can get there, since you no longer have GPS). According to the Pew Research Center, 43 percent of the world's population uses a smartphone. Rates are highest in places such as South Korea (88 percent), Australia (77 percent) and Israel (74 percent). \n And use it they do. We check Facebook so often that the company no longer just measures its users on a monthly basis. A more important number is how many people check in on a daily basis. In June, more than 1 billion people checked Facebook on a mobile device at least once a day. \n In a report on global mobile device usage, the consulting firm Deloitte found the obvious, namely that \"device obsession is deepening\" and that people are using their phones for \"everything from watching TV to simply crossing the road.\" Some of us even use the phones while crossing the road, which is not the safest thing in the world. \n A small 2015 study by Nottingham Trent University that tracked 18- to 33-year-olds found that they checked their phones an average of 85 times a day \u2014 often without realizing. \n Entire industries have sprung up to try to pry us away from our gadgets, such as phone-free summer camps for adults, anti-texting-and-driving apps and apps that track how much time you spend on your phone. \n As such, it's not surprising that smartphone owners suddenly deprived of this extra limb are finding ways around the inconvenience. \n \"I am currently using my tablet that has AT&T number sync.

Trump looked on during a rally at Mohegan Sun Arena in Wilkes-Barre Twp., Pa. on Monday. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb The \"shackles\" gone, Donald Trump stepped up his fierce attacks on his own party leaders today, promising to teach Republicans who oppose him a lesson and fight for the presidency \"the way I want to.\" \n Exactly four weeks before Election Day and with his campaign floundering, the businessman reverted to the combative, divisive strategy that propelled him to victory in the GOP primary: Attack every critic \u2014 including fellow Republicans. Those close to Trump suggested it was \"open season\" on every detractor, regardless of party. \n \"It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to,\" Trump said in a tweet that brought new concern \u2014 near panic in some cases \u2014 to a party trying to stave off an all-out civil war before Nov, 8. \n In another series of tweets, the Republican nominee called House Speaker Paul Ryan \"weak and ineffective,\" Sen. John McCain \"very foul-mouthed\" and \"disloyal\" Republicans \"far more difficult than Crooked Hillary.\" \n \"They come at you from all sides,\" Trump declared. \"They don't know how to win \u2014 I will teach them!\" \n Rage against fellow Republicans from the face of the 2016 GOP exposed a party slipping from mere feuding into verbal warfare with advance voting already underway in roughly half the states. Polls suggest Trump is headed toward a loss of historic proportions if he doesn't turn things around. \n His scorched-earth approach, days after his sexual predatory language caught on tape triggered a mass Republican defection, threatened to alienate even more supporters. \n \"Fighting for the sake of fighting is not really very helpful,\" said former Trump adviser Barry Bennett. \n Trump has acknowledged the possibility of defeat in recent days, but today he tried to shift the blame for his struggles on Republican defections and an election system that may be \"rigged\" against him. On Monday, he warned of potential voter fraud in heavily African-American Philadelphia, a claim for which there is no evidence but one that could challenge Americans' faith in a fair democratic process. \n At the same time, Trump's campaign is considering whether to feature Bill Clinton accusers at his upcoming rallies. Trump shocked the political world before Sunday's debate by appearing with several women who had accused the former president of sexual impropriety decades earlier. \n The aggressive shift is in line with the philosophy of recently hired campaign official \n Steve Bannon, whose conservative website has long fueled attacks on Republican leaders and perpetuated popular conservative conspiracy theories. Bannon is now leading the campaign's messaging. \n The approach has done little to endear Trump to anxious party leaders. At least 40 Republican senators and congressmen have revoked their support for the embattled Republican nominee \u2014 with nearly 30 of them urging him to quit the race altogether. \n Republican Speaker Ryan, in a Monday conference call with congressional Republicans, said he would no longer campaign with Trump. He said he would focus instead on ensuring Clinton doesn't get a \"blank check\" with a Democratic-controlled Congress, all but conceding that Trump would lose the presidential contest. \n Yet Trump's aggressive shift is popular among his most loyal supporters who continue to flock to his rallies by the thousands. \n \"He's fighting for us,\" said Megan Johnston, 54, who was among an estimated 2,000 people who packed into a high school gym to see him on Monday near Pittsburgh. She shrugged off his sexually aggressive comments in the 2005 video and pointed at Democrat Hillary Clinton's shortcomings. \n \"He said what he said and he apologized. She should be in jail,\" Johnston said. \n While Trump devoted much of his fire to fellow Republicans today, he did not ignore his Democratic opponent. \n His campaign released a new ad that focuses on Clinton's recent bout with pneumonia. The ad features images of masked gunmen and nuclear weapons as a sick Clinton stumbles toward a vehicle. \n \"Hillary Clinton doesn't have the fortitude, strength or stamina to lead in our world,\" the narrator declares. \n Meanwhile, Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee declared that hacked emails released by WikiLeaks today showed collusion between the Clinton campaign and the Department of Justice during an investigation into the former secretary of state's email server. \n The evidence does indicate there was communication between the two about a court hearing date. But such dates are not inside information. They would have been publicly posted in advance on the court's docket. \n The emails show that in May 2015, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon alerted other staffers that the Justice Department was proposing to publish Clinton's work-related emails by January in response to requests by news organizations. Fallon, a former Justice Department spokesman, wrote that unspecified \"DOJ folks\" told him there was a court hearing planned soon in the case. \n The name and email address of the person who shared the information with Fallon had been deleted. \n As some Republicans fought to focus Trump's anger on Democrats, another longtime Trump ally openly considered walking away. \n New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he was still grappling with Trump's comments from the video, calling them \"indefensible.\" He said he still supported Trump \"at this point\" but was thinking about that. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Unshackled Trump unleashes aggressive attacks on own party"}

{"date": "October 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former Vice President Al Gore was interviewed in Nov. 2015 in Nashville, Tenn. Gore, a longtime environmental activist, will join the Democratic presidential candidate at a rally in Miami today. \n DES MOINES, Iowa \u00bb Hillary Clinton is bringing in Al Gore as her closer on climate change as she struggles to appeal to young voters who consider the issue a priority. \n Vice president during her husband's eight years in the White House and a longtime environmental activist, Gore will join the Democratic presidential candidate at a rally in Miami today. During the event, Clinton will emphasizing her plans to develop more clean energy, reduce fossil fuel production and build more weather-resistant infrastructure. She will also continue her attacks on Republican Donald Trump. \n Speaking at Ohio State University Monday night, Clinton said: \"I'm running against somebody who doesn't believe in climate change or at least he says he doesn't, who has even said he thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese.\" \n During the primary contest against progressive Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton offered clean energy plans and came out against the Keystone XL Pipeline, which is opposed by environmentalists. \n \"Climate change is one of the issues where the difference between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is night and day,\" said Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon. \"For many of the core supporters we are seeking to galvanize in the remaining weeks of the campaign, including young voters, communicating the boldness of her plan is important.\" \n Trump has repeatedly questioned climate change and said he plans to \"renegotiate\" the Paris Climate Agreement, an international treaty designed to curb the rise in global temperatures. \n The world is on pace for the hottest year on record, breaking marks set in 2015, 2014, and 2010. It is about 1.8 degrees warmer than a century ago. Scientists have also connected man-made climate change to deadly heat waves, droughts and flood-inducing downpours. \n Gore explored global warming in his 2006 documentary, \"An Inconvenient Truth.\" \n Advocacy group NextGen Climate, founded by billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, is backing Clinton and has put $25 million into a millennial outreach program. Their surveys of young people showed that early in the summer, many did not see a difference between Clinton and Trump on climate, but as they learned more, they moved toward Clinton. \n \"We've seen throughout this campaign that climate change is an issue that millennials care about deeply,\" said NextGen's political director Heather Hargreaves. \n Despite Clinton's promotion of energy policies aimed at lessening climate change, there has not always been unanimity among her campaign aides about how strong that support should be. A message released today by Wikileaks from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's hacked email account shows some aides were not totally on board with Clinton's promise in June 2015 to raise fees on companies involved in oil exploration and fossil fuel production on federal land. \n Clinton had broached the idea in her campaign launch speech in June 2015, but raising energy royalties could be politically explosive in western states where oil and gas firms have spent billions of dollars on extracting fuels. \n In July 2015, campaign speechwriting director Dan Schwerin told Podesta in an email that \"I think we're going to have to make peace with our fossil fuels royalties, since she's already promised that.\" \n On July 15, 2015, Clinton said she wanted to raise fees and phase out fuel extraction operating on public lands, but warned it could not be done quickly because \"we still have to run our economy, we still have to turn on the lights.\" \n The leaked emails also show a discussion on how Clinton could show her opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline. Wrote Schwerin on August 7, 2015: \"We are trying to find a good way to leak her opposition to the pipeline without her having to actually say it and give up her principled stand about not second-guessing the president in public.\" \n Clinton announced her opposition during a town hall in Iowa the following month, in response to a question from the audience. \n Stephen Braun and Bradley Klapper in Washington contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton brings in Gore as closer on climate change"}

{"date": "October 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Marines from the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade and their Philippine counterpart saluted at the closing ceremony of the 33rd joint US-Philippines amphibious landing exercises dubbed PHIBLEX at the marine corps in suburban Taguig city, east of Manila, Tuesday. The Philippine president says he will not abrogate a defense treaty with the United States but is questioning its importance and that of joint combat exercises, which he says only benefit America. \n MANILA \u00bb Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Tuesday he will not abrogate a defense treaty with the United States but questioned its importance and that of joint combat exercises, which he says only benefit America. \n Duterte pressed his criticism of the United States and his country's engagement with the American military in a speech as U.S. Marines and their Philippine counterparts ended combat drills a day early in a separate ceremony. A U.S. general, in contrast, underscored the need for the joint drills to brace for potential crises. \n Duterte, who labels himself a socialist, has had an uneasy relationship with the U.S. and a falling out with President Barack Obama, whom he has lambasted for criticizing his deadly anti-drug fight. Despite his constant anti-U.S. pronouncements, Duterte said he would not abrogate the mutual defense treaty with the U.S. but questioned the need for it. \n \"I do not mean to cancel or abrogate the military alliances,\" Duterte said in a speech before new government officials at the presidential palace. \"But let me ask you \u2026 do you really think we need it?\" \n He did not clearly specify his reason for questioning the treaty alliance but said if a conflict pitting the world's most powerful nations breaks out, \"there will be no more American aid to talk of.\" He added that when Russia annexed Crimea, \"America wasn't able to do anything.\" \n Duterte has announced he will end the joint combat exercises, which China has opposed. His defense secretary, Delfin Lorenzana, said he has asked Duterte for a reconsideration, and has explained to the president the importance of the approximately 28 annual joint military exercises, including three major ones that involve thousands of troops, in preparing for natural disasters and other contingencies. U.S. military officials want to continue the joint maneuvers, Lorenzana said Friday. \n Duterte, however, has remained criticial, saying Tuesday that U.S. troops take back with them the high-tech and powerful weapons after each drill. \"So what's the point?\" he asked. \"They're the ones who benefited, they're the ones who learned but we got nothing.\" \n In Washington, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia said Tuesday the U.S. will honor its commitments to the Philippines and expects its Southeast Asian ally to do the same. \n Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel said the U.S. values the relationship and wants to keep it on an \"even keel.\" \n \"We're prepared, as we always have been, to honor our commitments and the obligations that we have to the Philippines and we expect the same in return,\" Russel said at an event held by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. \n Russel said the U.S. has no problem with the Philippines discussing its territorial and maritime disputes with China if it is done on terms acceptable to the Philippines and consistent with international law. \n That was an apparent reference to a July ruling by an international tribunal in a case brought by the previous Philippine government that found that China's sweeping claims to most the South China Sea on historical grounds were invalid under a U.N. treaty. \n The joint drills that ended Tuesday in an austere ceremony were held in an air of uncertainty because of Duterte's warning that they would be the last under his rule. \n U.S. Marine Brig. Gen. John Jansen said the drills underscored the depth of the U.S.-Philippine alliance \"and the commitment to be there when it counts,\" adding both countries benefited from the exercises. \n \"It makes us all better,\" Jansen said. \"\"It not only makes us better but more capable and effective as an integrated force that provides a capability that we might apply to our treaty obligations in the future, whether it be in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, assistance in internal security, or in other types of crisis.\" \n A Philippine military spokesman for the exercises, Col. Ariel Caculitan, said the maneuvers ended a day early because of adjustments resulting from stormy weather forecasts, among other reasons, and had no connection with Duterte's criticism of the drills. \n Associated Press writer Matthew Pennington in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Duterte on U.S. alliance: 'Do you really think we need it?'"}
