He wanted to gun down police officers because they wore the uniform.\" \n He termed the attack an ambush and said the officers \"walked into a trap.\" The killings are the latest in a string of fatal attacks on officers that includes ambushes in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. \n Felix faces special-circumstance allegations of murder of a police officer in the line of duty, multiple murders and lying in wait, which qualify him for the death penalty, Hestrin said.

While she got many belongings out, they couldn't move everything \u2014 a bicycle is chained to a back deck surrounded by water. \n \"I cry and pray. There's nothing else to do,\" said Van Beveren, who is staying with friends. \"We keep coming up here every hour. And every hour it's worse.\" \n Such is the vigil many are keeping on Van Beveren's side of Willow Street, which runs parallel to the Tar River and has largely served as a boundary between those who evacuated and those who stayed. The leafy neighborhood \u2014 one of many around North Carolina to suffer flooding after Hurricane Matthew \u2014 includes one-story homes and small apartment buildings that house a mix of families and students from nearby East Carolina University. \n North of Willow, houses and apartments were filling up with water even before the river was expected to crest Thursday. The flooding triggered by heavy rain from Matthew \u2014 which killed more than 500 people in Haiti \u2014 has left at least 35 dead in the U.S. \n South of the street \u2014 and uphill from the river \u2014 homeowners expect their houses to be dry, and most stayed despite a mandatory evacuation. \n \"People that are staying are pretty comfortable because a lot of us were here for Floyd, and we know what's coming,\" said John Benson. He lives on a street that crosses Willow just uphill from a Dead End sign that marked the edge of the floodwaters from Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The Tar River isn't expected to get as high this time. \n Joe Davis owns houses on another street that crosses Willow, including a rental property where waist-deep water lapped at the foundation Wednesday. \n He watched a worker use duct tape and sheets of plastic to seal crawl space vents after placing sandbags at the doors. \n \"This is my first time doing this, so we'll see how this works,\" said Davis, who bought the rental house several months ago. \n Wearing duck-hunting waders, Andrew Brauns strode through the murky water after working on Davis's rental house.

A 22-year-old Syrian man arrested in Germany for a suspected Islamic extremist bomb plot killed himself Wednesday in a prison cell in Leipzig, Saxony's state Justice Ministry said late Wednesday. \n BERLIN >> German officials demanded answers Thursday after a 22-year-old Syrian man suspected of planning an Islamic extremist bombing attack was able to take his own life in his jail cell despite indications he might be a suicide risk. \n Germany's top security official, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, said Jaber Albakr's death would make the investigation into whether he had accomplices in the thwarted plot far more difficult. \n \"What happened last night demands a very quick and comprehensive explanation,\" he said on ZDF public television. \n Albakr's public defender, Dresden attorney Alexander Huebner, told Focus magazine that the Leipzig prison was aware that his client was a risk to kill himself. \n \"I'm unbelievably shocked and absolutely speechless that something like this could have happened,\" he said. Huebner did not immediately return calls seeking further details. \n Albakr killed himself in his cell Wednesday evening, Saxony Justice Ministry spokesman Joerg Herold told The Associated Press. \n The German press widely reported that the suspect was able to hang himself, but Herold would not confirm further details.

Casinos in New Jersey will be the first to see new skills-based slot machines after the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement approved the new machines. \n ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. >> New Jersey gambling regulators have approved a New York firm to become the first in the United States to deploy skill-based slot machines on casino floors in which payout is determined by the player's ability.  \n The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement gave approval late Wednesday night to GameCo, Inc. to deploy its machines at three Atlantic City casinos owned by Caesars Entertainment. The machines could start being installed as soon as Monday at Harrah's, Caesars or Bally's. \n The machines, called VGMs, are expected to undergo several weeks of testing, and are expected to usher in a new era of gambling aimed at attracting young people who grew up playing video games. \n \"With this approval from the DGE, the VGM is officially the first skill-based video game gambling product approved by any U.S. gaming jurisdiction regulator,\" said Blaine Graboyes, the company's CEO and co-founder. \n The company has been in a race with rival firm Gamblit, which last month announced plans to put similar machines in California and Nevada in October, also at Caesars-owned casinos. Other manufacturers working on similar products include IGT and NanoTech Gaming. \n The machines are aimed squarely at millennials and those who like playing games on social media networks or on their phones, and who may be less inclined to play traditional push-button slot machines. \n Titled \"Danger Arena,\" the games give the player a brief tutorial, make sure the customer knows how to use the controls and that they are working properly, and then presents the customer with a map, or game scenario. This scenario will vary randomly, and constitutes the element of chance or randomness that is the hallmark of traditional slot machines. It is then up to the player to maneuver through the playing field in 45-to-90-second increments. \n Each game also includes a secondary random winning opportunity, with a possible instant cash win ranging from $1 to $5,000, Graboyes added, so that even poorly skilled players have a chance at winning, he said. \n GameCo plans to deploy three triple-unit carousels at Caesars, two at Harrah's and two at Bally's, with a total of 21 playing stations. It plans to expand them to additional states within the next six months. \n The company was licensed in Atlantic City through the Division of Gaming Enforcement's New Jersey First program, which speeds approvals for new gambling products if they are introduced first in the resort town. \n \"We have been at the forefront of encouraging innovation, and are pleased that the efforts of GameCo and division staff have culminated in this skill-based video game becoming available in Atlantic City before any other jurisdiction in the United States,\" said David Rebuck, director of the gaming enforcement division. \n Gamblit plans to debut its machines at Harrah's Rincon in southern California. After field trials, Caesars Entertainment anticipates putting machines with 125 Gamblit gambling positions into multiple Nevada casinos, and intends to put 100 more positions into additional markets in early 2017. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Gambling regulators OK skill-based slots"}

{"date": "October 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A Honolulu Fish Auction worker received fish from a U.S. fishing vessel crewed by foreign fishermen at Pier 38 in Honolulu on March 23. A single yellowfin tuna can fetch more than $1,000, and vendors market the catch as \"sustainable seafood produced by Hawaii's hard-working fishermen.\" \n A group of Hawaii residents want to change local rules for issuing commercial fishing licenses and make the process more transparent after an Associated Press investigation found that hundreds of undocumented fishermen work in the fleet. \n A federal loophole allows the foreign men to work but exempts them from most basic labor protections, and some residents are concerned that state rules offer little transparency and leave workers in the dark. \n State and federal lawmakers promised to improve conditions for the foreign crews, and at least one company stopped buying fish from the boats immediately following the AP investigation. \n The petition asks for rule changes that include certifying that license applicants understand and have read the paperwork they are signing, but a state agency recommends the changes not be implemented. \n The foreign fishermen who work in the fleet often do not read, write or understand English and therefore cannot legitimately agree to terms of the license, petitioners said Wednesday. \n In a document signed by Bruce Anderson, the administrator for the Division of Aquatic Resources, the department recommends denying the rule changes because the petition focuses on labor issues that are outside the department's jurisdiction. \n \"We believe that a requirement that the applicant certify the he or she understands the application, or alternatively, certification from a person assisting the applicant the he or she has read the application and translated its terms to the applicant, is unnecessary,\" the document said. \"The applicant would be required to comply with all terms and condition of a commercial marine license.\" \n \"It is absurd that DLNR will grant a fishing license in the expectation that the applicant will observe its terms and conditions when the applicant may never have seen or read the original application,\" said Oahu resident Larry Geller in a statement emailed Wednesday. Geller was among a group to sign the petition. \n \"Aside from the language issues, the applications are filed by the ships captains and not by the applicant, under current rules. If the DLNR is interested in compliance, it needs to change its inadequate rules,\" he added. \n Over six months, The Associated Press obtained confidential contracts, reviewed dozens of business records and interviewed boat owners, brokers and more than 50 fishermen in Hawaii, Indonesia and San Francisco. The investigation found men living in squalor on some boats, forced to use buckets instead of toilets, suffering running sores from bed bugs and sometimes lacking sufficient food. It also revealed instances of human trafficking. \n The report was part of the AP's ongoing global look at labor abuses in the fishing industry, stretching from Southeast Asia to America's own waters. Last year, the AP reported on fishermen locked in a cage and others buried under fake names on the remote Indonesian island village of Benjina. Their catch was traced to the United States, leading to more than 2,000 slaves being freed. But thousands more remain trapped worldwide in a murky industry where work takes place far from shore and often without oversight. \n Another of the petitioners, Kathryn Xian, who runs the nonprofit Pacific Alliance to Stop Slavery, told The Associated Press Wednesday that the petition is not asking for the department to consider labor issues. \n \"We are basically trying to lay a foundation for future steps to be made in the licensing process to make it more transparent,\" Xian said. \"What the DLNR fails to understand is that the process by which these undocumented workers 'are assigned' fishing licenses is problematic and possibly unlawful,\" Xian said in a statement. \n The Board of Land and Natural Resources, which will make the final decision, will hold a meeting on Friday that will address the issue. \n The Department of Land and Natural Resources, which oversees the various departments, told the AP on Wednesday that it will not comment on the issue until the board has heard arguments from the public and has made its decision. \n Federal officials, including Customs and Border Protection, Homeland Security, the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration plan to hold a meeting with vessel owners later this month to address questions about the foreign workers. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "State agency opposes rule change for foreign fishermen"}

{"date": "October 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Buddhist nun and musician Ani Choying Drolma, center, performs during a concert in Mumbai, India. She is one Buddhist nun everyone in Nepal knows by name, not because she's a religious icon and a UNICEF goodwill ambassador, nor for her work running a girl's school and a hospital for kidney patients but because she is one of the country's biggest pop stars. \n KATHMANDU, Nepal >> There is one Buddhist nun everyone in Nepal knows by name \u2014 not because she's a religious icon and a UNICEF goodwill ambassador, nor for her work running a girl's school and a hospital for kidney patients. \n Ani Choying Drolma is famous as one of the country's biggest pop stars. \n With more than 12 albums of melodious Nepali tunes and Tibetan hymns that highlight themes of peace and harmony, the songstress in saffron robes has won hearts across the Himalayan nation and abroad. \n \"I am totally against the conservative, conventional idea of a Buddhist nun,\" the 45-year-old nun said. Some people \"think a Buddhist nun should be someone who does not come out in the media so much, who is isolated \u2026 always in a monastery, always shy. But I don't believe in that.\" \n Neither do her fans, who greet her with a roar of applause whenever she walks out on stage, and fall silent as she closes her eyes to sing. \n \"Every time I get frustrated with life or get angry, I just listen to Ani's music and I calm down,\" said one fan, Sunil Tuladhar. \"She is my music goddess.\" \n But with a career deviating sharply from what conservatives in Nepal believe to be the proper path of a Buddhist, she's caught criticism as well. One Buddhist monk at the famed Swayambhu Shrine questioned how she can reconcile the simple life of a religious ascetic with the fame and wealth she's amassed over her two-decade musical career. \n \"How can a nun be making money by selling her voice, living a luxurious life and yet claim she is a nun?\" Surya Shakya asked. \n Despite her fame, Drolma looks every bit the typical Nepalese Buddhist nun, with her hair shaved short and an ever-present smile. She travels the world giving concerts in countries including the United States, Brazil, China and India. \n Popular composer Nhyoo Bajracharya, who has worked with Drolma, describes her music as a fusion of traditional Tibetan and Nepali styles. \"They are religious songs, slow rock with flavors of blues and jazz combined,\" he said. \n But Drolma believes her singing goes beyond delivering a catchy tune. Her 2004 hit \"Phoolko Aankhama,\" which means \"Eyes of the Flower\" in the Nepali language, features lyrics that touch on religious teachings: \"May my heart always be pure/May my words be always word of wisdom/May the sole of my feet never kill an insect.\" \n Her singing offers listeners a way to practice meditation and \"is about invoking a spiritual quality,\" she said in a recent interview with the Associated Press. \"That is what I rejoice in.\" \n She refused to say how much money she has earned from album sales and concerts, but said she donates much of it to education charities through her Nun's Welfare Foundation and runs a kidney hospital. \n Still, compared with most Nepalese living in this impoverished mountain nation, Drolma lives like a rock star \u2014 with a luxury car and a new home in an upscale neighborhood of the capital of Kathmandu. \n \"It is a very conservative point of view thinking that a nun should be poor and wearing rags. That's a wrong attitude,\" she said. \"My concerts make very good money, my CD sales make very good money, and I think that helps me to afford such comfortable life.\" \n Drolma said she was 13 when her mother allowed her to join the Nagi Gompa nunnery to escape from an abusive father. She also dreaded getting married, as she would likely have been forced to do as it was the custom in Nepal at the time. \n \"I had the impression that getting married was the worst thing to do in life,\" she said. \n At the nunnery, just north of Kathmandu, she learned to chant the Buddhist scriptures. But while most recited the lines quickly, she stood out \u2014 chanting melodiously and drawing the other nuns' admiration. \n In 1994, American musician Steve Tibbetts visited the nunnery and, being impressed with her voice, recorded her singing. He returned after receiving interest from U.S. record companies, and recorded Drolma's first album, \"Cho,\" released in 1997. \n The album royalties and performance fees that came after left Drolma a bit stunned. Most Nepalese have humble lives, with a quarter of the country's 28 million people living in poverty and heavily reliant on subsistence farming and remittances from family members working abroad. \n \"The question was, what do I do with the money?\" she said. \"I realized that this money can help me fulfill my dream, so that is how I started the school.\" \n She set up an educational foundation and opened the Arya Tara school, on a mountainside just south of Kathmandu. The boarding school offers about 80 girls, aged about 5 to 18, free lessons in Buddhist scripture as well as math, science and computer skills. The foundation also covers the cost of sending the girls to college. \n The students, similarly clad in saffron robes, giggle and smile when talking about Drolma. \n \"Ani is more than my mother. My mother gave me birth, but Ani raised me, gave me education, took care of me and is the only reason that I have reached this far,\" said 17-year-old Dolma Lhamu, who is now enrolled in college. \n Drolma is similarly adored at the kidney hospital she runs in Kathmandu, where hundreds of patients receive free dialysis twice a week. \n She said it's her work at the hospital and school that keep her singing and accepting invitations to perform. For the critics who question her globe-trotting lifestyle or high income, she has little patience. \n \"People in society will have different opinions,\" she said. \"I try my best to see how I can improve my attitude toward life, toward people and toward the world, and to find ways to make the best use of my life. \n \"I am famous today, but tomorrow people will not know me. It fades away. That is the reality,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Nepal's most popular Buddhist nun is a musical rock star"}

The Arizona men, who also once owned the Phoenix New Times alternative weekly, are Backpage.com's controlling shareholders, said California Attorney General Kamala Harris, whose office filed the charges. \n The three briefly appeared in a courtroom cage, dressed in orange jail uniforms. A bail hearing was set for Thursday. \n The site advertises a wide range of services, but Harris charged that more than 90 percent of its revenue \u2014 amounting to millions of dollars each month \u2014 comes from adult escort ads that use coded language and nearly nude photos to offer sex for money. Court documents say affiliated sites including EvilEmpire.com and BigCity.com expanded Backpage.com's share of online sex marketing. \n By charging for the ads, Harris alleges the three men violated the state's law against pimping, defined as making money off prostitutes or soliciting customers for prostitution. Some of the ads involve children under the age of 18, court documents say. \n \"Four courts have held they're protected by the First Amendment. We've won that issue over and over again,\" another defense attorney, Jim Grant, said in an interview. \n The three men will make that argument against the California charges at a hearing Nov. 16. \n \"The merits of the case will be litigated in court,\" Harris spokeswoman Kristin Ford responded. \n The California complaint says that rather than simply being a conduit for ads created by others, Backpage.com's rules and screening process essentially coached advertisers in how to advertise commercial sex. \n The Washington state Supreme Court similarly ruled last year that the company didn't just host the ads, but helped develop the content. That ruling allowed a civil lawsuit to continue by three minors who attorneys said were in the seventh and ninth grades when adult professional sex traffickers used Backpage to sell them as prostitutes. \n Larkin and Lacey face a maximum of six years if convicted, while the charges against Ferrer could bring him nearly 22 years in prison. \n Ferrer was arrested last week after arriving in Houston on a flight from Amsterdam. Backpage.com is a Dutch-owned limited liability corporation. The Dallas headquarters for Backpage was raided by authorities at the same time, and Texas' attorney general added money laundering to the list of alleged crimes. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Operators of Backpage.com appear in court on pimping charges"}

Leeds was one of two women who told the New York Times that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump touched her inappropriately. \n PUEBLO, Colo. \u00bb Several women levied allegations of sexual assault against Donald Trump on Wednesday in a series of interviews, adding to the already damaging revelations about the Republican presidential nominee's aggressive sexual comments about women. \n Trump's campaign dismissed the allegations as having no merit or veracity, and it attacked one of the media outlets that published the women's accounts as acting on a vendetta. In a letter from his attorneys, Trump demanded The New York Times retract what it called a \"libelous article\" and apologize. \n \"For The New York Times to launch a completely false, coordinated character assassination against Mr. Trump on a topic like this is dangerous,\" Jason Miller, Trump's campaign spokesman, said in a separate statement. \"To reach back decades in an attempt to smear Mr. Trump trivializes sexual assault, and it sets a new low for where the media is willing to go in its efforts to determine this election.\" \n A story published in The Times said Jessica Leeds, 74, of New York, told the newspaper she encountered Trump on an airline flight three decades ago. Leeds said Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt. \"He was like an octopus,\" she told the newspaper. \"His hands were everywhere.\" \n Rachel Crooks, of Ohio, said she met Trump at Trump Tower in 2005. Age 22 at the time, Crooks said Trump kissed her \"directly on the mouth\" against her will. \n Trump denied the accusations, telling the Times, \"None of this ever took place.\" The letter from his lawyers said unless the paper removed the article from its website and ceased further publication, it would pursue \"all available actions and remedies.\" \n Separately on Wednesday, The Palm Beach Post in Florida reported that Mindy McGillivray, 36, told the newspaper that Trump groped her at his Mar-a-Lago estate 13 years ago. People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff also posted a story about a 2005 incident at Mar-a-Lago where, she wrote, Trump \"was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat.\" The Trump campaign said there was no \"merit or veracity\" to either story. \n Hillary Clinton's communication's director, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement the latest run of allegations \"sadly fits everything we know about the way Donald Trump has treated women.\" \n The interviews come just days after the publication of a recording from 2005, on which Trump made a series of vulgar and sexually predatory comments about women. While waiting to make a cameo appearance on a soap opera, he bragged to then-\"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush that his fame allowed him to force himself on women. \n \"And when you're a star, they let you do it,\" Trump said, adding later: \"Grab them by the p\u2014\u2014. You can do anything.\" \n Trump has apologized for the comments on the recording, but also dismissed them as \"locker room talk\" and a distraction from the campaign. Asked during Sunday's presidential debate whether he ever engaged in the sort of conduct he described in 2005, he said: \"No. I do not.\" \n The reports about Trump's conduct came at the end of a day during which an increasingly confident Clinton made only brief reference to her opponent's treatment of women \u2014 she noted his dismissal of the conversation as \"locker room talk\" \u2014 and did not address the new allegations. \n Trying to float above the fray, she warned voters in Colorado and Nevada not to be turned off by the \"pure negativity\" coming from her opponent. \n Clinton's campaign had signaled earlier in the day she would go even harder on Republicans, but after news of the fresh allegations, Clinton demurred. She continued to make newly prominent and explicit pitches for Democratic congressional candidates in tight races, including Florida Rep. Patrick Murphy and Nevada Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto. \n Even as she did so, two GOP senators and two House members who called for Trump to step aside over the weekend climbed back aboard. Their basic case: They're voting for a Republican next month, and if Trump isn't leaving then he's got to be the one. \n John Thune of South Dakota, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate, told the Rapid City Journal he had \"reservations about the way (Trump) has conducted his campaign and himself.\" However, he said, \"I'm certainly not going to vote for Hillary Clinton.\" \n Also back on board after calling on Trump to resign: Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Reps. Scott Garrett of New Jersey and Bradley Byrne of Alabama. There still are some three dozen GOP lawmakers who have withdrawn their support or are calling for Trump to step aside. \n The focus on Republican congressional candidates is the latest sign the Clinton campaign is moving past a narrow focus on winning the White House, and now is aiming to win big \u2014 by delivering the Senate to Democrats, making deep cuts into the Republicans' majority in the House and, possibly, winning states long considered Republican territory. \n \"If you've got friends in Utah or Arizona, make sure they vote, too,\" Clinton told a raucous crowd in Pueblo. \n \"We are competing everywhere. \u2026 I think Americans want to turn out in as big a number as possible\" to reject Trump's message, Clinton said. \n She had sympathetic words \u2014 serious or not \u2014 for Trump supporters who have begun to interrupt her events. \n As security escorted one man out in Pueblo, Clinton said, \"You have to feel a little sorry for them; they've had a really bad couple of weeks.\" \n Clinton's new swagger and expanded ambitions came as Trump declared he feels unshackled to launch the sort of hard-edged, personal campaign his most ardent supporters love. Hours before news of the assault allegations broke, Trump kept up his unrelenting denunciations of Clinton at a rally in Florida. It's not enough for voters to elect him instead of her, he declared \u2014 \"She has got to go to jail.\" \n In Florida, he highlighted a new batch of hacked emails from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's account, published by WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy group. He asserted that the emails show ever more clearly that the former secretary of state and her family are corrupt. \n \"It never ends with these people,\" he said. \n WikiLeaks, which U.S. officials have said has ties to Russian intelligence, released a fourth installment of private correspondence between top Clinton campaign officials on Wednesday. Clinton's campaign has not confirmed the accuracy of the emails, but Podesta said the FBI is investigating Russia's possible involvement, raising the extraordinary prospect of a link between Russia and the U.S. presidential election. \n The FBI said anew that it is investigating possible Russian hacking involving U.S. politics but made no comment on Podesta. \n Associated Press writers Steve Peoples, Jonathan Lemire and Jill Colvin contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New allegations of sexual assault emerge against Trump"}

{"date": "October 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally. \n LAS VEGAS >> Already deeply divisive, America's campaign for president is quickly devolving into an ugly fight over who has treated women worse: Donald Trump, whose White House bid is floundering, or former President Bill Clinton, who isn't on the ballot. \n Trump's campaign is now openly signaling it will spend the election's final month relitigating Bill Clinton's marital affairs and unproven charges of sexual assault, as well as his wife and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's unverified role in intimidating the women who were involved. But Trump is a deeply imperfect messenger, given that his attacks on the Clintons' treatment of women are being overshadowed by a flood of allegations that he kissed and groped women without their consent. \n On Wednesday, The New York Times and the Palm Beach Post reported stories about three women who alleged Trump had inappropriately touched them. Separately, a People Magazine reporter wrote a detailed first-person account of being attacked by Trump while interviewing the businessman and his wife, Melania Trump. \n The stories come less than a week after the publication of a 2005 recording in which the Republican nominee boasted of using his fame to kiss and grab women. The revelation prompted a flood of Republicans to revoke their support for Trump, with some even calling for him to drop out of the race \u2014 though a handful of GOP officials have since switched back to supporting their party's nominee. \n Clinton adviser Jennifer Palmieri said the latest revelations match \"everything we know about the way Donald Trump has treated women.\" \n Trump's campaign denied the reports and threatened to sue The New York Times if the paper did not retract its story. \n Taken together, the revelations about Trump and his counterprogramming about Bill Clinton have plunged an already rancorous campaign to new lows. The real estate mogul has also aggressively charged that Hillary Clinton not only needs to be defeated in November, but also \"has got to go to jail.\" His campaign is also facing questions about ties to Russian interests accused of hacking Democratic groups, as well as the hacking of a top Clinton adviser's emails. \n For Trump, the cumulative effect of his brazen strategy appears to be a tumble in the battleground states he needs to win in November. What was already a narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory is virtually indiscernible for Trump unless there's a significant shakeup in the race between now and Nov. 8 \n Rather than trying to make up ground by shifting attention back to issues like trade that have energized Trump backers and could appeal to new voters, the Republican campaign appears to be moving swiftly to make Bill Clinton's past a centerpiece of the campaign. \n Building on Trump's decision to bring three Bill Clinton accusers to last week's presidential debate, the GOP nominee is expected to have the women appear with him on stage at rallies and do a series of television interviews, according to a person briefed on the plan but not authorized to discuss it publicly. \n Trump supporters are also confronting Hillary Clinton with the accusations about her husband. Multiple Clinton rallies were interrupted this week by hecklers shouting \"Bill Clinton is a rapist.\" Earlier this week, right-wing radio host Alex Jones offered to pay $5,000 to anyone who can be heard on television shouting about the former president and wearing a \"Bill Clinton rape\" T-shirt. \n Bill Clinton never faced any criminal charges over the allegations, and a lawsuit over an alleged rape was dismissed. He did settle a lawsuit with one of the women who claimed harassment. \n The Trump campaign's hope is to showcase the decades-old accusations to young voters, particularly women, who may not have been old enough to remember the controversies that dogged the Clintons in the 1990s. And if the campaign can't get them to vote for Trump, the person briefed on the plans said the goal is to convince young voters to stay home and depress turnout, which would likely hurt Democrats. \n Former Trump senior adviser Michael Caputo said the businessman's only way to win is to \"go nuclear\" on the Clintons. \n \"There's no way Trump can do anything positive to earn back women,\" Caputo said. \"The only way he can stave off the bleeding is to drag them into parity.\" \n But it's unclear whether Trump's strategy is even aimed at winning the election at this point. Increasingly, Trump's campaign feels like an opportunity for longtime Clinton opponents to air decade's worth of grievances about the Democratic power couple on the biggest stage in American politics. \n Trump confidante and informal adviser Roger Stone has long been encouraging Trump to make Bill Clinton's alleged assaults and the way his wife treated those woman a centerpiece of the campaign. Steve Bannon, the Trump campaign's chief executive, ran Breitbart News, a right-wing website that eagerly promotes an endless string of conspiracy theories about the Clintons. \n Hillary Clinton, who is on pace to become America's first female president is her lead holds, has tried to stay above the fray in recent days. She is yet to respond directly to Trump's decision to resurrect accusations about her husband. \n And during a pair of rallies Wednesday in Colorado and Nevada, Clinton appeared to be looking toward how to heal the country's deep divisions if she's elected president, pledging she would be a champion both for her supporters and those who don't vote for her. \n \"I know how important it is that we stay focused on the concerns that people have, not on the demagoguery and distraction,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "2016 race devolves into ugly fight over treatment of women"}

MacMillan had been stabbed more than 20 times. \n Deputy Prosecuting Atty. Wayne Tashima said it will be up to the parole board to set Roediger-Geauque's minimum sentence. \n The victim's mother, Donna MacMillan, told Circuit Judge Jeffrey Crabtree before sentencing that \"the empty space always will be there since Scott left us \u2026 our family is no longer whole.\" \n Shawn Macmillan told the court that he \"not only lost a brother, but one of my closest friends. \n \"My son will never see his uncle again,\" said Shawn Macmillan as he broke down in tears, adding that \"towards the end of his life he had some hard times, but he didn't deserve what happened to him.\" \n In his statement, Tashima said that although Roediger-Geauque never admitted to killing Macmillan, he did say in a pre-sentencing report that he was \"remorseful,\" which Tashima said should be treated as an admission. \n Tashima said that Roediger-Geauque had been sentenced in 2014 to 120 days after he was convicted of fourth-degree sex assault. \n Roediger-Geauque only told the family that he \"was sorry for their loss. I am right with God and trying to make myself a better man.\" \n Eve Mann, Roediger-Geauque's grandmother, tried to tell Crabtree that defense attorney Arthur Indiola did not present all the facts in the case. \n \"Ryan has been framed,\" Mann told Crabtree. \"Ryan you have to stand up for yourself.\" \n However, Crabtree called for a recess while Mann kept talking, saying that \"he (Indiola) sabotaged the whole trial.\" \n Following the recess, Crabtree reminded Mann that the court proceeding was to set a sentence and \"not to re-litigate the trial.\" \n Crabtree said Roediger-Geauque has a right to appeal. \n At that point, Mann walked out of the courtroom, saying that her grandson has the \"mentality of a 12-year-old.\" \n A jury deliberated for barely two hours on Aug. 4 before finding Roediger-Geauque guilty of murder. \n Prosecutors said McMillan, 37, had permission to use the covered space and refused to share it with Roediger-Geauque on a night when rain made it uncomfortable to sleep in the open. \n Roediger-Geauque left the islands before being charged with murder. \n He was extradited to Hawaii on April 5 after his arrest in Santa Barbara, Calif., on March 6. \n Another hearing will be held next month to determine extradition and restitution costs. \n Macmillan, a Kalaheo High School graduate, was the former chef at Lucy's Grill & Bar and Island Fusion. \n The medical examiner said Macmillan died of multiple stab wounds. \n ", "author": "By Gregg K.

She's now seeking to spread her new momentum to fellow Democrats on November ballots. \n The move came on a day that ended with new allegations \u2014 piling onto already damaging revelations of Trump's aggressive sexual comments about women. \n Two newspapers reported late Wednesday that Trump's actions went beyond words. The New York Times published interviews with two women who said they were touched inappropriately by the billionaire without their permission. The Times said Jessica Leeds, 74, of New York, told the newspaper she encountered Trump on an airline flight three decades ago. Leeds said Trump grabbed her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt. \n \"He was like an octopus,\" she told the newspaper. \"His hands were everywhere.\" \n Rachel Crooks, of Ohio, said she met Trump at Trump Tower in 2005. Age 22 at the time, Crooks says Trump kissed her \"directly on the mouth\" against her will. \n Trump denied the accusations, telling the Times, \"None of this ever took place.\" His campaign spokesman, Jason Miller, called the story \"a completely false, coordinated character assassination.\" \n Separately, The Palm Beach Post in Florida reported Wednesday night that Mindy McGillivray, 36, told the newspaper that Trump groped her at his Mar-a-Lago estate 13 years ago. Trump's campaign said her allegation \"lacks any merit or veracity.\" \n And late Wednesday, People magazine reporter Natasha Stoynoff posted a story about a 2005 incident at Mar-a-Lago where, she wrote, Trump \"was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat.\" The Trump campaign also said there was \"no merit or veracity\" to Stoynoff's story. \n The reports came as two GOP senators and two House members who called for Trump to step aside over the weekend climbed back aboard.

The FBI said anew that it is investigating possible Russian hacking involving U.S. politics but made no comment on Podesta. \n Late Wednesday, Podesta was hacked again, this time via his Twitter account. The campaign would not comment on whether the second hack was related to the email breach. \n Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday in Moscow that \"hysterics have been whipped up to distract the attention of the American people from the essence of what the hackers released. \u2026 They talk about who did it. Is it really that important?\" \n With polls showing Clinton pulling ahead in the presidential race and Trump digging in, Republican candidates for the House and Senate are tied in knots. If they revoke their support for their party's nominee, they risk losing his voters and losing their races. If they stand by him, they not only risk turning off moderate Republicans but also being branded for years as aligned with the Republican who sparked a crisis for the party. \n As party leaders step away from him, Trump is vowing to win the election his own way. \n He is striking particularly hard at House Speaker Paul Ryan, who told Republicans Monday he'll no longer campaign for Trump. \n Trump said in Florida there is a \"whole sinister deal going on\" that has prevented Ryan and other Republican leaders from fully backing his campaign. \"We're going to figure it out,\" he said. \"I always figure it out.\" \n He said, \"I wouldn't want to be in a foxhole with a lot of these people, that I can tell you, including Ryan.

{"date": "October 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n For the second time this week two missiles were fired at the USS Mason in the Red Sea, and officials believe they were launched by the same Yemen-based Houthi rebels involved in the earlier attack, a U.S. military official said Wednesday. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb U.S.-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles destroyed three coastal radar sites in Houthi-controlled territory on Yemen's Red Sea Coast early today, officials said, a retaliatory action that followed two incidents this week in which missiles were fired at U.S. Navy ships. \n The strikes marked the first U.S. strikes targeting the Houthis in Yemen's long-running civil war. The U.S. previously only provided logistical support and refueling to the Saudi-led coalition battling Yemen's Shiite rebels known as Houthis and their allies, including supporters of Yemen's former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. \n While the U.S. military has been focused on al-Qaida in Yemen, the Houthis had not been a primary target of American forces until the missile launches from Houthi-controlled territory this week. \n No information on casualties from the U.S. missiles was provided by American officials. The three radar sites were in remote areas, where there was little risk of civilian casualties or collateral damage, said a military official who was not authorized to be named and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n The destroyer USS Nitze launched the cruise missiles, the official said. \n President Barack Obama authorized the strikes at the recommendation of Defense Secretary Ash Carter and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said in a statement. U.S. officials had said earlier that the U.S. was weighing what military response to take. \n \"These limited self-defense strikes were conducted to protect our personnel, our ships and our freedom of navigation in this important maritime passageway,\" Cook said following the U.S. action. \"The United States will respond to any further threat to our ships and commercial traffic, as appropriate, and will continue to maintain our freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandeb and elsewhere around the world.\" \n In a sign of the regional nature of the Yemen conflict, the Houthis' ally Iran announced today that it was deploying two warships into the Bab el-Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden. \n The semi-official Tasnim news agency said the deployment of the Alvand and the Bushehr was part of a regular anti-piracy patrol off Yemen and East Africa. Still, its announcement hours after the American strike appeared aimed at sending a signal to the United States. \n Iran says it supports the Houthis, though it denies arming the rebels. The U.S. Navy says it has intercepted shipments of weapons from Iran bound for Yemen. \n Meanwhile, Yemen's state news agency Saba\u2014 under Houthis' control\u2014 quoted an unnamed military official as saying that US accusations that a US destroyer had come under attack from areas under control of Houthis were false. He said, \"all these claims are totally untrue and that the popular committees (Houthi militias) have nothing to do with such action.\" \n He added, \"such claims are part of the general context of creating false justifications to escalate assaults and cover up the continuous crimes committed by the aggression against the Yemeni people, along with the blockade imposed on it, and after the increasing condemnations to such barbaric and hideous crimes against Yemenis.\" \n Loai al-Shami, a Houthi spokesman, had earlier declined to comment on the U.S. strike. \n Sharaf loqman, spokesman for the Yemeni army, called it an \"American farce to find a reason to interfere in Yemen directly after failure of the Saudis.\" \n He said that the army never targets ships outside the territorial waters and only those that enter the Yemeni waters come under attack. \n Early Wednesday, two missiles were fired at the USS Mason, an Arleigh Burke class of guided missile destroyer that is conducting routine operations in the region with the USS Ponce, an amphibious warship. Neither missile got near the ship, said a U.S. military official. \n The missiles were fired from the Yemen coast, near the location used Sunday when two missiles were launched at the same two ships, said the official, who was not authorized to be named and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n A second official said it wasn't clear whether the ship's countermeasures caused the missiles to hit the water on Wednesday or if they would have landed there anyway. The official also spoke on condition of anonymity. \n \"These unjustified attacks are serious, but they will not deter us from our mission,\" the chief of naval operations, Adm. John Richardson, said in a statement Wednesday. \"The team in USS Mason demonstrated initiative and toughness as they defended themselves and others against these unfounded attacks over the weekend and again today. All Americans should be proud of them.\" \n Col. Walid Zeyad, a top naval official in Hodeida, told the AP that radars were in three different sites: Ras Eissa and Khoukha (both in Hodeida) and al-Makha port, of the western province of Taiz. He said that they were hit early morning around 7 a.m. \n The area is a hub of weapons smuggling. The general impression in Yemen was that since the Saudi imposition of a blockade, and the air campaign, all radars were destroyed. When asked Zeyad if these radars are new, he declined to comment. \n The missiles fired on Sunday were variants of the so-called Silkworm missile, and both also fell harmlessly into the water. The Silkworm is a type of coastal defense cruise missile that Iran has been known to use. \n Sunday was the first time that U.S. ships were targeted by a missile launch from Yemen. Last week, an Emirati-leased Swift boat came under rocket fire near the same area and sustained serious damage. The United Arab Emirates described the vessel as carrying humanitarian aid and having a crew of civilians, while the Houthis called the boat a warship. \n The U.S. has been considering withdrawing its support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis following Saturday's airstrike on a funeral and other troubling incidents of civilian casualties as a result of the Saudi bombing campaign. \n The strike on the funeral in the capital, Sanaa, killed some 140 people and wounded more than 600. That bombing, among the deadliest of the war, likely sparked the rebels to launch more ballistic missiles in Saudi Arabia and target the U.S. warships in the Red Sea. \n Human rights groups have expressed outrage over the deaths and accused the U.S. of complicity, leading the White House to say it was conducting a \"review\" to ensure U.S. cooperation with longtime partner Saudi Arabia is in line with \"U.S. principles, values and interests.\" \n Meanwhile, an international human rights group, Human Rights Watch, said today that the funeral bombing constitutes an apparent war crime and that the remnants of missiles found at the site of the attack showed that they were American-made. It said a disproportionate number of the victims were civilians when the coalition carried out two airstrikes. \n An international investigation is needed into the \"atrocity,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director for the rights group. She said the attack on the funeral joins a long list of abuses by the coalition. \n The U.S. missile launch also could affect relations with Iran, which says it backs the Yemeni rebels but denies arming them. That's contradicted by the U.S. Navy, which says it has intercepted several shipping boats since the war began carrying Iranian weaponry suspected to be on the way to Yemen. \n There was no immediate reaction to the U.S. launch this morning in Iran, which was marking the Shiite commemoration of Ashoura. Houthi-linked media also did not report the strike. \n The missile fire by the Houthi raises questions about maritime safety in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which serves as a gateway for oil tankers headed to Europe through the Suez Canal. The U.S. moved more naval ships near the strait after an Emirati-leased Swift boat came under rocket fire near the same area and sustained serious damage. The United Arab Emirates described the vessel as carrying humanitarian aid and having a crew of civilians, while the Houthis called the boat a warship. \n Analysts with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy called the Houthi missile fire \"a surprisingly aggressive move,\" but stressed there were limits to Iran's control of the rebels. \n \"Houthi relations with the Islamic Republic resemble the Iran-Hamas relationship more than the Iran-Hezbollah relationship \u2014 that is, the Houthis are autonomous partners who usually act in accordance with their own interests, though often with smuggled Iranian arms and other indirect help,\" the analysts wrote in a report released early today. \n Associated Press writers Maggie Michael in Sanaa, Yemen, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. fires missiles at Yemen targets in retaliatory strike"}

{"date": "October 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n University of Richmond junior and sexual assault survivor, Whitney Ralston, spoke during an Oct. 10 interview in Richmond, Va. Ralston, who says she was sexually assaulted by a classmate at the Richmond school, said Donald Trump's vulgar remarks that were caught on videotape and his that it was \"locker room\" talk normalizes violence against women. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Columbia University graduate student Savannah Badalich led a Breakthrough Campus Catalyst Training with student activists at Syracuse University in Syracuse, N.Y., for Sexual Assault Awareness Month on April 8. When news broke that Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, had bragged of groping women, and then trivialized it as \"locker room talk,\" it felt to some students like a repudiation of their efforts. \n NEW LONDON, Conn. \u00bb At Connecticut College, as at a growing number of campuses nationwide, students are encouraged to speak up if they hear remarks celebrating or condoning sexual aggression against women. In one training scenario, male students ask a peer if he really means it when he boasts of such conduct. \n So when news broke that Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, had bragged of groping women and then trivialized it as \"locker room talk,\" it felt to some students like a repudiation of their efforts. \n \"It's shocking that someone of that status thinks that that's OK,\" said Greg Liautaud, a senior who works with the college's sexual assault prevention office. \"It does make the work harder, because our goal here is to shift culture.\" \n Trump's caught-on-tape remarks about kissing women and grabbing their genitals are resonating deeply on campuses across the U.S. where sexual assault has been a long-standing problem. Many worried the comments, coupled with an apology that diminished their severity, could hinder efforts to educate youth when society too often brushes off abusive behavior as \"boys being boys\" or puts the blame on the victim. \n At Connecticut College, the director of sexual violence prevention said the presidential contender's remarks likely would become fodder for small group discussions, as happened after a videotape surfaced of Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice hitting his fiancee. \n \"I hope that it doesn't set us back,\" Darcie Folsom said. \"I hope it pushes us forward everywhere to know more work needs to be done.\" \n The federal government, citing estimates that 1 in 5 women has been sexually assaulted while in college, has stepped up pressure on higher education institutions to improve their response to allegations of assault. More than 200 schools are under sexual violence investigations by the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights ; noncompliance could lead to loss of federal funding. \n Other institutions have faced lawsuits by women claiming officials were indifferent or hostile when complaints were lodged. The University of Connecticut, for example, settled for $1.3 million with five students, including one who alleged a campus police officer told her \"women have to just stop spreading their legs like peanut butter\" or rape will keep happening. \n Stanford University professor Michelle Dauber said Trump's comments worsen the problem by serving to minimize sexual assault. Dauber is pushing a recall campaign of the judge who sentenced former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a woman outside a fraternity house \u2014 a penalty widely criticized as too lenient. Turner was released last month after serving half that time. \n \"The rage you are seeing from women is not solely or even principally directed at Trump,\" Dauber said. \"It is at the institutions and leaders who are failing to take action and hold him accountable. \u2026 Women are sick and tired. Enough is enough.\" \n Alison Kiss, executive director of the Clery Center for Security On Campus, hopes that the outrage turns into a \"teachable moment\" that bolsters on-campus efforts to combat assault and support survivors. \"Talking about it as no big deal can normalize the behavior. We have to create a culture where victims and survivors are comfortable coming forward, and on a lot of campuses that hasn't happened.\" \n That issue resonates deeply with Savannah Badalich. She's a graduate student at Columbia University in New York, and works part time with other colleges to increase awareness about sexual assault. At those sessions, she shares her personal story about being sexually assaulted during her sophomore year at UCLA and being too timid to report the incident. \n \"If the potential president of the U.S. is saying this is OK, what's to say that sexual violence is going to be taken seriously and that survivors are going to be treated with any respect?\" she said. \n Whitney Ralston, a University of Richmond junior who says she was raped, physically abused and stalked by a classmate, has been heartened by the strong negative reaction to Trump's comments. \"This is a problem that needs to be addressed, and you can't just keep brushing it off as boys will be boys.\" \n Ralston's alleged attacker accepted responsibility for violating the university's sexual misconduct policy, was ordered to stay away from her and told that further violations would result in suspension or expulsion. Ralston has filed a complaint with the DOE accusing the university of mishandling the case. Federal investigators are already looking into two other cases at the school for possible violations of Title IX, a broad statute that prohibits gender discrimination as well as sexual harassment and gender-based violence. \n The University of Maryland, Baltimore County, is also under federal investigation for its alleged mishandling of sexual assaults on campus, and the Trump furor reverberated across the campus this week, as students and faculty prepared to mark Relationship Violence Awareness Month. A complaint filed in August with the DOE accuses school officials of discouraging one sex assault victim from going to the police and said school investigators failed to get photographs documenting her injuries. \n Shira Malka Devorah, a 20-year-old senior who works at the UMBC Women's Center, has refrained from sharing Trump's comments on social media because she didn't want to upset assault survivors. But she was horrified by the candidate's comments, and even more so his justification that they were merely locker room banter. \n \"Saying that it's OK to talk about things like this with your buddies and joke about hurting women and controlling women's bodies, it's reinforcing the notion that you have power over women \u2026 that they're not human beings,\" Devorah said. \n At Connecticut College, which has about 1,900 students, efforts have grown in recent years to fight sexual assault. Freshmen attend a mandatory orientation session on preventing sexual violence, speakers address the topic at panels for prospective students, and some 30 student volunteers promote a program that encourages students to see it as a collective responsibility to stop sexual assault. One of the overall aims is to teach people how and when to intervene through videos, role-playing and other exercises. \n Trump's remarks were on the minds of many students this week as guides led small groups on tours around the picturesque campus on the Thames River. \n \"It undermines the progress that we've made,\" said junior Maggie Corey. \"I think what he said only perpetuates the rape culture.\" \n Associated Press writers Juliet Linderman in Baltimore, Alanna Durkin Richer in Richmond, Virginia, and Paul Elias in San Francisco contributed to this report.

He has said, however, that he'll chart a foreign policy not dependent on Washington. \n \"I insist that we realign, that there will be no more exercises next year, 'Do not prepare,' I told Defense Secretary Lorenzana,\" he said in a speech at the anniversary of the country's coast guard, referring to his defense chief. \n Delfin Lorenzana said in a news conference last week that he has explained to the president the value of the annual military maneuvers with the Americans in responding to natural disasters and in potential security crises. The defense chief said he expected a final decision on the Philippines's participation before the two sides started planning the drills. \n Top officials of the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii are scheduled to fly to the Philippines later this month to discuss a range of defense issues, including plans for future joint exercises, said a Philippine defense official. \n Manila's defense department, however, has asked them to postpone their trip until after the U.S. presidential elections next month and after Duterte has finalized his decision to change the Philippine military's engagements with U.S. forces, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the issue. \n An eight-day combat exercise between U.S. and Philippine forces ended a day early Tuesday in an air of uncertainty because Duterte wanted to end such drills, saying the maneuvers only benefit the U.S. military. \n Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Manila Philip Goldberg said Washington wants to continue its robust alliance with the Philippines, saying both countries benefit mutually from the partnership. \n \"We have the desire to continue our alliance,\" Goldberg told reporters. \"Some of the things are beyond my control, beyond the U.S. control, but what I can tell you is the U.S. has a string of commitment to the Philippines, to the people of the Philippines, to the economic well-being of the Philippines.\" \n Aside from halting at least 28 joint combat exercises with U.S. forces each year, including the Balikatan or shoulder-to-shoulder drills that involve thousands of American and Filipino troops each year, Duterte has opposed joint patrols with the U.S. Navy in the disputed South China Sea. He also wants U.S. counterterrorism troops out of his country's south, saying they inflame restiveness among minority Muslims, who resent atrocities committed by American colonial forces in the early 1900s. \n Under Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, relations with the U.S. blossomed as the Philippines sought help in confronting Beijing over escalating territorial conflicts in the South China Sea and the U.S. reasserted its influence in Asia as a counterweight to China. \n Duterte, who took office in June and labels himself as a left-wing politician, however, has taken steps to scale back his country's military engagements with the U.S., which has criticized his bloody fight against illegal drugs, earning his ire. Contrastingly, Duterte has reached out to China and Russia. \n Last week, the foul-mouthed Duterte told Barack Obama to \"go to hell.\" He issued a new warning to his detractors Wednesday. \n \"If I don't respect you anymore, be prepared for the worst because I can give you gallons of gallons of epithets, curses,\" Duterte said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Duterte says he ordered preparations for U.S. drills scrapped"}
