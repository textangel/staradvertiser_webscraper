{"date": "October 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Bryson Mees-Hernandez, 9 months, with his mother, Crystal Mees, in Houston. \"When you are on the other side,\" Crystal recalls telling him, \"you are going to see Mommy cry a lot. It's not because she's mad. It's because she misses you.\" \n Hours earlier, he was a happy 4-year-old who loved Ironman and the Hulk and all the Avengers. Now, as Bryson Mees-Hernandez approached death in a Houston hospital room, his brain swelling through the bullet hole in his face, his mother assured the boy it was OK to die. \n \"When you are on the other side,\" his mother, Crystal Mees, recalls telling him, \"you are going to see Mommy cry a lot. It's not because she's mad. It's because she misses you.\" \n And this: \"It's not your fault.\" \n But whose fault was it? \n Bryson shot himself last January with a .22-caliber Derringer his grandmother kept under the bed. It was an accident, but one that could be blamed on many factors, from his grandmother's negligence to the failure of government and industry to find ways to prevent his death and so many others. \n The Associated Press and the USA TODAY Network set out to determine just how many others there have been. \n The findings: During the first six months of this year, minors died from accidental shootings \u2014 at their own hands, or at the hands of other children or adults \u2014 at a pace of one every other day, far more than limited federal statistics indicate. \n Tragedies like the death of Bryson Mees-Hernandez play out repeatedly across the country. Curious toddlers find unsecured, loaded handguns in their homes and vehicles, and fatally shoot themselves and others. Teenagers, often showing off guns to their friends and siblings, end up shooting them instead. \n Using information collected by the Gun Violence Archive, a nonpartisan research group, news reports and public sources, the media outlets spent six months analyzing the circumstances of every death and injury from accidental shootings involving children ages 17 and younger from Jan. 1, 2014, to June 30 of this year \u2014 more than 1,000 incidents in all. \n Among the findings: \n \u2014Deaths and injuries spike for children under 5, with 3-year-olds the most common shooters and victims among young children. Nearly 90 3-year-olds were killed or injured in the shootings, the vast majority of which were self-inflicted. \n \u2014Accidental shootings spike again for ages 15-17, when victims are most often fatally shot by other children but typically survive self-inflicted gunshots. \n \u2014They most often happen at the children's homes, with handguns legally owned by adults for self-protection. They are more likely to occur on weekends or around holidays such as Christmas. \n \u2014States in the South, including Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Georgia, are among those with the highest per capita rates of accidental shootings involving minors. \n In all, more than 320 minors age 17 and under and more than 30 adults were killed in accidental shootings involving minors. Nearly 700 other children and 78 adults were injured. \n The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 74 minors died from accidental discharges of firearms in 2014, the latest year for which comparable data are available. The AP and USA TODAY analysis counted 113 for that year, suggesting the federal government missed a third of the cases. \n While accidental shootings account for only a fraction of firearm deaths in the U.S., gun safety advocates have long argued that they are largely preventable and thus prefer to call them unintentional shootings, rather than accidental. \n \"The extent of the problem is a little bit shocking. The extent of the undercount is a little bit shocking,\" said Lindsay Nichols, an attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence in San Francisco. \"A lot of it provides further evidence that this is such a horrible pattern that continues and that more action is needed.\" \n Gun control advocates demand stricter laws requiring guns to be kept locked up and unloaded. But gun rights supporters argue those measures make guns less useful in emergencies; citing CDC statistics, the National Rifle Association argues in public statements that such deaths have declined significantly in recent decades and that the chance of a child dying in a firearms accident is \"one in one million.\" \n Bob Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch of the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, suggested the NRA was citing statistics that underestimate the risk guns represent to American children. \n He would not, he said, \"put money on that interpretation.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Bryson and his 2-year-old sister were staying with their grandparents in January to give their mother a break. She had given birth months earlier to a baby girl and needed sleep. \n It was a typical night. After their baths, Bryson asked if he could hop in bed with his grandfather, who was already asleep. His grandmother, Anna Sperber, said yes, before she fell asleep on the living room couch with the younger girl. \n When Sperber got up to get a blanket hours later, she saw Bryson face down on the bedroom floor. She thought he had fallen asleep. \n Then she noticed the lump on his head and panicked when she saw the pistol she kept under her bed lying next to him. He had shot himself above the right eye. \n Bryson's grandfather, who used a noisy breathing machine, had slept through the gunshot. After a frantic 911 call, emergency responders would take Bryson to a hospital by helicopter as his sister watched. Soon, a neurosurgeon would tell his mother it was only a matter of time before the boy would be dead. The bullet had gone straight to the back of his brain and shattered. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n The undercount documented by the AP and USA TODAY Network is \"significant and important,\" but not surprising, said the CDC's Anderson. \n He said the agency has long suspected that its statistics on accidental firearms deaths are too low; the agency tracks deaths from accidental discharges of firearms but tallies only those that are officially classified that way by coroners on death certificates. Coroners categorize many such deaths as homicides because they can fit the definition of being killed by another. They also can classify them as undetermined, if the cause is unclear. \n The AP and USA TODAY Network did not rely on coroners' findings, but rather counted those shootings that were declared accidental or unintentional by investigating agencies. They were tallied primarily from the Gun Violence Archive, where researchers track media, government and commercial sources to compile a comprehensive database of gun incidents. The review also uncovered a handful of shootings that had not previously been made public. \n The findings were in line with prior research done by Everytown for Gun Safety, the advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, which keeps a running database of such shootings. The group says that up to 70 percent of accidental shootings could be prevented if parents kept their guns locked and separated from ammunition, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. \n Since the start of 2014, more than 80 children age 4 and under have fatally shot themselves. \n \"That 3- to 5-year-old age group, they are going to be looking at the gun when they shoot it. They point the gun barrel at themselves and put their thumbs on the trigger,\" said Sheriff David McKnight of Marion County, Texas, who is investigating the death of a 3-year-old who killed himself with his father's gun in July. \n But children of every age, and especially boys, seem drawn to guns. \n Last year, 4-year-old Cameron Price and his 6-year-old brother, Ka'Darius, were riding their bikes outside the Levingston Motel in Shreveport, Louisiana, where their family had taken a $30-a-night room \u2014 all they could afford, their mother would later say. \n They decided to go inside, into a room where several adult acquaintances of their parents had been smoking marijuana. \n A gun was sitting out, and Ka'Darius thought the chrome and black .40-caliber pistol was a toy. \n A single shot rang out. Robert Price found his younger son slumped over on the arm of a couch when he entered after hearing a loud \"pop\" while in the bathroom of an adjacent room. He cradled the toddler as he took his final breaths before being whisked to a hospital, where he died. \n Ka'Darius later told police he \"pushed the bad button\" and he understood his brother \"had a hole in his head,\" was going to the hospital and not coming home. \n The Caddo Parish district attorney's office charged two people in the room with weapons and drug charges. Both pleaded down to attempted possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. In August, a judge sentenced them to four years with credit for time served. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n For children ages 10 and up, the cases usually involve a group playing together when one manages to obtain a gun. \n The AP-USA TODAY Network research showed the most vulnerable years are the middle teens, specifically for those just reaching the age when they can obtain a driver's license. \n A shooting in Iowa earlier this year illustrates one of the more common types of accidental shootings. \n It was the Friday of spring break, and the University of Iowa Hawkeyes had just won an NCAA tournament game on a buzzer-beater. It was a thrill for Senquez Jackson, a basketball-loving 15-year-old from Cedar Rapids. \n He relayed the news of the big win to his mother, who was resting in her bedroom before her night shift at an educational testing company. \n The high school freshman returned to the living room to hang out with friends, who had spent the week with him and his older brother, Malik. \n One, a 17-year-old, had brought over a handgun that had been legally owned by a friend's mother and recently disappeared from her home. A 13-year-old wanted to see the weapon and removed the clip. Thinking it was unloaded, he started playing with it. \n \"Bro, I'm hit,\" Senquez said. \n The friend thought he was kidding, but the gun had fired. The bullet ripped through the right side of Senquez's chest, piercing his lung. \n His mother, Tamara Bloemendaal, was jolted awake with Malik screaming: \"Mom, get up. Senquez has been shot.\" \n Bloemendaal recalls helping Senquez out of the recliner and watching him collapse on the floor in a pool of blood. She rode in the ambulance with the tall, handsome boy she called \"Chunks\" as a baby. Within hours, he was dead. \n The 13-year-old pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in juvenile court, expressing remorse. \n \"It doesn't seem like any of them had access to a gun before. They were fascinated by it; what it looks like, what it feels like to hold,\" said the boy's attorney, Jeremy Elges. \"It turned out there was a round in the chamber. He wasn't savvy enough with guns to know that's a risk.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Gun safety advocates have urged a public health approach that includes more research by the federal government, more public awareness and stricter state laws. But the problem of lax gun storage is difficult to address in part because it's hard to quantify, and the federal government stopped trying 12 years ago. \n The CDC had asked Americans about whether they kept loaded, unlocked guns in their homes as part of an annual telephone survey that asked 400,000 adults about various health risks. Using that data, researchers estimated that 1.5 million children lived in such homes \u2014 and the results varied greatly by state based on gun ownership levels. \n But the CDC scrapped that line of questioning in 2004. State public health officials voted this year not to reintroduce the questions in next year's survey, in part because of the political sensitivity around asking about gun ownership, which some see as an invasion of privacy. \n \"Some states did not think they would be allowed to ask such questions by their governor,\" said Donald Shepherd, the survey coordinator for Iowa. \n Gun control advocates say Child Access Prevention laws \u2014 on the books in about two dozen states \u2014 act as a deterrent. In general, those laws allow prosecutors to charge parents when children obtain their guns and use them to harm themselves or others. \n Supporters say a study of a Florida law suggests they can save lives if implemented correctly. And the concept enjoys wide public approval: Two-thirds of Americans support laws making adults criminally liable for gun safety lapses that endanger children, according to an AP-GfK Poll in July. \n But efforts to expand those laws have stalled in the face of opposition from the NRA and other gun rights supporters. Bills in several states, including Missouri and Tennessee, to create similar laws were introduced this year and died without action. \n The NRA argues that more education and training should be the solution, not more laws and prosecutions. The NRA takes credit for improving safety through its Eddie Eagle Gun Safe program, which warns children not to touch any firearms they come across and to tell adults. \n Critics dispute the effectiveness of that message, pointing to academic research that shows curious children will pick up loose guns, even when told otherwise. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Bryson Mees-Hernandez's grandfather had bought the gun and another firearm from his own father the year before, in California. The boy's grandmother kept them under her side of the bed because she was often home alone, struggled with mobility due to back problems and was concerned for her safety after reading about local break-ins on Facebook. \n The guns were kept in a case that had been used to transport them on an airplane back to Texas, and Anna Sperber believed that would keep them away from children. But Bryson was able to open the side of the case, reach in and grab the gun. \n \"I thought it was secure, but I was wrong. My grandbaby's gone. And it happened while I was watching him and I failed him,\" Sperber said, through tears. \"I don't want anyone to ever, ever go through this. It's so horrible.\" \n A grand jury declined to bring charges against Sperber, but Crystal Mees blames her mother for the boy's death and no longer talks to her or brings her two children around; she says she had warned her to keep the gun out of children's reach. She plans to push for a \"Bryson's law\" in Texas to make it easier for prosecutors to bring charges against adults who allow children access to firearms. \n Both women attended the funeral, where relatives dressed up as Bryson's beloved Avengers, and his casket had an Ironman theme. He was buried with Legos, toy cars and his grandfather's favorite cologne. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "An accidental shooting kills a child every other day"}

{"date": "October 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A farmer walks in a field during harvest in South Hwanghae province, North Korea. North Korea could be looking at a better harvest this year thanks to good weather and ongoing changes in policy that allow farmers to keep more of what they produce. \n PYONGYANG, North Korea >> North Korea could be looking at a better harvest than last year despite severe flooding in the country's northeast, thanks to generally good weather and ongoing changes in official policy that allow farmers to keep \u2014 and profit from \u2014 more of what they produce. \n While formal data is not out yet, the main harvest of 2016, which is currently underway, appears to be shaping up to be slightly better than last year, according to the World Food Program. \n The WFP, which has an office in Pyongyang, attributed the positive outlook to good weather, but noted North Korea will still need to top up locally produced food with imports and added that the flooding in the northeast caused by Typhoon Lionrock in late August and early September could have a significant impact on food supply in the affected areas. \n North Korea has made significant strides in agriculture since the disastrous famine years of the 1990s \u2014 caused by floods, drought, the collapse of Soviet bloc benefactors and the North's own policy missteps. But the mountainous and isolated socialist country has yet to achieve its official goal of food self-sufficiency. Malnourishment caused by the lack of balanced diets is widespread, and the United Nations continues a long-term program of assistance to the most vulnerable segments of the population. \n But there are also signs that incentives for farmers introduced by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are increasing production. \n In his first public speech after assuming power upon the death of his father in late 2011, Kim vowed in April 2012 that the North Korean people shouldn't have to tighten their belts again. That same year, outsiders started to detect changes in the North's agricultural policy, including allowing farmers to keep more of their crops, if they could produce more, instead of having to hand over all their harvest to the state. \n North Korea calls it the \"field responsibility system\" and officially credits the idea to its founding leader, Kim Il Sung. \n In effect, it's an effort by the government to create an incentive for production while maintaining overall state management. The policy is believed to have been cemented when Kim wrote a long letter to a meeting of farm workers in 2014 to promote the idea. \n Ri Won Jae, the chief engineer at the Samjigang Cooperative Farm, said it has indeed inspired farmers to produce more. \n \"I think the main thing for success is that the incentive to produce, and the farmer's sense of responsibility, have increased, because we introduced the field responsibility system,\" he said in a recent interview with Associated Television News. \n O Jong Hyok, the head of a sub-work team on the cooperative in South Hwanghae province, said the new policies have spurred competition. The sub-units themselves \u2014 generally from five to 10 people \u2014 are something of an innovation along the same lines. The smaller groupings increase each worker's feeling of having a stake in the yield. \n \"This is a field that our sub-work team is in charge of,\" O said in an interview with APTN at the farm. \"After finishing cutting the rice, we are carrying the rice sheaves and threshing now. Since we started the field responsibility system, the farmers have become more competitive and the harvest yield has increased. The more we grow, the more the farmers get, and then we will become wealthier.\" \n Even so, Colin Kampschoer, the WFP's representative in Pyongyang, stressed that the food losses caused by the flooding in the northeast come at a critical time, just before the start of the North's extremely cold winter. \n \"The floods that hit the north of the DPRK in early September have reportedly damaged 27,411 hectares of arable land,\" he said, using the acronym for the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. \"Greenhouses were washed away and people have lost their food stocks, kitchen gardens and livestock, which are all important sources for vegetables, fats and protein to make families' diets more diverse.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Good weather, new incentives seen boosting N.

{"date": "October 13, 2016", "text": "POOL PHOTO VIA AP / SEPT. 2012 \n In this file photo, then U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during her joint conference with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing when talks between Clinton and Chinese leaders failed to narrow gaps on how to end the crisis in Syria and how to resolve Beijing's territorial disputes with its smaller neighbors over the South China Sea. \n BEIJING \u00bb Hillary Clinton privately said the U.S. would \"ring China with missile defense\" if the Chinese government failed to curb North Korea's nuclear program, a potential hint at how the former secretary of state would act if elected president.  \n Clinton's remarks were revealed by WikiLeaks in a hack of the Clinton campaign chairman's personal account. The emails include a document excerpting Clinton's private speech transcripts, which she has refused to release. \n A section on China features several issues in which Clinton said she confronted the Chinese while leading the U.S. State Department. \n China has harshly criticized the U.S. and South Korea's planned deployment of a missile-defense system against North Korea, which conducted its fifth nuclear test this year. But Clinton said she told Chinese officials that the U.S. might deploy additional ships to the region to contain the North Korean missile threat. \n If North Korea successfully obtains a ballistic missile, it could threaten not just American allies in the Pacific, \"but they could actually reach Hawaii and the west coast theoretically,\" Clinton said. \n \"We're going to ring China with missile defense. We're going to put more of our fleet in the area,\" Clinton said in a 2013 speech. \"So China, come on. You either control them or we're going to have to defend against them.\" \n China is North Korea's economic lifeline and the closest thing it has to a diplomatic ally, and has been criticized by the U.S. and others for not doing enough to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Chinese officials and state media have responded by saying that North Korea is not solely China's responsibility, and that Beijing has limited influence with secretive leader Kim Jong Un's hard-line communist regime. \n Clinton also privately criticized China's position on another sensitive issue, the South China Sea. China claims almost the entirety of the strategically vital waterbody and has lashed out at an international tribunal's July ruling rejecting its claims. \n Clinton told a different audience in 2013 that by China's logic, the U.S. after World War II could have labeled the Pacific Ocean the \"American Sea.\" \n \"My counterpart sat up very straight and goes, 'Well, you can't do that,'\" she said. \"And I said, 'Well, we have as much right to claim that as you do. I mean, you claim (the South China Sea) based on pottery shards from, you know, some fishing vessel that ran aground in an atoll somewhere.\" \n In another remark revealed in the Wikileaks hack, Clinton called Chinese President Xi Jinping \"a more sophisticated, more effective public leader\" than his predecessor, Hu Jintao. She noted Xi's plans for economic and social reforms, but blamed what she called \"a resurgence of nationalism\" on the Chinese government. \n China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond Friday to faxed questions about Clinton's remarks. \n As secretary of state, Clinton visited China seven times and engineered Washington's \"pivot\" to Asia, which has long been viewed with suspicion by Beijing. The policy shift has seen a tighter focus on the region along with an increased military presence and fortified alliances with allies such as Australia and the Philippines, although the latter has been cast in doubt with the election of China-friendly President Rodrigo Duterte. \n She also drew condemnation from Chinese state media last year after describing Xi as \"shameless\" as he prepared to speak on women's rights at the United Nations, shortly after China detained five young feminists who'd campaigned against domestic violence. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton says U.S. could 'ring China with missile defense'"}

{"date": "October 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Steve Bailey wears a mask outside of his house while he attempts to go for a walk around the block with is wife in Provo, Utah. \n PROVO, Utah >> Lehi resident Steve Bailey went to the gym with his wife, Merity, to walk the track. For Steve, who has the genetic condition alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, even just going to the gym and having energy to walk was a marked difference from earlier months. \n After doing some walking, Steve said he felt like he needed to run the last lap, something he hadn't done in five or six years since he started having difficulty breathing, a symptom of alpha-1. \n \"As ridiculous as it looked, it really felt good because I didn't think I'd ever run again,\" Steve said. \n Merity said she saw her husband start running while she was working out and started to worry about him. \n \"I see him over there clutching something and I think it's his heart,\" she said. \"So I ran over to him, but he ran. It was a hop, skip, jump type thing.\" \n \"It was pathetic,\" Steve said to his wife, commenting on how funny he must have looked. \n \"No, it was awesome,\" Merity responded. \n Maybe it was the day \u2014 he had just found out he was no longer rejecting the transplanted lungs \u2014 or something else, but Steve ran the last lap. It was worth it, he said. \n Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic condition where the liver doesn't produce enough of a protein called antitrypsin, which helps protect the lungs on other organs. \n Steve's double lung transplant in July didn't fix everything. At first, his lung function was in the high 90 percent range and he was able to do things he hadn't for a while. \n But then his lung function dropped back into the 80 percent range, a dramatic decrease. For several weeks, he took medicine and went to extra doctor visits. \n Merity said she could see the effects of the rejection \u2014 familiar signs from the years spent fighting alpha-1 \u2014 coming back in late September. \n \"I see the different patterns coming back that he had before the transplant. I see the raccoon eyes coming back from before the transplant. I see the grey color coming back,\" she said the day before Steve went in for another round of tests in late September. \n After having a bronchoscopy and biopsy, where doctors look at the lungs and remove a small piece for testing, he finally got the good news that he wasn't rejecting and his lung function was increasing. \n After so many ups and downs, Steve said he's learned to take every challenge one at a time and be prepared. He said he's ready to move on to the next chapter and the next challenge. \n \"When I was told I was no longer rejecting, it was kind of the same reaction as when I found out I was rejecting,\" he said. \"'It's just the next chapter. We will deal with this now.\" \n Steve will have another bronchoscopy and biopsy in six weeks to check on his new lungs and how he is doing. \n \"I won't have to worry for six weeks,\" Merity said. \n During the rejection, he found out he lost his job. Steve, who works in information and cybersecurity, said he has some leads on jobs but is still waiting to hear back. \n \"The transplant team encourages you to get back to work when you can, but they want to make sure you're ready,\" he said. \"They want you to get back to your life as quick as possible. It's about that time.\" \n Merity said the family has been incredibly blessed by all the help they have received from their community and people who found their story on Facebook. \n While every day is special for them because they knew without a transplant he wouldn't make it through the winter, it's not without its struggles. \n \"He's a young guy to have a double lung transplant,\" Merity said. \n The Baileys are holding an online auction from Oct. 11 to Oct. 17 to raise money to cover the cost of Steve's medical bills and to help make ends meet at home. \n Those that are interested in participating can get more information on Facebook in the Help Steve Breathe Online Auction group or can donate to their GoFundMe page. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Man with rare lung disease pushes past transplant rejection"}

{"date": "October 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATE PRESS \n Aedes Aegypti mosquito larvae swim in a container displayed at the Florida Mosquito Control District Office, in Marathon, Fla. Florida health officials have identified another Miami neighborhood where mosquitoes have spread the Zika virus to people. \n MIAMI BEACH, Fla. >> Health officials announced Thursday a new Zika zone in Miami \u2014 a setback less than a month after declaring the nearby Wynwood neighborhood cleared of the virus following aggressive mosquito spraying. \n Five people have been infected with Zika in a 1-square-mile area of the city just north of the Little Haiti neighborhood and about 3 miles north of Wynwood, according to a statement released Thursday by Gov. Rick Scott's office. \n It is the third Miami-area neighborhood identified where mosquitoes have transmitted the virus to people, after Wynwood and a touristy section of Miami Beach, which is still considered an active transmission zone. Wynwood was declared free of the virus after 45 days went by without any new infections. \n These are the first such areas of transmission confirmed in the continental U.S., following major outbreaks of the disease across Latin America. Zika symptoms are so mild that most people who get it don't feel sick, but the disease can cause severe brain-related birth defects if a pregnant woman is infected. \n The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that pregnant women should avoid travel to the new outbreak area, and they should consider postponing non-essential travel to the rest of Miami Dade, according to CDC spokesman Tom Skinner. \n \"We're not yet at the end of mosquito season, so we might continue to see local transmission going on for a little while yet,\" Skinner said. \n Officials in Florida had warned that Hurricane Matthew would interrupt efforts to eradicate the mosquitoes that spread the virus, and Gov. Rick Scott had told residents to be mindful of standing water on their properties after the storm passed.

This is not something we can ignore.\" \n Mrs. Obama said the comments made by Trump are part of a long history of demeaning women. \n \"We have a candidate for president of the United States who over the course of his lifetime, over the course of this campaign, has said things about women that are shocking, so demeaning,\" she said. \"I simply will not repeat anything here today. Last week, we actually saw this candidate bragging about sexually assaulting women.

At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. \n NEW YORK \u00bb Some airlines are taking extra steps to prevent a disaster in case a passenger's device powered by a lithium ion battery catches fire during flight. \n At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. \n The issue has taken on new urgency following incidents of overheating Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones, including one on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. \n The Federal Aviation Administration has taken the unusual step of warning passengers not to use or charge the devices while on board and not to stow them in checked luggage. \n One of the first airlines to deploy fire-containment bags on its entire fleet was Alaska Airlines. The Seattle-based airline finished adding them to its 219 planes in May, a process that took two months from concept to deployment. \n The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops that can sometimes overheat and catch fire. The bags can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers and can withstand temperatures up to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit. The sell for $1,800 each but airlines are likely to have negotiated a bulk discount. \n Virgin America has installed fire-containment bags on all its planes, said spokeswoman Jennifer Thomas. The airline, which is based in Burlingame, California, has about 60 jets. \n Delta Air Lines noted today on a call with investors that it too would be adding such bags. The Atlanta-based airline has more than 900 planes, all of which will eventually get the bags, depending on production speeds and the ability to train flight attendants and pilots. \n The first priority will be the 166 aircraft that cross oceans, as well as some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, according to spokesman Morgan Durrant. Those jets will have two bags each by the end of the year. In 2017, Delta plans to start adding the bags to its domestic fleet, including planes flown by its regional airline partners. \n \"This has been on the to-do list but has been accelerated by recent events,\" Durrant said. \n American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines don't have any immediate plans for fire containment bags but all said their crews are trained on how to fight such high-energy fires. Additionally, aircraft have been fitted with fire extinguishers in the cabin as well as other fire detection and suppression systems in cargo holds for decades. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Airlines add 'fire containment bags' for overheating phones"}

{"date": "October 13, 2016", "text": "The U.S. will remain the most important partner for the Philippines even as Rodrigo Duterte improves ties with China, his foreign secretary said ahead of the president's trip to Beijing. \n \"We have a special relationship with the U.S.,\" Perfecto Yasay, the country's top diplomat, said in an interview Thursday in his office in Manila. \"They are our only military ally. You could not put the United States, in that sense, in equal footing with China.\" \n The U.S. has been the Philippines' closest ally since independence in 1946, and the nations are linked by formal defense treaties. But those ties have been strained since Duterte took office three months ago, with the tough-talking leader frequently calling the relationship into question. \n Yasay, 69, himself delivered a scathing attack on the U.S. in an essay posted on his Facebook page last week, accusing the U.S. of holding onto \"invisible chains that reined us in towards dependency and submission as little brown brothers not capable of true independence and freedom.\" \n On Thursday, Yasay backed Duterte's recent tirades, saying the president's strong words and attacks had made the U.S. take notice of the Philippines instead of taking the country for granted. \n Yasay, who was Duterte's roommate at university, is a newcomer to international diplomacy. He is a lawyer by trade and served as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1995 to 2000. He is also relatively new to politics, having never held elected office, with an unsuccessful bid for the vice presidency in 2010. \n While he has often supported Duterte's call for closer relations with China and his desire to hold direct talks with Beijing about territorial disputes in the South China Sea, he and other senior ministers have at other times sought to calm fears that overtures toward China will weaken the alliance with the U.S. \n Yasay said the Philippines was open to further military exercises with the U.S. \"if these joint exercises are designed to help us build our own capabilities in defense and in enforcement, disaster response and so on.\" Duterte had said last month the latest joint maritime drills would be the last. \n 'Without Strings'  \n The foreign secretary also sought to explain Duterte's call earlier this month for U.S. President Barack Obama to \"go to hell,\" saying it was frustration with what the Philippine leader believed was Washington's refusal to sell weapons to his nation because it disapproved of Duterte's deadly drug war. According to police data, as many as 3,700 suspects may have been killed since July 1. \n \"If you want to help us,\" Yasay added, referring to the U.S., \"then you help us without strings attached.\" \n Yasay will accompany Duterte on next week's state visit to China, along with up to 400 business leaders. The diplomat said the Philippines wanted better ties with China after it had been neglected under the previous administration led by Benigno Aquino. \n \"I'd like to let everyone know that that this trip is not to engage China in bilateral negotiations with respect to our disputes in the South China Sea,\" Yasay said, adding his nation would proceed with caution on pledges of business and investment from China. \n \"You don't want to place your eggs in one basket when you engage any country for that matter, in so far as trade relationships are concerned,\" he said. \"You would always want to make sure that when you do something, decide on something, it is always be for the purpose of national interest.\" \n China angered the Aquino administration in 2012 when it seized Scarborough Shoal, a rocky outcrop located around 240 kilometers off the coast of the Philippines. Aquino subsequently challenged China's claims to more than 80 percent of the South China Sea before the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. The tribunal ruled in favor of the Philippines in July, after China had already reclaimed some 3,200 acres (1,290 hectares) on rocks and reefs. \n \"I do not believe at this point in time that China is intending reclamation projects in the Scarborough Shoal,\" Yasay said. \"I could be wrong but this is what I believe in.\" \n Yasay said it was time to give China a breather. \"Let's give them a face-saving mechanism,\" he said. \"As much as we would like them also to give us some face-saving mechanism. Let's work together in making sure that these provisional arrangements can come about.\" \n Trade, Investment  \n Yasay said the Philippines was seeking support from China related to infrastructure development, agriculture and trade. He said the Philippines was also interested in reviving talks related to Chinese investment in rail and telecommunications that had fallen apart under previous administrations, and would consider possible arms purchases from China. \n \"This is something that we have to take into very serious consideration,\" Yasay said. \"For the most part, it will just be a window shopping on these things, maybe for small things with respect to our fight against violent extremism.\" \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "Philippines wants U.S. to remain top military ally, foreign minister says"}

{"date": "October 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke during a campaign rally at the South Florida Fairgrounds and Convention Center, today, in West Palm Beach, Fla. \n WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. \u00bb Lashing back, Donald Trump heatedly rejected the growing list of sexual assault allegations against him as \"pure fiction,\" hammering his female accusers as \"horrible, horrible liars\" as the already-nasty presidential campaign sank further into charges of attacks on women. \n Campaign foe Hillary Clinton said \"the disturbing stories just keep on coming\" about her Republican opponent, but she let first lady Michelle Obama's passionate response carry the day. Obama, in battleground New Hampshire, warned that the New York billionaire's behavior \"is not something we can ignore.\" \n After years of working to end \"this kind of violence and abuse and disrespect \u2026 we're hearing these exact same things on the campaign trail. We are drowning in it,\" Obama declared, her voice cracking with emotion. \"We can't expose our children to this any longer, not for another minute, let alone for four years.\" \n With Election Day less than four weeks away, Republican Trump was again forced to defend himself against allegations of sexual misconduct, five days after a video surfaced in which he bragged about kissing and groping women without their permission. \n Similar behavior was detailed by women who accused Trump in articles published late Wednesday by The New York Times and the Palm Beach Post. Separately, a People Magazine reporter offered a first-person account accusing Trump of attacking her while she was in Florida to interview him and his pregnant wife. \n Ever defiant, the New York billionaire denied the allegations and blamed them on Hillary Clinton's campaign and the complicit news media as he campaigned in Florida. He promised to sue his media critics and said he was preparing evidence that would discredit his female accusers, whom he called \"horrible people. They're horrible, horrible liars.\" \n He went further during an evening appearance in Columbus, Ohio, saying he \"never met\" some of the women. \n \"I don't know who they are,\" he insisted and said they \"made up stories.\" \n \"These vicious claims about me, of inappropriate conduct with women, are totally and absolutely false. And the Clintons know it,\" he said earlier. He offered no evidence discrediting the new reports except to ask why his accusers had waited years and then made their allegations less than a month before the election. \n His comments came soon after he called a reporter \"a sleazebag\" for asking whether Trump had ever touched or groped a woman without her consent. \n Trump's attacks on his accusers' credibility marked an awkward break from campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who earlier in the week highlighted a Clinton tweet that said \"every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be heard, believed, and supported.\" \n Conway hoped to encourage more women to come forward with allegations against Bill Clinton, building on the campaign's Sunday decision to bring three of the former president's accusers to the second presidential debate. \n \"His campaign is promising more scorched-earth attacks. Now that's up to him,\" Clinton said during a San Francisco fundraiser. \"He can run his campaign however he chooses. And frankly, I don't care if he goes after me.\" \n Trump running mate Mike Pence ditched the national reporters who pay to travel with his campaign in Pennsylvania. The Indiana governor's Twitter account showed him meeting with faith leaders and stopping at a restaurant \u2014 after a Pence spokesman said the vice presidential nominee was attending closed-door fundraisers. \n Republican leaders across the country said they were deeply troubled by the allegations against Trump, but there was no evidence of new defections. Over the weekend, dozens of Republican senators and congressmen vowed they would not vote for him, with many calling on him to step aside. \n Some recanted after an aggressive weekend debate performance. And in what he called an increasingly \"muddy\" election, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson raised complaints about Hillary Clinton Thursday but wondered aloud what could change voters' minds at this point. \n \"Is there a deal-breaker out there? How many emails have to be destroyed? How many investigations have to be concluded with question marks? How many comments have to come out from one campaign in reference to religious institutions that raises concerns?\" \n More Trump accusers may be coming forward, according to attorney Gloria Allred, who said women have contacted her office in recent days. \n \"The dam has broken, and more women will be coming forward,\" she said. \n The stories about Trump and his countercharges against Clinton's husband have plunged an already rancorous campaign to new lows. They also have distracted attention from the release of thousands of hacked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta that included some potentially damaging information. \n A new batch indicated today that her 2008 presidential campaign had tried to move the Illinois Democratic primary to a later date, believing it might help her. The emails are being parceled out by WikiLeaks. \n For Trump, the cumulative effect of recent revelations and allegations about his personal life appears to be a tumble in the battleground states he needs to win in November. What was already a narrow path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory has virtually disappeared unless there's a significant shake-up before Nov. 8 \n He promised today to focus on issues in the final weeks, even as his campaign crafted plans to highlight decades-old accusations against Bill Clinton. \n Trump confidant and informal adviser Roger Stone has long encouraged him to make Bill Clinton's alleged assaults a centerpiece of the campaign. Steve Bannon, the campaign's chief executive, until recently ran a conservative website that eagerly promotes conspiracy theories about the Clintons. \n Back in New Hampshire, Michelle Obama said, \"Enough is enough.\" \n If Americans let Trump win the election \"we are telling our sons it's OK to humiliate women. We are telling our daughters this is the way they deserve to be treated. We are telling all of our kids that bigotry and bullying is perfectly acceptable.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump calls female accusers 'horrible, horrible liars'"}

{"date": "October 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n University of Pittsburgh researcher Robert Gaunt prepared Nathan Copeland for research testing of brain implants, in Oct. 2015, that could help the paralyzed man feel sensation in his own hand while using a mind-controlled robotic arm. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb A paralyzed man is regaining a sense of touch while using a mind-controlled robotic hand, feeling subtle pressure in his own fingers when the artificial ones are touched. The experiment reported today is an early step in the quest to create prosthetics that can feel. \n How it works: Tiny chips implanted in Nathan Copeland's brain are bypassing his broken spinal cord, relaying electrical signals that govern movement and sensation to and from that robotic arm. \n When University of Pittsburgh researchers blindfolded Copeland, he could correctly identify which robotic finger they touched 84 percent of the time. \n \"The majority of them, it felt like a pressure or a tingling\" in his own corresponding finger, said Copeland, 30, of Dunbar, Pennsylvania. When a researcher touched two fingers at the same time, \"I just laughed and I said, 'Are you trying to be tricky or something?\" \n Harnessing brain waves to power prosthetics is a hot field, with a goal of giving the disabled more independence and improving artificial limbs for amputees as well. Headlines in recent years have reported experiments that let paralyzed people move a robotic arm to touch a loved one or take a drink simply by imagining the motion. Their thoughts activate brain implants that relay electrical signals needed to command movement. The signals are transmitted through a computer to the robotic limb. \n What's new is recreating sensation using this brain-controlled technology. After all, proper motion depends on more than muscle movement. Reach for something and that sense of touch helps you naturally grasp with just enough force to hang on while not either dropping something or crushing it. \n \"It's not only that emotional connection we get,\" said Robert Gaunt, a Pittsburgh assistant professor of rehabilitation who led the new study. \"People have an incredibly difficult time interacting with objects, picking objects up, manipulating them, doing fairly basic things with the hand if they don't have a very basic sense of touch.\" \n Step one is placing sensors in prosthetics. The next hurdle is how to allow feedback to and from those sensors. For amputees, some scientists are attempting to wire nerves left in the remaining part of the person's natural limb directly to the robotic arm. \n That's not possible if a spinal cord injury has interrupted the messages that normally flash between the hand and the brain. But previous monkey research had suggested brain implants could bridge that gap. So surgeons at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center implanted electrodes in part of Copeland's brain that controls what his hands feel. \n Electrically stimulating those cells worked even though the car wreck that left Copeland mostly paralyzed happened over a decade ago, Gaunt noted. \n \"This shows you can get natural sensation\" through the brain implant, added Pittsburgh neurobiologist Andrew Schwartz. \n Today's report in Science Translational Medicine details the first six months of experiments after Copeland received the brain implants in March 2015. The ongoing research is becoming more sophisticated, as he picks up objects while the electrodes stimulate different amounts of force, Copeland said in a phone interview. \n While the work is in just one patient, it's a step toward creating touch capability, said Richard Andersen, a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology whose team also studies mind-controlled prosthetics and is about to begin a similar experiment. \n \"It still needs to be determined if this tactile feedback will improve performance\" in using the robotic arm, Andersen cautioned. \n Copeland doesn't get to take the robotic arm home but is proud of helping to advance the science. \n \"Technically when it's over, I will have netted nothing except having done some cool stuff with some cool people,\" Copeland said. \"It's cheesy but, Luke Skywalker loses his hand and then basically the next day he's got a robot one and it's working fine. We have to get to that point, and to do that, someone has to start it.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Paralyzed man feels touch through mind-controlled robot hand"}

You never really know what you're walking into,\" Evans said. \"And I think we see right now the dangers of our job.\" \n Two police officers in Palm Springs, California, were killed last weekend when they responded to a domestic violence call. Police there said the officers had just asked a man to come out of his family's home Saturday when he opened fire through a closed front door. \n The Boston suspect was identified as Kirk Figueroa, 33, of East Boston. \n Figueroa described himself as a Boston constable, a former member of a U.S. Army Reserve military police unit, a bounty hunter in California and a former corrections officer. He also said he was trained in mixed martial arts. Constables are authorized to serve subpoenas and other legal documents. \n Evans said Figueroa fired at the officers late Wednesday night shortly after they arrived at a home in the city's East Boston neighborhood on a report of a fight between roommates. Several other officers who were stationed outside ran inside and exchanged gunfire with the suspect. \n \"Two of the officers dragged their fellow officers out of the line of fire so they were in a protected zone, and the officers continued to engage in a gun exchange,\" Evans said. \n The officers shot and killed the suspect and then began administering first aid to the wounded officers, one a 28-year veteran, the other a 12-year veteran of the force. \n \"One officer had his hand in one of the wounds and I think that was instrumental in getting the officer down to Mass General quickly,\" Evans said. \n Both officers were taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, where they were being treated for serious injuries. Nine other officers were being treated at Tufts Medical Center for trauma, stress and minor injuries. \n Police, initially concerned that their might be a second suspect, ordered residents to shelter in place.

{"date": "October 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Thailand King Bhumibol Adulyadej acknowledged the crowd in Bangkok during the June 2006 celebrations of the 60th anniversary of his accession to the throne. Thailand's Royal Palace said on Thursday that Thailand's King Bhumibol, the world's longest-reigning monarch, died at age 88. \n BANGKOK \u00bb Grieving Thais went to work dressed mostly in black Friday morning, just hours after the palace announced the death of their beloved King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the politically fractious country's unifying figure and the world's longest-reigning monarch. He was 88. \n Traffic and businesses appeared to be running normal, but many Thais \u2014 some seen crying \u2014 were dressed in muted colors and there was a somber mood on the streets following an outpouring of sorrow on Thursday when the king's death was announced. Television channels ran shows devoted to the king's life. \n The news had been expected, and hundreds of people had gathered since Wednesday at Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital, where Bhumibol had been treated for various ailments for much of the past decade. Many sobbed loudly, clutching each other in anguish and shouting \"Long live the king.\" \n \"There is no word to explain my feeling right now,\" Gaewkarn Fuangtong, a humanitarian worker, said in Bangkok's financial district. \n \"I lost one of the most important people in my life. I feel like I haven't done enough for him. I should have done more. I will do good, do better for his sake.\" \n The government announced a one-year mourning period and a 30-day moratorium on state events, and all public offices and schools will fly flags at half staff for 30 days. \n But businesses, tourist attractions and public transport were to remain open Friday because of the government's desire not to hurt the sputtering economy. \n \"The stock market, investments, other businesses should not stop. Do not try to let the country lose its credibility, especially in the case of impact on the stock exchange,\" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said in a televised address to the nation. \n He said Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn will succeed the king under the constitution, but had asked for more time to mourn with the nation before ascending the throne. No date has been set for his coronation. \n Most Thais have seen no other king in their lifetime and thought of Bhumibol, who reigned for 70 years, as their father and the embodiment of goodness and godliness. \n Although a constitutional monarch, he wielded enormous political power and served as a unifying figure during Thailand's numerous political crises. But in recent years, he suffered from a variety of illnesses that affected his kidneys, brain, lungs, heart and blood. He remained publicly detached from recent political upheavals, including the 2014 coup that brought Prayuth, an army general, to power. \n \"Since I was young I saw him work really hard, and now it's hard to explain. I feel numb inside,\" said Danaiwut Wiroonpiti 26, a photographer who was crying outside the Grand Palace where the king's body will be taken in a procession Friday. \"He's the center of all Thai people. It's like we lost the main pillar of our lives, the person who holds us together. I can't hold my tears.\" \n Portraits of Bhumibol displayed in most Thai homes and businesses generally depict him in arduous travels to remote villages, where he often went to see the situation of his subjects first hand. \n But recently, whenever Bhumibol appeared in public, he was in wheelchair, waving feebly at his subjects. Even those rare appearances stopped as he became confined to the hospital. \n On Sunday, the palace announced his health had become \"unstable,\" and on Wednesday, Vajiralongkorn rushed back from Germany, Prayuth canceled a trip abroad and royal family members began gathering at Siriraj Hospital. \n He died a little before 4 p.m. on Thursday, the palace said. His death was announced three hours later in a broadcast carried simultaneously by all TV stations. \n \"Even though the board of doctors has closely monitored and treated him to the best of its abilities, the king's condition never improved,\" the palace said in a statement. It said he passed away peacefully. \n \"He is now in heaven and may be looking over Thai citizens from there,\" Prayuth said in a statement. \"He was a king that was loved and adored by all. The reign of the king has ended and his kindness cannot be found anywhere else.\" \n Messages of condolences poured in from across the world. \n \"With a creative spirit and a drive for innovation, he pioneered new technologies that have rightfully received worldwide acclaim,\" U.S. President Barack Obama said. \"His majesty leaves a legacy of care for the Thai people that will be cherished by future generations.\" \n French President Francois Hollande hailed the king for \"exceptional human qualities \u2026 his profound sense of justice, his care for modernity and sustainable development.\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described him as \"one of the tallest leaders of our times.\" \n Bhumibol Adulyadej (pronounced poo-mee-pon ah-dun-yaa-det) became king in 1946. He anchored the Southeast Asian country through violent upheavals at home and communist revolutions next door with a blend of majesty and a common touch. \n There is great concern about the succession, since Vajiralongkorn has not earned the same respect as his father. \n Government spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said for the next 30 days all TV and radio stations, including online media, will broadcast the same programs provided by a government-controlled pool. He did not specify foreign TV channels in the rule, but on Thursday night all channels on the country's main satellite TV service, including BBC and CNN, were replaced by the pool footage. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Thais gripped by grief after beloved king's death"}
