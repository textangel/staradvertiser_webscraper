Other neighborhoods have been permitted but told they might have to evacuate again during the weekend. Homes west of the lake will remain under evacuation. \n Gov.

{"date": "October 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin makes a statement during the appointment of the Secretary-General designate, Antonio Guterres of Portugal, at United Nations headquarters. \n UNITED NATIONS >> Russia's U.N. ambassador said that tensions with the United States are probably the worst since the 1973 Mideast war. \n But Vitaly Churkin said Friday that Cold War relations between the Soviet Union and the U.S. more than 40 years ago were different than U.S.-Russia relations today. \n \"The general situation I think is pretty bad at this point, probably the worst \u2026 since 1973,\" he said in an interview with three journalists at Russia's U.N. Mission. \n But Churkin said that \"even though we have serious frictions, differences like Syria, we continue to work on other issues \u2026 and sometimes quite well.\" \n That wasn't the case generally during the Cold War. \n When Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar in October 1973, the Mideast was thrown into turmoil. And according to historians, the threat of an outbreak of fighting between the Soviet Union, which backed the Arabs, and the United States, Israel's closest ally, during the Yom Kippur War was the highest since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. \n Churkin said there are \"a string of things\" that have brought U.S.-Russian relations to their current low point. \n \"It's kind of a fundamental lack of respect and lack of in-depth discussions\" on political issues, he said. \n Churkin pointed to the U.S. and NATO deciding to build their security \"at the expense of Russia\" by accepting many East European nations formerly in the Soviet bloc as NATO members, and the United States pullout from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2001. \n One of \"the greatest provocations\" during President George W. Bush's administration was the 2008 NATO summit, which decided that Ukraine and Georgia should become NATO members, he said. \n Most important, he said, was the conflict that erupted in eastern Ukraine in April 2014, weeks after a former Moscow-friendly Ukrainian president was chased from power by massive protests. Churkin called it \"a coup\" supported by the United States. Soon after, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, which has led to Western sanctions against Moscow. \n Ties between Washington and Moscow have deteriorated further in the past month after the collapse of a cease-fire in Syria and intensified bombing on Aleppo by Syrian and Russian aircraft, and U.S. accusations that Russia is meddling in the U.S. presidential election next month. But despite the strained relations, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met Saturday in Lausanne, Switzerland, in an effort to look at possibilities for restoring a cease-fire. \n Churkin also pointed to other positive achievements in U.S.-Russia relations even at this low point. He cited agreements in the U.N. Security Council in recent years supported by Moscow and Washington, even on Syria \u2014 allowing cross-border aid deliveries without government approval and establishing a team of experts to determine responsibility for chemical weapons attacks in the country. He also cited council resolutions to combat terrorism. \n The United States and Russia were also key players in last year's nuclear deal with Iran, and last week they agreed on the Security Council's nomination of former Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres as the next U.N. secretary-general, which Churkin said was \"maybe the best success of the Security Council in the last five years.\" Guterres was elected by acclamation Thursday by the General Assembly. \n Churkin said Russia would like to normalize relations with the United States. \n \"If the change of administration is going to help, that's fine,\" he said. But even if President Barack Obama stayed for another term, which he is barred from doing, \"we would be pushed to trying to get back to normal in our relations.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Russia envoy: Tensions with U.S. are probably worst since 1973"}

It said the failed launch was made near an airport in the North's North Pyongan province. \n South Korea strongly condemns the launch because it violates U.N. Security Council resolutions that bans any ballistic activities by North Korea, the statement said. \n The U.S. military first reported the launch was attempted at 11:33 p.m. EDT Friday (12:03 p.m. Saturday local time) and that the missile didn't pose a threat to North America. The action brought harsh criticism from the U.S. \n \"We strongly condemn this and North Korea's other recent missile tests, which violate U.N. Security Council Resolutions explicitly prohibiting North Korea's launches using ballistic missile technology,\" said Cmdr. Gary Ross, a Pentagon spokesman. He said the U.S. would raise concerns at the U.N. \n \"Our commitment to the defense of our allies, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, is ironclad,\" Ross said. \"We remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation.\" \n North Korea has claimed technical breakthroughs in its goal of developing a long-range nuclear missile capable of reaching the continental United States. South Korean defense officials have said the North doesn't yet have such a weapon. \n It's the latest in a series of moves by North Korea aimed apparently at displaying a show of force. As recently as last month, it fired three ballistic missiles off its east coast, timed to get the attention of world leaders including President Barack Obama who were visiting the region for a series of summits. The U.N. Security Council subsequently condemned those North Korean launches and threatened \"further significant measures\" if it refused to stop its nuclear and missile tests. \n North Korea also conducted its fifth nuclear test last month and in all has launched more than 20 ballistic missiles this year, part of its program aimed at improving the delivery system for nuclear weapons. Earlier this year, North Korea successfully launched a Musudan missile in June after several failed attempts. \n Obama has vowed to work with the United Nations to tighten sanctions against North Korea, but has also said that the U.S. was still open to dialogue if the government changes course. \n The U.S. strategy has largely centered on trying to get China, North Korea's traditional ally, to use its influence to persuade the North to change course. North Korea is continuing missile test launches even as the United Nations Security Council is deliberating a further tightening of sanctions after the September nuclear test. \n Previously in August, Japanese and South Korean officials said a medium-range ballistic missile flew about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) and landed near Japan's territorial waters. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S., South Korea say latest North Korea missile launch fails"}

Bhumibol died Thursday after prolonged illnesses that had incapacitated many of his organs. He was 88. \n But confusion reigned outside the complex as police announced that it was closed for seven days. A while later, the complex gates were opened for people to visit one of the halls. The king's body, which is being kept in another building, will not be revealed to the public for another 15 days, authorities said. \n The crowds lining outside since dawn were subdued and orderly despite the swelling numbers. People shared food and handed each other water and wet towels to cope with the tropical heat. \n While announcing the king's death, the prime minister had said that the heir apparent, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, would ascend the throne. But hours later he said that the prince did not want to be immediately named king because he wanted more time to grieve along with the rest of the nation. \n Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam appeared on television Friday evening to explain that the head of the Privy Council, an advisory body to the king, is automatically the regent until a new monarch is crowned. \n There was no official statement that the council's head, 96-year-old Prem Tinsulanonda, had been named regent, creating uncertainty. But Wissanu said an announcement wasn't needed because the process is mandated by Thailand's constitution. Prem, a former prime minister, was one of Bhumibol's principal confidants and has ties to Bhumibol's popular daughter, Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. \n For ordinary Thais, the overwhelming focus was on grieving for Bhumibol, not the succession. \n \"I haven't even started to think about that; I'm still in mourning over the king,\" said Rakchadaporn Unnankad, a 24-year-old Bangkok office worker. \"I left home at 6 a.m. to come here. We were queuing for so long before they told us that we can't go inside the palace. There were people who have been here since 4 or 5 a.m.\" \n \"My tears started flowing out of me without my realizing,\" she said, recalling the news of Bhumibol's death. \"I didn't even want to hear the announcement.\" \n Buddhist funeral ceremonies began Friday night after a royal motorcade brought Bhumibol's body from nearby Siriraj Hospital to the Grand Palace complex. \n Bhumibol's death after 70 years on the throne was a momentous event in Thailand, where the monarch has been glorified as an anchor for a fractious society that for decades has been turned on its head by frequent coups. Over the past 10 years, Thailand has suffered particularly intense political turmoil pitting arch-royalists against those seeking a redistribution of economic and political power, allied with Thaksin Shinawatra, a populist prime minister ousted in a 2006 coup. \n But in recent years, Bhumibol had suffered from a variety of illnesses and seemed far removed from the upheavals of Thai politics, including the 2014 coup that brought current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, an army general, to power. \n \"His death means that the Thai political system must find an alternative focal point around which to unite the country's factionalized population,\" said Tom Pepinsky, a Southeast Asia expert at Cornell University. \n He said one challenge that royalists will face is the possibility that the monarchy's popularity will be undermined by the crowning of Vajiralongkorn, who does not command the same respect his father did. \n Another mourner, 48-year-old Suchart Warachawanwanich, said it was \"appropriate\" to not immediately accept the crown and let the nation grieve first. \n A one-year mourning period for the government has been declared together with a 30-day moratorium on state and official events. But no substantial demands have been made of the private sector. \n The government has only urged people to refrain from organizing entertainment events for a month, apparently mindful of the need to ensure that the sputtering economy, which relies heavily on tourism, does not suffer too much. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Thais flock to palace after king's death; caretaker in place"}

{"date": "October 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this March 1, 1934 file photo, Margaret Sanger, who founded the American Birth Control League in 1921, speaks before a Senate committee to advocate for federal birth-control legislation in Washington. Sanger's legal appeals eventually prompted federal courts to grant physicians the right to give advice about birth-control methods. Sanger founded two organizations that later merged to form the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \n NEW YORK >> Planned Parenthood's 100th anniversary celebrations this weekend come with a sense of relief for the group that traces its roots to a time when women could not vote and contraception was illegal. The organization, whose services include birth control, sex education and abortions, has survived largely intact in the face of violence, vilification and fierce efforts in Congress and many states to cut its funding. \n There's been some adverse impact: In Texas and Wisconsin, for example, some Planned Parenthood facilities closed after the states cut off funding streams. But most of the Republican-led defunding efforts have been thwarted, and multiple investigations related to the disposition of fetal tissue have thus far failed to prove wrongdoing on Planned Parenthood's part. \n Meanwhile, the organization has received strong backing from the Democratic Party, including presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and says support from the public is robust. \n \"The attacks have only strengthened our resolve,\" said Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards. \"I do believe we are in a stronger place today than a year ago, or five years ago.\" \n Planned Parenthood's foes, who denounce its role as the nation's leading abortion provider, show no signs of relenting. Eleven anti-abortion groups issued a joint statement depicting the 100th anniversary as \"a tragic milestone for our nation and a reminder of the millions of unborn children who will never have a birthday.\" \n However, opponents also express some frustration at Planned Parenthood's lobbying and fundraising skills. \n \"They put themselves in role of martyr while at the same time making money hand-over-fist,\" said Kristi Hamrick of Americans United for Life. \"The thing they're really good at is public relations and marketing and making money.\" \n Planned Parenthood dates its beginnings to Oct. 16, 1916, when Margaret Sanger, her sister and a friend opened America's first birth control clinic in Brooklyn. It was a challenge to mores and laws of the time, four years before the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote. \n The clinic was raided, and Sanger was convicted of disseminating birth control information. Undaunted, she founded two organizations that later merged to form the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \n Sanger's personal legacy is complicated. She opposed abortion \u2014 and yet the organization she founded now provides about one-third of America's estimated 1 million annual abortions. Her views on eugenics and racial issues remain a subject of bitter debate to this day. \n Over the decades, Planned Parenthood played pivotal roles in easing laws against contraception, popularizing the birth control pill and setting the stage for the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established a woman's right to have an abortion. \n Its clinics have been repeated targets of bombings, arson and protests. Last November, a gunman killed three people and injured nine at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado. The man charged with the attack said he acted because of his opposition to abortion. \n Threats against the organization escalated in mid-2015 after an anti-abortion group called the Center for Medical Progress began releasing secretly recorded videos alleging that Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue to researchers for a profit in violation of federal law. \n Investigations by several states and congressional panels produced no evidence of wrongdoing, though one probe in the U.S. House remains in progress. David Daleiden, the activist who orchestrated the undercover videos, predicts that the outcome of that investigation will spell the end of Planned Parenthood's \"abortion empire.\" \n Planned Parenthood says affiliates in two states continue to donate fetal tissue to medical researchers; they no longer accept any reimbursement to cover the costs of these programs. \n The videos rekindled long-running efforts to cut off Planned Parenthood's federal funding, which accounts for about one-third of its annual $1.3 billion budget. Republicans in Congress finally managed to get a bill to President Barack Obama that would have achieved that goal, but he vetoed it in January. \n Across the country, politicians in about two-dozen states have either enacted or proposed measures targeting Planned Parenthood with defunding. In most of those states, the cuts didn't take effect, often because of successful lawsuits filed by Planned Parenthood. \n \"They're doing the smart thing by going on offense,\" said anti-abortion leader Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List. \"I think there was a lot of damage done to them, but it's a longer struggle than I would like.\" \n Most of the taxpayer money received by Planned Parenthood covers birth control and other medical services for low-income women. By law, federal funds may not be used directly for abortions except in rare cases, but anti-abortion activists argue that the grants, by covering operational costs, free up other money to provide abortions. \n Statistics in Planned Parenthood's annual reports show how its operations have changed over the past decade. The nationwide number of local health centers has dropped from about 850 to about 650; there's been a decline in the number of contraceptive services provided; and the annual number of abortions performed rose from 264,943 in 2005 to 323,999 in 2014. \n Cecile Richards said Planned Parenthood is pleased that more women can now obtain effective contraception on their own, without the need to visit a health center. She attributed the increase in abortions to the fact that Planned Parenthood clinics often have been able to remain open in the face of tough state regulations that forced the closure of numerous other clinics. \n Looking ahead, what's on Planned Parenthood's agenda? \n Long-term, Richards said Planned Parenthood aspires to use technology to get more information and services to clients through digital means.

He has denied the claims, calling the women liars. \n Earlier Saturday, Trump took to Twitter to warn that \"100% fabricated and made-up charges, pushed strongly by the media and the Clinton Campaign, may poison the minds of the American Voter. FIX!\" \n \"Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and should be in jail,\" he added. \"Instead she is running for president in what looks like a rigged election.\" \n In a country with a history of peaceful political transition, his challenge to the election's legitimacy \u2014 as a way to explain a loss in November, should that happen \u2014 was a striking rupture of faith in American democracy. \n It was not the first time Trump has raised the idea the election is unfairly tilted against him, but it has become a resurgent theme for the New York billionaire and many of his supporters in the past several days as he's slipped in preference polls and faced allegations of sexual misconduct. \n Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, said in a statement that campaigns \"should be hard-fought and elections hard-won, but what is fundamental about the American electoral system is that it is free, fair and open to the people.\" \n \"Participation in the system\u2014and particularly voting\u2014should be encouraged, not dismissed or undermined because a candidate is afraid he's going to lose,\" he said. \n Trump also suggested at one point Saturday that Clinton had been on drugs during the last debate.

{"date": "October 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n John Podesta, a top adviser to Hillary Clinton, on Tuesday, Oct. 11, accused Roger Stone, a longtime Donald Trump aide, of receiving \"advance warning\" about WikiLeaks' plans to publish thousands of hacked emails and suggested the Republican candidate is aiding the unprecedented Russian interference in American politics. \n WASHINGTON >> Hacked emails released in daily dispatches this past week by the WikiLeaks group exposed the inner workings of Hillary Clinton's campaign leading up to her 2015 announcement that she would seek the presidency, and through this year's primary. \n The thousands of emails were hacked from the accounts of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. \n U.S. intelligence officials have blamed the Russian government for a series of breaches intended to influence the presidential election. The Russians deny involvement. \n Among the revelations from Podesta's hacked emails: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n WALL STREET SPEECHES \n The campaign asked former President Bill Clinton to cancel a planned speech to a Wall Street investment firm last year because of concerns the Clintons might appear to be too cozy with Wall Street just as the former secretary of state was about to announce her White House bid. \n Clinton aides wrote that Hillary Clinton did not want her husband to cancel the speech, but was eventually convinced that canceling was the right step. \n Campaign manager Robby Mook said he realized canceling the speech would disappoint both Clintons, but said, \"it's a very consequential unforced error and could plague us in stories for months.\" \n Clintons' paid speeches have been an issue throughout the campaign, particularly Hillary Clinton's private speeches to Wall Street firms. \n Bill Clinton was scheduled to speak to Morgan Stanley executives in April 2015, a few days after his wife was set to launch her bid for president. \n \"That's begging for a bad rollout,\" Mook wrote in an email from March 11, 2015. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n SHUFFLING PRIMARY DAYS \n The Clinton campaign tried to move the Illinois presidential primary to a later date. The campaign said a contest held after the Super Tuesday primaries might stop momentum for a moderate Republican candidate, and it emphasized that Clinton and her husband \"won't forget\" a political favor. \n The email, from Mook to Podesta, said Obama administration officials should use their connections in the president's home state to try to push back the March 15 Illinois primary by at least a month. \n \"The overall goal is to move the IL primary out of mid-March, where they are currently a lifeline to a moderate Republican candidate after the mostly southern Super Tuesday,\" Mook wrote. \"IL was a key early win for (GOP presidential candidate Mitt) Romney\" in 2012. \n \"The Clintons won't forget what their friends have done for them,\" he added. \n Mook suggested that Bill Daley, a former White House chief of staff and longtime Illinois power broker, should reach out to Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan to make the request. \n The effort was ultimately unsuccessful. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n PRIVATE EMAIL SYSTEM \n As news broke last year about her use of a private email server, one of Clinton's top aides suggested simply releasing all the messages from her time as secretary of state. \n The email was sent on March 4, 2015, the day The Associated Press first reported that Clinton had been running a private server inside her home in New York. \n Within hours of AP's reporting, Republicans from the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued a subpoena demanding Clinton's emails regarding the deadly 2012 attacks on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya. \n Adviser Phillipe Reines proposed that Clinton should respond by tweet: \"No need for this, happy for you to have what I gave State. If they can't, I will. Bring a dolly!\" \u2014 referring to a moving cart. \n Clinton lawyer and chief of staff Cheryl Mills responded: \"Seriously?\" \n Reines, who had worked for Clinton at the State Department, reiterated that he was serious, though he suggested maybe a campaign spokesman could respond less \"flippantly.\" \n Mills appeared to like the idea, at least initially. \"Can we implement this in the next hour?\" \n It never happened. \n Instead, Clinton's team waited more than a year as the State Department pored through more than 55,000 pages of Clinton's work-related emails from her time as the nation's top diplomat. And the issue kept bubbling up, no matter how hard Clinton's team worked to put it behind her. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n HOW TO REPLY \n Clinton's campaign was slow to grasp the seriousness of the email controversy and believed it might blow over after one weekend. \n Two days after the AP report, her advisers were shaping their strategy to respond to the revelation. \n Campaign spokesman Nick Merrill optimistically suggested that the issue might quickly blow over. \n \"Goal would be to cauterize this just enough so it plays out over the weekend and dies in the short term,\" Merrill wrote on March 6, 2015. \n It did not, and instead became the leading example of Clinton's penchant for secrecy, which has persisted as a theme among her campaign critics and rivals throughout her election season. Clinton did not publicly confirm or discuss her use of the email server until March 10 in a speech at the United Nations, nearly one week after AP revealed the server's existence. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n BILL CLINTON'S BUSINESS \n There was consternation among those closest to Hillary Clinton about how Bill Clinton's business dealings might damage his reputation and potentially affect her presidential hopes. \n The emails also gave insight into tension and turmoil within the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state. The chief operating officer of the family charity was reported to be threatening to commit suicide over the stress. \n The messages that circulated among Podesta, Chelsea Clinton and former Bill Clinton aide Doug Band detail internal tensions that simmered inside the Clinton Foundation and appear to have played a role in Band's departure from the family charity. \n After Chelsea expressed concerns about Band and the private corporate advisory firm he co-founded, Teneo Holdings, Band wrote that she was \"acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues to justify what she's doing because she, as she has said, hasn't found her way and has a lack of focus in her life.\" \n Also in December 2011, Clinton Foundation chief operating officer Laura Graham contacted Band to complain that stress she blamed on the former president and Chelsea Clinton was causing her to consider suicide. \n Band wrote that when Graham called him, she was in her car parked near the water with her foot on the gas pedal. He said he dissuaded her from hurting herself. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n TRADE POLICY \n Hillary Clinton told bankers behind closed doors that she favored \"open trade and open borders\" and said Wall Street executives were best-positioned to help reform the U.S. financial sector, according to transcripts of her private, paid speeches that appeared in hacked emails released Oct. 7. \n Excerpts of the speeches given in the years before her 2016 campaign included some blunt and unguarded remarks to her private audiences, which collectively had paid her at least $26.1 million in speaking fees. Clinton had refused to release transcripts of the speeches, despite repeated calls to do so by her Democratic primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders. \n Among the emails was a compilation of excerpts from Clinton's paid speeches in 2013 and 2014. It appeared campaign staff had read all Clinton's speeches and identified passages that could be potentially problematic for the candidate if they were to become public. \n One excerpt put Clinton squarely in the free-trade camp, a position she has retreated on significantly during the 2016 election. In a talk to a Brazilian bank in 2013, she said her \"dream\" is \"a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders\" and asked her audience to think of what doubling American trade with Latin America \"would mean for everybody in this room.\" \n Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has made opposition to trade deals a cornerstone of his campaign. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "A look at hacked emails from Clinton's campaign chairman"}

McGillivray, 36, told The AP that Trump's denial in last Sunday's presidential debate that he had ever groped women prompted her to come forward after years of brushing off an incident from 2003. She told The Palm Beach Post for a story published on Oct. 13, that while she was backstage at a concert at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, when he grabbed her buttocks. \n A number of women have come forward recently to say they were assaulted, groped or kissed without consent by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. \n Several have said they were moved to go public after listening to Trump boast about such behavior in a 2005 video, in which he bragged about using his fame to force himself on women. \n Trump has denied the accusations of sexual misconduct and said the women are liars. He has apologized for his comments on the video, which was disclosed this month, but also dismissed them as \"locker-room talk\" and a distraction from the campaign. \n A look at the women and their allegations: \n \u2014Summer Zervos, 41, says Trump made aggressive, unwanted sexual advances in a Beverly Hills, California, hotel room in 2007. A former contestant on \"The Apprentice,\" Zervos says she contacted Trump to ask for a job. He later invited her to dinner, and when she met him at his hotel, Zervos said, Trump almost immediately began kissing her and placed his hand on her breasts. \n \u2014Kristin Anderson, 46, told The Washington Post that she was sitting on a couch with friends at a New York nightclub in the early 1990s when someone reached up her skirt and touched her through her underwear. Anderson, then in her early 20s, said she pushed the hand away, turned around and recognized Trump as the man who had groped her. \n \u2014Jessica Leeds, 74, told The New York Times that Trump groped her on an airplane more than three decades ago. Leeds says the two were seated next to each other when Trump lifted the armrest separating them and began to touch her, grabbing her breasts and trying to put his hand up her skirt. Leeds called the incident an \"assault.\" \n \u2014Rachel Crooks says Trump kissed her without invitation in 2006 when she was a 22-year-old receptionist for a real estate firm located at Trump Tower. Crooks told the Times she was meeting Trump for the first time when he took her hand to shake it and would not let go. He began kissing her cheeks and then kissed her on the mouth, she told the paper. \n \u2014Mindy McGillivray, 36, of Palm Springs, Florida, says Trump groped her after she attended a Ray Charles concert at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in 2003. McGillivray told The Palm Beach Post she was standing with a group of people after the show and Trump came up behind her and grabbed her buttocks. \n \u2014Natasha Stoynoff, a reporter for People magazine, says Trump forced himself on her in 2005, when she was interviewing him for a feature on the one-year anniversary of his marriage to Melania Trump. Stoynoff wrote in an article published on the magazine's website that Trump was giving her a tour of his Mar-a-Lago mansion when he said he wanted to show her a special room. He shut the door \"and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat.\" \n \u2014Temple Taggart, a former Miss Utah, says Trump kissed her on the mouth more than once when she was a 21-year-old contestant in his Miss USA beauty pageant. Taggart initially told her story to the Times in May. She said she was struck by how Trump's comments from the 2005 video mirrored her experience. \n \u2014Jill Harth, a former business associate, told the Times that Trump put his hands under her skirt during a business dinner in 1992 and, on another occasion, tried to force himself on her. Harth sued Trump accusing him of sexual harassment in 1997. She dropped the lawsuit Trump after he settled a separate breach of contract suit. \n \u2014More than 20 former crew members, editors and contestants on Trump's \"Apprentice\" reality show described a pattern of crass behavior and demeaning comments on the set. Trump repeatedly addressed women with sexist language, rated female contestants by the size of their breasts and talked about which ones he'd like to have sex with, the people told The Associated Press. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "A look at the women making allegations against Trump"}

{"date": "October 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This Oct. 13, 2016 photo shows the U.S. Navy's newest guided-missile destroyer, the future USS Zumwalt, docked in Baltimore. The destroyer's commissioning ceremony is set for Oct. 15 during the inaugural Maryland Fleet Week. \n BALTIMORE >> What's a ride like in the Navy's largest and most sophisticated new destroyer? Capt. James Kirk compares it to \"a really souped-up sport utility vehicle.\" \n \"It's not like a Ferrari, but it's like a very big SUV that is made to go very fast,\" says Kirk, commanding officer of the futuristic USS Zumwalt that's being commissioned Saturday in Baltimore. \n With a price tag of at least $4.4 billion, the guided missile destroyer is perhaps more like a stealthy Rolls-Royce. The company manufactured the ship's propellers and generator sets. The Zumwalt also features an unconventional wave-piercing hull. \n \"Very smooth,\" is how Lt. Cmdr. Nate Chase described the ride. \"You had no fear of having an open cup of coffee and getting jerked around, like some of these other ships.\" \n Here are some other details about the Zumwalt: \n STEALTH \n The 610-foot-long warship is sleek, with an angular shape to minimize its radar signature. It looks like a much smaller vessel on radar. Quieter than other ships, the Zumwalt is hard to detect, track and attack. A composite deckhouse hides radar and other sensors. Its powerful new gun system can unload 600 rocket-powered projectiles on targets more than 70 miles away. \n POWER \n Weighing nearly 15,000 tons, the ship's advanced technology and capabilities allow it a range of defensive and offensive missions to project power, wherever it is needed. Kirk says it generates 78 megawatts of power, \"enough power to power a medium- to small-sized city.\" With a motto of Pax Proctor Vim (Peace Through Power), it's unique capability to generate power could be used in ways perhaps not even envisioned yet, such as in the testing and use of laser and directed-energy weapon systems. \n MISSILES \n The Zumwalt will be able to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles, Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles, standard surface-to-air missiles and anti-submarine rockets from 80 missile tubes. \n CREW \n With 147 officers and sailors, the Zumwalt's crew is the smallest of any destroyer built since the 1930s, thanks to extensive automation. All sailors are cross-trained, and there's more sharing of tasks on the Zumwalt. Sailors have staterooms, instead of bunk rooms with dozens of people in them. \"So, when they wake up, they wake up to only one or two alarm clocks, not four, not 50,\" Kirk says. \n REFORMER \n The ship is named after the late Adm. Elmo \"Bud\" Zumwalt, who earned the Bronze Star in World War II and commanded small boats that patrolled the Mekong Delta in the Vietnam War. He became the youngest chief of naval operations and earned a reputation as a reformer, who fought racism and sexism. \"He changed our Navy in massive ways, some to make the fleet a more potent fighting force but most importantly he reformed the institution of the Navy to be more just and fair to all its sailors, making sure that all sailors regardless of race, creed, color, faith, had an opportunity to serve in whatever capacity that their heart and their passion desired to,\" Kirk said. \n THE BRIDGE \n On the bridge, there are 180-degree windows and chairs for the ship's captain and executive officer to command the vessel and plenty of video monitors. \n STAR TREK? \n Kirk rolls with questions about his sharing the first and last name of the fictional captain of the Starship Enterprise, telling reporters to \"live long and prosper.\" But he says his parents named him after his grandfather, not Capt. James T. Kirk of \"Star Trek.\" \n \"I have interrogated them about this a great deal \u2014 more over the last couple of years than before \u2014 and they tell me, no, it was all about my grandfather,\" Kirk says. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Navy's new destroyer rides like 'a really souped-up' SUV"}

It wasn't clear whether they made any progress. \n With the Syrian and Russian governments pressing an offensive against rebel-held parts of the city of Aleppo, no one predicted a breakthrough and there were no immediate claims of one. The meeting in Switzerland concluded without apparent plans for a news conference, a joint statement or anything else that might signify a success. \n U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry led the renewed talks, joined by a familiar cast that included Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the top envoys from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Qatar, Egypt and Jordan. \n \"We're working very hard,\" Kerry told reporters in front of the eight other diplomats. \n Days of deadly airstrikes in Aleppo prompted Kerry last month to end bilateral U.S.-Russian engagement on Syria, including discussions over a proposed military alliance against Islamic State and al-Qaida-linked militants in Syria. Last week he accused Russia of war crimes for targeting hospitals and civilian infrastructure in the Arab country. \n Nevertheless, Kerry reunited with Lavrov at the lakeside Beau-Rivage Palace in Lausanne, meeting with the Russian for almost 40 minutes before the larger gathering. U.S. hopes of any diplomatic progress appeared to rest squarely on Russia's cooperation. \n Kerry also met privately with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. \n The conflict has killed as many as a half-million people since 2011, contributed to Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II, and allowed the Islamic State to carve out territory for itself and emerge as a global threat. \n Residents of opposition-held eastern Aleppo have faced daily violence as Syrian President Bashar Assad's government seeks to take full control of the country's largest city. \n On Saturday, Syrian and Russian airstrikes hit several rebel-held neighborhoods amid clashes on the front lines in Syria's largest city and onetime commercial center, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Aleppo Media Center, an activist collective. Also, opposition fighters backed by Turkish airstrikes launched an offensive to try to capture Dabiq from IS, which confers special status to the northern Syrian town in its ideology and propaganda. \n In an interview this week with a Russian media outlet, Assad said a military victory in Aleppo would provide the Syrian army a \"springboard\" for liberating other parts of the country. \n Despite fiercely criticizing Syria and Russia, the United States doesn't seem to have an answer. \n President Barack Obama and the Pentagon have made clear their opposition to any U.S. military strikes against Assad's military. The U.S. is uneasy with providing more advanced weaponry to the anti-Assad rebels because of their links to extremist groups. And sanctions on Moscow are seen as unlikely step, given their limited impact after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea territory in 2014 and the weak appetite among America's European partners for such action. \n With no apparent Plan B, Obama directed his national security team on Friday to renew diplomatic efforts to reduce the bloodshed in Syria. The White House said it hoped the larger discussions with Russia and other key governments would \"encourage all sides to support a more durable and sustainable diminution of violence.\" \n Russia says it also wants a cease-fire, but describes the U.S. and its partners as the problem. \n In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Vitaly Churkin, Russia's U.N. ambassador, said this weekend's talks are focused on getting U.S.-backed, \"moderate\" opposition forces to break ranks with al-Qaida-linked fighters. \n Given the collapse of several cease-fires in Syria in recent months, Washington doubts Moscow's seriousness. And with rebel-held Aleppo poised to fall, potentially in a matter of weeks, there is deep skepticism that the Syrian and Russian governments want to stop the fighting just yet. \n Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he had instructed his foreign minister to make a proposal in Lausanne about fighting IS in Syria and Iraq. \n Saturday's gathering also brought together many of the major protagonists in Yemen's war, and discussions on that are likely. \n An investigation team with the Saudi-led coalition said Saturday that wrong information led to the bombing of a packed funeral in Yemen's capital last weekend that killed some 140 people and wounded more than 600. \n The U.S. struck radar sites belonging to Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis this week after a U.S. Navy ship took fire from the rebels. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Progress unclear after 4\u00bd hours of U.S.-led talks on Syria"}

{"date": "October 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A man battles windy conditions walking past storm debris on Laneda Avenue after a tornado reportedly touched down on Friday, Oct. 14, 2016, in Manzanita, Ore. \n Portland, Ore. \u00bb A tornado struck an Oregon beach town, sending debris flying and toppling power lines and trees as strong winds and heavy rain walloped the Pacific Northwest. \n Thousands of people were without power as utility crews in the region prepared for what's expected to be an even rougher storm on Saturday. \n In Seattle, a 4-year-old boy and his father were injured by a falling tree branch Friday. The Seattle Fire Department said the child suffered serious injuries and the father minor injuries. \n The Coast Guard and other agency officials near Port Angeles, Washington, had made several trips to rescue 40 teenagers and six adults who became stranded at an outdoor recreation camp after they lost power and downed trees blocked their way out. \n The National Weather Service in Portland, Oregon, urged people to stay off roads as multiple streets in the city were flooded and impassable after heavy rains hit the area Friday evening. \n The tornado was reported on the northern Oregon coast. Tillamook County Sheriff Andy Long said it touched down in the city of Manzanita about 8:20 a.m. There were no reports of injuries. \n Debbie Harmon, owner of the Amanita Galley, said most of the damage is near the beach and downtown. \n \"It was a normal beach storm, which we get a lot of, and then out of nowhere the wind went 'whoooo,'\" she said. \"Suddenly the whole sky was filled with debris. It was just crazy. And then it just stopped.\" \n The mayor declared a state of emergency \u2014 a necessary step for the small town 90 miles west of Portland to be eligible for federal disaster money. \n Long said two businesses were destroyed and one home is uninhabitable. He says other homes have roof damage. The Red Cross opened a shelter for those affected. \n Julee Ward, who lives between Manzanita and Nehalem, said she awoke to violent thunderstorms and an eerie, dark sky. Her husband went outside to check on things after 8 a.m. and called for her to come out. \n \"Behold there was this big tornado flying about a mile away from our house,\" she said. \"There was debris flying everywhere \u2026 you could see the debris up in the funnel.\" \n Video shot by her husband showed a massive funnel spilling down from dark clouds. \n \"You could hear it howling too, which was the crazy part,\" she added. \n The National Weather Service said another twister made landfall about 9 a.m. near Oceanside, Oregon, but no damage was reported. A total of 10 tornado warnings were issued. \n The heavy rain created dangerous conditions throughout the region , as drivers tried to see out rain-pounded windshields and navigate through standing water on roads. \n In Oregon, Portland General Electric reported that more than 4,000 customers were without power early Friday. Pacific Power reported that 2,800 customers in coastal communities had no lights, down from a peak of more than 15,000. \n At one point, 15,000 customers were without power in Seattle. \n Portland had the rainiest Oct. 13 in its history. In addition, the National Weather Service says a 103-mph wind gust was recorded at Cape Meares. \n In Washington, Puget Sound Energy responded to scattered outages affecting thousands of people throughout the day. Lightning strikes hit the southwest Washington coast. \n In northern Nevada, winds gusting up to 76 mph fueled a wild fire that has destroyed at least 22 homes and charred 3 square miles of brush and timber in a rural valley between Carson City and Reno. \n Meteorologists expect a lull before the remnants of Typhoon Songda, which wreaked havoc in the western Pacific days ago, hit the Pacific Northwest on Saturday. Forecasters say wind gusts as high as 70 mph could sweep through Seattle. Mayor Ed Murray urged residents to avoid the city's many parks during the wet weekend weather. \n The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was rushing to fix a 300-foot section of a rocky coastal retaining wall in La Push, Washington. The jetty had previously failed and the only thing remaining was a gravel berm, according to spokeswoman Patricia Graesser. A breach of the wall would expose the Quileute reservation, a Coast Guard station, and marina to direct Pacific wave action. \n The same weather system is expected to affect Northern California, bringing rain, wind and coastal flooding to the San Francisco Bay Area through part of Saturday. \n The storm also carried the potential for flash flooding in central Idaho, where nearly 300 square miles of mountainous terrain burned in a blaze earlier this year. \n ___ \n Bellisle reported from Seattle.
