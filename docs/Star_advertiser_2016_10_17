But inside the cockpit, in the right seat, a robot with spindly metal tubes and rods for arms and legs and a claw hand grasping the throttle, was doing the flying. In left seat, a human pilot tapped commands to his mute colleague using an electronic tablet. \n The demonstration was part of a government and industry collaboration that is attempting to replace the second human pilot in two-person flight crews with robot co-pilots that never tire, get bored, feel stressed out or become distracted. \n The program's leaders even envision a day when planes and helicopters, large and small, will fly people and cargo without any human pilot on board. Personal robot planes may become a common mode of travel. Consider it the aviation equivalent of the self-driving car. \n The program, known as Aircrew Labor In-Cockpit Automation System or ALIAS, is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and run by Aurora Flight Sciences, a private contractor. With both the military and airlines struggling with shortages of trained pilots, defense officials say they see an advantage to reducing the number of pilots required to fly large planes or helicopters while at the same time making operations safer and more efficient by having a robot step in to pick up the mundane tasks of flying. \n The idea is to have the robot augment the human pilot by taking over a lot of the workload, thus freeing the human pilot \u2014 especially in emergencies and demanding situations \u2014 to think strategically. \n \"It's really about a spectrum of increasing autonomy and how humans and robots work together so that each can be doing the thing that its best at,\" said John Langford, Aurora's chairman and CEO. \n Sophisticated computers flying planes aren't new. In today's airliners, the autopilot is on nearly the entire time the plane is in the air. Airline pilots do most of their flying for brief minutes during takeoffs and landings, and even those critical phases of flight could be handled by the autopilot. \n But the ALIAS robot goes steps further. For example, an array of cameras allows the robot to see all the cockpit instruments and read the gauges. It can recognize whether switches are in the on or off position, and can flip them to the desired position. And it learns not only from its experience flying the plane, but also from the entire history of flight in that type of plane. \n The robot \"can do everything a human can do\" except look out the window, Langford said. But give the program time and maybe the robot can be adapted to do that too, he said. \n In other ways, the robot is better than the human pilot, reacting faster and with knowledge instantaneously available, able to call up every emergency checklist for a possible situation, officials said. \n It some ways, it will be like flying with a \"co-pilot genius,\" Langford said. \"The robot carries in them the DNA of every flight hour in that (aircraft) system, every accident,\" he said. \"It's like having a human pilot with 600,000 hours of experience.\" \n The ALIAS robot is designed to be a \"drop-in\" technology, ready for use in any plane or helicopter, even 1950s vintage aircraft built before electronics. \n But the robot faces a lot of hurdles before it's ready to start replacing human pilots, not the least of which is that it would require a massive rewrite of Federal Aviation Administration safety regulations. Even small changes to FAA regulations often take years to make. \n Elements of the ALIAS technology could be adopted within the next five years, officials said, much the way automakers are gradually adding automated safety features that are the building blocks of self-driving technology to cars today. Dan Patt, DARPA's ALIAS program manager, said he thinks replacing human pilots with robots is still a couple of decades away, but Langford said he believes the transition will happen sooner than that. \n Pilot unions, however, are skeptical that robots can replace humans in the cockpit. Keith Hagy, the Air Line Pilots Association's director of engineering and safety, pointed to instances of multiple system failures during flights where only through the heroic efforts of pilots able to improvise were lives saved. In 2010, for example, an engine on a jumbo-sized Qantas airliner with 450 people on board blew up, firing shrapnel that damaged multiple other critical aircraft systems and the plane's landing gear. The plane's overloaded flight management system responded with a cascading series of emergency messages for which there was no time to respond. By chance, there were five experienced pilots on board \u2014 including three captains \u2014 who, working together, were able to land the plane. But it was a close call. \n \"Those are the kind of abnormal situations when you really need a pilot on board with that judgment and experience and to make decisions,\" Hagy said. \"A robot just isn't going to have that kind of capability.\" \n David Strayer, a University of Utah professor of cognition and neural science who has studied the human-machine interface, agreed. \n \"Pilots are going to make mistakes, but a skilled human in that context, their expertise is quite amazing,\" he said. \"It's a high bar for the robot to meet.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "That pilot in the cockpit may someday be a robot"}

Rising seas in the Marshall Islands can be seen on many of the Atolls in the group as more coastline disappears and vegetation is washed away. \n WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u00bb The U.S. Air Force is spending nearly $1 billion to build a radar installation that will help keep astronauts and satellites safe by tracking pieces of space junk as small as a baseball. That is, if global warming doesn't get in the way.  \n The Space Fence is being constructed on a tiny atoll in the Marshall Islands that scientists say could be regularly swamped by rising seas within a couple of decades as a result of climate change. The salt water could play havoc with the equipment, the scientists say. \n And The Associated Press found that neither the military nor its contractor, Lockheed Martin, gave serious consideration to that threat when designing the installation and choosing a site, despite warnings from the island nation's environmental agency. \n The future \"does not look good for a lot of these islands,\" said Curt Storlazzi, an oceanographer with the U.S. Geological Survey who is leading a study at Kwajalein Atoll, where the Space Fence complex is being built. \n Dana Whalley, a civilian who is managing the Space Fence program, said that the radar installation has a projected lifespan of 25 years and that he doesn't expect sea levels to rise enough over that period to cause a problem. But if necessary, he said, the base could take steps to improve its seawalls. \n Still, because of budget pressures, military equipment is often used well beyond its projected lifespan. In fact, a key part of the radar tracking system that the Space Fence replaces was built during the dawn of the space age and was badly outdated by the time it was shut down 50 years later in 2013. \n Midway between Hawaii and Australia, the Marshall Islands are specks of land that typically poke just a few feet above the Pacific Ocean, making them some of the world's most vulnerable places to rising seas. \n The U.S. military has a longstanding connection to the islands. Bikini Atoll was used as a nuclear test site after World War II. Kwajalein Atoll, a battle site during the war, is now an Army base, a ballistic missile test site and an important part of the military's space surveillance network. \n The growing problem of space debris was highlighted in 2009, when an old Russian satellite smashed into a commercial U.S. satellite, creating hundreds of pieces of orbiting junk. The 2013 movie \"Gravity\" dramatized the threat to astronauts, who need to be safe from debris whether they're traveling on the International Space Station or in a rocket. \n Lockheed Martin won the $915 million Space Fence contract in 2014 and broke ground last year. When the radar system becomes operational in late 2018, it should increase the number of objects that can be tracked tenfold to about 200,000 and provide more precise information on their orbits. \n The Space Fence installation will include digital transmitters and receivers as well as power and cooling facilities. About 15 people will operate and maintain it around the clock. \n The military chose the Marshall Islands because the Space Fence works best near the equator. But it means the installation is being built just 10 feet (3 meters) above sea level, or the height of a basketball hoop. \n Storlazzi said his study explored the point at which storms will cause the sea to wash clear across an island, completely submerging it, at least once a year. He said that's when an island will no longer be able to sustain most plant or animal life. \n He examined one island within Kwajalein Atoll and found that it will probably reach its tipping point within a few decades. He said the island on which the Space Fence is being built faces a similar threat. \n The flooding there will probably damage power cables, sewer lines and other electronics and hardware, he said. The seawater will erode land, he said, and eat away at everything from concrete to cars. \n \"When you get to the point where water is going over the top of the island annually, it will affect a lot of daily life, whether it's related to the Space Fence or other operations, like moving food around,\" he said. \n The study, funded primarily by the Defense Department, has not yet been peer-reviewed or published. But it paints a much more dire future for the atoll than earlier studies. \n \"We are talking the next couple of decades, not centuries, as previously thought,\" Storlazzi said. \n He said his team studied the underwater contours of the islands and showed how coral reefs will become less effective as breakwaters when sea levels rise. \n The Marshall Islands base is among dozens of U.S. military sites threatened by climate change. A July report by the Union of Concerned Scientists analyzed 18 military installations along the U.S. East and Gulf coasts. It found that with just a moderate rise in sea levels, 16 could flood 100 times a year by 2050. \n Last October, strong winds and waves battered Kwajalein Atoll. Ferries were canceled and a dock was damaged, forcing the base to take the unprecedented step of hosting 845 Marshallese day workers overnight. \n Whalley said the military investigated threats, including ocean flooding, in an environmental assessment of the site before beginning construction. \"The over-wash threat, if you will, is built into the government requirements of the site,\" he said. \n Yet that 2014 assessment, which runs over 100 pages and addresses everything from sea turtles to the island's archaeological history, makes no mention of climate change, noting only that the Space Fence would be able to withstand a small earthquake-generated tsunami. \n A single line reads: \"Based on historical data, there are no anticipated issues with ocean tide and/or wave flooding.\" \n Lockheed Martin did not investigate the issue either. Bruce Schafhauser, Lockheed's program director for the Space Fence, said the Air Force asked it to design the system to withstand earthquakes but not rising seas. \n \"We don't have any insight into that,\" Schafhauser said. \"It has not been something that has been required from the Air Force.\" \n Schafhauser said the responsibility for finding a suitable location for the installation fell to the military. \n The Marshall Islands Environmental Protection Authority wrote a response to the environmental assessment, describing the U.S. military's overall treatment of the climate change threat to Kwajalein as \"wholly inadequate.\" It questioned whether the military was overstating the atoll's elevation and criticized its reliance on historical data when the problem is rising seas, a more recent phenomenon. \n The military responded in its final report: \"Detailed study of sea-level rise risks are beyond the scope of this document.\" \n Since then, leaders from the Marshall Islands say they have been working with the U.S. to improve environmental standards and ensure climate effects are seriously addressed in future military projects. \n Whalley said he plans to find out more about the USGS research at Kwajalein. \n \"It's the first I've heard about the study,\" he said. \"When they give you a billion dollars, you tend to focus on getting the radar built.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. ignored rising-sea warnings at radar site"}

{"date": "October 17, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Sept. 28 file photo, first lady Michelle Obama speaks at LaSalle University in Philadelphia, as she campaigns for presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \n DES MOINES, Iowa \u00bb Hillary Clinton was always expected to get a late-campaign enthusiasm boost from the White House. The surprise is that it's not coming from the president.  \n On a star-studded team of campaign surrogates \u2014 including President Barack Obama \u2014 the most valuable player of 2016 is undoubtedly first lady Michelle Obama. \n During a divisive political year, the hugely popular first lady has wowed voters with her powerful rhetoric. And she can be the emotional center to a campaign whose candidate is not known for projecting warmth. \n Last week, in a searing indictment of Republican nominee Donald Trump that was broadcast live by cable news networks, Michelle Obama said his recorded boasts about making unwanted sexual advances toward women had \"shaken me to my core in a way that I couldn't have predicted.\" \n With that, the first lady spoke in terms that Hillary Clinton rarely does, given accusations against her own husband that he's long denied \u2014 but Trump has raised. \n \"If Hillary Clinton were out there making these same arguments, we know how Donald Trump would respond, by attacking former President Clinton and bringing up old stories from the 90s,\" said Democratic strategist Lis Smith. \n Michelle Obama also had one of the most memorable lines of the Democratic National Convention, saying her family motto is: \"When they go low, we go high.\" \n Clinton has repeated that line in public several times since. \n \"Michelle Obama is seen as a truly authentic voice that whatever topic she speaks on, people feel that it's really coming from her bones,\" said Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh. \n To the Clinton campaign, Michelle Obama is a crucial asset who can connect with the Democratic base \u2014 particularly young people \u2014 but also reach independent and undecided voters. That was clear Monday, when the campaign signaled a push into traditionally Republican Arizona by announcing that the first lady would host an early-vote rally in Phoenix on Thursday. \n \"There is no more powerful advocate for our campaign,\" said Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri. \"Because the first lady isn't seen as a political figure, when she does speak out, it has a real impact.\" \n Even among Clinton's so-called \"uber-surrogates\" \u2014 the president, Vice President Joe Biden, former President Bill Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 Michelle Obama has stood out. Once a reluctant campaigner, she has grown more comfortable after more than eight years on the national stage, promoting her childhood obesity and education initiatives, hosting her own events and showing a playful side on talk shows and in interviews. \n \"Either she's Meryl Streep, or she's really genuine about this,\" said Robert Watson, an American studies professor at Lynn University. \"In this year of plastic candidates, Michelle just seems the most genuine one out there.\" \n Still, political analysts said the intensity of her advocacy for Clinton is notable. \n \"It's unusual for a sitting first lady, or a sitting president for that matter, to campaign so enthusiastically for a presidential candidate. They usually take a lower profile approach. This is indicative of how important both Obamas think this election is,\" said Katherine Jellison, chair of the history department at Ohio University who studies the first ladies. \n Anita McBride, a veteran of three Republican administrations, said Mrs. Obama's schedule is more flexible at this stage of the administration because she has held the final events for some of her biggest initiatives. \n \"It's sort of wrapping up time where's it's never wrapping up time for the president,\" said McBride, who was chief of staff to first lady Laura Bush. \"He still has everything coming to his desk every day. Now it's all about preserving the legacy and giving everything she can to the person she thinks can best reflect their values.\" \n So far this fall, Michelle Obama has campaigned in Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New Hampshire. She has done radio and television ads, including a television spot targeting early voters in Iowa, Ohio and Nevada. Arizona is up next, with more appearances expected after that. \n With three weeks until the Nov. 8 election, Clinton is leading in many national and battleground state polls as the race has been largely overwhelmed by Trump's inflammatory rhetoric and past sexual comments. Clinton is still contending with the slow release of hacked emails that have raised questions about her relationship to Wall Street and inner campaign workings, and will likely be asked about it when she and Trump debate one final time on Wednesday night, but Trump has taken up much of the spotlight. \n Michelle Obama so far is one of the few to escape the wrath of Trump, who has spoken harshly about various voting groups, his own Republican leaders and, lately, the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. \n \"I can't think of a bolder way for Donald Trump to lose even more standing than he already has by engaging the first lady of the United States,\" said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "First Lady Michelle Obama emerges as surrogate MVP"}

Because the U.S. won't officially confirm or deny if its ships have nuclear capabilities, New Zealand had imposed a blanket ban on U.S. ships. \n But Key said he'd taken advice from his own officials and was \"100 percent confident\" the USS Sampson wasn't nuclear powered or carrying nuclear weapons. \n \"I think it's a sign of the fact that the relationship between New Zealand and the United States is truly in the best shape it's been since the anti-nuclear legislation was passed,\" Key said. \"All of those last vestiges of the dispute that we had have really been put to one side.\" \n Key said he didn't think the result of the upcoming U.S. presidential election would affect the relationship. \n The dispute began in 1985 when the New Zealand government refused to allow a U.S. destroyer to visit. The U.S. responded by downgrading its military ties. New Zealand passed its nuclear-free law in 1987. \n The relationship improved after 2001, said Rear Admiral John Martin, the chief of the New Zealand Navy, when New Zealand agreed to send special forces and later a reconstruction team to Afghanistan. The U.S. and New Zealand signed defense agreements in 2010 and 2012. \n \"We've been working with the U.S. Navy for many decades and we're looking forward to hosting them down here,\" Martin said. \"A birthday is not complete without your friends.\" \n Mark Gilbert, the U.S. ambassador in Wellington, said the visit helped clarify the improvement in the relationship.

The lawsuit alleging NBA star Rose and his friends raped an incapacitated woman is all about consent. \n LOS ANGELES \u00bb Months before Derrick Rose took the stand to defend himself in the lawsuit claiming he and two buddies gang raped an ex-girlfriend while she was intoxicated, the NBA star was asked if he understood the word consent. \n \"No. But can you tell me?\" he asked at a deposition in June. \n Rose came to court last week with a much better grasp of the word that is central to the $21 million civil case, though his interpretation of the concept could still prove costly. \n No one disputes Rose and his childhood friends had sex with the woman in her apartment Aug. 27, 2013. The question is whether she consented \u2014 as the men claim \u2014 or whether she was too incapacitated to do so \u2014 as the ex-girlfriend says. \n There is no commonly accepted definition for consent, which is at the heart of a \"patchwork quilt\" of evolving laws on rape and sexual assault that in some cases require an affirmative agreement before sex, attorney Rebecca O'Connor said. \n \"It is murky and I think that's where we're seeing a lot states try to clear the weeds, if you will, and take this on and make it clear,\" said O'Connor, a vice president at the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. \"It's so complicated we can never just say it's black and white.\" \n Rape was once defined as intercourse with force against a woman's will, said Matt Lyon, a law professor at Lincoln Memorial University. Reform efforts in some states led to rape being defined more by the non-consent of the victim than a use of force by the perpetrator. States such as California have gone steps further in deciding consent can be withdrawn during sex and that a victim can be too incapacitated to agree to the act. \n \"One of the big criticisms against the modernization is the 'he said, she said,'\" Lyon said. \"It's so easy when it's clear there was force used, but here the woman may say it was rape though there's no physical evidence of force or that it was done against her will.\" \n That is the situation in the Rose case, where the woman said she blacked out and felt drugged after a night of drinking and hanging out at Rose's Beverly Hills mansion. With no physical evidence, the case hinges as much on her credibility as that of the three men. \n The woman said she went home from Rose's, vomited, and woke up around 3 a.m. to find Rose, Ryan Allen and Randall Hampton having sex with her against her will. \n Rose may have been tripped up by the word consent in his videotaped deposition, but he tried to recover at trial by defining it as both parties being in agreement. He also connected dots he felt outlined consent, including the ex-girlfriend's racy texts that started 17 hours earlier saying he made her \"horny.\" \n \"Maybe she sent suggestive texts or emails, but that doesn't prove she consented to it at the time,\" said Evan Lee, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings College of Law. \"A woman may be willing to have sex 23 hours in the day, but if he has sex in that 24th hour when she's not willing, then that's rape if he knows she doesn't want to.\" \n Rose assumed consent based on their sexual history, the fact she had never denied him and because of sex acts she initiated with him and his friends at the Beverly Hills house earlier in the night, he testified. He and his friends all said the woman seemed sober and she willingly participated in sex. \n The Associated Press is not naming her because it generally does not identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault. \n The topic of consent and whether someone is too incapacitated to agree to sex have been part of a national discussion after allegations that Bill Cosby drugged and molested dozens of women over decades and after outrage over a six-month sentence for ex-Stanford swimmer Brock Turner, who sexually assaulted a passed-out woman. \n The topic has even crossed into the presidential campaign with a recording surfacing of Republican candidate Donald Trump bragging about grabbing women's genitalia and several women accusing him of groping them. \n \"People are starting to recognize that even if they didn't fit whatever mythological circumstance people think needs to happen in order for it to be rape or sexual assault, that there is in fact that gray area where it's still nonconsensual,\" O'Connor said. \"Even if you wore a skirt or you didn't outwardly force someone off you, this may legally fall into the realm of sexual assault.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "She said, they said: Derrick Rose case boils down to consent"}

Biden Jr. on Monday released a federal report on the cancer moonshot initiative that highlights goals to accelerate the development of cures, including more widespread sharing of data and faster research and approval timelines for new treatments.  \n Biden presented to President Barack Obama the report from the Cancer Moonshot Task Force, a federal panel with representatives from the Health and Human Services Department, National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration and others. \n Both the president and vice president have been personally touched by cancer. Obama noted in remarks at the White House Monday that his mother died from cancer in her early 50s, while Biden's son Beau Biden died last year at the age of 46. \n \"I'm looking forward to not only laying the groundwork for the next administration to pick up the baton and run with it, but I know Joe and Jill and I and Michelle will all continue to be involved after we've left this office in making sure that this works,\" Obama said. \n Biden said he was optimistic about new emerging technologies and treatments that could save lives. \n \"The fundamental thing I've come away with is there is a need for a greater sense of urgency because there are available answers now to some cancers and there is enormous opportunity in sharing data,\" Biden said. \"There is real excitement.\" \n The report lists several accomplishments the administration achieved under the program since its inception earlier this year and outlines goals for fiscal 2017 and beyond. But one potential barrier to the initiative's future could be the lack of dedicated funding. \n The program has yet to receive any federally appropriated money. Neither of the pertinent spending bills for next year that the Senate and House Appropriations committees approved included funding directly for the moonshot initiative. Both, however, did increase funds for the National Cancer Institute and the NIH more broadly. \n The report highlights Obama's request for $1 billion in fiscal 2017 for the moonshot effort and alludes to the difficulty in advancing the program without additional federal money. \n \"Funding and resource limitations are an ongoing challenge. Nonetheless, the vision is to improve existing programs so that they work optimally, efficiently, and with a broader perspective on their opportunities to improve health care quality,\" the report states. \n While some patient advocates have expressed concern about the future of the program once Obama leaves office should Congress fail to allocate any money directly to it, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said earlier this year that, if elected, she would continue to \"carry out the mission\" Biden envisioned. \n The report identifies several focus areas to help achieve the program's goal of conducting 10 years of cancer research in only five years. \n Among those is a greater emphasis on the sharing of data. Biden has been highly critical of researchers' tendency to keep data and other information private. \n \"The way the system now is set up, researchers are not incentivized to share their data,\" he said earlier this year at the annual meeting of the nonprofit American Association for Cancer Research. \"Too often grants are given for what you've already done rather than what you are doing.\" \n That information is often viewed as proprietary by officials at institutions, such as academic medical research universities, because it helps them win federal grants from agencies like the NIH. \n In its report, the task force says the rapid sharing of data and subsequent analyses is imperative. The report also highlights the need to develop a workforce with the expertise necessary to analyze large volumes of data. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \u00a92016 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved  \n ", "author": "By Joe Williams CQ-Roll Call", "title": "Biden presents 'moonshot' task force report"}

He faces life in prison if convicted of murder. \n Allegations that Harris had sexually explicit online conversations with an underage girl are completely unrelated to the murder and child cruelty charges he faces in the death of his son, defense attorney Maddox Kilgore has said previously. \n But prosecutors contend that those alleged actions can provide evidence of a motive for the murder charges and can demonstrate Harris' state of mind leading up to and on the day of the boy's death. \n The 17-year-old, whose identity was shielded by Judge Mary Staley Clark, was 15 years old at the time she and Harris began exchanging sexual messages, according to Monday's testimony. \n They first began communicating with one another on the anonymous service called Whisper and later on another service called Kik, the Journal-Constitution reported. \n Eventually, the girl told Harris she was actually 15 years old, but that didn't deter him from continuing their conversation, she told jurors. \n \"He told me he wanted me to make him a naughty old man,\" she testified, adding he said he wanted to have sex with her. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Teen testifies to sexting with man in hot car death case"}

Vidinha was also charged with four counts of second-degree attempted murder. His bail was set at $1 million. \n At a news conference Monday, Acting Assistant Police Chief Dagan Tsuchida said police were called to the area multiple times that day, but the situation did not rise to the level of arresting the suspect during the initial call. The caller complained about a man making inappropriate comments and asked how to obtain a temporary restraining order. \n Later calls reported a man standing naked outside the residence and then shots being fired. \n At about 3:45 p.m. Saturday, Vidinha allegedly used a firearm to threaten three adults, two teenagers and a 9-year-old boy at a Kunia townhouse subdivision, police said. He allegedly fired the weapon multiple times into the home. \n A resident, who declined to give his name and lives in the same building as Vidinha and the victims, said he was watching football when he heard a couple of popping sounds similar to firecrackers. Moments later, he heard a barrage of gunshots. \n \"All I heard was pop, pop, pop, pop,\" said the resident while he stood in front of his building Monday morning. \n A gunshot penetrated the front of the victims' town-home, right next to their front door. \n The neighbor said the victims' rear sliding door also was shattered by gunshots. No injuries were reported. \n The resident said the firearm looked like a \"miniature M16.\" \n Police arrested Vidinha Saturday afternoon. \n Court records show that two women filed separate temporary restraining orders against him in 2008, accusing him of harassment.

{"date": "October 17, 2016", "text": "JAMM AQUINO / JUNE 30, 2015 \n Steven Levinson, former Associate Justice of the Hawaii State Supreme Court, poses for a portrait on June 30, 2015 in his residence in Manoa. \n Mayor Kirk Caldwell today appointed retired Hawaii Supreme Court Associate Justice Steven Levinson to the embattled Honolulu Police Commission. \n Levinson's appointment, which would run through Dec. 31, 2020, requires confirmation from the City Council. \n Levinson would replace commission Chairman Ron Taketa, who has been public face of the seven-member panel as it has fended off accusations that it has not done enough to address recent controversies involving Chief Louis Kealoha and HPD officers. \n Taketa, who has been a holdover since Jan. 1, will continue to serve until Levinson is confirmed. After that, the commission will need to pick a new chairman. \n Levinson was on the High Court from 1992 to 2008. Prior to that, he was a Hawaii Circuit Court judge. He has been a director with the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii since 2009. \n Levinson was the justice who wrote the 1993 opinion in the case Baehr v. Lewin, which said the state needed to show a compelling interest for denying marriage licenses to same sex couples. \n In an interview with the Honolulu Star-Advertiser shortly after his nomination was announced today, Levinson said he's aware of the criticism that's been lodged against the commission but wants to reserve comment on those issues until he's had a chance to sit-in and learn more. \"I'm going in with an open mind,\" he said. \n Levinson said, however, that he supports an amendment to the City Charter, before voters next month, that would allow the commission to subpoena witnesses or evidence, and makes it clear that the panel can remove or suspend the police chief for any reason at any time. The chief will also need to provide in writing the reasons for any disagreement with a Police Commission recommendation under the proposal. \n \"It's a step in the right direction that the Police Commission be given subpoena powers to put some teeth into its investigative functions,\" Levinson said, adding that he supports the other provisions in the amendment as well. \n The biggest of the controversies surrounding HPD is a widely publicized federal grand jury investigation into alleged wrongdoing on the part of Kealoha and his wife, Katherine. The two, meanwhile, filed a lawsuit against the city claiming that the Ethics Commission under former Executive Director Chuck Totto conducted an investigation against them that they believed was groundless. \n Mayoral challenger Charles Djou has blamed HPD's problems and the commission's handling of those issues on Caldwell. \n The mayor, however, said the main thing he can do is appoint commission members who are accountable to the public. \n In June, Caldwell appointed attorney Loretta Sheehan, who has openly voiced frustration that the commission has not done more to address the criticisms. Like Levinson, Sheehan supports the proposed Charter amendment giving the commission broader powers. \n Taketa, in May, said the proposal only clarifies the commission's authority. The commission can fire the chief and impose lesser forms of discipline as it sees fit. If Kealoha were indicted, he would not be automatically suspended, but the commission would take action against him if evidence of wrongdoing were discovered, he said. \n ", "author": "By Gordon Y.K.

Halsey sits under the window where authorities say someone threw in a flammable device that burned the campaign office. \n HILLSBOROUGH, N.C. >> Investigators combed through shards of glass, looked for residue of flammable accelerant and tried to narrow down the overnight hours when someone torched a local Republican Party office by throwing a flammable device through the window. \n Local party officials reopened a makeshift operation on folding tables outside the office today while uniformed police looked on. Plainclothes investigators looked for evidence at the scene as state, local and federal investigators divided up leads. \n Meanwhile, the head of the Arizona Republican Party said today that its office received a bomb threat and it likely will hire private security guards. \n Arizona Chairman Robert Graham says the office got a call around 3:15 p.m. from an adult who said there was a bomb in the building. \n Phoenix police responded and gave an all-clear to the situation about two hours later. \n The Hillsborough, N.C. mayor said he wasn't aware of any surveillance footage from the immediate vicinity, and the office sits where there wouldn't normally be foot traffic late at night \u2014 in a decades-old retail complex that backs up to a wooded area and is set back from a main road. \n A bottle filled with flammable liquid was thrown through the window of the Orange County Republican Party headquarters early Sunday, damaging the interior before burning out, according to authorities. Someone also spray-painted \"Nazi Republicans leave town or else\" on a nearby wall. The office was empty and no one was injured. \n \"We have had people working on it from three different federal agencies, state agencies, our local folks, all day today, running down leads, working different parts of the investigation,\" Hillsborough Police Chief Duane Hampton told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \n He declined to say how confident he was that the evidence would lead to an arrest. \n North Carolina's Republican Gov. Pat McCrory spoke to reporters at the office, saying he'd never seen anything like it in his political career. McCrory, who's been touring parts of the state ravaged by floods, said: \"To come back near our state Capitol and see a broken window from a Molotov cocktail is unimaginable.\" \n He also questioned why it took Hillsborough authorities several hours after the 911 call to release information publicly Sunday, suggesting they had initially treated the crime as merely vandalism instead of something more serious. \n But Hampton said federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were called immediately and arrived on the scene within an hour of his own officers. \n \"I certainly don't want anyone to think that we didn't take this seriously because we realized the implications right away,\" he said. \n The graffiti and remnants of the fire were discovered Sunday morning by 68-year-old Bobbie Sparrow, whose Balloons Above Orange shop is next to the GOP headquarters. She came to feed stray cats before church when she noticed the graffiti shortly before 9 a.m. \n \"I saw the hate in it. And the only reason they used the side of my building, because it was a blank canvas for a message to the Republican Party people,\" she said in an interview. \"I picked up my cellphone and called 911 and told them someone needed to get here immediately.\" \n County GOP chairman Daniel Ashley arrived Sunday morning to find the area roped off by yellow police tape. He said he believes whoever's responsible intended to burn down the building. \n \"I definitely think the reason they spray-painted that building there was because they thought this one wouldn't be here,\" he said, standing in front of his office. \n The violent act in the key battleground state has been condemned by public figures across the political spectrum, including Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump. McCrory's challenger, the state's Democratic Attorney General Roy Cooper also said the violence \"has no place in our democracy.\" \n Democrats started a campaign to raise $10,000 to reopen the GOP office, meeting the goal in less than 40 minutes and \"showing that Americans are thirsty for civility and decency,\" wrote the GoFundMe drive's creator, David Weinberger, a researcher at Harvard University. \n \"It's a great gesture. We appreciate it a lot, but I don't know how much of that we're going to get to use because of the campaign laws,\" Ashley said Monday. \n The walls of the multi-room office were covered in black char, and a couch against one wall had been burned down to its springs. Shattered glass covered the floor, and melted campaign yard signs showed warped lettering at the office in the town about 40 miles northwest of Raleigh. \n Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 3-1 in Orange County, which also includes Chapel Hill and the University of North Carolina campus. \n Blake Halsey, a 21-year-old college student who volunteers at the Orange County GOP office, answered calls Monday at a folding table outside the shattered front window. He grew up in the area and described the town as a \"melting pot\" for all political views. \n He said the attack made him think about his personal safety because he's worked after-hours recently at the office. \n \"It's sad to see America go this way,\" he said. \"The Constitution says we have free speech.

It's not acceptable. And I was surprised, because that is not the man that I know,\" she told CNN. \n She suggested that Trump may not have known his microphone was on, calling it \"kind of a boy talk\" that \"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush was encouraging. And she suggested that the women who have claimed in recent days that Trump made unwanted advances were attention-seekers who were making \"damaging and unfair\" accusations. \n \"I believe my husband,\" she said in the interview that aired tonight. \"My husband didn't do anything.\" \n Mrs. Trump also said it is fair game for her husband to appear with women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault, claiming the Democrats fired the first volley into the increasingly ugly war about the couples' private lives. \n \"They're asking for it. They started. They started from the beginning of the campaign putting my picture from modeling days,\" she said in excerpts released by Fox News ahead of the interview's broadcast. \"That was my modeling days and I'm proud what I did. I worked very hard.\" \n Melania Trump's image was used in a negative ad campaign during the Republican primary, but there is no evidence that the Clintons were involved. At the time, Donald Trump accused former rival Ted Cruz of being involved and responded by tweeting an unflattering image of the Texas senator's wife. Cruz also denied involvement. \n The interviews are Melania Trump's first moments in the public eye since the accusations over the last 10 days that have sent her husband's White House bid reeling. \n First, a 2005 video leaked of Trump using vulgar language to describe women and apparently boasting of sexual assault. And in recent days, several women have come forward to say that Trump had groped or sexually assaulted them. \n The Republican nominee has denied the claims, calling the women liars and belittling their appearances. \n In the interviews, Melania Trump deemed the celebrity businessman's comments on the leaked tape \"offensive to me and they were inappropriate.\" \n \"And he apologized to me,\" she said in an interview with CNN airing at the same time the crowd at her husband's rally in Wisconsin was chanting \"CNN sucks.\" \"And I expect \u2014 I accept his apology. And we are moving on.\" \n She said something similar in a statement released by the campaign after the video's release. She has also demanded retractions from a People Magazine writer who profiled the couple in 2005 and last week accused Donald Trump of an assault at the couple's Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, while Melania was out of the room. And she repeated her husband's assertion, which he makes without supporting evidence, that the media and Clinton campaign are working in tandem to sink the Republican nominee's campaign. \n Melania Trump has never filled the role of the traditional political spouse, only making rare appearances on the campaign trail. Her speech at July's national convention was initially praised until it was discovered that passages of it were lifted from Michelle Obama's 2008 convention address. \n Trump, who attended each of the first two presidential debates, was also lampooned on this week's Saturday Night Live. The long-running sketch show ran a video in which actresses playing Melania Trump, her two step-daughters and two of the candidate's most visible female allies did a version of Beyonce's feminist manifesto \"Lemonade\" in an act of rebellion against the candidate. \n The video ends with the Cecily Strong, the comedian playing Melania Trump, suggesting she wrote the song herself. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Melania Trump does not believe husband's accusers"}

He is in critical but stable condition. \n VALLEJO, Calif. \u00bb A gunman wearing body armor targeted two California police officers who were taking a break at a coffee shop in an ambush that failed when his gun malfunctioned, authorities said today. \n Adam Powell, 41, appeared in the doorway of a Starbucks and \"attempted to assassinate\" the two officers on Sunday, Vallejo Police Chief Andrew Bidou said. \n The officers were not injured because the battered weapon, its butt covered with duct tape or foil, appeared to jam. Powell of Suisan City was in critical condition after being shot by the officers during a foot chase. \n It was the latest attack on police across the country. Earlier this month, a man in body armor shot and killed two officers in Palm Springs who were responding to a domestic disturbance call at the home of an ex-convict's family. \n That shooting occurred just three days after Los Angeles County sheriff's Sgt. Steven Owen was shot and killed in Lancaster while answering a burglary call. Owen was the victim of \"a calculated execution\" by a parolee with a long history of arrests who pumped bullets into his body as he lay wounded, Sheriff Jim McDonnell said. \n Bidou said he attacks have led to a heightened sense of alert among police. \n He gave no further information on a motive for the attack in Vallejo, where the gunman kept trying to fire the assault-style weapon as he fled from the officers, police said, noting that the man was also carrying a loaded handgun. \n The officers \"were ambushed by somebody who has superior firepower,\" Bidou said. \n Police say Powell fled when he could not get the weapon to fire. \n Officers said they caught up with Powell about 100 feet from the Starbucks and he was shot three times in a neighborhood of small houses next to a freeway on-ramp. \n Jazmin Addison, who lives next to the intersection, said she heard more than a dozen shots. \"It was scary. I made my kids get down on the floor,\" she said. \n She later saw the suspect on the ground, with numerous police around him. \n Authorities said Powell had served prison time for robbery and drug-related offenses and was barred from possessing guns. \n Bidou said Powell is the father of a 2-year-old boy who may have accidentally shot himself earlier Sunday in Suisun City, about 50 miles north of San Francisco. The child was taken to a hospital for a gunshot wound. \n Police said preliminary information indicates the wound was accidental and self-inflicted. Powell was present when the child was shot and left the home before officers arrived, police said. \n In Palm Springs, prosecutors say a gang member killed two police officers and wounded a third. \n John Hernandez Felix, who has pleaded not guilty to murder charges, wore body armor and used armor-piercing ammunition when he opened fire with an AR-15 rifle on officers who came to the door, prosecutors said. \n Five Dallas police officers were killed in a sniper attack this summer and earlier this month, a gunman also wearing body armor was fatally shot after critically wounding two police officers in Boston. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Chief: Gunman tried to assassinate officers in California"}

An additional $1 million is going into efforts in Missouri and Indiana, both states with competitive Senate races, a small amount of TV time is being bought in Texas and media appearances are scheduled in Utah. \n At the same time Clinton is showing new signs of confidence, she faced fresh revelations about her use of a private server as secretary of state and hacked emails from a top campaign official's personal account. FBI records released Monday show that a senior State Department official unsuccessfully sought to lower the classification level of an email found on the server, a move Trump's campaign labeled collusion. \n The new questions highlight a dual reality of the presidential race: Even as Clinton has a growing advantage, she's been unable to put the biggest controversy of her campaign behind her. \n With her lead increasing, Clinton is unlikely to need any of the normally solid-red states to win the White House. But her team believes that a wide presidential margin of victory would help end Trump's political movement and undermine his intensifying claims that the election is rigged. \n On the other side, Trump's campaign dramatically expanded its ad buys in seven battleground states and announced plans to launch a $2 million advertising blitz in long-shot Virginia. \n \"Donald Trump is becoming more unhinged by the day, and that is increasing prospects for Democrats further down the ballot,\" said Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, who cited early voting and registration numbers to predict record voter turnout \n Democrats aren't the only targets of Trump's rhetoric about the legitimacy of the election system. \n In a Monday morning blitz of tweets, he lashed out at Republicans who have tried to tone him down, calling his own party's leaders \"so naive\" and claiming without evidence that major fraud is real. \n \"Of course there is large-scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive!\" he tweeted. \n There is no evidence to back up Trump's claims. A study by a Loyola Law School professor found that out of 1 billion votes cast in all American elections between 2000 and 2014, there were only 31 known cases of impersonation fraud. \n Trump's tweets show he is continuing to play a scattershot defense rather than make his case to voters, with just three weeks left and much ground to make up in opinion polls. \n Rather than campaigning in the tightest battlegrounds, Trump was spending much of Monday out of sight before speaking in Green Bay, Wisconsin, a state where Clinton is viewed as having an edge. Clinton was spending the day with advisers near her home in New York, preparing for the final presidential debate Wednesday night. \n Clinton's email use is certain to return as an issue in that faceoff, and Trump was given new ammunition. \n According to FBI records released Monday, State Department Undersecretary for Management Patrick F. Kennedy, a close aide to Clinton during her time as secretary of state, contacted an FBI official seeking to change an email's classification. Notes on the conversation describe discussion about a \"quid pro quo\" in which the email's classification would be changed and \"State would reciprocate by allowing the FBI to place more agents in countries where they are presently forbidden.\" \n The records indicate that Kennedy made that suggestion, but both the FBI and State Department said Monday that it was the unidentified FBI official. Neither the declassification nor the increase in agents occurred. \n In an online video, Trump called the records proof of collusion between the FBI, the Justice Department and the State Department \"to try to make Hillary Clinton look like an innocent person.\" \n Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said it is well known that there was disagreement among various government agencies \"about the decisions to retroactively classify certain material in emails sent to Secretary Clinton. \u2026 and we were not part of these disagreements that played out inside the government.\" \n Clinton's campaign also continues to answer for hacked emails being released by the thousands by WikiLeaks. \n On a brighter note for her, the Clinton campaign for months has been eyeing an expansion into Arizona, where Hispanic voters make up more than 15 percent of the electorate and Trump's sharp language about immigrants have left him vulnerable, said Republican pollster Whit Ayers, an adviser to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's re-election campaign. \n \"Trump has run against Hispanics,\" Ayers said. \"Consequently, Arizona is tailor made as an easily winnable red state where Trump could lose.\" \n Trump also leads in Indiana and Missouri, but U.S. Senate races in both states have become very close. In Indiana, former Sen. Evan Bayh is in a dead heat with U.S. Rep. Todd Young. In Missouri, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt is locked in a tight race with Democrat Jason Kander, Missouri's secretary of state. \n A former senator, Clinton and her team are clear-eyed about how closely her success as president would be tied to having her party in power on Capitol Hill. Senate Republicans already are casting themselves as a crucial check on her, signaling the fights to come. \n \"I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton, if she were president, would put up,\" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, said in a radio interview.

{"date": "October 17, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Brian Newby, executive director of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC), appeared at a public meeting in Arlington, Va. on Jan. 6. Emails obtained by The Associated Press show that Newby, now a top U.S. elections official, left behind an unfolding scandal in Kansas where he was having an affair with a woman he promoted in his previous job and used her to skirt oversight of their lavish expenses. \n WICHITA, Kan. \u00bb When Brian Newby took the helm of a federal election agency, he left behind an unfolding scandal in Kansas where he was having an affair with a woman he promoted in his previous job and used her to skirt oversight of their lavish expenses, prompting a local prosecutor to investigate, according to emails obtained by The Associated Press. \n The affair and resulting fallout was revealed in hundreds of emails ordered released after the AP sued Johnson County, the Kansas City suburb where Newby was the top election official before leaving to become executive director of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. \n The emails \u2014 coupled with hundreds more obtained from the Kansas secretary of state's office through a separate open records request \u2014 portray a rogue election official who berated employees and deliberately bypassed supervision. They also document a toxic workplace created by his affair with then Assistant Election Commissioner Jessica White, an apparent violation of county policy on intimate relationships with subordinates. \n In a June 2015 exchange from his work email to her personal address, the then-married Newby told White: \"You, my little lover, are so wonderful.\" In graphic language, Newby also describes a sex act he wishes he was doing with her, \"scheming and dreaming with you into the night.\" \n Newby and White did not respond to numerous phone and email messages seeking comment. \n Newby's penchant for ignoring supervision continued when he took the top federal job in November 2015 at an agency whose mission is to make voting easier. He enraged voting rights advocates when, without public notice or approval from agency commissioners, he tightened voting registration rules in three states. A federal appeals court last month temporarily blocked Newby from changing a federal voter registration form to require residents of Kansas, Alabama and Georgia to show proof of U.S. citizenship, saying it is \"difficult to imagine a more clear violation\" of federal administrative law. \n A scathing county audit of the Kansas election office found Newby intentionally circumvented oversight by charging expenses to White's government credit card, allowing him to review and approve his own spending. Auditors also said Newby and White made purchases without sufficient business justification and supporting documentation. \n Some emails offer a glimpse into an investigation opened by the district attorney's office. Newby's Kansas office had drawers full of phones, tablets and other equipment not listed in inventory. Tom Gottschalk, financial crimes investigator for the district attorney, asked in one email for access to the locked office to examine them. The investigator also wanted a list of everything the elections office had discarded as surplus in the last five years. \n Kristi Bergeron, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said she did not know the status of that investigation. \n In an email touching on his management style, Newby prodded an employee to speed up work on a project by noting he had \"terrorized\" two other employees. He copied one of those employees on that email, telling the person he was doing so in the event they wanted to commiserate or \"share the therapy sessions I undoubtedly caused.\" \n Newby promoted White to assistant election commissioner in January 2015, emails show. \n White at times publicly belittled other employees, often leaving them in tears, and some colleagues feared crossing her because Newby always backed her, said a former employee who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because of career concerns. One email sent to the secretary of state's office refers to numerous grievances filed against her with the county's human resources department. \n Newby would spend hours alone with her each work day in his closed office or in the warehouse where there is a workout area. They were frequently gone on business trips together, the former employee said. \n The evening before the local election in April 2015, a line of poll supervisors waited half an hour for a list from White because no one dared knock on his office door and interrupt the couple, the former employee said. \n Johnson County officials met with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and his staff on April 22, 2015, about \"several concerns\" dealing with the election office, according to an email from county spokeswoman Sharon Watson. The email does not specify the concerns. \n Kobach said through his spokeswoman that he was not aware of Newby's affair at the time he reappointed him to the Kansas job and recommended him for the federal position. \n \"Mr. Newby was, and remains, one of the most highly regarded election administrators in the United States. He has received national awards for his excellent and innovative work,\" Kobach told AP in a statement. \"It was for that reason that I re-appointed him to the position of Johnson County Election Commissioner in 2014. And it was for that reason that I later recommended him favorably to the EAC when I was asked my opinion.\" \n After auditors presented their findings to county officials in March, Johnson County Commissioner Steve Klika publicly apologized to Newby's replacement for having \"to deal with this.\" \n White resigned from the Johnson County election office in January, and is now is a Washington, D.C.-area voter services manager at the Montgomery County Board of Elections in Maryland. \n Newby filed for divorce from Lori Newby in March 2015 and a decree last month ended their 30-year marriage. \n Elections office staff \"collectively gave a sigh of relief\" when they learned Newby was leaving, election worker Jenifer Lefort wrote in an email to Kobach. She said his departure would help \"restore morale and well-being.\" \n Others were less restrained. Janette Scobey, the office technology manager, wrote to Kobach, \"I just wanted to say thank goodness he is out of here.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. elections chief left behind Kansas scandal"}

{"date": "October 17, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama greeted students after speaking at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School in Washington, today, where he highlighted the steady increase in graduation rates. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama spoke to students, teachers and invited guests at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School in Washington, today, to highlight the progress his administration has made over the last eight years to improve education across the country. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb The nation's high school graduation rate has reached a record 83.2 percent, continuing a steady increase that shows improvement across all racial and ethnic groups, according to federal data released today. \n President Barack Obama welcomed the higher rate as good news, but the gains come against a backdrop of decreasing scores on national math and reading tests. \n Education Secretary John B. King Jr. acknowledged worries about sagging achievement. \"A higher graduation rate is meaningful progress, but certainly we share the concern that we have more work to do to make sure every student graduates ready for what's next,\" he said. \n Obama visited Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, a magnet school in the District of Columbia, to tout the graduation rate for the 2014-2015 school year. \"More African-American and Latino students are graduating than ever before,\" he said. \n Gains also were seen for disabled students and those from low-income families. \n The District of Columbia made the most progress in the U.S. in 2014-2015 compared to the previous year, improving its graduation rate by 7 percentage points. \n Obama applauded the high school for graduating all its seniors. \"It's been a while since I did math, but 100 percent is good. You can't do better than that,\" Obama told the audience, which included King, former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Mayor Muriel Bowser and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. \n At the same time, he also warned the students they would need more than a high school diploma to succeed in today's job market. He said that repetitive work done in factories or offices can now be done by machine. They would need critical thinking skills. \n \"We live in a global economy,\" Obama said. \"And the best jobs are going to go to the people who are the best educated, whether in India or China, or anywhere in the world.\" \n Before the president spoke, King said the graduation rate was more than just a number. \"It represents real students in real cities, towns and rural communities who are better prepared for success in college and careers,\" King said during a conference call with reporters. \n The administration said the graduation rate has increased by about 4 percentage points since the 2010-2011 school year. Obama frequently cites the increase when he talks to groups about progress made during his presidency. \n Despite the increase in the graduation rate, test scores are declining. \n Last year, math scores for fourth and eighth graders dropped for the first time in 25 years on the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Progress \u2014 also known as the Nation's Report Card. Reading scores were not much better: flat for fourth graders and lower for eighth graders compared with 2013. Average scores on SAT and ACT college entrance exams have also shown declines. \n The growth in graduation rates has been steady since states adopted a uniform way of tracking students. In 2008, the George W. Bush administration ordered states to begin using a formula that is considered a more accurate count of how many students actually finish school. \n Several groups campaigning for a 90 percent graduation rate by 2020 welcomed the progress, but said much work remains. \n \"Too many young people are still being left behind,\" said an array of education groups leading the GradNation campaign. \n The groups said that nearly 700,000 16-19 year olds are not in school and do not have a high school diploma, and they called for a redoubling of efforts to close graduation gaps among minority and poor students, English-language learners, homeless students and students with disabilities. \n Obama also emphasized there was more work to do. He said too many states have cut education funding and many still aren't working seriously to raise learning standards. \n \"In too many school districts, we still have schools that despite the heroic efforts of a lot of great teachers are not fully preparing their kids for success because they don't have the resources to do it, or the structure to do it,\" Obama said. \n The administration reported significant differences in graduation rates among groups. Asian Americans had a 90.2 percent graduation rate, while whites were at 87.6 percent, followed by Hispanics at 77.8 percent, African-Americans at 74.6 percent and Native Americans at 71.6 percent. \n The White House said money invested through a grant program called Race to the Top has helped improve some of the nation's lowest-performing schools. The administration also said millions of students have gained access to high-speed broadband in their classrooms, and that state and federal governments have helped hundreds of thousands more children gain access to preschool programs. \n Associated Press writers Jennifer C. Kerr and Darlene Superville contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "National high school graduation rate hits record high of 83.2 percent"}

{"date": "October 17, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Social Security Administration's main campus is seen in Woodlawn, Md. in Jan. 2013. Millions of Social Security recipients and federal retirees will get only tiny increases in benefits next year, the fifth year in a row that older Americans will have to settle for historically low raises. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Millions of Social Security recipients and federal retirees will get a 0.3 percent increase in monthly benefits next year, the fifth year in a row that older Americans will have to settle for historically low raises. The adjustment adds up to a monthly increase of less than $4 a month for an average recipient. \n The cost-of-living adjustment, announced by the government today, will affect more than 70 million people \u2014 about 1 in 5 Americans. For recipients, the average monthly Social Security payment now is $1,238. \n Unfortunately for some seniors, even the small increase will probably be wiped out by an expected increase in Medicare Part B premiums, which are usually deducted from Social Security payments. \n By law, rising premiums for most Medicare recipients cannot exceed their Social Security cost-of-living increase. That's known as the \"hold harmless\" provision. However, new enrollees and high-income retirees are not covered by that provision, so they could face higher Medicare premiums, which will be announced later this year. \n There was no Social Security benefit increase this year, and next year's will be small because inflation is low, driven in part by cheaper fuel prices. The low inflation rate should help keep some older folks' bills from rising very rapidly. \n Don't tell that to Millicent Graves, a retired veterinary technician, who says Medicare and supplemental insurance premiums eat up nearly a third of her $929 monthly Social Security payment. The 72-year-old from Williamsburg, Virginia, says her insurance premiums went up by $46.50 this year, and her cable TV, internet and phone bill went up, too. \n \"I just lose and lose and lose and lose,\" Graves said. \n More than 60 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses and children get Social Security benefits. The COLA also affects benefits for about 4 million disabled veterans, 2.5 million federal retirees and their survivors, and more than 8 million people who get Supplemental Security Income, the disability program for the poor. Many people who get SSI also receive Social Security. \n Since 2008, the COLA has been above 2 percent only once, in 2011. It's been zero three times. \n \"This loss of anticipated retirement income compounds every year, causing people to spend through retirement savings far more quickly than planned,\" said Mary Johnson of the Senior Citizens League. \"Over the course of a 25- or 30-year retirement, it reduces anticipated Social Security income by tens of thousands of dollars.\" \n The cost-of-living adjustment is based on a broad measure of prices generated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It measures price changes for food, housing, clothing, transportation, energy, medical care, recreation and education. \n If prices go up, benefits go up. If prices drop or stay flat, benefits stay the same. \n Gasoline prices have fallen by more than 6 percent over the past year, according to the September inflation report, while the cost of medical care has gone up by more than 5 percent. \n For seniors who don't drive much, they don't get the full benefit of low gas prices, said Max Gulker, a senior research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research. Many seniors spend more of their income on health care. \n Graves said she appreciates lower gas prices, but the higher medical costs are a problem. \n \"I just have to rely more each month on cashing in investments,\" Graves said. \"I'm lucky I can do that.\" \n Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has embraced the idea of expanded benefits for certain low-income retirees. She says the nation would pay for it by raising taxes on \"the highest-income Americans.\" \n Breaking with other Republicans, GOP nominee Donald Trump has pledged not to cut benefits. However, he has offered few specifics on how he would address Social Security's long-term financial problems. \n Social Security is financed by a 12.4 percent tax on the first $118,500 of a person's annual wages, with the worker paying half and the employer paying the other half. The amount of wages subject to the payroll tax will go up to $127,200 next year, the Social Security Administration said. \n About 173 million workers will pay Social Security taxes next year \u2014 about 12 million of them will face higher taxes because of the higher cap, the agency said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "$4 a month?
