In the city of Shenzhen, authorities ordered schools, markets and factories to close, halted public transportation and evacuated some areas. \n Hong Kong hunkered down as Haima lashed the financial hub with rain and wind gusts of up to 109 kilometers (68 miles) an hour.

Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a charity gala organized by the Archdiocese of New York, tonight at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, right, laughs at a joke with Cardinal Timothy Dolan, center, and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation dinner, tonight, in New York. \n Donald Trump said he was in a room full of wonderful people at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York. \n \"Or as Hillary calls it, her largest crowd of her season,\" he said with a chuckle, as Democratic rival Hillary Clinton laughed, too. \"This is corny stuff.\" \n But as it progressed, Trump's speech turned more biting. \n \"Here she is in public pretending not to hate Catholics,\" he said. Several in the crowd booed. \n Trump went on: \"Everyone knows of course Hillary's belief that it takes a village, as in Haiti where she's taken a number of them.\" That was met with more jeering from the crowd. Clinton's smile was still on her face, but she didn't laugh. \n Just 24 hours after engaging in fierce verbal combat in their final debate in Las Vegas and refusing to shake hands, Clinton and Trump were nearly elbow to elbow again, seated at the same table at the ballroom in the Waldorf Astoria, at a charity dinner famous for its humorous speeches. \n If Wednesday's debate raised the question whether the two New Yorkers vying for the nation's highest office could deliver a knock out blow or take a punch, Thursday's encounter tested each's ability to deliver a punchline and take a joke. \n Clinton, who spoke second, began with the self-deprecatory remarks and gracious gestures that have been the hallmarks of previous dinners. \n She got big laughs when she told the audience: \"I just want to put you all in a basket of adorables.\" \n She told Trump that if he didn't like what she was saying, \"Feel free to stand up and shout 'wrong!' while I'm talking.\" That was a reference to Trump's habit of interrupting her comments at the debate to disagree. \n Clinton also shifted to more biting tone as her speech progressed, and added that after Trump's speech that she'll \"enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever gave it.\" \n Trump, with his arms folded, laughed. \n But he didn't always seem amused. \n \"Looking back, I've had to listen to Donald for three full debates. And he says I don't have any stamina. That is 4 1/2 hours. I have now stood next to Donald Trump longer than any of his campaign managers,\" Clinton said as a stone-faced Trump looked on. \"Now, look, I have deep respect for people like Kellyanne Conway. She's working day and night for Donald, and because she's a contractor, he's probably not even going to pay her.\" \n During Wednesday's debate Trump had described Clinton as \"such a nasty woman.\" She called him \"the most dangerous presidential candidate\" in modern history. A day later, tradition at the 71-year-old dinner called for the two to light-heartedly rib each other. Their place settings were separated only by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, New York's archbishop. \n Before either candidate spoke on Thursday, they were admonished be civil toward one another by Al Smith IV, the great-grandson of the state's 42nd governor. He won laughs when he spun an imaginary scene in which Trump greeted Clinton and asked how she was doing, and she would have said \"Fine, now get out of the ladies' dressing room.\" \n Smith then got more laughs at Trump's expense. \"Even though there's a man sitting next to you in a robe, please watch your language,\" he said, referring to his seat next to the Cardinal. \n The dinner's namesake, Smith, was New York's 42nd governor and the nation's first Catholic presidential candidate. He was known as \"the Happy Warrior\" for the good humor with which he railed against political adversaries. \n As has been the custom, the audience of 1,500 was dressed in white-tie formal attire. They paid $3,000 to $15,000 per person, raising about $6 million for Catholic charities that will give services to impoverished New York children, according to Joseph Zwilling, spokesman for New York's archdiocese. \n The room was filled with Wall Street titans. Among them, seated on the dais, were Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, NASDAQ CEO Robert Greifeld, hedge fund manager Roberto Mignone and Mary Erdoes, CEO for Asset Management at JPMorgan Chase & Co. \n \"Hi Chuck,\" Trump said to New York Senator Chuck Schumer. \"He used to love me when I was a Democrat.\" \n They dined on a \"seafood trio\" of king crab salad, lobster cocktail and lobster roll, followed by beef, \"cheesy polenta\" and red cabbage and desserts that included red velvet cupcakes and dark chocolate praline. \n Thursday night's dinner program offered biographies of the two candidates \u2013 and each carried a difference in tone that mirrored the two campaigns. Clinton's matter-of-fact rehashing of her life story presented her as the daughter of a small businessman who went to Wellesley College, Yale Law School where she met Bill Clinton, and her career as first a children's advocate, then as first lady if Arkansas, then as wife of the president, followed by her stints as U.S. Senator and Secretary of State. Trump's described himself in superlatives as \"the very definition of the American success story,\" a \"pre-eminent developer of quality real estate\" whose \"business acumen is unparalleled.\" \n Anxiety about the risk that the confrontation might break with its gentle traditions arose last week when foundation board member Maureen Sherry, a former Bear Stearns Cos. managing director, said \"We're all craving some level of decency.\" The candidate who wins, she said, \"will be the one who can take the higher road.\" \n Trump told the audience that during the debate \"I called Hillary a nasty woman, and after listening to her go on and on and on, I don't dislike Rosie O'Donnell so much any more.\" \n Clinton gave a stream of one-liners. \"Well either have the first female president or the first president who started a Twitter war with Cher,\" she said. \n \"It great, also, to see Mayor Bloomberg here,\" Clinton said, and smiled at former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the guests on the dais. \"It's a shame he's not speaking tonight. \"I'm curious to hear what a billionaire has to say.\" \n None of Clinton's remarks elicited booing. Afterward, she reached out and shook hands with Trump, an occurrence that did not go unnoticed by those in attendance. \n \"I did see the candidates reach across a great divide and shake hands,\" Smith IV remarked. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Jokes mix with boos, handshake as Clinton, Trump roast each other"}

{"date": "October 20, 2016", "text": "In this June 9, 2014 photo, U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk R-Ill., speaks in his office in Chicago. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama, left, is welcomed on stage by Rep. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., right, to speak at the Stony Island Arts Bank during a fundraiser for Duckworth's Senate campaign in Chicago on Oct. 9, 2016. \n BELLEVILLE, Ill. >> Sen. Mark Kirk says he's ready for \"Hurricane Trump.\" \n The Illinois freshman was the first congressional Republican to withdraw his support for Donald Trump after the presidential candidate disparaged the impartiality of an East Chicago-born judge of Mexican heritage. Kirk was among the first to urge Trump to quit the race earlier this month after a leaked 2005 video revealed Trump bragging about grabbing women by their genitals. \n \"Among all the guys in tough races, I'm probably the best-prepared to weather the Trump storm,\" Kirk told McClatchy in an interview aboard his campaign bus in Chicago. \n But if he's the best-prepared Republican incumbent, the Republicans could be in real trouble. \n Three weeks before the elections, Kirk trails Rep. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who graduated from McKinley High School in Honolulu and attended the University of Hawaii.  \n Kirk is considered the most vulnerable among a half-dozen Republican incumbents whose races will determine whether the party loses control of the Senate. \n They lose power if they lose four seats and Hillary Clinton is president; five, if Trump wins. \n And they are vulnerable in at least six states: Illinois, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. \n Kirk faced odds even before Trump became the Republican nominee: Kirk is a Republican running in a state that hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. \n \"It would take an extreme number of crossover voters or an extreme depression of Democratic voters\" for Kirk to win, said Nathan Gonzales, the editor of the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter that rates the Illinois contest as leaning Democratic. \n Duckworth, a two-term member of the House of Representatives, leads Kirk by 7 percentage points in a Real Clear Politics polling average. Kirk insists that the race is closer. \n To gain ground, Kirk is walking a moderate line, stressing a message of fiscal conservatism to appeal to the right while touting his support for same-sex marriage, abortion rights and gun control, to woo Democrats and center-left independents. \n But his middle-ground approach and distancing himself from Trump are grating on some of the state's staunch conservatives and tea party supporters, constituencies he'll also need if he's to overtake Duckworth in the closing weeks. \n \"Yes, we're concerned about the Senate, but a lot of Republicans aren't fond of Mark Kirk,\" said Denise Cattoni, a DuPage County resident who's founder of the Illinois Tea Party. \"Donald Trump said something to make Mark Kirk squeamish, so he won't vote for Trump. He just wants to stay in Washington.\" \n Try as Kirk might to separate himself from Trump, the top of the ticket casts a long shadow over the senator's race and other down-ballot contests. \n In dozens of interviews between Belleville and Chicago, several voters expressed frustration with having to choose between Trump, whose temperament and alleged treatment of women they abhor, and Clinton, whom they consider untrustworthy. \n That frustration is seeping into down-ballot races. \n Judy Klohr, a 71-year-old from Lebanon, Ill., comes from a military family that's been reliably Republican. She plans to vote a straight Democratic line next month because of Trump, even though Kirk has disavowed his party's standard bearer. \n \"He is, to me, Hitler reincarnated,\" Klohr said of Trump. \"He scares me a lot.\" \n Connie Morriss, a 61-year-old retired naval intelligence specialist from Belleville, said Kirk and everyone else in Congress had done little to help Americans and they all needed to be replaced. \n \"I'm not voting for any incumbents; they've been in there too long,\" Morriss said as she sold wares at the Swansea Farmers Market last week. \"Kirk's been in for six years. What has he done?\" \n A few booths away, Sue Sippel lamented how the ugliness and negative campaigning at the top of the Republican and Democratic tickets are leading her to skip voting altogether. \n \"There's nothing there that interests me, from president to senator on down,\" the 65-year-old Belleville resident said while helping to her sell handmade jewelry. \"I've always voted. I just don't know what I'm going to do this year.\" \n Over at Max and Benny's deli in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook, Gary Anders is the type of ticket-splitting voter Kirk desperately needs. \n \"I believe if you have a Democratic president it behooves you to have a Republican Congress,\" said Anders, a Republican from Island Park, Ill. \n Though not as heated as the Trump-Clinton matchup, the Illinois U.S. Senate battle has been contentious. \n Duckworth has attacked Kirk for making controversial comments, including referring to President Barack Obama as \"drug dealer in chief\" after the U.S. paid Iran $400 million linked to the release of American prisoners there and for jokingly referring to bachelor Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., as a \"bro with no ho.\" In an editorial debate earlier this month, Kirk conceded that he has \"been too quick to turn a phrase.\" \n Kirk has lashed out at Duckworth for voting for the Iran nuclear deal in the House of Representatives and has pressed her about a government lawsuit filed against her during her tenure as the head of the state's Department of Veterans Affairs. \n The Illinois Senate race has been historic, with two candidates who have physical disabilities and often use wheelchairs campaigning against each other for the first time. \n Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran, lost her legs and partial use of her right arm when the Black Hawk helicopter she was flying was shot down in 2004. Kirk suffered a massive stroke in 2012 that left him partially paralyzed on his left side and affected his speech. \n His health has become a campaign issue since the Chicago Tribune editorial board endorsed Duckworth last week, saying Kirk is no longer up to rigors of the job. \n \"While a stroke by no means disqualifies anyone from public office, we cannot tiptoe around the issues of Kirk's recovery and readiness,\" wrote the Tribune. \"Our reluctant judgment is that, due to forces beyond his control, Kirk can no longer perform to the fullest the job of a U.S. senator.\" \n Kirk called the editorial a \"cheap shot,\" particularly since he'd released a letter last month from his treating physician, who said the senator had made a \"full cognitive recovery\" from the stroke. \n \"I've been sucker-punched in the past and I've always got up and prevailed,\" Kirk said. \"Last I checked, they hadn't gone to medical school.\" \n ", "author": "By Tribune News Service", "title": "Duckworth leads in Illinois Senate race as Kirk struggles with Trump"}

The Justice Department says a former National Security Agency's theft of top secret information was \"breathtaking\" in its scope. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb A former National Security Agency contractor's theft of top secret government information was \"breathtaking in its longevity and scale,\" federal prosecutors said in a court filing today aimed at keeping the man locked up as the case moves forward. They said he took enough classified material to fill roughly 200 laptop computers. \n The Justice Department also said it anticipated bringing additional charges against Harold T. Martin III, including charges under the Espionage Act, which would expose him to far harsher penalties if convicted. It described the evidence against him as \"overwhelming\" and said Martin admitted to investigators that he was illicitly storing classified materials. \n The court papers offered new details about the enormous volume of information prosecutors believe Martin stole and revealed the Justice Department's concern that Martin is or could be in contact with a foreign government. Prosecutors said Martin has had online communication in Russian and \u2014 raising the specter of a situation akin to previous NSA leaker Edward Snowden \u2014 said that if Martin were freed he \"could seek refuge with a foreign government willing to shield him from facing justice.\" \n \"Given the nature of his offenses and knowledge of national secrets, he presents tremendous value to any foreign power that may wish to shelter him within or outside of the United States,\" prosecutors said. \n A detention hearing was scheduled for Friday afternoon in Baltimore. Martin's attorneys said he never intended to betray his country and does not pose a danger or flight risk. They said Martin, a former lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, does not have a valid passport and dismissed as \"fantastical scenarios\" concerns that he might flee. \n Martin was arrested at his Maryland home in August around the same time as federal officials acknowledged an investigation into a cyberleak of purported hacking tools used by the NSA. Those documents were leaked by a group calling itself the \"Shadow Brokers,\" but there is nothing in court filings that explicitly connects Martin to that group. \n Prosecutors said agents who searched Martin's home and car seized dozens of computers and electronic devices, then found classified government materials from 1996 to 2016 and some 50 terabytes of information \u2014 or enough to fill 200 laptops. One document marked as \"Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information\" included \"specific operational plans against a known enemy of the United States,\" according to the court filing. \n The information includes an email chain marked as \"Top Secret\" that appeared to have been printed from an official government account. On the back of the document, prosecutors said, were handwritten notes describing the NSA's classified computer infrastructure. The notes, which include basic concepts about classified information, appear \"intended for an audience outside of the Intelligence Community,\" the government said. \n Prosecutors also cited Martin's use of technologies designed to encrypt communication and allow for online anonymity. They said Martin, who had been trained in computer security and at the time of his arrest was enrolled in a doctoral program on information security management, appeared to be trying to connect to the internet anonymously using a specialized operating system. \n The government was likely referring to Tails, a Linux-based operating system that appears similar to Microsoft Windows \u2014 but makes web browsing practically anonymous. It also vanishes once the computer restarts. \n Because systems like Tails direct internet traffic through a global network called Tor, it's harder for authorities to trace a user's internet address or capture identifying information about them. The operating system and the Tor network itself are largely used by journalists, activists and others who have a safety interest in keeping their web browsing habits a secret. \n Martin, a former contractor at Booz Allen Hamilton, had access to classified information since 1996, the government said. \n His arrest was a further blow to the NSA, coming three years after Snowden \u2014 another NSA contractor who also worked at Booz Allen \u2014 disclosed to journalists details about government surveillance programs. Snowden, who now lives in Moscow, was charged in his absence under the Espionage Act. \n \"The evidence is overwhelming that the defendant abused this trust and chose to repeatedly violate his agreements, his oaths and the law\u2014and to retain extremely sensitive government information to use however he wished,\" prosecutors said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ex-NSA contractor committed 'breathtaking' theft of secrets, prosecutors say"}

He has laid the groundwork by complaining for weeks that the system is \"rigged\" against him and in favor of Clinton, a former first lady, former U.S. senator and former secretary of state. \n \"I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense,\" Trump said. Clinton responded by calling the statement \"horrifying.\" \n On Thursday, Trump tried to make light of the situation while campaigning in Ohio. \n \"I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election,\" he said. After pausing for several seconds, Trump added: \"If I win.\" \n Obama, who has felt the sting of losing an election, wasn't buying it. He said Trump's comments were further evidence that he's unfit for office. \n \"All the Republicans \u2014 not all, but most \u2014 have acknowledged there's no way to rig an election in a country this big,\" Obama said. \"He doesn't even worry if what he says is true. This is just about him worried that he's losing, which means he really doesn't have what it takes to hold this job.\" \n He said Trump didn't offer a \"shred of evidence\" to prove rigging or fraud, and called the claim \"more than just the usual standard lie.\" \n Obama urged Floridians to take advantage of the opportunity to vote early, beginning on Monday. \n \"There's only one way we lose this election. Just one. If we don't turn out to vote,\" Obama said. \"Only way. We got to do it big. We got to leave no doubt.\" \n Obama said Trump is the first major party nominee in U.S. history to suggest he will not accept a loss. \n \"That is dangerous,\" Obama said. \"Because when you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's minds about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy. \u2026 You're doing the work of our adversaries for them because our democracy depends on people knowing that their vote matters, that those who occupy the seats of power were chosen by the people.\" \n Earlier in the week, Obama advised Trump to \"stop whining\" and get to work trying to win votes. \n The president also used the Florida appearance to criticize Sen. Marco Rubio, saying Rubio's continued support for Trump makes him unworthy of re-election. He urged Florida voters to send Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy to the Senate instead. \n Rubio lost the Republican presidential nomination to Trump after a bitter primary campaign, during which he called Trump a \"con artist,\" among other things. \n The senator has said he supports Trump's bid for the White House, despite their policy disagreements and recent accusations that Trump has been sexually aggressive toward women, because he doesn't want Clinton to be president. \n Obama said such reasoning shows that Rubio cares only about himself. \n \"How can you call him a con artist and dangerous and object to all the controversial things he says, and then say 'but I'm still going to vote for him.' Come on, man,\" Obama said. \"It is the height of cynicism.\" \n After the rally, Obama ventured to Miami Beach to attend a fundraising dinner for Democratic gubernatorial candidates. About 40 people were expected to attend the event, which was closed to news media coverage. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama: Trump 'dangerous' for suggesting he won't concede"}

Duterte also said he might go to Russian President Vladimir Putin and tell him \"there's three of us against the world.\" \n The comments marked Duterte's strongest yet in disparaging an alliance that has underpinned the U.S.'s Asia-Pacific strategy since World War II. Yet it remains to be seen whether he will follow through on the heated rhetoric with actions \u2014 such as jointly exploring for energy with Beijing in disputed waters or tearing up defense agreements that give the U.S. access to bases in the Philippines. The U.S. has strong ties with the Philippine defense establishment, and the nation's citizens say they trust America more than China by a wide margin. \n \"Symbolically none of this good for the U.S., but in concrete terms the U.S. has thick skin,\" said Malcolm Cook, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"If the Duterte government starts to restrict U.S. access to Philippine bases or something like that, then the U.S. will have a problem.\" \n State Department spokesman John Kirby described the U.S. as \"baffled\" by Duterte's rhetoric. The U.S. will seek an explanation when Daniel Russel, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, visits the Philippines this weekend on a previously scheduled trip, Kirby said. \n Duterte's comments are \"inexplicably at odds with the very close relationship that we have with the Filipino people, as well as the government there, on many different levels, not just from a security perspective,\" Kirby said. The U.S. remains committed to the two countries' mutual defense treaty, he said. \n While Duterte's cabinet members often seek to tone down his remarks \u2014 a routine they followed again today \u2014 the president has kept repeating them. In his speech to the Chinese business leaders, Duterte said that the separation from the U.S. would be both military and economic, without elaborating. Duterte said he was mulling plans to require U.S. visitors to the Philippines to obtain a visa. \n In a joint statement issued after Duterte's speech, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez and Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia said the Philippine Cabinet would move strongly and swiftly toward regional economic integration. \n \"We will maintain relations with the West, but we desire stronger integration with our neighbors,\" the statement said. Overseas investors, however, appear to have been unsettled by the mixed messages. The peso dropped to the weakest in seven years this month as $666 million fled from the nation's local-currency stocks and bonds since Aug. 1. \n Earlier in the day, China announced a resumption of bilateral talks on contested territory in the South China Sea, an issue that had previously pushed the Philippines closer to America. China's Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Liu Zhenmin hailed a \"new stage of maritime cooperation.\" \n \"It's a win-win for both,\" said Kang Lin, deputy director of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, China's only state-backed research institution dedicated to South China Sea research. \"The Philippines can reap a commercial harvest from his trip, including much-needed infrastructure funding. And for China, it's the temporary end of the South China Sea migraine that lasted for the past couple of years.\" \n Officials from both countries signed 13 pacts on areas including trade, investment and tourism. China agreed to extend $9 billion in credit to the Philippines, the Inquirer reported, including $6 billion in soft loans. China overtook the U.S. as the Philippines's largest trading partner in 2006. \n Duterte welcomed investment from China, telling the business forum: \"I have separated from them, so I will be dependent on you for a long time.\" \n \"If China can get the Philippines out of the orbit of the U.S., it will be a big victory for it even if the Philippines doesn't necessarily align itself with China,\" said Ramon Casiple, executive director at the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform in Manila. \"Duterte wants to get more benefits from all \u2014 that's the card he's playing and he's playing it to the hilt.\" \n Before his meeting with Xi, Duterte told hundreds of Filipinos in Beijing that \"it's time to say goodbye\" to the U.S. \n \"Foreign policy veers now\" toward China, Duterte said on Wednesday night. \"No more American interference. No more American exercises,\" he told a cheering crowd. \"I will not go to America anymore\" for assistance, he said. \"We will just be insulted there.\" \n The U.S. has expressed concern about Duterte's policies. Philip Goldberg, the U.S. envoy in Manila, said Wednesday that the Philippines's efforts to improve ties with China \"shouldn't be a zero-sum game.\" Kirby at the State Department also said the U.S. welcomes better China-Philippines ties. \n While Duterte and the Philippines weren't mentioned in Wednesday night's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, U.S. relations with China and Russia came up repeatedly. Trump again said he would pressure American partners to pay more for American assistance, while Clinton said the alliances made both the U.S. and the world safer. \n Even as Duterte warmed up to China, Beijing appeared eager to distance itself from his anti-U.S. rhetoric. A commentary run by the official Chinese news agency Xinhua on Thursday said the rekindling of ties between Manila and Beijing carried \"no meaning\" for the Philippine-U.S. alliance. \n \"The Chinese government never attempts to build up its ties with other countries on condition that these nations have to sacrifice their partnership with any third party,\" it said. \n Despite his remarks, Duterte still has yet to commit to anything that may permanently undermine the long-standing alliance between the U.S. and the Philippines. He hasn't torn up any agreements, conceded that China has sovereignty in disputed waters or undermined the right of the U.S. to conduct military operations in the South China Sea. \n \"The 'yet' is a very big 'yet,'\" said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra. \"At a certain point, if Duterte wants to reap the economic benefits from his visit to China he will need to pay the piper. He will need to do what he is saying, otherwise he won't get anything from China.\" \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "Duterte bids U.S. goodbye with embrace of China and Russia"}

{"date": "October 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n An Iraqi military helicopter flew over the frontline near Bartella, Iraq today. An American soldier died today from wounds sustained in a bombing in northern Iraq, the U.S. military said. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb A U.S. military member assisting Iraqi forces in their push to retake Mosul was killed by a roadside bomb, marking the first American combat casualty in the campaign to oust the Islamic State group from its last major stronghold in northern Iraq. \n U.S. officials said the American was fatally wounded near the town of Bashiqa, north of Mosul. He was operating as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist in support of Kurdish Peshmerga fighters who are part of an effort to recapture Mosul that began Monday. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details. \n The American was in or near a vehicle when he was hit, the officials said. He later died of his wounds. His identity was being withheld pending notification of his family. \n He was the fourth U.S. combat death in Iraq since the U.S. began military operations against the Islamic State with airstrikes in August 2014. \n It was not immediately clear whether other U.S. service members were hurt in the bomb attack Thursday. \n Pentagon officials had acknowledged at the outset of the Iraqi-led offensive that U.S. special operations troops advising Iraqi security forces and Kurdish militia fighters could be injured or killed as they advanced on Mosul. \n Roadside bombs and other emplacements of improvised explosive devices pose a particular danger to advancing Iraqi forces and the U.S. advisers who are with them. The Islamic State group, which has occupied Mosul for more than two years, has prepared extensive defenses in and around the city. \n More than 100 U.S. special operations forces are operating with Iraqi units, and hundreds more are playing a support role in staging bases farther from the front lines. \n U.S. Central Command announced the death in a brief statement saying the service member was wounded by an \"improvised explosive device.\" \n The assault on Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is bringing American forces into their most significant role in Iraq in years. There are more U.S. forces in Iraq now than any time since the 2011 U.S. withdrawal, and American forces have been increasingly active on and beyond front-line positions. \n Asked earlier this week about the degree of risk facing U.S. special operations forces who are advising Iraqi forces in the Mosul operation, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said Iraqis are in the lead but efforts are being made to limit the risk facing U.S. troops. \n \"There are Americans in harm's way as part of this fight,\" Cook said Monday as the Mosul offensive was announced by the Iraqi government. \"We're very aware of that and we're taking steps, as many steps as we can, to reduce the risk to American forces and we'll continue to do that.\" \n There are approximately 4,800 U.S. troops in Iraq, according to the Pentagon. That doesn't include another 1,500 troops considered there \"on temporary duty,\" whose number changes daily, according to the U.S. officials. \n Three other service members have died in Iraq since the U.S.-led coalition began launching airstrikes against IS. \n In October 2015, Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler was killed when he and dozens of other U.S. special operations forces participated in a raid alongside Iraqi Kurdish forces to free IS-held prisoners. \n Months later, Marine Staff Sgt. Louis Cardin was killed when IS fighters attacked a fire base in northern Iraq, and in May, Navy SEAL Charles Keating was killed in a firefight near Tel Askuf, also in the north. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. service member killed by roadside bomb in northern Iraq"}

{"date": "October 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke during a campaign rally today at the Delaware County Fair, in Delaware, Ohio. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump debated with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the third presidential debate at UNLV in Las Vegas, on Wednesday. \n DELAWARE, Ohio \u00bb Mocking his critics, Donald Trump pledged to fully accept the outcome of next month's presidential election \u2014 if he wins. The Republican said he reserved the right to contest questionable results, deepening his unsubstantiated assertions that the race against Hillary Clinton could be rigged against him. \n Trump's comments came a day after his stunning refusal in the final presidential debate to say whether he would concede to Clinton if he loses. His resistance, threatening to undermine the essence of American democracy, was roundly rejected by fellow Republicans. \n Arizona Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, called the peaceful transfer of power \"the pride of our country.\" \n \"I didn't like the outcome of the 2008 election. But I had a duty to concede, and I did so without reluctance,\" McCain said in a lengthy statement. \"A concession isn't just an exercise in graciousness. It is an act of respect for the will of the American people, a respect that is every American leader's first responsibility.\" \n With the presidential race slipping away from him, Trump has repeatedly raised the specter of a rigged election, despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud heading toward Election Day or in previous presidential contests. His top advisers and running mate Mike Pence have tried to soften his comments, only to watch helplessly as he plunges ahead. \n Asked in Wednesday's debate if he would accept the election results and concede to Clinton if he loses, Trump said: \"I will tell you at the time. I will keep you in suspense.\" \n Clinton slammed Trump's comments as \"horrifying,\" and fellow Democrats piled on Thursday. \n \"That undermines our democracy,\" President Barack Obama said while campaigning for Clinton in Florida. \"Our democracy depends on people knowing their vote matters.\" \n His wife, first lady Michelle Obama, told 7,000 Clinton supporters in Republican-voting Arizona Thursday that Trump was threatening to \"ignore our voices and reject the outcome of this election.\" She said that's the same as \"threatening the very idea of America itself.\" \n Trump's comments overshadowed his attempts to diminish Clinton's credibility during the debate. He entered the contest desperate to reshape the race and attract new voters who are deeply skeptical of his brash temperament and fitness for office, but it appeared unlikely he accomplished those goals. \n Campaigning Thursday in must-win Ohio, Trump tried to make light of the situation. \n \"I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election,\" he said. After letting that vow hang in the air for a few seconds, he added, \"If I win.\" \n The Republican nominee said he would accept \"a clear election result\" but reserved his right to \"contest or file a legal challenge\" if he loses. He brushed off the likelihood of that happening with a confident prediction that \"we're not going to lose.\" \n Yet numerous Republican leaders concede Trump is heading for defeat barring a significant shift in the campaign's closing days. The GOP's top concern now is salvaging its majority in the Senate, followed closely by worries over the Republicans' once comfortable grip on the House. \n \"The landscape has gotten a lot tougher for Republicans in the House,\" said Liesl Hickey, a Republican strategist involved some of those races. In Pennsylvania, Sen. Pat Toomey said Trump's comments were \"irresponsible.\" \n Maine Gov. Paul LePage called Trump's comments an \"absolute stupid move\" and advised him to \"take your licks and let's move on.\" \n U.S. elections are run by local elected officials \u2014 Republicans, in many of the most competitive states. \n Trump's campaign pointed to Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000 as an example of why it would be premature for Trump to say he'd acquiesce on Nov. 8. That election, which played out for weeks until the Supreme Court weighed in, didn't center on allegations of fraud, but on proper vote-counting after an extremely close outcome in Florida led to a mandatory recount. \n Trump tried to turn the tables on Clinton by accusing her of \"cheating\" and suggesting she should \"resign from the race.\" He cited a hacked email that showed her campaign was tipped off about a question she'd be asked in a CNN town hall meeting during the Democratic primary. \n \"Can you imagine if I got the questions? They would call for the re-establishment of the electric chair, do you agree?\" Trump said at a rally in Ohio. \n Trump's effort to shift the conversation back to Clinton focused on an email from longtime Democratic operative Donna Brazile to Clinton's campaign in March with the subject line \"From time to time I get the questions in advance.\" It contained the wording of a death penalty question that Brazile suggested Clinton would be asked. \n Brazile, now the acting Democratic National Committee chairwoman, was a CNN contributor at the time she sent the email, one of thousands disclosed publicly by WikiLeaks after Clinton's campaign chairman's emails were hacked. Clinton's campaign has said Russia was behind the hack. \n The rivals toned down the vitriol a little Thursday night at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York, a white-tie gala in which politicians are expected to be light-hearted and funny. Still, Trump drew some jeers for calling Clinton \"corrupt,\" while Clinton got personal with jokes about Trump's treatment of women and connections to Russia. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump says he'll 'totally accept' election results 'if I win'"}

Half a year later, colors are changing again as leaves turn to burnt yellow and red across the thickly wooded hills. \n Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader told WCPO-TV this week that he now believes the killers were local . \n Union Hill Road, where seven of the victims were found on three properties, is open again to traffic. \"Private Property: No Trespassing\" signs are posted at the end of the homes' driveways. Porches sit stranded in yards, their steps leading nowhere: In May, investigators moved the mobile homes where the killings occurred to a secure location as the investigation continued. \n Leonard Manley, who lost his daughter, Dana Rhoden, and three grandchildren, lives on Union Hill Road near all the crime scenes. He spends his days tinkering after retiring two years ago from cutting timber. He doesn't know who committed the crime and questions whether it will be solved in his lifetime. \n Manley, 65, has long thought the killers knew the properties intimately, in part because Christopher Rhoden Sr. had a security system, as well as a pit bull and bulldog, that would have been hard for a stranger to get past. \n \"You wake up at night, and you wonder. I get up of a night, 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. Can't go back to sleep, thinking about things,\" Manley said. \n The victims were Kenneth Rhoden, 44; Christopher Rhoden Sr., 40; his ex-wife, 37-year-old Dana Rhoden; their three children, 20-year-old Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden, 16-year-old Christopher Rhoden Jr. and 19-year-old Hanna Rhoden; a cousin, 38-year-old Gary Rhoden; and Frankie Rhoden's fiancee, 20-year-old Hannah Gilley, whose 6-month old son with Frankie Rhoden was unharmed. \n Two other children, Hanna Rhoden's 4-day-old daughter and Frankie Rhoden's 3-year-old son, also were unharmed. Adding to the family's pain is a legal fight involving three family members seeking custody of the children. A Pike County judge is shielding public access to those court hearings and records. \n Most of the victims were shot multiple times in the head and, in the case of Christopher Rhoden Sr., in his upper body and torso, as well. Some bodies showed signs of bruising, as if they'd been beaten. Kenneth Rhoden's body was found at his trailer a few miles away from the properties on Union Hill Road. \n Kendra Rhoden, Tajianna's sister, says her father, Kenneth Rhoden, was a wise man who taught her lessons about dealing with life, heartbreak and all. The 19-year-old is studying to be a licensed practical nurse. Like others, she believes someone in the community knows what happened but is afraid to come forward. \n Regardless of the delays and the mystery surrounding the deaths, Kendra Rhoden believes the case will be solved. \n \"My dad taught me to have hope,\" Rhoden said. \n Early on, authorities disclosed a large-scale illegal marijuana growing operation at one of the crime scenes and said pot was being cultivated at some of the other homes, too, leading to suggestions Mexican cartels might have been involved. \n Large marijuana operations are common in southern Ohio. Investigators in 2012 said the seizure of about 1,200 plants in Pike County could be related to a Mexican drug cartel. \n Attorney General Mike DeWine, overseeing the investigation along with the sheriff, will say only that the killers had to be familiar with land around the properties, as well as the properties themselves. \n Though many residents of the rural county about 80 miles south of Columbus also believe the killers are local, most aren't worried about their safety. They believe the family members were specifically targeted. \n \"I don't think nobody's going to come forward and say, 'Oh, I know who did this,'\" said Dana Lansing, who lives with her husband about 3 miles from the main crime scene and who was a longtime friend of Dana Rhoden. \"Because it's too big.

Because the men do not have visas, they have no legal standing to enter the United States and therefore must not leave the secured piers where they are docked. The entire system by which the fishermen are allowed to work on American-owned, American-flagged vessels contradicts other state and federal laws. \n The AP investigation discovered some men were living in squalor, forced to use buckets instead of toilets, and suffered running sores from bed bugs. The AP also found that federal officials issued two men from Indonesia who worked in Hawaii waters special visa designations for victims of human trafficking, but officials said Thursday that despite many allegations over the years, they have not found any instances of trafficking in the fleet. \n \"Certainly, the nature of the fishing industry makes it susceptible to labor trafficking, and that is one of the reasons we have these meetings,\" said Joanna Ip, special agent in charge for Homeland Security Investigations in Hawaii. \"We have received many allegations that could be construed as human trafficking \u2026 but we haven't come across a case yet.\" \n Of the 167 fishing vessels in the fleet, 143 of them employ a total of about 620 foreign men. About 20 owners or their representatives showed up for the meeting on Thursday. \n The foreign men are allowed to leave their boats if they want to end their contracts, have disputes or need to return to their home countries for emergencies. Federal officials will parole fishermen who need to enter the United States, which allows them to be escorted off the vessels and flown off the islands. \n In 2015, there were \"663 total paroles for various reasons: medical needs, a need to go to the consulate to renew a passport , or, ultimately, parole for immediate departure,\" said Custom and Border Protection's Brian Humphrey, the director of the San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, field offices, which oversees Hawaii. Of those, 296 paroles were issued for fishermen whose contracts expired and they wanted to return home or for men who wanted to leave early. \n \"If they want to leave before their contract expires, that's not our issue to argue. If someone tells us they want to return home, we will make accommodations,\" he said. \n But vessel owners hold the men's documents, and getting back home can be expensive. Boat owners on Thursday said they always pay for crews to return if they have to, but the AP investigation showed at least one fisherman from Kiribati had deductions from his pay including $1,300 for airfare, $1,800 to pay for his replacement and $2,100 for breaking a captain's computer. \n Workers are paid a fraction of what other U.S. fishing fleets pay their mostly American crews. Some of Hawaii's workers make less than $5,000 a year, while experienced American crew members in Alaska can make up to $80,000 a year. \n Federal law requires that U.S. citizens make up 75 percent of the crew on most commercial fishing vessels in America. The fleet in Hawaii has an exemption carved out years ago, largely by lawmakers no longer in office. \n To many of the workers, the meager pay is good compared with what they would make in their home countries, and many fishermen return to the fleet year after year to work and provide for their families. \n On Wednesday, Hawaii state Rep. Kaniela Ing held a public meeting at the state Capitol on the issue. Ing and other lawmakers pressed representatives from the fishing industry and government agencies about what can be done to increase oversight and improve conditions in the industry. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Cathy Bussewitz contributed to this report from Honolulu. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Officials say they cannot enforce Hawaii fishing contracts"}
