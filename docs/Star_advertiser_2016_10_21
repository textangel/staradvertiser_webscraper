{"date": "October 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People line up under the morning sun for early voting at Chavis Community Center in Raleigh, N.C. \n WASHINGTON >> Hillary Clinton appears to be displaying strength in the crucial battleground states of North Carolina and Florida among voters casting ballots before Election Day, and may also be building an early vote advantage in Arizona and Colorado. \n Donald Trump, meanwhile, appears to be holding ground in Ohio, Iowa and Georgia, according to data compiled by The Associated Press. Those are important states for Trump, but not sufficient for him to win the presidency if he loses states like Florida or North Carolina. \n \"The Trump campaign should be concerned,\" said Scott Tranter, co-founder of Optimus, a Republican data analytics firm. His firm's analysis suggests a \"strong final showing for the Clinton campaign\" in early voting. \n Early voting \u2014 by mail or at polling stations \u2014 is off to a fast start. More than 4.4 million votes have been cast already, far outpacing the rate for this period in 2012. Balloting is underway in 34 out of 37 early-voting states. \n In all, more than 45 million people are expected to vote before Election Day \u2014 or as much as 40 percent of all votes cast. \n Both parties are encouraging their supporters to vote early. The outcome of those ballots won't be known until counting begins after polls close on Nov. 8, but some clues are available. Some states report the party affiliations of early voters, as well as breakdowns by race and gender. \n The data that is available represents a small sample of the more than 120 million people who will cast ballots in the presidential election, but a notable one. \n A look at early voting trends: \n GOOD SIGNS FOR CLINTON: FLORIDA, NORTH CAROLINA, MAINE \n The Clinton campaign is looking to build an insurmountable lead in Florida and North Carolina during early voting. If she wins either of those states, she'll probably be the next president. \n Using 2012 as a guidepost, she appears to be in a strong position in early voting. \n While Democrats tend to do better in early voting, Republicans usually post an initial lead with mail-in ballots before Democrats surpass them during in-person early voting in mid to late October. \n Democrats so far have kept it close with mail-in ballots, giving Clinton a chance to run up the score with in-person early voting. To do that, she'll need non-whites and young people to turn out near the high levels they did in 2012 for Barack Obama. \n In North Carolina, Democrats have moved ahead of Republicans in early voting. Republicans had held a modest lead based on mail-in ballots returned, but that was at a much narrower margin than in 2012, when Mitt Romney narrowly won the state. After in-person voting began on Thursday, Democrats overtook Republicans in overall votes cast. \n In Florida, a record 3.1 million people have requested ballots, more than one-third of the total voters in 2012. Democrats have requested almost as many ballots as Republicans: 39 percent vs. 40 percent. \n By comparison, in 2008, Republicans held a lead of 49 percent to 32 percent in requests, according to an analysis for AP by Catalist, a Democratic analytical firm. Obama won in Florida in 2008 and 2012. \n Democrats are also showing momentum in the 2nd congressional district of both Maine and Nebraska. The two states allocate electoral votes by congressional district. \n SIGNS OF EARLY EDGE FOR CLINTON OUT WEST \n Early voting is surging in Arizona, another state Trump can't afford to lose. Arizona has long been reliably Republican, but Clinton is targeting it. \n More than 1.9 million ballots have been requested and 36,000 returned. That's more than triple the 10,800 ballots returned during a similar period in 2012. \n Democrats have a 44 percent to 31 percent lead over Republicans in ballots returned. Another 25 percent were independent or unknown. At this point in 2012, Democrats had a narrower 38 percent to 35 percent lead, according to Catalist. \n While figures are preliminary, Tranter, the Republican analyst, said Arizona had become competitive. \n \"It's close,\" Tranter said. \n In Colorado, which began voting by mail on Monday, Democrats led 43 percent to 30 percent among the 15,280 ballots returned by late Thursday. In 2012, the party had trailed Republicans early. Registered Democrats have since surpassed Republicans in the state. \n And in Nevada, which also began absentee voting this week, overall ballot requests and returns were down. There were sharper declines among older whites, who tend to vote Republican. \n GOOD SIGNS FOR TRUMP: OHIO, IOWA AND GEORGIA \n Early vote data for now points to potential Trump strength in Ohio, Iowa and Georgia. \n In Ohio, data compiled by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who runs the U.S. Elections Project, continue to show big declines in ballot requests in the heavily Democratic counties of Cuyahoga and Franklin. \n The state does not break down ballots by party affiliation. By race, voter modeling by Catalist found the white share of Ohio ballot requests was up, to 91 percent from 88 percent. The black share declined from 10 percent to 7 percent. \n In Georgia, which also does not report party affiliation, both ballot requests and returns from black voters also trailed 2012 levels. \n And in Iowa, Democrats lead early requests, 43 percent to 36 percent. But that level is down significantly from 2012. Obama won the state that year based on a strong early vote in his favor. \n In a statement, the Republican National Committee said it was focused on boosting turnout in 11 battleground states and predicted a strong Election Day performance. \n \"Democrats are not turning out new voters, just turning out people who would have voted on Election Day,\" it said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Early voting: Democrats show strength in key battlegrounds"}

{"date": "October 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n United Nations staff, some holding signs, stand in a silent protest against a U.N. meeting to designate Wonder Woman as an \"Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls.\" \n UNITED NATIONS >> The United Nations celebrated Wonder Woman's 75th birthday on Friday by naming the comic book character as its new Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Woman and Girls, despite frustration from both inside and outside the world organization that the spot should go to a real \u2014 and less sexualized \u2014 woman. \n The carefully choreographed ceremony was marred by some 50 U.N. staffers protesting by the visitors' entrance to the U.N., who then went inside the Economic and Social Council chamber and silently turned their back to the stage during the opening speech, some with their fists in the air. \n U.N. staffer Cass DuRant, who held a sign saying \"Real Women Deserve a Real Ambassador,\" said the protesters \"don't think that a fictitious comic book character wearing basically what looks like a Playboy-type bunny outfit is really the right message we need to send to girls or even boys for that matter.\" \n The super heroine's image will be used by the U.N. on social media platforms to promote women's empowerment, including on gender-based violence and the fuller participation of women in public life (using the hashtag WithWonderWoman). The push, hoping to reach young people, is backed by DC Entertainment and Warner Bros., which produce both comics and films featuring Wonder Woman. \n But an online petition , started by U.N. staffers, asked the secretary-general to reconsider the appointment, saying, \"The message the United Nations is sending to the world with this appointment is extremely disappointing.\" As of Friday afternoon, it had more than 1,100 signatures. \n Honorary ambassadors \u2014 as opposed to goodwill ambassadors like Nicole Kidman and Anne Hathaway \u2014 are fictional characters. The U.N. previously tapped Winnie the Pooh to be an honorary Ambassador of Friendship in 1998, and Tinker Bell as the honorary Ambassador of Green in 2009. But the protest on Friday seemed to unnerve many of the U.N.'s press officers. \n The Friday event brought together actress Lynda Carter, who played Wonder Woman in the 1970s TV series, and Gal Gadot, who has taken on the role in the forthcoming \"Wonder Woman\" film, as well as Girl Scouts in Wonder Woman T-shirts and U.N. staffers' kids who skipped school, with one girl wearing a full Wonder Woman costume, complete with head piece. Diane Nelson, president of DC Entertainment, gave a speech in which she argued that stories \u2014 even comic book stories \u2014 can \"inspire, teach and reveal injustices.\" \n Carter, who gave a moving speech about how Wonder Woman embodies the inner strength of every woman, was the only one to acknowledge the protesters in her remarks, saying \"Please embrace her,\" she said. \"To all those who don't think it's a good idea, stand up and be counted.\" \n As for Gadot, she said after the event: \"I'm the kind of person who always looks at the half-full glass. I care for the people who care and I'm here for a wonderful cause today.\" She added, through a thin smile: \"That's all what my focus is.\" \n But among those thinking the glass was half empty was Shazia Z. Rafi, managing director of the consulting firm Global Parliamentary Services. She argued that the choice of Wonder Woman was tone deaf at a time when real women are fighting against sexual exploitation and abuse. \n \"I think it's a lot of rubbish that you can appoint a cartoon female to represent gender equality in this day and age, even if it is to reach younger women,\" said Rafi. \n Rafi said there were plenty of real heroines that could be the face for gender equality. \n The Wonder Woman appointment came after many women were dismayed that another man, Antonio Guterres, the former prime minister of Portugal, was chosen to be the next secretary-general, even though more than half the candidates were women. \n Rafi, who had campaigned for a woman to be appointed the world's diplomat-in-chief, said the decision to name Wonder Woman as an ambassador was effort to appease disappointed staffers. \n Rafi and the petition also take issue with Wonder Woman's skimpy outfit, arguing that the world might not embrace a scantily clad character in a thigh-baring body suit with an American flag motif and knee high boots. \n It is not the first time the United Nations has partnered with a huge media company. In March, the U.N. appointed Red, the leader of the \"Angry Birds\" mobile game characters, as an envoy to tackle climate change. That campaign is in partnership with Sony Pictures Entertainment. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press Writer Edith M.

{"date": "October 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A model of Schiaparelli, the Mars landing device, is on display at the European Space Agency, ESA, in Darmstadt, Germany. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Italian Space Agency President Roberto Battiston held a pamphlet reading in Italian \"Colonize Mars\" today in front of a rendering showing the Schiaparelli Space Module and the planet Mars during an event organized by Italy's Space Agency. \n BERLIN >> Europe's experimental Mars probe hit the right spot \u2014 but at the wrong speed \u2014 and may have ended up in a fiery ball of rocket fuel when it struck the surface, scientists said Friday. \n Pictures taken by a NASA satellite show a black spot in the area where the Schiaparelli lander was meant to touch down Wednesday, the European Space Agency said. The images end two days of speculation following the probe's unexpected radio silence less than a minute before the planned landing. \n \"Estimates are that Schiaparelli dropped from a height of between 2 and 4 kilometers (1.4-2.4 miles), therefore impacting at a considerable speed, greater than 300 kilometers per hour (186 mph),\" the agency said. \n It said the large disturbance captured in the NASA photographs may have been caused by the probe's steep crash-landing, which would have sprayed matter around like a blast site on Earth. \n \"It is also possible that the lander exploded on impact, as its thruster propellant tanks were likely still full,\" the agency said. \n Schiaparelli was designed to test technology for a more ambitious European Mars landing in 2020. The European Space Agency said the probe's mother ship was successfully placed into orbit Wednesday and will soon begin analyzing the Martian atmosphere in search for evidence of life. \n \"In my heart, of course I'm sad that we couldn't land softly on the surface of Mars,\" ESA chief Jan Woerner told The Associated Press. \"But the main part of the mission is the science that will be done by the orbiter.\" \n Woerner said engineers received a wealth of data from the lander before the crash that will prove valuable for the next attempt in four years' time. He described the mission as \"a 96 percent success.\" \n Still, the crash-landing was a painful reminder of how hard it is to put a spacecraft on the surface of the red planet. \n Its resting place was photographed by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which also spotted Europe's last ill-fated mission to the surface of the planet. The Beagle 2 probe landed on Mars in 2003 but failed to deploy its solar panels properly, preventing it from functioning. \n There have only been seven successful robotic landings on Mars, all by NASA. The last landing was in 2012, when the Curiosity rover touched down in a Martian crater. \n Landing on Mars is notoriously difficult because of the planet's thin, dusty atmosphere. Inbound spacecraft hit the atmosphere at 12,000 mph (19,300 kph) and have only minutes to slow down and land. \n With the loss of Schiaparelli, only two spacecraft are currently roaming the Martian surface \u2014 Curiosity and Opportunity, which landed in 2004. \n ESA said that, according to what its scientists have been able to piece together so far, Schiaparelli suffered problems during the last 50 seconds of its descent through the harsh Martian atmosphere. \n The picture taken by NASA's orbiter shows two features that weren't visible on the surface when the spacecraft photographed the area in May. The first is a bright spot of about 12 meters diameter, likely to be Schiaparelli's parachute, ESA said. \n The second was described as \"a fuzzy dark patch roughly 15 by 40 meters in size and about 1 kilometer north of the parachute\" and is likely to be the lander. \n \"These preliminary interpretations will be refined following further analysis\" and a high-resolution picture in the coming days, the agency said. \n While Schiaparelli was able to beam back some 600 megabytes of data before the crash, scientists won't get any of the close-up photos the probe took during its descent. Those were meant to be transmitted after the landing. \n ESA said the other part of the ExoMars mission \u2014 the Trace Gas Orbiter \u2014 was \"working very well and will take science calibration data during two orbits in November.\" \n The spacecraft will then descend to an altitude of about 400 kilometers and begin its study of Mars next year. The orbiter is also going to act as a radio relay for the next stage of the ExoMars mission and other future attempts to land on the planet. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Photos show European Mars probe crashed, may have exploded"}

{"date": "October 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton pointed to the crowd while speaking at a rally at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland today. \n WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. >> Hillary Clinton's campaign is increasingly preparing for the possibility that Donald Trump may never concede the presidential election should she win, a development that could enormously complicate the crucial early weeks of her preparations to take office. \n Aiming to undermine any argument the Republican nominee may make about a \"rigged\" election, she hopes to roll up a large electoral vote margin in next month's election. That could repudiate the New York billionaire's message and project a governing mandate after the bitter, divisive presidential race. \n Clinton's team is also keeping a close eye on statements by national Republican leaders, predicting they could play an important role in how Trump's accusations of electoral fraud might be perceived. That's according to several Clinton campaign aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal strategy. \n Campaign officials stress they are not taking the outcome of the election for granted. But Clinton and her team have begun thinking about how to position their candidate during the postelection period. Long one of the country's most polarizing political figures, Clinton has begun telling audiences she'll need their help in healing the country. \n \"I've got to figure out how we heal these divides,\" she said in a Friday interview with a Tampa radio station WBTP. \"We've got to get together. Maybe that's a role that is meant to be for my presidency if I'm so fortunate to be there.\" \n A refusal by Trump to accept the election results would not only upend a basic tenet of American democracy, but also force Clinton to create a new playbook for handling the transfer of power. And a narrow victory would make it more difficult for her to claim substantial political capital at the start of her administration. \n \"Donald is still going to whine if he loses. But if the mandate is clear, I don't think many people will follow him,\" said Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Clinton's running mate, in an interview Thursday with CNN's \"New Day.\" \n While Clinton's campaign has long focused on maintaining pathways to cross the threshold of 270 electoral votes, it's now looking to capture an expanded number of states that could also help determine control of the Senate \u2014 including Republican-leaning Arizona. \n Polls indicate that Clinton has extended her advantage in several toss-up states during the three fall debates, giving her campaign more confidence. She has maintained stable leads in states such as Pennsylvania, Virginia and Colorado, as well as a narrow edge in Florida and North Carolina. \n \"They're looking at it like this: We've got these doors of opportunity open, let's make sure we go down all of them,'\" said Jeremy Bird, the national field director for President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign who is helping Clinton's team. \n If Clinton wins the White House, she will enter as one of the least popular first-term presidents in generations. While Trump has suffered from high unfavorable ratings, particularly among women, Clinton has been hampered by polls showing more than half of the public considers her to be untrustworthy. \n Some Republicans are already preparing for Trump's defeat, downplaying the significance of a Clinton triumph. \n \"On Nov 8, Clinton's claims of a mandate will fly in the face of reality. She only won by not being Trump,\" tweeted conservative writer Erick Erickson. Rolling up a big victory in the Electoral College would let Clinton push back against that notion and assert that voters had rejected what she has called Trump's mean, divisive message. \n In a race against Trump and independents Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, Clinton may struggle to reach 50 percent of the vote. But competing in states such as Arizona and pushing for Senate victories in Missouri and Indiana might help Democrats in their quest to recapture the Senate and give her a better chance of surpassing Obama's 332 electoral votes in the 2012 campaign. \n Clinton's campaign is making a significant push in Arizona, which offers 11 electoral votes and has stayed in the Republican column in all but one presidential election since 1952. Bill Clinton was the last Democrat to carry the state, in 1996. \n First lady Michelle Obama courted voters in Phoenix on Thursday, following appearances by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and the Clintons' daughter, Chelsea Clinton. The campaign is spending $2 million in advertising and toying with sending Clinton herself there before Election Day. \n \"I think it's clear that Hillary Clinton has a chance to win Arizona just like her husband did 20 years ago,\" said Rodd McLeod, a Phoenix-based Democratic strategist who helped Clinton's campaign during the primary. \n Two other Republican-leaning states could prove tempting. \n Georgia, which has had an influx of diverse voters in the Atlanta area, is considered a future battleground state, with many Democrats comparing it to North Carolina. \n Utah overwhelmingly supported Mitt Romney, the nation's first Mormon presidential nominee, with more than 72 percent in 2012. But many of the state's Republicans have abandoned Trump and polls show Clinton and Trump in a tight contest against independent Evan McMullin, a conservative former CIA officer who graduated from Brigham Young University. \n If McMullin captures Utah, he will be the first independent presidential candidate to win electoral votes since George Wallace in 1968. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton camp preparing for possibility Trump won't concede"}

{"date": "October 21, 2016", "text": "ALBANY, N.Y. >> New York state enacted one of the nation's toughest restrictions on Airbnb on Friday with a new law authorizing fines of up to $7,500 for many short-term rentals. \n The measure signed into law by Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo applies to rentals of fewer than 30 days when the owner or tenant is not present. \n Supporters of the measure say many property owners use sites like Airbnb to offer residential apartments as short-term rentals to visitors, hurting existing hotels while taking residential units off the already expensive housing market in New York City. \n \"Today is a great day for tenants, seniors, and anyone who values the safe and quiet enjoyment of their homes and neighborhoods,\" said Manhattan Democratic Sen. Liz Krueger, a co-sponsor of the bill. \"For too long companies like Airbnb have encouraged illegal activity that takes housing off the market and makes our affordability crisis worse.\" \n Airbnb said it would immediately file a lawsuit challenging the law. \n \"In typical fashion, Albany backroom dealing rewarded a special interest \u2014 the price-gouging hotel industry \u2014 and ignored the voices of tens of thousands of New Yorkers,\" said Josh Meltzer, Airbnb's head of public policy in New York. \n Enforcement of the new laws will be a challenge. Thousands of short-term apartment rentals are listed for New York City despite a 2010 law that prohibits rentals of fewer than 30 days when the owner or tenant is not present. \n The new law won't apply to rentals in single-family homes, row houses or apartment spare rooms if the resident is present. \n The complicated rules mean many New Yorkers may not know whether they can legally rent out their homes \u2014 and Airbnb says it does not have the ability to remove listings that violate the 2010 law. \n Supporters say the imposition of fines will likely be driven by complaints from neighbors. Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal said the intention is to go after commercial operators who rent large numbers of vacant units in multi-apartment buildings. \n \"That's who we're targeting,\" said the Manhattan Democrat, who sponsored the bill in the Assembly. \n Airbnb mounted a last-minute campaign to kill the measure and this week proposed alternative regulations that the company argued would address concerns about short-term rentals without onerous fines. \n Most people who list a rental on Airbnb are looking to make a little money while they're out of town, according to Chris Lehane, head of global policy for San Francisco-based Airbnb. The company says the 46,000 Airbnb hosts in New York City have generated more than $2 billion in economic activity. \n \"It's baffling to us in this time of economic inequality that folks would be looking to impose fines of as much as $7,500 on a middle-class person looking to use the home that they live in to help make ends meet,\" Lehane said before the bill was signed. \n A spokesman for Cuomo said the administration gave the bill careful consideration. \n \"Ultimately, these activities are already expressly prohibited by law,\" said spokesman Rich Azzopardi. \n An investigation of Airbnb rentals from 2010 to 2014 by the office of state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman found that 72 percent of the units in New York City were illegal, with commercial operators constituting 6 percent of the hosts and supplying 36 percent of the rentals. \n Schneiderman vowed to fight any legal challenge to the new law. \n \"The law signed today will provide vital protections for New York tenants and help prevent the continued proliferation of illegal, unregulated hotels, and we will defend it,\" he said in a statement. \n As of August, Airbnb had 45,000 city listings and 13,000 others across the state. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New York enacts restrictions on Airbnb, with fines of up to $7,500"}

He denied touching the bag, even though special powder authorities put on the fake drugs was on his hands. \n \"I don't find Mr. Gorion to be credible,\" U.S. District Judge J.

{"date": "October 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Keystone Steele City pumping station, into which the planned Keystone XL pipeline is to connect to, is seen in Steele City, Neb., in November of 2015. \n WASHINGTON >> Hacked emails show Hillary Clinton's campaign wrestled with how to announce her opposition to construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline without losing the support of labor unions that supported to project. \n Emails published this week by WikiLeaks show debate and confusion within the Clinton camp as it faced down the unexpectedly strong primary challenge by liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders, who opposed the pipeline. \n As Clinton prepared to come out against the pipeline last year, her aides worried about how her shift in position would be perceived. \n Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon asked in an email whether the candidate's \"newfound position on Keystone\" would be \"greeted cynically and perhaps as part of some manufactured attempt to project sincerity?\" \n The emails were stolen from the accounts of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, the latest in a series of high-profile hacks that U.S. intelligence officials have blamed on Russia. Clinton has condemned the breaches as an attempt by a hostile foreign government to sway the election in favor of her Republican rival, Donald Trump. \n For seven years, the administration of President Barack Obama delayed deciding whether to build the pipeline to carry heavy crude oil from the tar sands of western Canada more than 1,700 miles to refineries on the U.S Gulf Coast. The pipeline had long been a flashpoint in the political debate over climate change, with environmentalists opposing its construction and Republicans in Congress voicing strong support. \n As secretary of state, Clinton helped oversee the federal government's yearslong review of the pipeline's economic and environmental impact. Asked about the issue in 2010, Clinton said: \"We've not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so.\" \n But once she left the State Department and began preparing for her presidential run, Clinton studiously avoided taking a hard position on whether the pipeline should be built. Emails show that throughout 2015, Clinton's aides were awaiting word on when Obama would come out against the pipeline, offering Clinton a measure of political cover to do the same. \n Clinton campaign labor liaison Nikki Budzinski and others warned that opposing the Keystone pipeline might earn the ire of union leaders who supported the pipeline due to the thousands of construction jobs that would be created. Political director Amanda Renteria offered reassurance in an August 2015 email that even if Obama took that position, the campaign could still keep support of the trade unions. \n \"We are so close to getting bldg trades and if we do this right, it will be ok even though they won't like it,\" Renteria wrote. \n Energy adviser Trevor Houser circulated talking points intended to minimize potential political damage.

{"date": "October 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke during a campaign rally today in Johnstown, Pa. \n CLEVELAND >> Hillary Clinton ramped up her pressure on Donald Trump in the election's most competitive states Friday with an emotional TV ad targeting his criticism of a Muslim-American family. Trump vowed to go all-out in the final three weeks so he'll have no regrets \u2014 even if he loses. \n The nominees retrenched behind familiar arguments a day after appearing together at a charity event that veered into cutting personal attacks, an unexpected metaphor for this year's take-no-prisoners presidential campaign. Clinton's new ad features Khizr Khan, whom Trump assailed after Khan spoke at the Democratic National Convention. \n In the minute-long ad, which Clinton's campaign said was airing in seven battleground states, Khan retells how his son, Captain Humayun Khan, died in Iraq seeking to protect his U.S. military unit from a suicide bomber. \n \"Mr. Trump, would my son have a place in your America?\" the father asks, tearing up as the ad fades to black. \n Trump focused some of his criticism on Michelle Obama, who has emerged as one of the most effective voices for Clinton. One of the country's most popular Democrats, the first lady for years has been loath to devote significant time to campaigning, but has done so in recent days with searing indictments of Trump's treatment of women. \n \"All she wants to do is campaign,\" Trump said as he rallied supporters in North Carolina. He cited comments Mrs. Obama made during her husband's 2008 campaign in which she said someone who can't run their own house can't run the White House. \"She's the one that started that,\" Trump said. \n The typically self-assured Trump was unusually candid about the possibility of losing the election, a prospect that's grown in likelihood as Clinton solidifies her lead in battleground states that will decide the election. Trump said he is packing his schedule with campaign events through Election Day so he will know he spared no effort even if ultimately unsuccessful. \n \"I will be happy with myself,\" he said. \n Trump and Clinton were still sharply at odds over his unprecedented assertion in the final debate on Wednesday that he may not concede if he loses. \n She said Friday at a Cleveland campaign stop, \"Make no mistake, by doing that, he is threatening our democracy.\" She said that America knows \"the difference between leadership and dictatorship.\" \n Trump, meanwhile, has said he's merely reserving the right to contest the results if the outcome is unclear or questionable. Underpinning his threat is his contention \u2014 presented with no evidence \u2014 that the election is \"rigged\" against him and may be soiled by widespread voter fraud. He's urged supporters to \"monitor\" polling places for potential shenanigans. \n Fanning those flames, Russia's government has asked Oklahoma and two other states to allow Russian officials to be present at polling stations on Election Day, to study the \"US experience in organization of voting process.\" Allegations by the U.S. government that Russia is trying to influence the election by hacking Democratic groups has fed a Clinton camp claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin is siding with Trump. \n The Oklahoma secretary of state's office said Friday it had denied the Russian request, in line with state law. At the White House, press secretary Josh Earnest said it was unclear what Moscow was trying to do. \n \"It's appropriate that people might be suspicious of their motives,\" Earnest said. \n Early voting is underway in more than 30 states. Clinton, reaching for voters who may be reconsidering their support for Trump, said in Ohio that she knows they still have questions about her. \"I want to answer them,\" she said. \"I want to earn your vote.\" \n With the final debate behind them, the two candidates appeared together Thursday night for likely the last time in the campaign, at a Catholic fundraiser that turned unusually hostile. \n At the dinner, a tradition intended as a display of national unity, Trump drew boos when he referred to Clinton being \"so corrupt\" and said without apparent humor that she was appearing at the event \"pretending not to hate Catholics.\" \n But Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the New York archbishop seated between them at the dinner, described a less antagonistic moment backstage after he invited them to pray. \n \"After the little prayer, Mr. Trump tuned to Secretary Clinton and said, 'You know, you are one tough and talented woman,' and he said this has been a good experience,\" Dolan told NBC's \"Today\" on Friday. \"And she said, 'Donald, whatever happens, we need to work together afterwards.'\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "No regrets, Trump vows; Clinton pursues his supporters"}

{"date": "October 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte delivers a speech during the Philippines-China Trade and Investment Forum at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing Thursday. \n MANILA >> Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he did not mean he would cut off ties with the United States when he said in China that he was separating from the U.S., adding it's in his country's best interest to stay with America. \n Despite the clarification, the tough-talking president kept up on his tirades against the U.S., saying in a late-night speech in his southern hometown of Davao city that he would never travel to America \"in this lifetime.\" \n At an economic forum Thursday in Beijing, where he made a state visit, Duterte declared \"my separation from the United States \u2026 both in military and economics also.\" His pronouncement was met with applause, but Duterte did not explain what he exactly intended to do and when. \n Duterte, however, said in an arrival speech in Davao that he was not severing ties with his country's treaty ally that is home to a large number of Filipino expatriates. \n \"When you say severance of ties, you cut the diplomatic relations. I cannot do that. Why? It's to the best interest of my country that we maintain that relationship,\" Duterte said, adding that Filipinos were not ready to embrace such an option. \n What he meant by his remarks in China, Duterte said, was ending a Philippine foreign policy that closely leaned toward the U.S. \n Ahead of his China visit, Duterte made a series of pronouncements to curb Philippine security engagements with the U.S., including the removal of American counterterrorism forces in the country's south and his opposition to planned joint patrols with the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea. He also wanted to stop annual joint combat exercises the Philippines hosted alongside the U.S. military that China opposes. \n Duterte has said he did not want to embroil the Philippines in an unwinnable war with China, which could instead be tapped as a major trading partner and source of development funds. \n U.S. officials said they have not received any formal Philippine notice of Duterte's pronouncements, adding the alliance benefits both countries and should continue to blossom. \n However, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said today there had been \"too many troubling public statements\" by Duterte in recent months leading to uncertainty about his intent. He said that the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia would discuss that uncertainty when he travels to the Philippines this weekend. \n U.S.-Philippine ties also got attention on the U.S. presidential campaign trail Friday. Republican candidate Donald Trump told a rally in North Carolina that the Philippine shift toward closer relations with China after decades of a pro-U.S. foreign policy showed that \"America has grown weak.\" \n He said that the Philippines is a \"very important strategic ally\" and China and Russia \"are probably going to take it.\" \n Duterte's reaching out to China, which has been locked in longstanding territorial disputes with the Philippines in the South China Sea, and his severe criticisms of the U.S. has come under fire at home. \n Former Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, who brought the triumphant arbitration case against China over the disputes, said Duterte's shift from Washington to Beijing should be regarded \"a national tragedy.\" \n \"The declared shift in foreign policy, casting aside a long-time reliable ally to hastily embrace an aggressive neighbor that vehemently rejects international law, is both unwise and incomprehensible,\" del Rosario said in a statement. \n \"What is unfolding before us must be considered a national tragedy, which does not need to happen,\" he said. \n The criticism by del Rosario, a respected Asian diplomat, is among the strongest so far of Duterte's declared policy to back away from America while reaching out to China and Russia. His main political ally, former President Fidel Ramos, has also criticized Duterte's profane tirades against President Barack Obama and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \n As the foreign secretary of Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, del Rosario spearheaded the filing of an arbitration case that challenged the validity of China's claims to virtually the entire South China Sea. In its July ruling, the tribunal invalidated China's claims under a 1982 U.N. treaty in an embarrassing defeat that Beijing has ignored. \n The U.S. and its Western and Asian allies have called on China to respect the outcome. \n At the end of Duterte's trip to China, both countries announced in a joint statement several trade and business deals and closer cooperation on a range of concerns. They added they have resumed dialogue on the South China Sea. \n There was no mention of the arbitration ruling or Duterte's call for China to respect the rights of Filipinos to fish in the disputed Scarborough Shoal, where Beijing's coast guard ships continue to drive them away. But both sides agreed to continue talking. \n \"Without prejudice to other mechanisms, a bilateral consultation mechanism can be useful, which will meet regularly on current and other issues of concern to either side on the South China Sea,\" the joint statement said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philippine president says 'separation' does not mean cutting ties with U.S."}

{"date": "October 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this image made from video, smoke rises from a building where two militants are believed to be holed up, according to Rudaw TV, in Kirkuk, Iraq, today. \n KIRKUK, Iraq >> Islamic State militants armed with assault rifles and explosives attacked targets in and around the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk early today, in an assault that appeared aimed at diverting Iraqi security forces from a massive offensive against the IS-held city of Mosul. \n At least 13 workers, including four Iranians, were killed when IS militants stormed a power plant north of Kirkuk and then blew themselves up. \n Multiple explosions meanwhile rocked the city and gun battles were ongoing, said witnesses in Kirkuk, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were concerned for their safety. Much of the fighting was centered on a government compound in the city. They said the streets were largely deserted out of fear of militant snipers. \n IS said its fighters targeted the provincial headquarters. The claim was carried by the IS-run Aamaq news agency and could not immediately be verified. \n Local Kurdish television channel Rudaw aired footage showing black smoke rising over the city as extended bursts of automatic gunfire rang out. It quoted Kirkuk Gov. Najmadin Karim as saying that the militants had not seized any government buildings. \n The fighting raged late into the afternoon, and heavy smoke billowed up from the area of the provincial headquarters, where clashes were underway, according to live footage on the local Terkmeneli TV channel. It was unclear what caused the blaze. \n In the power plant attack, which took place in Dibis, a town north of Kirkuk, three IS suicide bombers stormed the facility and killed 13 workers, including four Iranians, before blowing themselves up as police arrived, said Maj. Ahmed Kader Ali, the Dibis police chief. \n Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi condemned the Kirkuk assault, which he said killed four Iranians and wounded three others, according to the official IRNA news agency. It was not immediately clear if Iranians were targeted in other attacks. \n There was no immediate word on casualties among civilians or Kurdish forces in Kirkuk city. \n Kirkuk is some 100 miles from the Islamic State-held city of Mosul, where Iraqi forces have been waging a wide-scale offensive since Monday. \n IS has in the past resorted to suicide bombings in and around Baghdad in response to battlefield losses elsewhere in the country. But the complex assault in Kirkuk more closely resembled those carried out by the Taliban in the Afghan capital, Kabul. \n Kirkuk is some 180 miles north of Baghdad and southeast of Mosul. The oil-rich city is claimed by both Iraq's central government and the country's Kurdish region. Kurdish forces assumed full control of Kirkuk in the summer of 2014, as Iraq's army and police crumbled in the face of a lightning advance by IS. \n Kemal Kerkuki, a senior commander of Kurdish peshmerga forces west of Kirkuk, said the town where his base is located outside the city also came under attack early Friday, but that the base was now under control. \n He said IS maintains sleeper cells in Kirkuk and the surrounding villages. \"We arrested one recently and he confessed,\" he said, adding that the attackers may have posed as displaced civilians in order to infiltrate the city. \n Kirkuk province has absorbed hundreds of thousands of displaced people since IS first overran wide stretches of northern and western Iraq in the summer of 2014, capturing Mosul, the country's second largest city. \n Iraqi and Kurdish forces backed by a U.S.-led coalition launched a multi-pronged assault this week to retake Mosul and surrounding areas from IS. The operation is the largest undertaken by the Iraqi military since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. \n Iraqi officials said they had advanced as far as the town of Bartella, 15 kilometers (nine miles) from Mosul's outskirts, by Thursday. \n Lt. Gen. Talib Shaghati of Iraq's elite forces held a press conference Friday a kilometer (half a mile) away from the town and insisted the special forces had \"full control.\" He said special forces were clearing explosives and contending with some snipers who remained in the town. Gunfire could be heard in the distance. \n Elsewhere in Iraq, the country's top Shiite cleric called on forces taking part in the Mosul offensive to protect civilians, and for residents of Mosul, a mainly Sunni city, to cooperate with security forces. \n \"We stress today upon our beloved fighters, as we have before on many occasions, that they exercise the greatest degree of restraint in dealing with civilians stuck in the areas where there is fighting,\" the reclusive Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said in a Friday sermon read by an aide. \"Protect them and prevent any harm to them by all possible means.\" \n Some 3,900 people, or about 650 families, have fled Mosul and the nearby Hamdaniyah district since the operation began this week, according to Adrian Edwards of the U.N. refugee agency. \n Ravina Shamdasani, of the U.N. human rights office, said it had \"verified information\" that IS had forced 550 people to relocate to Mosul from the nearby villages of Samalia and Najafia on Monday, part of an \"apparent policy of preventing civilians from escaping to areas controlled by Iraqi security forces.\" \n Shamdasani reiterated concerns IS could use civilians as human shields, and said the office was investigating reports that the group had killed at least 40 civilians for suspected disloyalty.

He said it was done \"in a routine, lawful manner without ship escorts and without incident.\" \n A Chinese defense ministry statement called it \"a gravely illegal act\" and \"intentionally provocative.\" The Chinese navy sent a guided missile destroyer and an escort vessel that \"spotted and verified the American ships and warned them to leave,\" the statement said. \n Ross said there was just one U.S. vessel involved. \n The Paracels, a group of islands and reefs, are occupied by China but are also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan. Ross said the ship passed within an \"excessive\" claim of territorial waters by China between two land features, although it did not go within 12 nautical miles of them. \n He did not specify where in the Paracels the ship sailed. \n The U.S. Navy has now conducted four freedom-of-navigation operations in the past year in the South China Sea, where China has reclaimed land on a massive scale to assert its claim to disputed features \u2014 mostly in the Spratly islands that lie further south. \n China has looked dimly upon the U.S. operations, which it views as meddling in waters where the U.S. does not have territorial claims. Today's operation comes a day after the leader of the Philippines, one of the six governments with claims in the South China Sea, announced during a visit to Beijing his nation's \"separation\" from the United States, as it seeks to deepen ties with China. \n Ross said the operation was unrelated to any such event. \n The Chinese statement accused the U.S. of being a \"troublemaker\" in the South China at a time when \"under the joint efforts of countries in this region\" the situation is developing positively. \n \"Under these circumstances, for the U.S. to deploy ships to violate Chinese territorial waters is to wish for the whole world to be in chaos\" and to cause troubles from which the U.S. can profit, the statement said. \n Ross denied the operation was provocative. \n He said the U.S. conducts these operations on a regular basis around the world.

But Wednesday's actions against more than 1,000 left-wing students, laborers and tribal people have been seen as among the most brutal in recent years. That's largely because of the van hitting protesters, but police were also seen using a firetruck hose, lobbing tear gas and hitting people and pulling their hair. \n Videos of the van hitting the protesters like bowling pins have gone viral online. \n Associated Press TV footage showed the van repeatedly ramming the protesters as it drove wildly back and forth after activists surrounded and started hitting it with wooden sticks. Horrified protesters are heard screaming and cursing at the police. \n Malayao and a few others were hit and injured, some hospitalized. \n Lawmakers have also called for a congressional inquiry. U.S.-based Human Rights Watch urged national police chief Ronald dela Rosa, who has expressed dismay over the violent dispersal, to carry out an impartial investigation and prosecute those behind the violence. \n \"Failure to do so will only guarantee that the culture of impunity for unlawful police violence continues,\" HRW said in a statement. \n Wednesday's protesters were demanding an end to the presence of visiting U.S. troops in the Philippines and to support Duterte's vow to chart a foreign policy not dependent on the U.S., the country's longtime treaty ally. \n The violence happened as the police and Duterte are under increased international scrutiny for their alleged role in the killings of thousands of drug suspects and pushers as part of the tough-talking president's war on illegal drugs. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Filipino protesters burn U.S. flag, demand punishment for police"}

{"date": "October 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, left, speaks during a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, unseen, at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing Thursday. \n MANILA >> A former top Filipino diplomat, who brought the triumphant arbitration case against China over territorial disputes, said the Philippine president's declaration to pivot away from Washington to Beijing should be regarded \"a national tragedy.\" \n \"The declared shift in foreign policy, casting aside a long-time reliable ally to hastily embrace an aggressive neighbor that vehemently rejects international law, is both unwise and incomprehensible,\" said former Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario today. \n \"What is unfolding before us must be considered a national tragedy, which does not need to happen,\" he said in a statement. \n The criticism by del Rosario, a respected Asian diplomat, is among the strongest so far of President Rodrigo Duterte's publicly declared policy to back away from America, his country's longtime treaty ally, while reaching out to China and Russia. His main political ally, former President Fidel Ramos, has also criticized Duterte's profane tirades against President Barack Obama and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \n At an economic forum Thursday in Beijing, Duterte declared \"my separation from the United States \u2026 both in military and economics also.\" His pronouncement was met with applause, but Duterte did not explain what he exactly intended to do and when. \n His accompanying Cabinet officials tried to downplay his remarks soon afterward, saying the Philippines would not cut off trade ties with the U.S., one of the country's largest trading partners, aid providers and a treaty ally. The differing pronouncements have stirred confusion and uncertainties. \n \"There is no rush for us to interpret the speech of the president,\" presidential spokeswoman Marie Banaag said in a daily news briefing in Manila. \"We have to wait for guidelines.\" \n Ahead of his China visit, Duterte made a series of pronouncements to curb Philippine security engagements with the U.S., including the removal of American counterterrorism forces in the country's south and his opposition to planned joint patrols with the U.S. Navy in the South China Sea. He also wanted to stop annual joint combat exercises the Philippines hosted alongside the U.S. military that China opposes. \n Duterte has said he did not want to embroil the Philippines in an unwinnable war with China, which could instead be tapped as a major trading partner and source of development funds. \n U.S. officials said they have not received any formal Philippine notice of Duterte's pronouncements, adding the longtime alliance benefits both countries and should continue to blossom. \n As the foreign secretary of Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, del Rosario spearheaded the filing of an arbitration case that challenged the validity of China's claims to virtually the entire South China Sea. The tribunal invalidated China's claims under a 1982 U.N. treaty, an embarrassing defeat that Beijing has ignored. \n The U.S. and its Western and Asian allies have called on China to respect the outcome. \n \"We must be with responsible nations with whom we share our core values of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law,\" said del Rosario, who also served as Manila's ambassador to Washington. \"To stand otherwise, is not what Filipinos are, it is not what we do, it is not what is right.\" \n At the end Duterte's trip Friday, both countries said in a joint statement several trade and business deals and closer cooperation on a range of concerns and added both sides resumed dialogue on the South China Sea issues. \n There was no mention of the arbitration ruling or Duterte's call for China to respect the rights of Filipinos to fish in the disputed Scarborough Shoal, where Beijing's coast guard ships continue to block and drive them away. But both sides agreed to continue talking. \n \"Without prejudice to other mechanisms, a bilateral consultation mechanism can be useful, which will meet regularly on current and other issues of concern to either side on the South China Sea,\" the joint statement said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ex-top diplomat: Duterte's China shift a 'national tragedy'"}

{"date": "October 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Logo of Takata Corp. at an auto supply shop in Tokyo. The U.S. government is confirming another death due to the rupture of an air bag made by Takata Corp. \n DETROIT >> A 50-year-old woman who died after a car wreck last month in California is the 11th U.S. victim of Takata Corp.'s defective air bag inflators. \n The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration confirmed the woman's death on Thursday but didn't release her name. Up to five people also may have been killed by the air bags in Malaysia, bringing the number of deaths globally to as many as 16. \n The agency said the woman, identified in Riverside County, California, coroner's records as Delia Robles, 50, of Corona, was driving a 2001 Honda Civic. Riverside police said in a statement that a man making a left turn in a Chevrolet pickup truck was hit head-on by the Civic. The woman was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she died from her injuries, the statement said. \n \"The left turn: that's what caused the collision,\" police officer Ryan Railsback told the Riverside Press-Enterprise, adding that police continue to investigate with state and federal help. \"They're still working on whether the air bag system played any role in the death.\" \n Honda said in a statement that its \"thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family of the driver during this difficult time.\" \n Roble's son, Jose Contreras, told KCAL-TV that his mother was driving to get a flu shot when she crashed. He said she was doing 25 mph at the time. \n \"My mom was a very safe driver. Seat belt was on, always,\" he said. \n He said he is considering taking legal action. \n \"It's not like she was sick and she had a terminal illness, and you knew this was coming. This happened from one minute to another,\" Contreras said. \n Takata air bags can inflate with too much force, which causes a metal canister to rupture and spew shrapnel into the vehicle. Tokyo-based Takata, unlike other manufacturers, uses the chemical ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion that inflates air bags in a crash. \n But the chemical can deteriorate when exposed to prolonged high heat and humidity and can burn faster than designed. That can blow apart a metal canister designed to contain the explosion. \n The problem touched off what is now the largest auto recall in U.S. history. More than 69 million inflators have been recalled in the U.S. and more than 100 million worldwide. Takata faces billions in costs. \n Honda said the Civic involved in the California crash had been included in multiple recalls since 2008. The company said it mailed more than 20 recall notices to the car's registered owners, but its records indicate the vehicle was never repaired. \n Company spokesman Chris Martin said \"multiple\" notices were sent to the victim's address, but he did not know if she received them. She bought the car at the end of 2015, he said. \n In June, NHTSA urged owners of 313,000 older Hondas and Acuras to stop driving them and get them repaired, after new tests found that their Takata inflators are extremely dangerous. The agency said it had data showing that chances are as high as 50 percent that the inflators can explode in a crash. Martin said about 300,000 have not been repaired, and that the owners have been difficult to reach. Just over 1 million Hondas originally had the risky type of inflators. \n NHTSA's urgent advisory covers vehicles that are up to 16 years old including 2001 and 2002 Honda Civics and Accords, the 2002 and 2003 Acura TL, the 2002 Honda Odyssey and CR-V, and the 2003 Acura CL and Honda Pilot, NHTSA said. They were recalled from 2008 to 2011, and about 70 percent of them already have been repaired, the agency said. \n Honda says it has sufficient supplies of replacement air bags for owners who still need them. \n The older the inflators are, and the more time they spend in heat and humidity, the more likely they are to malfunction. \n The government urged people to go to safercar.gov and enter their vehicle identification number to see if their car or truck is being recalled. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. confirms 11th death due to Takata air bags"}
