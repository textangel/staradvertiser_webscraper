The name was not disclosed. One of the cars destroyed in a fiery blaze in the parking lot belonged to the retired military man, and his house burned to the ground earlier on Sunday, the reports said. \n The back-to-back loud bangs in the park and parking lot shocked bystanders, many heading to a festival at the park on a sunny autumn day. The apparent blasts occurred around 11:30 a.m. within about 200 meters (yards) of each other. The festival was canceled after the incidents. \n Two men were seriously injured in the park explosion, and a 14-year-old boy had minor leg injuries. No one was hurt at the small parking lot. \n Kyodo News agency said the burned body was found after police received a call saying a person was on fire following what sounded like an explosion. \n Bystanders also reported hearing loud blasts from the parking lot. Flames and black smoke shot into the air and repeated bangs could be heard on video posted on the Asahi newspaper's website. Nearby cars also were damaged. \n Utsunomiya, the capital of Tochigi prefecture, is a city of some 500,000 people about 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Tokyo.

{"date": "October 22, 2016", "text": "WASHINGTON >> Hacked emails from the personal account of Hillary Clinton's top campaign official show some of the attention her team paid to courting black voters. \n There were worries about Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' appeal to that historically Democratic voter group. There was angst over whether Clinton should give a speech on race relations. Meanwhile, a South Carolina Democratic Party official voiced concerns that Clinton hadn't visited a particular region of the state. \n The emails were among hundreds released Saturday by WikiLeaks. The notes were stolen from the email account of John Podesta, the Clinton campaign's chairman, as part of a series of high-profile computer hacks of Democratic targets that U.S. intelligence officials say were orchestrated by Russia, with the intent to influence the Nov. 8 election. \n It was impossible to authenticate each hacked email that WikiLeaks published, but Democrats have openly acknowledged they were hacked and have not pointed to any specific case where an email was altered to inflict political damage. \n SPEECH ON RACE  \n Clinton's campaign debated whether she should give a speech on race. \n Her chief speechwriter, Dan Schwerin, emailed Podesta, communications director Jennifer Palmieri and others in February 2016 to say that, as conceived, the speech would demonstrate Clinton's \"sustained and comprehensive commitment\" to improving race relations and her lifelong sympathy toward the plight of minorities in the U.S. \n Both Bill Clinton and candidate Clinton were clear that the speech shouldn't be \"a big mea culpa,\" but the former president also said \"we shouldn't try to defend the indefensible.\" \n Schwerin went on to say that adviser Minyon Moore had raised tough questions about the wisdom of making the speech because it could \"unintentionally end up elevating questions that aren't yet being widely asked and introduce new damaging information, especially super predator, to a lot more voters.\" \n In a 1996 speech about Bill Clinton's crime bill when she was first lady, Hillary Clinton described young people in gangs as \"super-predators.\" \n Some blacks find the term offensive and have sought during the campaign to hold her accountable for it. Hillary Clinton has said she regrets using the term. \n After a \"gut check\" conversation with Moore and subsequent talks with policy advisers Jake Sullivan and Maya Harris, Schwerin says in the email that the campaign hierarchy is \"mostly persuaded\" by Moore's concerns. Instead, a decision to push the Supreme Court nomination issue could replace the race speech. \n Schwerin ultimately closes his memo with the idea that \"if we're slipping fast, maybe it's worth rolling the dice and doing the speech. If we're holding relatively steady, maybe we see if we can ride this out without doing the speech.\" \n Clinton offered a detailed plan to overcome racial disparities in a February speech in Harlem. \n PEE DEE REGION \n In an apparent effort to court young African-American voters in South Carolina's Pee Dee region, Hillary Clinton staffers promised Jamie Harrison, the state's Democratic Party chairman, that his area would not be overlooked by Clinton. They also offered up some bold names in black entertainment who could stump for votes. \n In a Jan. 28, 2016, email, Brynne Craig, deputy director of State Campaigns for Hillary for America, summarizes a conversation with Harrison, who is unhappy that Clinton hasn't visited the Pee Dee region, the northeastern corner of the state and about 100 miles east of Columbia, the state capital. \n Craig says he assured Harrison that such a visit is a top priority for the former first lady, or her husband, former President Bill Clinton. (Clinton visited the region in late February and later won the state's Democratic presidential primary.) \n Craig says Harrison also mentioned the need to bring younger surrogates into the state, not just well-known, older politicos. He says he offered Harrison a partial list of black entertainers they've asked to travel to the state, including singer Usher, actors Anthony Anderson and Gabrielle Union, and athletes Alonzo Mourning and Grant Hill. \n Craig says, \"I feel confident we will be able to increase the amount of surrogates we have in South Carolina \u2013 more importantly the RIGHT kind.\" \n BERNIE SANDERS \n Clinton's campaign worried about Bernie Sanders' appeal to black voters, a key Democratic constituency that Clinton counted on. \n In a July 2015 email, Podesta frets to other campaign staffers about Sanders, who had challenged Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination all the way through to the end of the primary process. \n The Vermont senator had built his campaign around an anti-Wall Street, anti-establishment message with strong appeal to progressives \n In the email, Podesta says of Sanders: \"He'll be at Sharpton rallies pretty soon,\" referring to civil rights activist Al Sharpton. \"Still think we should do something with him on VRA Anniversary.\" \n Sanders visited Dallas and Houston in July 2015 for a series of town-hall meetings in Southern cities to help boost his support. \n Clinton called in to Sharpton's nationally syndicated radio show on the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act on Aug. 6 to appeal to blacks to turn out to vote during the primaries. Her subsequent support among blacks in the South helped her gain a big delegate advantage over Sanders. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Emails show Clinton campaign attention to black voters"}

{"date": "October 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Sunday, Oct. 9, 2016. \n WASHINGTON >> A look at where Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump stand on three dozen issues: \n ABORTION \n Persistent Republican-led efforts to restrict access to abortion and to curb government funding for Planned Parenthood have been hotly debated in Washington and in states. The issue will be shaped in some way by the next president and could be shaped profoundly if the election winner manages to tip the balance of the Supreme Court. \n Trump, in the third and final presidential debate, said he would appoint justices open to overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion. Clinton vowed to appoint justices who would uphold that ruling, saying, \"We have come too far to have that turned back now.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n CHILD CARE/PAY EQUITY \n In much of the U.S., families spend more on child care for two kids than on housing. And if you're a woman, it's likely you earn less than your male colleagues. That's according to the latest research, which suggests that while the U.S. economy has improved, women and their families are still struggling to make the numbers work. \n Women comprise about 57 percent of the labor force and many of them have young children. If they aren't getting paid enough to make ends meet, more families will seek out government aid programs or low-quality, unlicensed daycares for their children. \n Clinton wants a 12-week government-paid family and medical leave program, guaranteeing workers two-thirds of their wages up to a certain amount. Trump proposes six weeks of leave for new mothers, with the government paying wages equivalent to unemployment benefits. \n Both candidates propose tax relief for child care costs. Trump's plan provides for a new income tax deduction for child care expenses, other tax benefits and a new rebate or tax credit for low-income families. Clinton says no family should spend more than 10 percent of its income on child care. She would double the child tax credit for families with children 4 and younger, to $2,000 per child. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n CHINA \n Tensions have been rising over China's assertive behavior in the seas of Asia. The U.S. also accuses China of unfair trading practices and cyber theft of business secrets. \n Trump says that the sheer volume of trade gives the U.S. leverage over China. He accuses China of undervaluing its currency to make its exports artificially cheap and proposes tariffs as high as 45 percent on Chinese imports if Beijing doesn't change its behavior. Such action could risk a trade war that would make many products in the U.S. more expensive. \n Clinton says the U.S. needs to press the rising Asian power to play by international rules, whether on trade or territorial disputes. \n While many of China's neighbors are unnerved by its military build-up, the wider world needs the U.S. and China to get along, to tackle global problems. The U.S. and China are also economically inter-dependent, and punishment by one party could end up hurting the other. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n CLIMATE CHANGE \n It's as if Trump and Clinton live on two entirely different Earths: one warming, one not. Clinton says climate change threatens us all, while Trump repeatedly tweets that global warming is a hoax. \n Measurements and scientists say Clinton's Earth is much closer to the warming reality. And it is worsening. \n From May 2015 to August 2016, 16 months in a row set records globally for heat, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The world is on pace to break the record for hottest year, a record already broken in 2010, 2014 and 2015. It is about 1.8 degrees warmer than a century ago. \n But it's more than temperatures. Scientists have connected man-made climate change to deadly heat waves, droughts and flood-inducing downpours. Studies say climate change is raising sea levels, melting ice and killing coral. It's making people sicker with asthma and allergies and may eventually shrink our bank accounts. \n Trump calls attempts to remedy global warming \"just a very, very expensive form of tax.\" \n Clinton proposes to spend $60 billion to switch from dirty fossil fuels to cleaner energy. She promises to deliver on President Barack Obama's pledge that by 2025, the U.S. will be emitting 30 percent less heat-trapping gases than in 2005. \n \u2014\u2014 \n DEBT \n The federal government is borrowing about one out of seven dollars it spends and steadily piling up debt \u2014 to the tune of about $14 trillion held by investors. Over the long term, that threatens the economy and people's pocketbooks. \n Most economists say rising debt risks crowding out investment and forcing interest rates up, among other problems. At the same time, rapidly growing spending on federal health care programs like Medicare and the drain on Social Security balances caused by the rising tide of baby boomers could squeeze out other spending, on roads, education, the armed forces and more. \n It takes spending cuts, tax increases or both to dent the deficit. Lawmakers instead prefer higher spending and tax cuts. \n Neither Clinton nor Trump has focused on the debt. \n Trump has promised massive tax cuts that would drive up the debt and he's shown no interest in curbing expensive benefit programs like Medicare. \n Clinton, by contrast, is proposing tax increases on the wealthy. But she wouldn't use the money to bring down the debt. Instead, she'd turn around and spend it on college tuition subsidies, infrastructure and health care. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n EDUCATION \n The U.S. has some 50 million K-12 students. Teaching them, preparing them for college and careers, costs taxpayers more than $580 billion a year, or about $11,670 per pupil per year. A better education usually translates into higher earnings. \n And while high school graduations are up sharply and dropout rates down, the nation has a ways to go to match the educational outcomes elsewhere. American schoolchildren trail their counterparts in Japan, Korea, Germany, France and elsewhere. \n Clinton wants to make preschool universal for all 4-year-old children within 10 years by providing new federal dollars to states. Trump proposes to spend $20 billion during his first year in office to help states expand school choice programs. He wants states to divert an additional $110 billion of their own education money to help parents who want their children to go to other schools. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ENERGY \n Energy independence has been a goal of every president since Richard Nixon. Clinton and Trump have very different ways to get there. How energy is produced and where it comes from affect jobs, the economy and the environment. \n Domestic production of all types of energy except coal has boomed in recent years, spurred by improved drilling techniques such as fracking and discoveries of vast oil supplies in North Dakota and natural gas in states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and West Virginia. \n Clinton vows to continue the boom while ensuring the U.S. generates enough renewable energy to power every home in America within 10 years. \n Trump vows to \"unleash American energy,\" allowing unfettered production of oil, coal, natural gas and other sources to push the U.S. toward energy independence and create jobs. \n Both Clinton and Trump support natural gas, a cleaner alternative to coal. Trump calls for rescinding the Clean Power Plan, a key element of President Barack Obama's strategy to fight climate change. Clinton is committed to Obama's climate-change goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30 percent by 2025. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY \n \"Your Majesty\" isn't in the American political lexicon. But when a president sets a major policy by edict, skirting Congress, it sets off a debate that traces back to the time of kings and queens \u2014 and the Founding Fathers, who rejected the authority of the crown. Lawmakers cry foul when a president, especially of the other party, usurps their authority through executive action. Defenders say it can be the only way to get something done when Congress is gridlocked. \n President Barack Obama has used executive authority expansively, most notably on immigration. \n Donald Trump says he'd make sure Obama's \"unconstitutional actions\" never come back. But some Republicans worry Trump, too, might pursue an \"imperial presidency.\" Hillary Clinton supported Obama's unilateral move to curb deportation of millions of immigrants in the U.S. country illegally. The Supreme Court deadlocked in June over the major portion of the immigration executive actions, effectively killing the plan for the rest of Obama's presidency. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n FOREIGN POLICY \n How the U.S. uses its influence as the world's sole superpower is a central feature of presidential power. \n It can mean taking the country to war \u2014 to protect the homeland or to defend an ally. Or it can mean using diplomacy to prevent war. It can affect U.S. jobs, too, as choices arise either to expand trade deals or to erect barriers to protect U.S. markets. \n In the contest between Clinton and Trump, America's role in the world is a point of sharp differences. Each says the U.S. must be the predominant power, but they would exercise leadership differently. Trump calls his approach \"America first,\" meaning alliances and coalitions would not pass muster unless they produced a net benefit to the U.S. Clinton sees international partnerships as essential tools for using U.S. influence and lessening the chances of war. \n These divergent views could mean very different approaches to the military fight and ideological struggle against the Islamic State, the future of Afghanistan and Iraq, the contest with China for influence in Asia and the Pacific, and growing nervousness in Europe over Russian aggression. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n GUNS \n The right to bear arms is carved into the Constitution and seemingly embedded in the national DNA. But after a seemingly endless stretch of violence, Americans are confronting how far those rights extend. \n Do Americans have the right to have AR-style firearms, the long guns with a military look used in the past year in several mass shootings? Should they be able to buy magazines that hold 10 or more bullets? Should every gun buyer have to pass a background check? \n Trump casts himself as an ardent protector of gun rights and proclaims that if more \"good guys\" were armed there would be fewer gun tragedies. He's made fealty to the Second Amendment a quality he wants in Supreme Court nominees. \n Clinton wants to renew an expired ban on assault-type weapons instituted when her husband was president. She's also called for measures to ensure background checks are completed before a gun sale goes forward, mandating such checks for gun-show sales and repealing a law that shields gun manufacturers from liability. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n HEALTH CARE \n About 9 in 10 Americans now have health insurance, more than at any time in history. But progress is incomplete, and the future far from certain. Rising costs could bedevil the next occupant of the White House. \n Millions of people previously shut out have been covered by President Barack Obama's health care law. No one can be denied coverage anymore because of a pre-existing condition. But \"Obamacare\" remains divisive, and premiums for next year are rising sharply in many communities. As well, some major insurers are leaving the program. \n Whether Americans would be better off trading for a GOP plan is another question. Recent studies found Trump's proposal would make 18 million to 20 million people uninsured. GOP congressional leaders have a more comprehensive approach, but key details are still missing. \n Overall health care spending is trending higher again, and prices for prescription drugs \u2014 new and old \u2014 are a major worry. \n Medicare's insolvency date has moved up by two years \u2014 to 2028. \n Clinton would stay the course, adjusting as needed. Republicans are united on repealing Obama's law, but it's unclear how they would replace it. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n HOMEGROWN EXTREMISM \n Radical Islamic militancy has inspired a series of deadly attacks on U.S. soil, shaking the American psyche and leaving the presidential contenders at odds over how to respond. \n The culprits typically have no ties to foreign terrorist organizations, no explicit directions from overseas and no formal training. \n Instead, they've blended into American society and skated beneath the radar of federal investigators grappling with a frenetic threat landscape and hundreds of investigations across the country. \n The bombing in Manhattan in September that injured more than two dozen people crystallized concerns: A journal found with the Afghan-born U.S. citizen accused in the explosion praised terrorists like Osama bin Laden, prosecutors say. \n Trump has proposed various means of choking off a terrorist influx, though that would do little to stop self-radicalized Americans. \n Clinton says Muslim-Americans help the struggle against homegrown extremism because they can prevent young people from joining jihadis and notify authorities when they suspect radicalization. She'd prohibit people on terrorist watch lists from being able to purchase weapons. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n IMMIGRATION \n The future of millions of people living in the U.S. illegally could well be shaped by the presidential election. The stakes are high, too, for those who employ them, help them fit into neighborhoods, or want them gone. \n Trump at first pledged to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. Not only that, he'd build a wall all along the Mexican border. But his position has evolved. He's sticking to his vow to build the wall and make Mexico pay. But he's no longer proposing to deport people who have not committed crimes beyond their immigration offenses. Still, he's not proposing a way for people living in the country illegally to gain legal status. \n Clinton, in contrast, would overhaul immigration laws to include a path to citizenship, not just legal status. \n Illegal immigration has been at nearly 40-year lows for several years. It even appears that Mexican migration trends have reversed, with more Mexicans leaving the U.S. than arriving. Billions of dollars have been spent in recent years to build fencing, improve border technology and expand the Border Patrol. \n Nonetheless the Mexican border remains a focal point for those who argue that the country is not secure. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n INCOME INEQUALITY \n Income inequality has surged near levels last seen before the Great Depression. The average income for the top 1 percent of households climbed 7.7 percent last year to $1.36 million, according to tax data. That privileged sliver of the population saw pay climb at almost twice the rate of income growth for the other 99 percent, whose pay averaged a humble $48,768. \n Dogged on the issue during the primaries by Bernie Sanders, Clinton has highlighted inequality in multiple speeches. She hopes to redirect more money to the middle class and impoverished. Clinton would raise taxes on the wealthy, increase the federal minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, provide universal pre-kindergarten and offer the prospect of tuition-free college. \n Trump offers a blunter message about a system \"rigged\" against average Americans. To bring back jobs, Trump has promised new trade deals with better terms, greater infrastructure spending than Clinton foresees and tax cuts that he says would propel stronger growth (though independent analysts say his budget plans would raise deficits). \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n INFRASTRUCTURE \n The nation's infrastructure is in need of repair and improvement. On that, politicians generally agree. Harder to answer: How to pay for it and which projects should take priority? \n A reliable infrastructure system is important for the nation's economy, safety and quality of life. \n Public health can be put at risk by poor infrastructure, such as the lead-tainted pipes that contaminated the water supply of Flint, Michigan. \n Poorly maintained highways and congested traffic also can raise the cost of shipping goods and the price consumers pay. \n A recent report by the American Society of Civil Engineers projects the U.S. will face a $1.4 trillion funding gap for its infrastructure by 2025. \n Clinton wants to spend $250 billion over the next five years on public infrastructure and direct an additional $25 billion to a new infrastructure bank to help finance local projects. Trump has said he wants to spend at least double that amount on infrastructure, financed with bonds. Whoever becomes president, it's a staggering amount of money for the federal treasury to put out \u2014 if Congress goes along. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n IRAN \n Last year's nuclear deal with Tehran has significantly reduced for now the threat of a U.S.-Iranian military confrontation. But the deal rests on shaky ground. \n The accord curtailed Iran's nuclear program, pulling it back from atomic weapons capability in exchange for the end of many economic sanctions. \n But the next president could have his or her hands full, dealing with Iran in general and the agreement in particular. Various restrictions on Iran start ending in about seven years. \n As secretary of state, Clinton helped lay the groundwork for the pact. She supports it, while taking a generally tougher tone on Iran than President Barack Obama. \n Trump hates the deal. But he contends that he can renegotiate its terms. \n Both are prepared to use force to prevent Tehran from acquiring the bomb. If the deal collapses or expires without sufficient safeguards, that possibility is back in play. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n IRS \n The Internal Revenue Service touches everyone, not just taxpayers but anyone who receives a government check, drives on roads made possible by tax revenue or sends a child to a school helped by Washington. It's a touch that can come with a heavy hand, in the eyes of critics who believe the agency's far-reaching powers are abused and need to be tamed. \n Trump's most explicit views about the agency have been on the personal level \u2014 he says he's been under a continuing multi-year IRS audit and that's why he won't release his tax returns, as other presidential candidates do. He's also boasted that his use of business losses to zero out his tax liability shows he's smart. Trump's tax plan reduces the number of tax brackets but does not envisage dismantling the IRS, as its fiercest critics want. \n Clinton has said little about the powers of the IRS except to suggest Trump would use them to go after his opponents. She's sure to fight attempts by congressional Republicans to cut the agency's budget. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ISLAMIC STATE \n The Islamic State group seized swaths of land in Iraq and expanded its territory in Syria in a dramatic blitz in 2014. The militant group slaughtered civilians in its march to try to establish a radical caliphate, and has spawned a string of deadly attacks across Europe, the Middle East and the United States. \n Now, as the militants suffer setbacks in Iraq and Syria, they are becoming more intent on inspiring lone-wolf attacks, already seen in the U.S. and Europe. \n The group has either claimed responsibility or been linked as a possible inspiration for the November attacks in Paris; the mass shootings in San Bernardino, California; the subway and airport bombings in Brussels; the Orlando nightclub shootings; and the Bastille Day truck attack in Nice, France. \n Clinton's plan to deal with the IS threat abroad and at home mostly embraces what President Barack Obama is doing. Trump has vowed relentless bombing and expressed support for enhanced interrogation techniques. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ISRAEL \n Support for Israel has been a mainstay of American foreign policy since the Jewish state's creation in 1948. Despite occasionally strong and even pointed differences, successive U.S. administrations of both parties have steadily increased financial, military and diplomatic assistance to Israel over the past six decades. \n The U.S. now provides Israel with roughly $3 billion every year, making it the largest single recipient of American foreign aid, and the Obama administration boosted that amount to $3.8 billion with a new memorandum of understanding on defense. \n Debate over Washington's pro-Israel position has intensified in recent years \u2014 notably over the Iran nuclear deal that Israel opposes, failed efforts to forge an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal and Israel's continued construction in territory claimed by the Palestinians. But the Democratic and Republican parties and their presidential candidates have never wavered from that stance and strong congressional backing for Israel makes any significant change in policy unlikely. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n JOBS \n Tepid income growth and a smaller share of the population at work have kept many Americans anxious about jobs and the economy, seven years after the Great Recession ended. \n And most jobs that pay decent wages require more education than in the past, leaving many workers feeling left behind. \n Trump says he would cut regulations and taxes to spur more hiring, and renegotiate or withdraw from trade agreements to bring jobs back to the U.S. \n Clinton says she would spend more on roads, tunnels, and other infrastructure and make state colleges and universities tuition free to most students. \n Even though hiring has been healthy for the past six years, incomes have lagged. A typical household didn't see its income recover to pre-recession levels until just this past July. And the proportion of Americans working or looking for work remains below pre-recession levels, as some of the unemployed have given up searching for jobs. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n LGBT \n Same-sex marriage is now the law of the land, but there are other battlegrounds related to civil rights and nondiscrimination protections for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people. Two polarizing questions: What sort of access should transgender people have to public bathrooms? And are the advances for LGBT rights infringing on the religious freedom of some Americans? \n Whoever wins the presidency will be somewhat limited in his or her ability to influence national LGBT-rights policies. A pending LGBT-inclusive nondiscrimination bill is unlikely to advance through a Republican-controlled House. And the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage is unlikely to be threatened. \n However, the election outcome could determine how aggressively federal agencies work to expand LGBT rights. Clinton would probably press efforts to bolster transgender rights. \n Thus far, federal judges have generally been unsympathetic to arguments that certain types of anti-LGBT discrimination are permissible if in accordance with a person's religious beliefs. Trump has told conservatives he'd place a high priority on religious liberty. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n MINIMUM WAGE \n Modest income gains, strikes by fast-food workers, the rapid growth of low-paying jobs while middle-income work shrinks. These factors have combined to make the minimum wage a top economic issue for the 2016 campaign. \n Millions would benefit from higher pay, of course. But an increase in the minimum wage would also boost costs for employers and may slow hiring. \n Clinton supports raising the minimum wage at least to $12 an hour, even higher at state and local levels. Trump has said he supports an increase to $10, but thinks states should \"really call the shots.\" It's $7.25 now. \n Why the momentum for higher minimums? The typical household's income has fallen 2.4 percent since 1999. Low-paying industries, such as retail, fast food and home health care aides, are among the largest and fastest-growing. And many low-wage workers are older, have families and are probably more willing to demand higher pay. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n MONEY IN POLITICS \n Voters are disgusted with the way political races are paid for \u2014 disproportionately by big-money donors, including those who stand to gain or lose from government decisions. The rules even allow donors to hide their identities by giving to politically active nonprofit groups that don't file detailed public paperwork about their finances. \n The system leaves everyday Americans fearing that their voices are being drowned out by these moneyed interests. \n So far, donors have pumped more than $1.7 billion into the presidential race, according to an Associated Press tally. \n Both presidential candidates talk a good game when it comes to money in politics, but both fail to back their words with action. \n Clinton and Trump denounce big money in politics, but they are both largely funded with big money. Trump also has no proposals addressing campaign finance, while Clinton's are vague and difficult to execute. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n NORTH KOREA \n Pariah state North Korea could soon be capable of targeting America with nuclear weapons. What can the U.S. do to stop it? \n Diplomacy and economic sanctions have not worked so far. North Korea's isolation is deepening, but it has continued to conduct nuclear test explosions and make advances in its missile technology. \n Trump says the U.S. can put more pressure on China to rein in its North Korean ally. He says he is willing to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. \n Clinton wants the world to intensify sanctions as the Obama administration did with Iran, a course that eventually opened the way for a deal to contain its nuclear program. \n But it will be tough to force North Korea back to negotiations that aim at its disarmament in exchange for aid. Kim views atomic weapons as a security guarantee for his oppressive regime. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n OPIOID EPIDEMIC \n More than 28,000 Americans died from overdosing on opioids in 2014, a record high for the nation. \n That's 78 people per day, a number that doesn't include the millions of family members, first responders and even taxpayers who feel the ripple of drug addiction in their daily lives. \n A rise in prescription painkillers is partially to blame: The sale of these drugs has quadrupled since 1999, and so has the number of Americans dying from an addiction to them. When prescriptions run out, people find themselves turning to the cheaper alternative heroin and, increasingly, the even more deadly drug fentanyl. \n Recovering addicts and their family members are increasingly speaking out, putting a face on drug addiction and lessening the stigma surrounding it. But dollars for prevention, treatment and recovery services are still hard to come by, leaving many people waiting weeks or months to find the treatment they're seeking. Meantime, family members empty bank accounts in search of help, while law enforcement officers and emergency rooms serve as a first line of defense. \n Trump says the wall he wants to build along the southern border is essential to stopping the flow of illegal drugs into the country. Clinton pledges to spend $10 billion to increase access to prevention, treatment and recovery services, among other things. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n RACE and POLICING \n The continued deaths of unarmed African-Americans at the hands of police are turning into one of the most consequential civil rights issues of the new millennium. Since the death in 2014 of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the sharing of video-recorded deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement has sparked unrest in many cities around the country, and prompted calls for additional training and more monitoring of police forces. \n Clinton has offered specific proposals, including legislation that would help end racial profiling, providing federal matching funds for more police body cameras and overhauling mandatory minimum sentencing. \n Trump has described himself as the \"law and order\" candidate, and has not specifically addressed plans on race and policing. He endorsed a former New York City police policy called \"stop and frisk\" after unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, over the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n REFUGEES \n With millions of Syrians displaced by a years-long war and hundreds of thousands of people fleeing to Europe, countries around the world are being pressed to help resettle people seeking refuge. \n The United States pledged to accept 10,000 such refugees by the end of the budget year in September and did so, a month early. \n Republicans have balked at the idea of allowing people from Syria into the United States and Trump has called for a halt on refugee resettlement for them. He says vetting of these refugees is inadequate. \n Clinton has pledged to expand the Syrian refugee program and allow as many as 65,000 such refugees into the United States. \n The fate of the program almost certainly hinges on the outcome of the November election. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ROLE OF GOVERNMENT \n It's the Goldilocks conundrum of American politics: Is the government too big, too small or just right? Every four years, the presidential election offers a referendum on whether Washington should do more or less. \n Trump favors cutting regulation and has promised massive tax cuts, but his plans are expected to add trillions to the national debt. Unlike most conservatives, he supports eminent domain and has spoken positively about government-run health care. And don't forget that massive border wall. Clinton has vowed new spending on education and infrastructure that could grow government, too. She strongly supports \"Obamacare,\" which most small-government proponents see as overreach. \n At its heart, the debate about government's reach pits the desire to know your basic needs will be cared for against the desire to be left alone. For the last few decades, polls have found Americans generally feel frustrated by the federal government and think it's wasteful. A smaller government sounds good to a lot of people until they're asked what specific services or benefits they are willing to do without. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n RUSSIA \n Russia is reasserting itself, posing vexing questions for the U.S. and presidential candidates split on Vladimir Putin. It's also apparently poking its nose into the election \u2014 blamed by the U.S. for hacking Democratic Party emails. \n After briefly looking inward during much of President Barack Obama's first term, Russia has returned to the international stage with force under Putin. Russia is militarily involved in Syria and supports separatists in eastern Ukraine and areas of Georgia. \n At the same time, the U.S. has been forced to accept that working with Russia is probably the only way to achieve results on many complicated international issues. Thus, Russia was central in the Iran nuclear negotiations and is a player as well as negotiator in the Syria truce effort. \n Trump advocates improved relations with Russia and has been strikingly complimentary of Putin's authoritarian leadership style. \n Clinton has had direct negotiating experience with Putin and his aides and that has left her wary of cooperating with Moscow. She promises to stand up to Putin and deter Russian aggression in Europe. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n SOCIAL SECURITY \n Big changes are coming to Social Security, sooner or later. \n If left to later, those changes promise to be wrenching. \n The trustees who oversee the program say it has enough money to pay full benefits until 2034. But at that point, Social Security will collect only enough taxes to pay 79 percent of benefits. Unless Congress acts, millions of people on fixed incomes would get an automatic 21 percent cut in benefits. \n Social Security's financial problems might seem far off. But the longer Congress waits to act, the harder it will be to save Social Security without dramatic tax increases, big benefit cuts or some combination. \n Clinton has proposed expanding Social Security benefits for widows and family caregivers. She says she would preserve Social Security by requiring \"the wealthiest\" to pay Social Security taxes on more of their income. Trump has promised not to cut Social Security. He's suggested he'd revisit the program after his tax-cut plan boosts economic growth. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n STUDENT DEBT \n More Americans are getting buried by student debt \u2014 causing delays in home ownership, limiting how much people can save and leaving taxpayers at risk as many loans go unpaid. \n Student debt now totals around $1.26 trillion. This amounts to a stunning 350 percent increase since 2005, according to the New York Federal Reserve. \n More than 60 percent of the class of 2014 graduated with debt that averaged nearly $27,000, according to the College Board. Not all that taxpayer-backed debt is getting repaid. Out of the 43 million Americans with student debt, roughly 16 percent are in long-term default \u2014 a potential hit in excess of $100 billion that taxpayers would absorb. \n Clinton proposes no tuition for students from families making less than $85,000 who go to an in-state, public college. That threshold would rise to $125,000 by 2021. Trump promises to cap payments at 12.5 percent of a borrower's income, with loan forgiveness if they make payments for 15 years. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n SUPREME COURT \n The ideological direction of the Supreme Court is going to tip one way or the other after the election. The outcome could sway decisions on issues that profoundly affect everyday Americans: immigration, gun control, climate change and more. \n The court has been operating with eight justices since Antonin Scalia died in February. His successor appears unlikely to be confirmed until after the election, at the earliest. The court is split between four Democratic-appointed, liberal justices and four conservatives who were appointed by Republicans \u2014 although Justice Anthony Kennedy has sided with the liberals on abortion, same-sex marriage and affirmative action in the past two years. \n The ninth justice will push the court left or right, depending on whether Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump becomes president. President Barack Obama has nominated Merrick Garland to take Scalia's seat, but the Republican Senate has refused to consider Garland's nomination, in an effort to prevent a liberal court majority. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n TAXES \n Presidents like to try reshaping the tax code to make substantive changes in fiscal policy and to show voters their priorities. \n Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have made clear that that's just what they want to do. There's an enormous difference between their approaches and goals. \n Trump, the Republican, is intent on cutting taxes. He'd collapse the current seven income tax brackets, which peak at 39.6 percent, into just three tiers with a top rate of 33 percent, slice the corporate income tax and eliminate the estate tax. Analysts say the wealthy would benefit disproportionately. \n Clinton, the Democrat, is proposing tax increases on the rich, including a minimum 30 percent tax on incomes over $1 million and higher taxes on big inheritances. Most taxpayers would see little or no impact on their tax bill, but the government might look different. She'd use the added revenue to expand domestic programs. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n TRADE \n In this angry election year, many American voters are skeptical about free trade \u2014 or hostile to it. \n The backlash threatens a pillar of U.S. policy: The United States has long sought global trade. \n Economists say imports cut prices for consumers and make the U.S. more efficient. \n But unease has simmered, especially as American workers faced competition from low-wage Chinese labor. Last year, the U.S. ran a $334 billion trade deficit with China \u2014 $500 billion with the entire world. \n The Democratic and Republican presidential candidates are both playing to public suspicions about trade deals. Hillary Clinton broke with President Barrack Obama by opposing an Asia-Pacific trade agreement that she had supported as secretary of state. \n Donald Trump vows to tear up existing trade deals and to slap huge tariffs on Chinese imports. \n But trade deals have far less impact on jobs than forces such as automation and wage differences between countries. Trump's plans to impose tariffs could start a trade war and raise prices. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n VETERANS \n Clinton has pledged to ensure veterans have access to timely and high-quality health care and vows to block efforts to privatize the Veterans Health Administration, the VA's health-care arm. Clinton also wants to bolster veterans' benefits, including education and housing aid included in the GI bill. She would ensure that military sexual trauma is acknowledged as a disability under VA rules. \n Trump says he will expand programs that allow veterans to choose their doctor \u2014 regardless of whether they're affiliated with the VA \u2014 and still receive government-paid medical care. Trump says that's not privatized care but, he told The Associated Press, \"a way of not allowing people to die waiting for doctors.\" \n Trump also pledged to fire or discipline VA employees who fail veterans or breach the public trust. He also would increase mental health professionals and create a \"White House hotline\" dedicated to veterans. If a valid complaint is not addressed, \"I will pick up the phone and fix it myself if I have to,\" Trump said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n VOTING RIGHTS \n Voting rights in America are in flux. Republican-controlled legislatures are tightening voter laws, placing limits on early voting and same-day registration, and imposing new requirements for IDs at polling places. In 2013, the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. That provision had required states with a history of racial discrimination to get federal preclearance to change election laws. \n The issue has become highly partisan with the rapid growth of minority populations, which in recent presidential elections have tilted heavily Democratic. And it has become overlaid with Trump's statements that the election is rigged against him and that he might not accept defeat at the polls. \n The Obama Justice Department has challenged voter ID and other laws, saying they could restrict access for minorities and young people. Federal court rulings softened some of the toughest restrictions, but litigation remains knotted up with Supreme Court appeals underway. Bills in Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act are stalled. \n Trump opposes same-day voter registration. Clinton wants Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act and seeks a national standard of at least 20 days of early in-person voting. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n WALL STREET REGULATION \n The debate over rules governing banks and the markets comes down to this: how to prevent another economic catastrophe like the Great Recession ignited by the financial crisis in 2008. The worst upheaval since the 1930s Depression wiped out $11 trillion in U.S. household wealth and about 8 million jobs. More than 5 million families lost their homes to foreclosure. \n The economic recovery over eight years has been halting and slow. \n The goal behind the most radical overhaul of financial rules since the 1930s was to rein in high-risk practices on Wall Street and prevent another multibillion-dollar taxpayer bailout of banks. In the package of rules Congress enacted in 2010, regulators gained new tools to shut banks without resorting to bailouts. Risky lending was restricted and a new federal agency was charged with protecting consumers from deceptive marketing of financial products. \n Republicans and many in the business community say the restrictions have raised costs for banks, especially smaller ones. They want the overhaul law repealed. Trump calls it a \"disaster,\" saying he would dismantle most of it. \n Clinton says the financial rules should be preserved and strengthened. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers contributing to this report: Marcy Gordon, Julie Bykowicz, David Crary, Eric Tucker, Deb Riechmann, Matthew Daly, Jesse J.

{"date": "October 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n An AT&T building is seen in San Antonio, Tuesday, Jan. 23, 2007. \n NEW YORK >> Grab some popcorn \u2014 AT&T wants to take you to the movies. \n AT&T is buying Time Warner, the owner of the Warner Bros. movie studio as well as HBO and CNN, for $85.4 billion in a deal that could shake up the media landscape. \n The acquisition would combine a telecom giant that owns a leading cellphone business, DirecTV and internet service with the company behind some of the world's most popular entertainment, including \"Game of Thrones,\" the Harry Potter franchise and professional basketball. It would be the latest tie-up between the owners of digital distribution networks \u2014 think cable and phone companies \u2014 and entertainment and news providers, all aimed at shoring up businesses upended by the internet. \n The deal would make Time Warner the target of the two largest media-company acquisitions on record, according to Dealogic. The highest was AOL's disastrous $94 billion acquisition of Time Warner at the end of the dot-com boom. \n Regulators would have to sign off on the deal, no certain thing. The prospect of another media giant on the horizon has already drawn fire on the campaign trail. Speaking in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump vowed to kill it if elected because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \n In Washington, Sen. Al Franken said the deal \"raises some immediate flags about consolidation in the media market\" and said he would press for more information on how the deal will affect consumers. \n Shares of AT&T, as is typical of acquirers in large deals, fell on reports of a deal in the works on Friday, ending the day down 3 percent. \n MEDIA MERGER MANIA \n Companies that provide phone and internet connections are investing in media to find new revenue sources and ensure they don't get relegated to being just \"dumb pipes.\" Verizon bought AOL last year and has now proposed a deal for Yahoo to build a digital-ad business. Comcast bought NBCUniversal in 2011. \n AT&T has been active, too. \n After its attempt to buy wireless competitor T-Mobile was scrapped in 2011 following opposition from regulators, the company doubled down on television by purchasing satellite-TV company DirecTV for $48.5 billion. AT&T is expected to offer a streaming TV package, DirecTV Now, by the end of the year, aimed at people who have dropped their cable subscriptions or never had one. \n The pressure on AT&T has been intense. \n The venerable phone company, whose roots trace back to Alexander Graham Bell, has to contend with slowing growth in wireless services, given that most Americans already have smartphones. And it faces new competitors for that business from cable companies. Comcast plans to launch a cellphone service for its customers next year. \n Buying Time Warner may be \"a good defensive move\" against Comcast as the cable giant continues stretching into new businesses, New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin said in a Friday note. Comcast also bought movie studio DreamWorks Animation in August. \n POTENTIAL DOWNSIDES \n Even if the AT&T deal overcame opposition in Washington, though, it's possible that regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal no longer makes sense. \n \"It's not hard to imagine what you can do on paper. They would keep HBO exclusive for only DirecTV subscribers, or only make TNT or TBS available over AT&T Wireless,\" said analyst Craig Moffett of research firm MoffettNathanson, referring to Time Warner networks. \"But as a practical matter, those kinds of strategies are expressly prohibited by the FCC and antitrust law.\" \n Then there is the $85 billion that AT&T is handing over to Time Warner, almost 40 percent more than investors thought the company was worth a week ago. \n \"Count me as a skeptic that there is real value to be created,\" Moffett said. \n Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie Capital, recalled many celebrated media deals of the past have turned into duds, mentioning the Time Warner-AOL deal in particular. \"If you look at history, it's still an unproven\" that big deals make sense, she said. AT&T, she noted, was paying \"a huge price.\" \n Still, Yong said that AT&T and other phone companies feel they have to act because the threats to their business seem to be coming from every direction. \"At the end of the day, these companies are trying to compete with Google and Facebook and Amazon, not just traditional competitors,\" she said. \"You see Google pivoting into wireless.\" \n John Bergmayer of the public-interest group Public Knowledge, which often criticizes media consolidation, warned of harm to consumers from the AT&T deal. He said, for example, AT&T might let wireless customers watch TV and movies from Time Warner without using their data, which would make video from other providers less attractive. \n MARKET SPILLOVER \n The prospect of more media acquisitions sent several stocks soaring Friday. Netflix and Discovery Communications each jumped more than 3 percent. \n Time Warner rose nearly 8 percent on Friday, and is now up 38 percent since the start of the year. \n The company has moved aggressively to counter the threat that sliding cable subscriptions poses to its business. Among other things, it launched a streaming version of HBO for cord-cutters and, alongside an investment in internet TV provider Hulu, added its networks to Hulu's live-TV service that's expected next year. \n In Time Warner's last blockbuster deal, when AOL bought it 15 years ago, the $94 billion offered came entirely in the form of AOL stock, which then proceeded to crash. This time, Time Warner is playing it safer. It's getting half of the deal in Time Warner stock, and half in cash. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "AT&T buying HBO and CNN owner Time Warner for $85.4 billion"}

{"date": "October 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., speaks to The Associated Press during an interview in Boston, Saturday, Oct. 22, 2016. \n BOSTON >> Tim Kaine is sounding a hopeful note that a Democratic White House could work with Republicans to bridge deep divides laid bare by this bitter presidential campaign. \n The vice presidential candidate told The Associated Press on Saturday that he and Hillary Clinton have already spoken about how to heal the nation if they should win. He said tackling economic anxieties, finding common policy ground with the GOP and perhaps bringing Republicans into the administration would be elements of unity, though he added that he and Clinton did not discuss Cabinet positions. \n \"We have not run this campaign as a campaign against the GOP with the big broad brush \u2014 we've run it against Donald Trump,\" Kaine said. He predicted: \"We're going to get a lot of Republican votes and that will also be part of, right out of the gate, the way to bring folks back together.\" \n Clinton's campaign has been preparing for the possibility that Trump won't concede the election if he loses, based on his assertions that the contest is rigged. Kaine said he hasn't talked with Clinton about that scenario. \n A self-described underdog, Kaine said he only recently began acknowledging the real possibility of victory. He's hired Wayne Turnage, a former chief of staff, as his transition director and is considering issues he'd pursue as vice president. \n \"It's probably only been in the last couple of weeks that I've started to think about, OK, the prospect of winning is such that we better start doing some thinking about practicalities,\" Kaine said. \n As vice president, Kaine said he would hope to be central in forging relationships between the administration and mayors and governors. Kaine served as the mayor of Richmond and governor of Virginia before winning his Senate seat in 2012. He also wants to help shape U.S. policy in Latin and South America, due to his fluency in Spanish and experience as a missionary in Honduras. \n Kaine still remains somewhat of an outsider in Clinton's world. She has developed trusted relationships with several aides over decades and Kaine is a new addition to the mix. \n He's at times been out of the loop on major developments, such as not knowing about Clinton's pneumonia diagnosis in September until days later. The two campaign together infrequently, but communicate by text message, email and phone. Sometimes they talk every few days, but it could be as infrequent as once a week, Kaine said. \n Their scheduled joint appearance in Pennsylvania on Saturday was their first event together since Labor Day. \n But Kaine said he's not worried about lacking a voice in a Clinton administration and expects to be a principal adviser to her on the most difficult issues if she wins. He said he thinks Clinton picked him over longtime confidants specifically because he was not a member of the inner circle from way back. \n \"I'm not worried about, you know, getting my two cents in,\" he said. \n Kaine said his experience as Virginia's lieutenant governor and as Democratic National Committee chairman during President Barack Obama's first term has showed him how to be a strong adviser and asset for Clinton. \n Kaine might be well-positioned to work with Republicans, having won three statewide races \u2014 lieutenant governor, governor and senator \u2014 in historically Republican Virginia, although the state has started going Democratic in presidential contests. Now in his fourth year as a senator, he said he's already talking with Republicans about working together after the election. \n Clinton is stepping up efforts to help Democrats recapture Senate control but Kaine didn't make a specific pitch for a Democratic Senate. He said he's more focused on finding policies Republicans and Democrats can agree on. \n \"I have very good relations with Republicans in the Senate,\" Kaine said. \"There's some people who really want to get some good work done.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Kaine sees working with GOP as key to post-election healing"}

{"date": "October 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally, Friday, Oct. 21, 2016, in Newtown, Pa. \n GETTYSBURG, Pa. >> Steering his campaign toward controversy yet again, Donald Trump vowed Saturday to sue every woman who has accused him of sexual assault or other inappropriate behavior. He called them \"liars\" whose allegations he blamed Democrats for orchestrating. \n Trump's blunt threat of legal action eclipsed his planned focus on serious-minded policy during a speech in Gettysburg. Though his campaign had billed the speech as a chance for Trump to lay out a to-do list for his first 100 days as president, he seemed unable to restrain himself from re-litigating grievances with Hillary Clinton, the media and especially the women who have come forward in recent days. \n \"All of these liars will be sued once the election is over,\" Trump said. He added later: \"I look so forward to doing that.\" \n Nearly a dozen women have publicly accused Trump of unwanted advances or sexual assault in the weeks since a 2005 recording emerged in which the former reality TV star boasted of kissing women and groping their genitals without their consent. The latest came on Saturday, when an adult film actress said the billionaire kissed her and two other women on the lips \"without asking for permission\" when they met him after a golf tournament in 2006. \n Trump has denied all the allegations, while insisting some of the women weren't attractive enough for him to want to pursue. \n \"Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,\" he said. Without offering evidence, he surmised that Clinton or the Democratic National Committee had put the women up to it. \n Clinton's campaign said Trump's threat of litigation was a troubling insight into a potential Trump presidency. \n Trump's broadside against the women came at the start of an otherwise substantive speech that sought to weave the many policy ideas he has put forward into a single, cohesive agenda that he said he would pursue aggressively during his first three months in office. \n The Republican nominee vowed to lift restrictions on domestic energy production, label China as a currency manipulator and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, familiar themes to supporters who have flocked to his rallies this year. \n \"This is my pledge to you, and if we follow these steps, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people,\" Trump said, invoking a phrase from President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. \n Though mostly a recap of policies he's proposed before, Trump's speech included a few new elements, such as a freeze on hiring new federal workers and a two-year mandatory minimum sentence for immigrants who re-enter the U.S. illegally after being deported a first time. In a pledge sure to raise eyebrows on Wall Street, he said he'd block a potential merger between AT&T and media conglomerate Time Warner. \n Translating his proposals into digestible bullet points, he offered to-the-point titles for the legislative vehicles he'd need Congress to approve to accomplish his goals, such as the \"End Illegal Immigration Act\" and the \"Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act.\" \n Throughout the GOP primary, Trump was criticized for shying away from detailed policy proposals. But his speech, which aides said would form the core of his closing argument to voters, underscored how the billionaire has gradually compiled a broad \u2014 if sometimes vague \u2014 policy portfolio that straddles conservative, isolationist and populist orthodoxies. \n Yet any headway that Trump may have made was likely to be diluted by his legal threats against his accusers, just the latest example of Trump stepping on his intended message at inopportune moments. Days earlier, during the final debate, his otherwise well-received performance was marred by an alarming statement near the end that he might not accept the outcome of the election if he loses. \n Trump didn't say what kind of lawsuits he planned to file against the women, but any libel litigation could be complicated by the fact that Trump, in the 2005 recording, bragged about the same kind of conduct the women now accuse him of perpetrating. Trump recently vowed to sue The New York Times for libel, but has not yet followed through on the threat. \n With the debates now over, Trump and Clinton have few apparent opportunities to alter the course the race substantially \u2014 a reality that benefits Clinton more than Trump. The Republican is trailing his opponent in most of the battleground states while Clinton eyes potential upset victories in traditionally safe GOP territory, with Arizona at the top of the list. \n An increasingly confident Clinton on Saturday made what's become her closing pitch in Pittsburgh, stressing unity and asking her backers to carry her message to any Trump supporters they meet. \n \"I understand that they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them and I want to be their president,\" she said. \n As Election Day nears, Clinton is also focusing on getting Democrats elected to Congress. She attacked the state's Republican senator, Pat Toomey, saying he has refused to \"stand up\" to Trump as she touted his Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty. \n Her campaign headquarters in New York was back up and running after a scare over an envelope that arrived containing a white powdery substance. Initial tests showed the substance wasn't harmful. \n Meanwhile, Clinton was getting a campaign boost Saturday from singer and pop icon Katy Perry, who was pushing early voting in Las Vegas. \n More than 4.4 million votes have already been cast.

U.S. military officials say that a fire at the sulfur plant in northern Iraq is creating a potential breathing hazard for American forces and other troops at a logistical base south of Mosul. \n BARTELLA, Iraq >> The Iraqi army pushed into a town near the Islamic State-held city of Mosul on Saturday, a day after dozens of IS militants stormed into the northern city of Kirkuk, setting off two days of clashes and killing at least 80 people, mostly security forces. \n U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter meanwhile met with Iraqi commanders in Baghdad to discuss the offensive to retake Mosul, which the U.S. is supporting with airstrikes and advisers on the ground. \n The Iraqi army said the 9th Division has pushed into the town of Hamdaniyah, also known as Qaraqosh and Bakhdida, and raised the flag over its government compound, but the troops were likely still facing resistance in and around the town. Similar past announcements have often proved premature. \n The town is around 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Mosul. Iraqi forces launched a wide-scale offensive earlier this week aimed at retaking Mosul, the country's second largest city, which fell to IS in 2014. \n Hamdaniyah is believed to be largely uninhabited. IS has heavily mined the approaches to Mosul, and Iraqi forces have had to contend with roadside bombs, snipers and suicide truck bombs as they move closer to the city. \n IS said it foiled an attack on Hamdaniyah and seized vehicles and weapons left by retreating Shiite militiamen. The claim, carried by the extremist group's Aamaq news agency, could not be confirmed. \n An Iraqi television station says one of its reporters was shot dead near Mosul, the second journalist in as many days to be killed while covering the conflict. \n Alsumaria TV says cameraman Ali Risan was shot in the chest by a sniper Saturday during a battle in the al-Shura area. Journalist Ahmet Haceroglu of Turkmeneli TV was shot dead by a militant sniper Friday, while covering the IS assault on Kirkuk. \n Iraqi forces retook the town of Bartella, around 15 kilometers (nine miles) east of Mosul, earlier this week, but are still facing pockets of resistance in the area. \n Inside Bartella, a road extending more than 100 meters (yards) was completely demolished, with all the homes on either side reduced to rubble. IS graffiti was scrawled across the walls, and the militants appeared to have renamed streets and neighborhoods after famous fighters during the more than two years they controlled the area. \n In Kirkuk, meanwhile, some fighting continued a day after the IS assault on the city, some 170 kilometers (100 miles) southeast of Mosul. The wave of attacks in and around Kirkuk appeared to be an attempt to divert attention from Mosul. \n The area around the provincial headquarters, where the fighting was heaviest on Friday, was quiet. But witnesses and police reported fighting in other parts of the city. \n Brig. Gen. Khattab Omer of the Kirkuk police said at least 80 people were killed in the assault, mainly Kurdish security forces. Another 170 were wounded, he said, adding that a sundown curfew has been imposed on the city. \n Omer said Kurdish security forces recovered the bodies of 56 militants who took part in the attack. The Kurds assumed control of Mosul in 2014, when the Iraqi army and police crumbled in the face of a lightning IS advance across northern Iraq. \n Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the Kirkuk assault was a terrorist attack and not a military breach. \n \"Nearly all the terrorists who entered Kirkuk have been eliminated, and we have full control, except for maybe one area where they are being flushed out,\" he said after meeting with Carter. \n Iraq launched a long-awaited operation on Monday aimed at retaking Mosul, its second largest city, which fell to IS in 2014. It is the largest operation undertaken by Iraqi forces since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and is expected to take weeks, if not months. \n Carter's visit comes two days after a U.S. service member was killed outside Mosul, underscoring the risk that American troops are taking as they advise Iraqi forces in the fight. \n More than 4,800 U.S. troops are in Iraq and there are more than 100 U.S. special operations forces operating with Iraqi units. Hundreds more American troops are playing a support role in staging bases farther from the front lines. \n Elsewhere in Iraq, a burning sulfur plant south of Mosul that was torched by the Islamic State group is releasing large amounts of noxious gas into the atmosphere, draping towns in the area in toxic smoke. \n The air has turned a greyish color as it mixes with smoke from earlier oil well fires set by the militants. The fumes make breathing difficult, with residents saying they are suffering from coughing, headaches and nosebleeds from as far as 30 kilometers (18 miles) away. \n \"The smoke is from sulfur that was lit by Daesh,\" said Alaa Abdullah Khaled, a resident in the nearby village of Awsaja, referring to IS by its Arabic acronym. \"It is causing suffocation among the children and it gives them nosebleeds.\" \n Two U.S. military officials said that while the fire was set two days ago in Mishraq, the winds shifted earlier Saturday, sending the smoke south toward Qayara West air field, a staging area for the Mosul offensive. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. \n They said troops at the base were wearing protective masks because of the breathing concerns, and estimated it could take two to three days to put the fire out. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Iraq pushes into town near Mosul after IS assault on Kirkuk"}

{"date": "October 22, 2016", "text": "NEW YORK >> Could millions of connected cameras, thermostats and kids' toys bring the internet to its knees? It's beginning to look that way. \n On Friday, epic cyberattacks crippled a major internet firm, repeatedly disrupting the availability of popular websites across the United States. The hacker group claiming responsibility says that the day's antics were just a dry run and that it has its sights set on a much bigger target. And the attackers now have a secret weapon in the increasing array of internet-enabled household devices they can subvert and use to wreak havoc. \n MEET THE FIRE HOSE \n Manchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks. These work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic \u2014 sort of like knocking someone over by blasting them with a fire hose. The attack temporarily blocked some access to popular websites from across America and Europe such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal. \n Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday affecting access to many sites from the East Coast. A second attack later in the day spread disruption to the West Coast as well as some users in Europe. \n Members of a shadowy hacker group that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter, though that claim could not be verified. They said they organized networks of connected devices to create a massive botnet that threw a monstrous 1.2 trillion bits of data every second at Dyn's servers. Dyn officials wouldn't confirm the figure during a conference call later Friday with reporters. \n MAKE THAT, MANY FIRE HOSES \n DDoS attacks have been growing in frequency and size in recent months. But if the hackers' claims are true, Friday's attacks take DDoS to a new level. According to a report from the cybersecurity firm Verisign, the largest DDoS attack perpetrated during that second quarter of this year peaked at just 256 billion bits per second. \n A huge September attack that shut down of security journalist Brian Krebs' website clocked in at 620 million bits per second. Research from the cybersecurity firm Flashpoint said Friday that the same kind of malware was used in the attacks against both Krebs and Dyn. \n Lance Cottrell, chief scientist for the cybersecurity firm Ntrepid, said while DDoS attacks have been used for years, they've become very popular in recent months, thanks to the proliferation of \"internet of things\" devices ranging from connected thermostats to security cameras and smart TVs. Many of those devices feature little in the way of security, making them easy targets for hackers. \n The power of this kind of cyberattack is limited by the number of devices an attacker can connect to. Just a few years ago, most attackers were limited to infecting and recruiting \"zombie\" home PCs. But the popularity of new internet-connected gadgets has vastly increased the pool of potential devices they can weaponize. The average North American home contains 13 internet-connected devices , according to the research firm IHS Markit. \n Since the attacks usually don't harm the consumer electronics companies that build the devices, or the consumers that unwittingly use them, companies have little incentive to boost security, Cottrell said. \n WHAT'S BEHIND THE ATTACKS \n Like with other online attacks, the motivation behind DDoS attacks is usually mischief or money. Attackers have shut down websites in the past to make political statements. DDoS attacks have also been used in extortion attempts, something that's been made easier by the advent of Bitcoin. \n For its part, a member of New World Hackers who identified themselves as \"Prophet\" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange that collective isn't motivated by money and doesn't have anything personal against Dyn, Twitter or any of the other sites affected by the attacks. Instead, the hacker said, the attacks were merely a test, and claimed that the next target will be the Russian government for committing alleged cyberattacks against the U.S. earlier this year. \n \"Twitter was kind of the main target. It showed people who doubted us what we were capable of doing, plus we got the chance to see our capability,\" said \"Prophet.\" The claims couldn't be verified. \n The collective has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's attacks. \n A SHIFTING GLOBAL ASSAULT \n Dyn said it first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. Services were restored about two hours later. But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and the latest wave of problems continued until Friday evening Eastern time. \n \"Prophet\" told the AP that his group actually had stopped its attacks by Friday afternoon, but that others, including members of the hacker collective known as Anonymous, had picked up where they left off. Anonymous didn't respond to a request for comment via Twitter. \n The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. \n Cottrell noted that there are several firms that offer protection against DDoS attacks, by giving companies a way to divert the bad traffic and remain online in case of an attack. But monthly subscription fees for these services are generally equal to a typical DDoS extortion payment, giving companies little incentive to pay for them. \n Meanwhile not much is required in the way of resources or skill to mount a botnet attack, he said, adding that would-be attackers can rent botnets for as little as $100. Cottrell said the long-term solution lies in improving the security of all internet-connected devices. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Attacks on the internet keep getting bigger and nastier"}

{"date": "October 22, 2016", "text": "SEATTLE >> Ariana Davis, who sponsored a measure on the fall ballot to raise Washington's minimum wage, doesn't expect a raise if it passes. She makes $20 an hour at a Safeway grocery store in Renton. \n Instead, Davis says she had some of her co-workers in mind \u2014 like Danielle Mendoza, a 25-year-old cashier who's trying to support three children while making 10 cents an hour more than the state's $9.47 minimum. \n \"I've worked at Safeway for 10 years now, my first and only job since I was 16,\" Davis says. \"There are many folks who are still making minimum wage.\" \n Mendoza is one of 730,000 workers in Washington who backers say would see their pay jump if voters approve Initiative 1433, which would raise the hourly minimum wage by roughly $4 over three years, to $13.50.The measure also would require employers to provide paid sick leave \u2014 at least one hour for every 40 worked \u2014 which could be used to care for family members or as \"safe leave\" for those who miss work because of domestic violence. \n That could have helped Mendoza when her 2-year-old daughter was hospitalized for a week with a stomach virus this summer, forcing her to miss work. Instead, she borrowed money from her father. \n \"I don't know how anybody is expected to live off $9.57 an hour,\" she said. \n With the federal minimum wage stuck at $7.25 and concern rising about income inequality, more than a dozen states have adopted measures recently to boost their wage floors, including California, where the rate will eventually hit $15, and Oregon, which is increasing pay at rates that vary by rural, \"standard\" or metro areas. SeaTac raised pay for transportation and hospitality workers to $15 in 2013, and Seattle is boosting its wage to $15. \n Opponents of I-1433 say they don't necessarily oppose raising the minimum wage. Some say they would support a more moderate increase, such as to $12, with certain conditions: that it's regionally tiered, includes a training wage for teens, and credits tips toward wages. I-1433 includes none of those provisions. \n Raising the minimum wage by nearly half could cost jobs and force businesses to close, they argue. Economically depressed parts of Washington couldn't bear it, they say, and Washington already has the nation's eighth-highest unemployment rate. \n Kelly Chambers runs a Visiting Angels franchise in Tacoma, providing in-home care to seniors who pay out of pocket. She says she surveyed her customers to ask what they'd do if she had to raise prices to cover higher worker costs under I-1433. About 90 percent said they'd cancel or reduce the care they receive, she said. \n The No on 1433 campaign includes the Association of Washington Business, the restaurant industry and the Washington Farm Bureau. It has spent just $50,000 to the $3.7 million by the yes campaign, which includes unions and the liberal Seattle venture capitalist Nick Hanauer. But the opponents have persuaded several newspaper editorial boards around the state to come out against it. \n Many economists say studies have found no correlation between minimum wage increases and job losses, but some believe the minimum wage should be set at about half of a region's median wage. \n But I-1433 would raise the minimum wage higher than that in most of the state, from 60 percent of the median in Kitsap County to 79 percent in Yakima County, according to a report by the Washington Research Council, which opposes the measure. \n \"When people get the facts in their hands, nobody can really get on board with anything above $12,\" said No on I-1433 spokeswoman Yvette Ollada. \n Supporters say giving low-wage workers hundreds in extra monthly pay will boost the state's economy. Jack Sorensen, a spokesman for the campaign, argues that the measure effectively is geographically tiered: Seattle has approved $15 an hour, and $13.50 is an appropriate floor for the rest of the state, he said. \n The Obama administration says it's counting on states to lead the way in improving worker pay. \n \"We have had a minimum wage in this country since 1937,\" Chris Lu, the deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor, said during a trip to Seattle last month to promote I-1433. \"Every time we raise the minimum wage, we have the same dispute, and this is still the most vibrant, dynamic economy in the world.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Gene Johnson at https://twitter.com/GeneAPseattle \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Minimum wage campaign: Is initiative best way to hike pay?"}

{"date": "October 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Charles Barkley calls it friendly fire, the criticism a rich black gets for talking about race from fellow blacks who believe he can't understand their struggles. But the basketball Hall of Famer and TNT analyst says he can handle it, and hopes he can create conversation that makes a difference beyond the things he's already doing when his show \"The Race Card\" debuts in 2017. \n NEW YORK >> Charles Barkley calls it friendly fire. \n When he talks about racial issues, it isn't only whites he risks angering. Some of the biggest complaints come from fellow blacks, who figure he's too rich, too successful to possibly understand their struggles. \n \"Like, those people say he's not black anymore, he shouldn't speak on black issues,\" Barkley said. \"I'm like, 'Dude, I'm always going to be black,' but that's a double-edged sword I'm willing to deal with.\" \n So not only will he keep talking, he wants to lead the conversation. \n The basketball Hall of Famer and TNT analyst will debut \"The Race Card\" on the network in 2017, a show that won't just be about black and white, because Barkley believes America's problems are more about rich versus poor. \n \"I just want to do a positive dialogue because I'm sick of arguing over race all the time,\" Barkley said. \"Like, I'm very aware that racism does exist, it always has and probably always will, but the media does a really poor job. There's more good than bad, but the bad pops off the newspaper and on television. And like I said, the truth is somewhere in the middle.\" \n On one hand, he seems an unlikely choice to be looking for it. In a Nike commercial during his playing career, he said himself he's no role model , and he still doesn't like the term now. And wearing a Ralph Lauren sweater and matching brown slacks during a lunch at a Manhattan restaurant Tuesday before slipping into a tuxedo for the induction of TNT's \"Inside the NBA\" studio show in the Broadcasting Hall of Fame, he does project the image of a comfortable life. \n But born in Alabama in 1963, the year Ku Klux Klan members killed four girls in a Birmingham church bombing, he sees the same struggles now as during his youth. Like many of today's athletes, he's discouraged by the killings of blacks by white police and the protests, sometimes violent, that have followed. \n Quarterback Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers has been kneeling in protest during the national anthem, and many NBA players have stood with arms locked during the preseason. Barkley respects their actions but would like to see more. \n \"It goes back to the Kaepernick thing,\" he said. \"I said, you do what you want to do, you're a grown man. But I challenge all these guys, what are you actually doing in the black community to help our people?\" \n For Barkley, that's included donating millions to his high school and colleges in Alabama. But he can't blame today's athletes who grapple with their involvement, a discussion he had with a professor for the show. \n \"He says, 'First of all, it's unfair for all you guys to have to solve the ills of all the black community. It's unfair, you guys aren't activists because you all haven't lived what those guys have been through,'\" Barkley said. \"And he says, 'I really think it's cool that you all are trying, but to try to compare today's black athletes to Jim Brown, Bill Russell, (Muhammed) Ali and those guys, we're doing them a disservice because those guys like lived.' \n \"They never told me I couldn't go to a restaurant or go to the same hotel,\" Barkley added. \"I ain't never been through anything like that.\" \n For the first episode of \"The Race Card,\" Barkley interviewed minorities about the way they are portrayed on television. He spent a day with Muslims, finding something in common. \n \"We started talking about, like every time I see a mass shooting, I'm saying to myself, 'Please don't be black.' And I said to them, every time you see a bomb, what are you thinking?\" And they're like, 'Please don't be a Muslim,'\" Barkley said. \n He spoke with four blacks, who gave very different accounts of their treatment by police. He met with Asians, telling them his perception of them from TV was that they're really smart and outperforming Americans. \n \"We're not that smart and we don't know karate,\" they replied. \n He interviewed entertainer Ice Cube, lamenting the criticism they get from African-Americans. \n \"And he says it's the stupidest thing he's ever heard. We're not supposed to be successful, and like wait, we're not black because we're successful?\" Barkley said. \"First of all, they should be patting us on the back because we made it, instead of saying, 'Well, they don't know what it's like to be black because they haven't been in the hood in so long.'\" \n But Barkley said he will handle it, because it's important to keep talking about social issues. He's warned his bosses at Turner never to prevent him from talking about what he wants, and while he once desired a chance to run an NBA team as a general manager, he realizes now that job would lessen his platform because it would require staying silent at times. \n Specifics about the show, including the debut date, are still being discussed, but Turner is eager to see which direction Barkley plans to take it. \n \"Charles will tell you himself: There has been no bigger problem in his life than racism. That is why we're doing this series with him. He wants to spark real dialogue and get everyone involved,\" said Michael Bloom, TNT/TBS senior vice president of unscripted series and specials. \n A political independent who said he's always voted Democrat but once weighed a run for Alabama governor as a Republican, he's disappointed in the presidential campaign and pondering not voting at all. He's also disgusted by TV coverage he said is often two panelists yelling at each other over the same soundbite. \n So he's hoping his show can be the one that deals with difficult topics in a proper manner. \n \"What I'm trying to do with the show is, all the racial BS is somewhere in the middle. It's not black and white \u2026 like everything is not all what it seems,\" Barkley said. \"I'm just trying to open up a positive dialogue. That's all I'm trying to do.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Charles Barkley has something to say about race in America"}
