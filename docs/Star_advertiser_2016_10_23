{"date": "October 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n On Saturday, Oct. 22, 2016, several reports citing unnamed sources said AT&T is in advanced talks to buy Time Warner, owner of the Warner Bros. movie studio as well as HBO and CNN. The giant phone company is said to be offering $80 billion or more, a massive deal that would shake up the media landscape. \n NEW YORK >> \n AT&T and Time Warner are playing up how their $85.4 billion merger will lead to innovative new experiences for customers. But analysts, public-interest groups and some politicians are far from convinced. \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said it should be killed. Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, said less concentration in media \"is generally helpful.\" And the Republican chairman and Democratic ranking member of the Senate's antitrust subcommittee said that the deal would \"potentially raise significant antitrust issues.\" \n The potential harm to consumers from this deal could be subtle \u2014 far more so than if AT&T were simply acquiring a direct competitor like a big wireless or home broadband company. Time Warner makes TV shows and movies; AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. But the concern is that anything AT&T might do to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films could hurt consumers overall. \n WALLING OFF TIME WARNER \n The company certainly wants to do that. \"With great content we believe you can build a truly differentiated service,\" said AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson. \"In particular, mobile.\" \n Here's how that would work. Because of Time Warner's world-famous shows and movies \u2014 \"Game of Thrones,\" the \"Harry Potter\" films, professional basketball \u2014 and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \n But many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \n Say AT&T reserved HBO for its customers only. That would cut HBO's reach and hurt its value. \n \"This creates massive strategic tensions that are almost impossible to resolve,\" wrote Jackdaw Research's Jan Dawson in a note. AT&T can either disadvantage Time Warner by restricting who can watch its stuff or limit benefits for its own customers so much that they barely rate attention, he suggested. \n FREE DATA FOR TIME WARNER \n There's another way AT&T could favor its own media offerings. The company currently lets many of its wireless customers stream from the DirecTV app on their phones without counting it against their data caps, a practice known as \"zero rating.\" AT&T has suggested it may also zero-rate its upcoming live-streaming DirecTV Now service, which doesn't require customers to install a dish on their homes. \n If AT&T did that with, say, HBO shows and TNT's basketball games, it could upset other video providers, who could reasonably worry that customers might shun their streaming services to avoid exceeding their monthly data limit and possibly suffering slower data speeds as a result. \n The companies also say that relying more on targeted ads could help lower the cost of making appealing shows and films. Even if that's the case, the savings might not get passed on to consumers. \n Rich Greenfield, a BTIG analyst, noted there's no evidence that Comcast's 2011 acquisition of NBC led to lower prices. In fact, prices have been increasing broadly, although Greenfield said there's no way to know whether the deal contributed to that trend. \n \"There may not be dramatic harm, but it's certainly hard to find clear benefit,\" Greenfield said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "A merged AT&T-Time Warner may not do consumers much good"}

{"date": "October 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This photo provided by KESQ NewsChannel 3/CBS Local 2 shows the scene of crash between a tour bus and a semi-truck on Interstate 10 near Desert Hot Springs, near Palm Springs, in California's Mojave Desert Sunday, Oct. 23, 2016. Multiple deaths and injuries were reported. \n PALM SPRINGS, Calif. >> A maintenance crew had slowed down traffic on a California highway through the night, and the work had gone on for hours without problems. Then a tour bus returning to Los Angeles from a casino trip slammed into the back of a semi-truck. Passengers who were asleep on the bus woke up to loud screams and the sound of crushing metal. \n The gambling jaunt ended in one of the deadliest wrecks in California history with 13 people killed and 31 others injured. \n Authorities said the bus was going much faster than the truck, causing it to plow about 15 feet into the truck on Interstate 10 just north of the desert resort town of Palm Springs. \n \"You can see it was a substantial impact,\" California Highway Patrol Border Division Chief Jim Abele said. \n It was not known if alcohol, drugs or fatigue played a role in the crash, but the bus was inspected in April and had no mechanical issues, Abele said. The bus driver was killed, and the truck driver received minor injuries. \n The bus was coming from Red Earth Casino in the desert town of Thermal and was about 35 miles into its 135-mile trip back to Los Angeles. \n CHP officers had been slowing traffic to allow utility workers to string wires across the freeway, Abele said. \n Passengers told officials that most people were asleep when the crash occurred shortly after 5 a.m. Abele said it appeared the 1996 bus didn't have seat belts and likely didn't have data recorder that would reveal how fast the bus was traveling and whether the driver braked before impact. \n \"I was awakened by the sounds of people screaming for help,\" passenger Ana Car, 61, told the Los Angeles Times. \"I noticed a heavyset woman lying in the center aisle to my right yelling, 'My legs! My legs!'\" \n Before April, the bus also was inspected in 2014 and 2015, the CHP said. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration records show it had no crashes in the past two years and had a satisfactory safety rating. \n The front of the bus crumpled into the semi-truck's trailer and debris was scattered across the key route through Southern California. Firefighters used ladders to climb into the bus' windows to remove bodies, and tow trucks lifted the trailer to make it easier to reach the bus, whose front end was demolished. \n Fourteen patients were sent to Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs, the area's only trauma center. Four remained in critical condition Sunday evening, two were transferred to other hospitals for continuing treatment and the rest were treated and released, hospital officials said. \n Many suffered facial injuries, a telltale sign they were not wearing seat belts, said Dr. Ricard Townsend, a trauma surgeon. \n \"It seemed as though most of the victims were unrestrained and were therefore flown through the air and ended up sustaining facial trauma,\" he said. \n Two other hospitals received patients with minor injuries. \n The tour bus company, USA Holiday, has one vehicle and one driver, according to federal regulators. A call to the company was not immediately returned. \n The company says on social media that it has more than 25 years of experience traveling to casinos in Southern California. It posts about quick turnaround trips leaving the Los Angeles area to casinos in the Southern California desert area and Las Vegas. \n The bus owner's neighbor said she'd often see a tour bus with the sign \"USA Holiday\" parked on the street in front of his apartment in a working-class neighborhood in Alhambra, about 7 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. \n Sonia Anderson said the family who lived there \u2014 a man, woman and their college student son \u2014 had lived in the apartment for about 17 years. She said the father generally drove the bus and his wife and son would sometimes travel on the bus with him. \n Anderson described them as a kind, close-knit family. \"All three of them are hard-working people. Good people. Beautiful family,\" she said. \n The father was \"always working, coming in and out, providing for his family,\" Anderson said. \n The National Transportation Safety Board is sending a team to California to investigate. \n The crash comes two years after a FedEx truck veered across an interstate median north of Sacramento and slammed into a bus full of high school students, killing 10 people. \n In 1963, 32 Mexican farm workers who were in the Central Valley as part of a work visa program were killed when a freight train struck the flatbed truck they were riding on. In 1976, a bus carrying the Yuba City high school choir plunged off a freeway ramp in Martinez, killing 28 students and one teacher. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "13 killed, 31 hurt in one of California's deadliest wrecks"}

Even longtime Republican strongholds such as Utah and Arizona suddenly appear within reach for Clinton on Nov. 8, enticing Democrats to campaign hard in territory they haven't won for decades. \n The shifting political map has freed up Clinton and her well-funded campaign to spend time and money helping other Democrats in competitive races. Clinton said she didn't \"even think about responding\" to Trump anymore and would instead spend the final weeks on the road \"emphasizing the importance of electing Democrats down the ballot.\" \n \"We're running a coordinated campaign, working hard with gubernatorial, Senate, and House candidates,\" said Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager. \n And for good reason. \n After a merciless two-year campaign, the next president will face the daunting task of governing a bitterly divided nation. If Clinton wins, her best prospect for achieving her goals will be greatly diminished unless her victory is accompanied by major Democratic gains in Congress. \n \"We've got to do the hard and maybe most important work of healing, healing our country,\" Clinton said Sunday at Union Baptist Church in Durham. \n For Democrats, there's another reason to try to run up the score. With Trump warning he may contest the race's outcome if he loses, Clinton's campaign is hoping for an overwhelming Democratic victory that would undermine any attempt by Trump to claim the election had been stolen from him. \n In a rare admission of fallibility by the typically boastful Trump, his campaign acknowledged he's trailing Clinton as Election Day nears. \n \"We are behind. She has some advantages,\" said Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. Still, she added, \"We're not giving up. We know we can win this.\" \n Conway laid out in granular detail Trump's potential path to winning: victories in Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, Nevada and Ohio, to start. If Trump prevents Arizona and Georgia from falling to Democrats and adds in some combination of Colorado, Virginia, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, he could reach the 270 electoral votes needed, Conway said. \n It won't be easy. A current Associated Press analysis of polling, demographic trends and other campaign data rates Virginia as solidly Democratic, while Colorado, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania are all leaning Democratic. Arizona, remarkably, is a toss-up. \n Trump was campaigning Sunday in Florida after spending the past few days in Pennsylvania and Ohio. \n If Clinton wins, Democrats would need a net gain of four Senate seats to retake the majority. House control would be much harder, considering Republicans currently enjoy their largest House majority since 1931. Democrats would need a 30-seat gain, a feat they haven't accomplished in roughly four decades. \n Clinton's nascent focus on helping fellow Democrats comes with an inherent contradiction. For months, she deliberately avoided the strategy employed by other Democrats of trying to saddle all Republicans with an unpopular Trump. In August, she said Trump represented the \"radical fringe,\" rather than the mainstream of the Republican Party. \n Painting Trump as beyond the typical GOP pale was a strategy intended to help Clinton win over voters who identify as Republicans but dislike Trump. Yet it's been a major sore point for Democratic campaign groups, illustrated by an internal Democratic National Committee email in May that was hacked and later disclosed by WikiLeaks. \n \"They don't want us to tie Trump to other Republicans because they think it makes him look normal,\" top DNC official Luis Miranda wrote in an email under the subject line \"Problem with HFA,\" an acronym for Hillary For America. \n Andrea Bozek of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP's campaign arm, said Clinton's last-minute push to aid Democrats was insufficient to make up for her party's shortfalls in recruiting competitive candidates this year. \n \"Democrats have relied on political gravity from the presidential race to carry them across the finish line,\" Bozek said. \n Indeed, as Clinton campaigned in North Carolina, where Democrats hope to unseat GOP Sen. Richard Burr, Clinton's argument appeared to rest on the hopes that voters offended by Trump would vote against Burr, too. She said Democratic candidate and American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Deborah Ross knows that Trump \"is wrong for America.\" \n \"Unlike her opponent, Debra has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump,\" Clinton said. \n Clinton isn't the only Democrat putting a premium on down-ballot races. \n President Barack Obama flew to Nevada on Sunday to campaign for the Democratic Senate candidate there before heading to San Diego to raise money for House Democrats. He and Vice President Joe Biden have recorded ads, raised money and campaigned in person for dozens of House, Senate and other Democratic candidates this year. \n For Trump, the campaign's finals weeks have been shadowed by concerns about his sexually predatory comments about women and mounting allegations of sexual assault. Trump used a weekend speech to announce he planned to sue all of the women, while one of his supporters, former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Trump supporter, lamented his \"oppression\" by the media. \n \"He's been waterboarded by these issues,\" Brewer said. \n Mook and Brewer spoke on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Conway spoke on \"Fox News Sunday\" and NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Looking past Trump, Clinton aims to help other Democrats"}

The European Union was scrambling Friday to salvage a massive free trade deal with Canada that was being held up by a small region in Belgium. \n BRUSSELS >> If Belgium cannot break a deadlock over the European Union's landmark free deal with Canada by Monday night, EU leaders will consider canceling a signing ceremony scheduled for later in the week, two officials with knowledge of the negotiations said. \n The officials told The Associated Press on Sunday that EU leaders plan to have telephone talks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about canceling the Thursday summit if Belgium's support for the deal isn't secured by the deadline. \n The officials asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the talks. \n The deal needs unanimity among the 28 EU nations, and Belgium needs unanimity among its regions. The francophone region of Wallonia, population 3.5 million, has been the lone holdout and refused to approve the trade pact. \n During the past week, Belgium missed two earlier deadlines and Canada briefly walked out of the trade talks before returning the next day. \n Yet, if Trudeau is expected to sign at an official summit on Thursday, precious little time is left. Without the guarantee the EU is ready to finalize the deal, there would be no reason to have the summit, an EU official said. \n The Belgian region of Wallonia has stood in the way of the CETA accord, short for Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. The deal between over 500 million EU citizens and 35 million Canadians would eliminate almost all tariffs. \n Politicians in Wallonia, which is smaller than the U.S. state of New Jersey, argue that the proposed deal would undermine labor, environment and consumer standards and allow multinationals to crush local companies. They have vowed to thwart a pact that the world's biggest trading bloc and Canada are eager to secure. \n New attempts were made to sway Wallonia leader Paul Magnette to sign on over the weekend. \n Magnette said Wallonia still saw \"some small difficulties.\" A better deal would bolster EU standards and set a strong precedent for future trade talks between Europe and its trading partners, he said. \n Canada's International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland walked away from the talks Friday on the verge of tears, saying the EU appeared incapable of signing the deal. Yet, she came back for talks on Saturday. \n EU leaders have warned that failure to clinch the deal with Canada could ruin the bloc's credibility as a trade partner and make it more difficult to strike such agreements with the United States, Japan and other allies. \n A similar free trade agreement being negotiated between the EU and the United States is facing far more opposition than the Canada pact.

We may be able to return to Scarborough Shoal, the fishing by our countrymen,\" Duterte said in a speech in the northern city of Tuguegarao, making a visit after the region was lashed by a super typhoon. \n Considering the delicate role of Scarborough's shallow lagoon, which is a spawning area for tuna and other fish, \"I myself said that if we're able to sail back to Scarborough Shoal as its owner \u2014 and they insist they are also the owner \u2014 I myself will say, 'Don't fish there,'\" Duterte said. \n \"What I know is he has also asked the Chinese fishermen to go away so there won't be anybody who'll be seen there,\" he said without identifying the Chinese leader he talked with. \"That's what we discussed. I'm not sure if they'll fulfill that.\" \n In another speech Sunday in the typhoon-hit province of Isabela, Duterte said a Chinese official insisted on China's ownership of virtually the entire contested sea on historical grounds, citing the official as saying, \"We will not give in on this.\" \n Duterte said he replied that the Philippines won't budge \"because we won in the court.'\" In a landmark ruling in July, an international tribunal in The Hague invalidated China's historic claims in the South China Sea and ruled that the Chinese government violated the Filipinos' right to fish in Scarborough, which it declared a traditional fishing ground. \n Duterte cited the Chinese as saying, \"We can resolve this case peacefully, no fighting, no blood and it will take time.\" Duterte said he responded by saying, \"It's OK \u2026 we'll discuss the award that we got someday and we won't get out of this document \u2026 we won in the ownership.\" \n \"But I will not insist now, I will not impose now, I will not go to war now, I will not waste the life of my soldiers,\" Duterte said. \"Our two FA-50s have no rockets, how will I wage a war? In five minutes, their planes will reach Manila while ours, on takeoff, will just get stuck there and won't be able to fly because they'll be bombed.\" \n During his visit to China, Duterte met Chinese President Xi Jinping and other top officials. \n China effectively took control of Scarborough in 2012 after its ships had a tense standoff with Philippine vessels. Then-President Benigno Aquino III said U.S. officials brokered a deal for a simultaneous withdrawal of the ships. Aquino withdrew his government's ships, but said China reneged on the verbal deal and went on to control Scarborough. \n Since then, Chinese coast guard ships have guarded the shoal, blocking and driving away Filipino fishermen, who complained that the Chinese at times used water cannons or dangerously chased them away while yelling, through a bullhorn, that they were barging into Chinese territory. \n In 2013, Aquino's administration brought its territorial disputes with China to international arbitration, a move that China ignored. \n China ignored the ruling by the tribunal and continued shooing Filipinos away from the shoal. \n The tough-talking Duterte, who has reached out to China while stepping back from his country's close security alliance with the U.S., has said he would not immediately insist on China's compliance to the arbitration ruling. Instead, he said he would mend strained relations with Beijing and seek to expand two-way trade and investments with the Asian economic powerhouse. \n China committed to provide up to $16 million in financial assistance, which could come next year, primarily for agriculture, aside from business deals with Philippine companies, Duterte said, praising China for \"really being nice inside.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Duterte: Filipinos 'may' be able to return to disputed shoal"}

Reid's seat is considered the only one Republicans could reasonably flip to their side this election.

Cortez Masto said in the recent Senate debate, \"Donald Trump's ship is sinking, and Congressman Heck is scurrying off it.\" \n Heck was one of the first GOP candidates to withdraw his backing from Trump after a recently released video showed Trump making sexually inappropriate comments about women back in 2005.

Don't think of voting as some boring thing \u2026 It's your chance to make a difference.\" \n The 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston last month upheld a decision that New Hampshire's ban on ballot selfies was unconstitutional, saying it suppressed a large swath of political speech and there was no evidence to support the state's concerns. \n \"It goes to the core of democracy,\" said Gilles Bissonnette, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, which brought the suit on behalf of three people investigated for violating the statute. \n Among those filing briefs in support of ballot selfies was Snapchat, which argued they are the latest way voters, especially young adults, get involved in the political process and express support for or against a cause or a candidate. \n \"We had a failure to recognize the importance of online political speech, especially to the younger generation,\" Bissonnette said. \"The First Amendment needs to be guarded rigorously. These old laws cannot and should not be applied to the modern technology.\" \n California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill last month that repeals a 125-year-old law barring voters from showing people their marked ballots. It goes into effect after the November election, but legislative analysists have found no occasion of the ban being enforced \u2014 and it hasn't stopped people from sharing photos of their 2016 ballots. \n Colorado started mailing ballots this week in the all-mail presidential election, and some ballot selfies started popping up on social media. In response, Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey on Thursday issued a reminder that publicizing completed ballots is a misdemeanor in the state. \n The ACLU criticized his statement as potential voter intimidation. Morrissey's spokeswoman told reporters he had no plans to comb social media looking for folks posting ballot selfies, saying authorities investigate only in response to a complaint. \n Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring issued a formal opinion last month that nothing in Virginia law prohibits voters from taking pictures of themselves, fellow voters or their ballot within the polling place. \n \"This is a product of the times we live in,\" said Democratic New Jersey Assemblyman Raj Mukherji, who has sponsored a measure to allow ballot selfies. \"If voters want to express their pride in participating in our democracy by voting or tout their political preferences on social media, they should be entitled to do so.\" \n Clarissa Livingstone, 26, of Toms River, said she doesn't understand concerns raised over ballot selfies. She doesn't believe people would be influenced by seeing ballot photos that she or anyone else might post. \n \"People are so rigid in their political beliefs these days,\" Livingstone said, \"they're not going to change their votes once they see how some Jersey girl voted.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Posting ballot selfies: Personal choice or illegal act?"}

{"date": "October 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump delivers a speech during a campaign event, Saturday, Oct. 22, 2016, in Gettysburg, Pa. \n NEW YORK >> \"Such a nasty woman.\" \n Like many people, 23-year-old Emily DiVito was multitasking while watching last week's presidential debate, with a little studying and a little Twitter-surfing. But when DiVito heard Donald Trump say those four words to Hillary Clinton, she shot up in her seat. \n \"The interruptions were so absurd, but that was particularly biting,\" she said. \n What's more, the moment gave DiVito, a former avid supporter of Clinton's primary rival Bernie Sanders, a feeling of solidarity with Clinton \u2014 a \"moment of connectivity,\" as she put it. \"I was for Bernie, but moments like this make me proud to be affiliated with her, the way she is persevering.\" \n That's good news for Clinton, who despite her lead in the polls, has struggled to connect with millennial voters. \n It also was probably bad news for Trump. Days after his devastating \"grab 'em\" remarks emerged and he started facing new allegations of sexual assault, the GOP presidential nominee had another bad week, leading some to wonder whether his popularity with female voters had reached rock bottom. \n The candidate who so badly needed to close the gender gap instead saw his \"nasty woman\" remark \u2014 accompanied by a wagging index finger \u2014 become a feminist battle cry, a galvanizing moment for Clinton and an exclamation point to a campaign dominated by gender. \n To Kathy Spillar, the \"nasty woman\" comment sounded like \"the coffin shutting.'\" \n \"I thought, 'That's it,'\" said Spillar, executive director of the Feminist Majority Foundation. \"Women voters are going to defeat Trump.\" The comment, she said, not only \"summed up his whole attitude about women,\" but showed how bitter he was about potentially losing to one. \n \"Losing would be bad enough, but that he has lost to a woman really grates on him,\" Spillar said. \"That's certainly clear. And this just fuels the gender gap.\" \n An ABC News poll released Sunday, and conducted in the days following Wednesday's debate, gave Clinton a 55 percent-35 percent lead over Trump among women. Among college-educated white women, the gap was 62 percent to 30 percent. Likely voters, by a margin of 69 percent to 24 percent, disapproved of Trump's response to questions about his treatment of women. In a Quinnipiac University poll conducted before that debate, Clinton led Trump among women by 52 percent to 37 percent. \n Also, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released a few days before the debate showed women favoring Clinton over Trump by 55 percent to 35 percent. \n Trump supporter Patti Stites felt the latest Trump remarks were unfortunate, but wouldn't sway her choice. \n \"It's certainly not nice, it's not appropriate, especially in a debate,\" said Stites, 61, of Northfield, New Jersey. \"But he says what he thinks. You still have to judge him by the issues. \n \"I don't need to like my president,\" added Stites, a former employee of a Trump property, the now-shuttered Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. \n The \"nasty woman\" interjection \u2014 coming on a night when both candidates interrupted each other frequently \u2014 went viral. Spotify tweeted that streams of Janet Jackson's \"Nasty\" were up 250 percent. \"Nasty Woman\" T-shirts were on offer (\"Bad Hombre\" ones, too.) Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, got in on the act, tweeting to Clinton: \"From one #NastyWoman to another, you were an inspiration last night.\" \n \"So much of this election cycle has been about the ways men belittle women when they don't get what they want from them,\" said Andi Zeisler, 43, feminist author and founder of the nonprofit Bitch Media. \"Now, people are seeing themselves in Donald Trump's words toward Hillary, they're seeing themselves in how his surrogates act toward women \u2014 and toward Latinos and anyone who is not a straight white man.\" \n The \"nasty woman\" remark, she said, is a \"somewhat predictable and almost laughable apex\" of what's been going on all year. But, she added, it is totally possible that there might be a new apex to come. \n Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to highlight her opponent's trouble with female voters, saying at one point: \"Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.\" When it came to abortion, she argued in a pointed way for a woman's right to control her own body, after Trump said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. \n That, too, impressed DiVito, who worked for Sanders' campaign for several months after graduating from Wellesley, Clinton's alma mater. \n \"I felt solidarity rooted in pride for a woman who was up there sticking up for other women against a man who has zero interest in trying to empathize with the emotional and physical complexity of abortion,\" DiVito said. \n It didn't help Trump that he evoked audible laughter in the audience \u2014 despite moderator Chris Wallace's admonitions to the crowd \u2014 when he said: \"Nobody has more respect for women than I do.\" \n Debbie Walsh, who specializes in women and politics at Rutgers University, said she wasn't particularly shocked by Trump's remark, given his other recent statements. \n \"Gender is front and center in this campaign, and he is clearly using it,\" said Walsh, director of the school's Center for American Women and Politics. She recalled Trump's saying Clinton had \"tremendous hate in her heart,\" calling her the devil, even saying he \"wasn't impressed\" when she walked in front of him \u2014 interpreted as a comment on her appearance. \n \"He is the gift that keeps on giving on this stuff,\" Walsh said. \n For a male Clinton supporter, the moment was a chance to reflect on how women might react when they hear such things. \n \"I imagined women throwing things at the TV,\" said Stefan Krieger, 69, a law professor in New York. \"I imagine there are some men that say such things to their girlfriends, their wives, their partners, in a fit of rage. It's a way of men lashing out with power.\" \n \"I hope I'm not like that.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's 'nasty woman' remark adds to woes with female voters"}

{"date": "October 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Regent University, Saturday, Oct. 22, 2016, in Virginia Beach, Va. \n WASHINGTON >> Donald Trump's campaign bluntly acknowledged Sunday that the real estate mogul is trailing Hillary Clinton as the presidential race hurdles toward a close, but insisted he still has a viable path to win the White House. \n With barely two weeks left and early voting underway in most of the U.S., Trump's team said \"the race is not over\" and pledged to keep campaigning hard \u2014 even in states like Virginia and Pennsylvania that polls show are now trending Clinton's way. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway laid out a path to the requisite 270 electoral votes that goes through make-or-break states Florida, Iowa, North Carolina and Ohio. \n \"We are behind. She has some advantages,\" Conway said Sunday. Yet she argued that Clinton's advantages \u2014 like a slew of bold-name Democrats campaigning for her \u2014 belied her lack of true support. \"The current president and first lady, vice president, all are much more popular than she can hope to be.\" \n Added Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus: \"We expect to win.\" \n Yet even as Clinton appeared to be strengthening her lead, her campaign was careful not to declare premature victory. \n \"We don't want to get ahead of our skis here,\" said Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. He said the \"battleground states\" where both candidates are campaigning hardest \"are called that for a reason.\" \n As part of his closing message, Trump was laying out an ambitious agenda for his first 100 days as president. Yet he undermined his own attempt to strike a high-minded tone on policy issues when he announced in the same speech that he planned to sue the numerous women who have accused him of groping and other unwanted sexual behavior. \n \"All of these liars will be sued once the election is over,\" Trump said Saturday during an event near the Civil War battlefield of Gettysburg. He added: \"I look so forward to doing that.\" \n Asked about Trump's remarks, Clinton told reporters between rallies Saturday in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia that she was done responding to what her Republican opponent is saying as Election Day nears and would instead focus on helping elect other Democrats. \n A day earlier, Clinton attacked Pennsylvania's Republican senator, Pat Toomey, saying in Pittsburgh that he has refused to \"stand up\" to Trump as she praised his Democratic challenger, Katie McGinty. Noting Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants and his attacks on a Muslim-American military family, she said of Toomey: \"If he doesn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all of this, then can you be sure that he will stand up for you when it counts?\" \n Clinton rejected Trump's allegation, offered without evidence, that the dozen or so women who have come forward are being prompted by her campaign or the Democratic National Committee. The accusers emerged after the former reality TV star boasted of kissing women and groping their genitals without their consent. \n \"These accusations are not coming from our campaign,\" Mook said. \n On Saturday, an adult film actress said the billionaire kissed her and two other women on the lips \"without asking for permission\" when they met him after a golf tournament in 2006. Trump has denied that all the other allegations, while insisting some of the women weren't attractive enough for him to want to pursue. \n \"He's been waterboarded by these issues,\" said former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Trump supporter, lamenting the \"oppression\" of her candidate in the media. \n Though mostly a recap of policies he's proposed before, Trump's speech included a few new elements, such as a freeze on hiring new federal workers and a two-year mandatory minimum sentence for immigrants who re-enter the U.S. illegally after being deported a first time. In a pledge sure to raise eyebrows on Wall Street, he said he'd block a potential merger between AT&T and media conglomerate Time Warner. \n Throughout the GOP primary, Trump was criticized for shying away from detailed policy proposals. But his speech, which aides said would form the core of his closing argument to voters, underscored how the billionaire has gradually compiled a broad \u2014 if sometimes vague \u2014 policy portfolio that straddles conservative, isolationist and populist orthodoxies. \n Mook and Brewer spoke on CNN's \"State of the Union\" and Priebus on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" Conway spoke on \"Fox News Sunday\" and on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump team says 'we are behind' but can still win the race"}
