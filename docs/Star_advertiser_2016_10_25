{"date": "October 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speak during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis. \n NEW YORK >> Back in June, when Donald Trump slammed President Barack Obama's endorsement of Hillary Clinton on Twitter, the Democrat's campaign was quick to tweet back a chilly three-word response: \"Delete your account .\" \n It was a telling exchange, and not just because it set the stage for what has become the country's first nationwide Twitter election. It also highlighted the striking, and very different, ways both presidential hopefuls have used the service to hone their messages, hurl accusations at one another and speak directly to voters \u2014 in effect, bypassing traditional media while also relying on it to amplify their retorts. \n So entrenched has Twitter become in the 2016 election that it can be difficult to remember just how new it is in this context. Four years ago, candidates Obama and Mitt Romney were just testing the waters with social media. This year, it's a major source of information \u2014 political and otherwise \u2014 for a huge number of Americans. In a Pew Research Center poll last January, 44 percent of adults said they had learned about the election in the previous week from social media, more than cited print newspapers. \n \"People are using Twitter to connect more directly to the live events, moments and candidates of this campaign in a way that voters have never been able to do before,\" says Adam Sharp, Twitter's head of news, government and elections. \n STILETTO VS. BLUDGEON \n The candidates are certainly making the most of it. While Trump says he writes many of his tweets himself, especially at night, Clinton's staff acknowledges producing the vast majority of hers. And Trump is definitely ahead by one crude measure: His followers outnumber Clinton's, 12.7 million to 10 million. \n The former reality-TV star and GOP presidential nominee draws outsized attention for what he's tweeting and retweeting on a near-daily basis, most recently for his attacks on fellow Republicans and unsupported claims that the Nov. 8 election will be \"rigged.\" During his primary campaign, Trump drew regular news coverage for Twitter assaults that bludgeoned opponents with insults and sometimes baseless charges. \n Trump's approach hasn't changed much in the general election, although his focus on his political opponent sometimes wavers. While he constantly refers to Clinton as \"Crooked Hillary\" and has continued to criticize the media for reporting that he is falling behind in the polls, he's also launched long, and sometimes late-night, Twitter broadsides on a beauty queen, the Muslim family of a slain U.S. soldier and a federal judge. \n The Trump campaign didn't respond to requests for comment. \n When the Clinton camp goes on the attack, by contrast, it uses Twitter more as a stiletto than a club. \"Delete your account\" is a popular internet meme, an arch putdown that suggests someone just said something so embarrassingly stupid that they should just slink away and disappear. The response was an immediate hit that ricocheted around blogs and news sites for days; it's been retweeted more than half a million times. \n Trump is \"that rough individual who will say anything,\" a stance that his supporters find \"very refreshing,\" says Ian Bogost, a communications professor at Georgia Tech. Clinton's tweet, by contrast, \"signals to her base that she's with-it on the internet,\" he noted in an earlier piece in the Atlantic. \n In his first debate with Clinton on Sept. 26, Trump denied saying that climate change was a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. Clinton's social media team immediately pounced, retweeting Trump's own 2013 tweet in which he said just that. \n After Clinton referred to a large fraction of Trump supporters as a \"basket of deplorables \" for their sexism and racism, Trump retweeted a 2012 Obama tweet that argued the country doesn't need a president \"who writes off nearly half the country.\" But Trump has also drawn fire for repeatedly retweeting white nationalists and promulgating at least one image condemned as anti-Semitic , an association Trump denied. \n SEIZING THE WHEEL \n Unsurprisingly, the two campaigns have very different social media goals. Trump, who joined Twitter in 2009, has long used the medium as a direct channel to the public for promoting himself and testing the political waters \u2014 for instance, by fueling the lie that Obama wasn't born in the U.S. \n Trump's campaign staffers do sometimes seize the wheel, as when the account tweeted \"thoughts and prayers \" for NBA star Dwayne Wade following the shooting death of his cousin in August. Trump's first tweet on the subject 82 minutes earlier had noted the shooting and crowed, \"Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!\" \n Some analysts have noticed that most Trump-y tweets from Trump's account originate from a different mobile device than ones that could have come from any traditional politician. That has spawned endless jokes \u2014 mainly on Twitter, naturally \u2014 along the lines of how his campaign staff fails to take away Trump's phone during his tirades. \n The Clinton campaign takes a more traditional approach, operating as its own massive brand rather than as a singular, fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants candidate. (Rare tweets directly from the candidate are signed \"-H.\") Many of the campaign's tweets are the typical boilerplate of politics \u2014 thanks to supporters, reiterations of the candidate's positions, forwarding news of endorsements and other developments. \n Clinton's approach hasn't always fared well; an early tweet asking people to share how student debt makes them feel in \"3 emojis or less \" quickly backfired. Responses on Twitter included, \"This is like when your mom tries to be hip in front of your friends and totally fails at it.\" \n THE DIGITAL 100 \n Twitter is just part of a much larger Clinton digital presence run by a 100-person \"digital team\" that extends from Twitter to Snapchat to Quora to YouTube to Pinterest. It's designed to draw in a broad range of voters, from young, social media savvy fans to Pinterest moms, while also working to undercut her rival on some of his favorite stomping grounds. \n Clinton's digital team offered Snapchat filters during the GOP convention that let people paste old Trump quotes praising Clinton over pictures of the gathering. There's the \"Trump yourself\" Facebook app, which lets users see how Trump would insult someone like them. \"Fat pig\" and \"women are always 'griping and bitching'\" are just some of the options. \n Clinton even has a tool that invites people to \"Troll Trump \" by signing up for automatic donations every time Trump tweets something offensive \u2014 which the campaign defines simply as every time Trump tweets. \n TWEETING FOR EFFECT \n The Clinton campaign argues that social media is just a means to an end: winning the election. \n \"Anyone who wants to say something unhinged, or (retweet) neo-Nazis\" will likely get outsized attention, says Teddy Goff, chief digital strategist for the Clinton campaign. \"Car wrecks get a lot of attention.\" \n Trump, of course, has rarely suffered for lack of attention. But while his unfiltered tweets helped him lock up the GOP nomination, they've proven less effective in the general election. Falling poll numbers, however, haven't cowed him. On Monday, he tweeted (without evidence) that Democrats are \"making up phony polls\" to suppress \"the Trump.\" He concluded: \"We are going to WIN!\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "The Trump-Clinton Twitter war: Bludgeon vs. stiletto"}

{"date": "October 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Outdoor School students walk along a pond with jumping fish during a lesson at Camp Howard in Mount Hood National Forest near Corbett, Ore. \n MOUNT HOOD NATIONAL FOREST, Ore. >> Each year, thousands of Oregon parents hug their kids goodbye and send them tramping into the wilderness for up to a week to learn about their state's natural wonders. \n The Outdoor School program was groundbreaking when it started more than a half-century ago. Since then, more than 1 million children have enjoyed \u2014 or endured \u2014 this rite of passage at campsites scattered from Oregon's stormy coast to its towering evergreen forests to its rugged high desert. \n At the program's heyday, 90 percent of sixth-graders spent the week testing water samples, studying fungi and digging through topsoil. Today, just half of Oregon's 11- and 12-year-olds take part, mostly through a patchwork of grants, fundraising, parent fees and charitable donations. Caps on property taxes, plus the recent recession, have forced many school districts to scrap the program or whittle it down to just a few days. \n Now, backers of a statewide ballot measure want to use a slice of lottery proceeds to guarantee a week of Outdoor School for all children. If it passes, the measure would make Oregon the only state with dedicated funding for outdoor education, including students in charter, private and home schools, said Sarah Bodor, policy director for the North American Association for Environmental Education. \n Opponents, however, say its passage would mean deep cuts to a state agency tasked with economic development by siphoning away millions in lottery money critical to expanding Oregon business. And at least one outspoken state lawmaker worries Measure 99 would impose liberal Portland's values on children in rural Oregon where farming, mining, logging and fishing are a way of life. \n The push to fund Outdoor School dovetails with a national trend toward outdoor learning, Bodor said. More than two dozen states have developed environmental literacy plans as educators realize the importance of outdoor time for developing critical thinking and leadership skills, she said. \n \"But these are really unfunded mandates and \u2026 the outdoor component is the piece that very often gets left behind,\" Bodor said. \n Measure 99 would cover that unfunded cost by taking up to $22 million \u2014 or 4 percent a quarter \u2014 from the state lottery's economic development fund to send 50,000 fifth- or sixth-graders to Outdoor School each year. The Oregon State University Extension Service would dole out the money to school districts using a process that will be determined if the measure passes. \n Applying for the lottery funds would be voluntary, and schools, educational districts and nonprofits that already run Outdoor Schools around the state could continue to do so. \n To get the state funding, programs would have to meet certain criteria, including a curriculum that includes the study of plants, animals, soil and water; discussion of the role of natural resources in the state economy; and lessons on the relationship between economic growth, natural resources and conservation. \n \"This is not a mandate \u2014 it's an offer. And we wanted to make sure it was a real one, which means providing sufficient funding to cover the cost of a good, high-quality program,\" said Rex Burkholder, chairman of the Measure 99 campaign committee. \n With two weeks to go before the election, Measure 99 has no organized opposition, and polls indicate it will pass \u2014 but not everyone is buying it. \n State Sen. Betsy Johnson, a Democrat who represents a rural district northwest of Portland, says lottery proceeds are for economic development, not camp. She worries Oregonians who remember their own Outdoor School experience will vote for the measure out of nostalgia without understanding it could hurt other programs. \n Economic Development for Central Oregon, a nonprofit that promotes job growth, says the money for Outdoor School would be equivalent to 70 percent of the budget for the state's economic development agency, which relies on lottery money. Efforts to bring television productions like \"Grimm,\" \"Leverage\" and \"Portlandia\" to Oregon could suffer as a result, it said. \n \"It's so feel-good, it's so 'Oregon' that I just worry that people are not going to give it the level of scrutiny it deserves,\" Johnson said. \"The assumption is Outdoor School \u2026 will produce better citizens and good Oregonians. What's my metric to know if that really happens?\" \n Supporters point to a Portland State University study that found students who participated in Outdoor School had improved attendance. They also highlight surveys by the Multnomah Education Service District \u2014 which provides 7,000 students a year with Outdoor School \u2014 that show the program boosts self-confidence and interest in math and science. \n At a recent five-day camp in Mount Hood National Forest, sixth-graders from Portland's Jackson Middle School seemed unaware of the politics surrounding their adventure. \n As a light drizzle fell, they dipped nets into a fog-cloaked pond surrounded by stands of Douglas fir trees, sketched water bugs in notebooks and tested the water's acidity and turbidity as rainbow trout jumped just a few feet away. Each child wore a \"wood cookie\" \u2014 a cross-section of a small log \u2014 emblazoned with their name and cabin assignment and decorated with beaded pins to denote their completion of field studies on plants, animals, soil and water. \n \"It's definitely better out here,\" said 11-year-old Maya Herring, showing off her wood cookie festooned with beads and bling awarded by her counselor. \"You can actually feel the nature. It's not just saying, 'This is what this fern looks like.'

{"date": "October 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Chinese electronics maker Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology has issued a recall for millions of products sold in the U.S. following a devastating cyberattack, but has lashed out at critics who say its devices were at fault. \n BEIJING >> A Chinese electronics maker that has recalled products sold in the U.S. said Tuesday it did all it could to prevent a massive cyberattack that briefly blocked access to websites including Twitter and Netflix. \n Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology has said some of its web-connected cameras and digital recorders became compromised because customers failed to change their default passwords. \n Liu Yuexin, Xiongmai's marketing director, told The Associated Press that Xiongmai and other companies across the home surveillance equipment industry were made aware of the vulnerability in April 2015. Liu said Xiongmai moved quickly to plug the gaps and should not be singled out for criticism. \n \"We don't know why there is a spear squarely pointed at our chest,\" Liu said. \n The hack has heightened long-standing fears among security experts that the rising number of interconnected home gadgets, appliances and even automobiles represent a cybersecurity nightmare. The convenience of being able to control home electronics via the web also leaves them more vulnerable to malicious intruders, experts say. \n Unidentified hackers seized control of gadgets including Xiongmai's on Friday and directed them to launch an attack that temporarily disrupted access to a host of sites, ranging from Twitter and Netflix to Amazon and Spotify, according to U.S. web security researchers. \n The \"distributed denial-of-service\" attack targeted servers run by Dyn Inc., an internet company located in Manchester, New Hampshire. These types of attacks work by overwhelming targeted computers with junk data so that legitimate traffic can't get through. \n \"The issue with the consumer-connected device is that there is nearly no firewall between devices and the public internet,\" said Tracy Tsai, an analyst at Gartner, adding that many consumers leave the default setting on devices for ease of use without knowing the dangers. \n Researchers at the New York-based cybersecurity firm Flashpoint said most of the junk traffic heaped on Dyn came from internet-connected cameras and video-recording devices that had components made by Xiongmai. Those components had little security protection, so devices they went into became easy to exploit. \n In an acknowledgement of its products' role in the hack, Xiongmai said in a statement Monday that it would recall products sold in the U.S. before April 2015 to demonstrate \"social responsibility.\" It said products sold after that date had been patched and no longer constitute a danger. \n The company, which also makes dashboard cameras and computer chips, said it would recall several models of web-connected cameras and has offered customers a software security fix. The recall will apply only to devices sold under Xiongmai's name. As an original equipment manufacturer, close to 95 percent of the company's products are sold by other firms that repackage its devices under their own brand names, said Liu, the marketing director. \n Liu refused to specify how many units the company expected to recall from the U.S. other than that it could be in the thousands. \n Xiongmai and Dahua, a video surveillance manufacturer also based in the eastern Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, first came under scrutiny several weeks ago after Flashpoint assessed that hackers had controlled their devices to attack the website of cybersecurity writer Brian Krebs, among other targets. Dahua has responded by saying it is dedicated to testing vulnerabilities, and has offered discounts for replacement equipment. \n Xiongmai has adopted a less conciliatory stance. It downplayed its culpability this week, saying that as even the world's largest technology companies experience security lapses, \"we are not afraid to also experience it once.\" \n Xiongmai also slammed as \"completely untrue, malicious and defamatory\" reports about its products and appended to its statement a letter from its lawyers threatening litigation. \n Mark James, an expert with Slovakia-based security company ESET, said that he doubted Xiongmai could be held liable for an attack such as Friday's, but that the company's officials \"obviously recognize a concern here.\" \n \"Hopefully other manufacturers will follow suit and take a look at what they can do to increase security of their own products,\" he said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Raphael Satter in London and researcher Fu Ting in Shanghai contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n This story has been corrected to remove reference to millions for number recalled webcam units. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Chinese firm says it did all it could ahead of cyberattack"}

KOJIMA / JAN. 2016 \n Family and friends pay respect at a memorial service held for the 12 marines who died in a helicopter crash off the North Shore. \n Twelve Hawaii Marines were killed on Jan. 14 when two CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters collided off Oahu as one chopper raced at night to catch up and the first helicopter turned in its path, according to the Investigative Reporting Program at the University of California, Berkeley. \n The impact resulted in an explosion that instantaneously killed all aboard, the university program said. Six Marines were in each aircraft during the night training. \n According to the program's report, Pegasus 32 outpaced the other helicopter, Pegasus 31, which accelerated just as the lead aircraft was making a sharp left turn, resulting in the collision at 1,500 feet elevation off Oahu's North Shore. \n The Kaneohe Bay pilots had fallen behind on flying hours and two of them were not adequately proficient in the use of night vision goggles, the Investigative Reporting Program said. \n The California program worked with families of the fallen Marines and reported the findings on Huffington Post and Civil Beat today. The Marine Corps is expected to formally release its investigation Wednesday. \n Lt. Col. Curtis L. Hill, a spokesman for Marine Corps Forces Pacific, said in an email today, that the Marines' \"investigation found the primary cause of this mishap to be pilot error.\" \n The inquiry \"determined that the aircraft failed to maintain adequate distance during the flight\" and they collided, Hill said. \"Investigators believe that the low light conditions made it difficult for the aircrew to recognize the rapid decrease in separation between the aircraft which led to the collision.\" \n The evidence indicated both aircraft were mechanically sound. \n \"Investigators found the main contributing factors were low aircraft readiness leading to inadequate pilot proficiency, human factors, and the squadron's lack of focus on basic aviation practices,\" Hill also said. \n Killed in the crash were: \n \u00bb Maj. Shawn M. Campbell, 41, pilot. \n \u00bb Sgt. William J. Turner, 25, crew chief. \n \u00bb Capt. Kevin T. Roche, 30, pilot. \n \u00bb Capt. Brian T. Kennedy, 31, pilot. \n \u00bb Sgt. Jeffrey A.

Hart, 21, crew chief. \n \"This loss of life was tragic and is felt deeply in the Marine Corps community,\" Hill said. \"Our thoughts go out to the families of all those affected by this incident.\" \n After the crash, the Marine Corps said it grounded its CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters from training in Hawaii for 19 days and pulled them from an Australia deployment. \n The collision in a fireball 2 miles off the coast came amid revelations that Marine Corps aviation \u2014 including fixed-wing F/A-18 Hornets as well as rotary aircraft \u2014 had been hamstrung by budget cuts leading to parts shortages and maintenance backlogs. \n Lisa and Mike De La Cruz, the parents of one of the lost Marines, Sgt. Dillon Semolina, previously told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that the two choppers shouldn't have been flying that night because the parts issue was so bad. \n Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 463, which had 12 choppers before the crash, \"stopped all flight operations for 12 days and then only conducted functional check-flights required in support of maintenance-related operations,\" Capt. Cassandra Gesecki, then a spokeswoman for the III Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, Japan, said in April. \"There were no training or operational support flights flown for a total of 19 days.\" \n Three days before the crash, Lt. Col. Edward Pavelka, commander of HMH-463, was relieved of command. Higher command had \"lost confidence in his ability to continue to lead the squadron,\" the Marine Corps said without explaining what Pavelka had done. \n An inquiry made by Minnesota U.S. Sen. Al Franken's office said Pavelka was removed because the squadron had low unit morale and low readiness. \n Mike De La Cruz previously said he was told Pavelka was flying the helicopters minimally because of safety concerns. \n By August, the Marine Corps had begun a full refurbishment of its CH-53E Super Stallion heavy lift helicopters, \"an effort aimed at significantly increasing the number of operationally fit aircraft and addressing systemic issues, which in recent years drove the platform's readiness level to unsustainable depths,\" Naval Air Systems Command said at the time. \n Officials found the material condition of the CH-53 helicopters degraded due to age and hard use in war in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n ", "author": "Star-Advertiser staff", "title": "Report: Pilot error blamed in Marine copter crash that killed 12 off Oahu"}

Avila has filed a lawsuit that alleges her co-workers at the Coralville, Iowa office of Sedgwick Claims Management Services repeatedly used the image of Donald Trump to harass her after she objected to Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants. \n IOWA CITY, Iowa >> A Hispanic woman says her white co-workers at an Iowa claims office used images of Donald Trump to racially harass her for months after they learned she was angered by his description of Mexican immigrants as rapists, according to a civil rights lawsuit she filed against her company. \n Alexandra Avila's co-workers at Sedgwick Claims Management Services \u2014 where they administered benefits for Wal-Mart employees \u2014 began calling her an \"illegal immigrant\" even though she's a natural-born U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit filed Monday in Iowa district court. The suit claims her former co-workers placed a picture of an angry-looking Trump as Avila's computer's screensaver, signed her up to volunteer for his campaign and sent her racist memes, including one that read: \"How's Mr. Donald Trump going to deport all these illegals? Juan by Juan.\" \n The Republican presidential candidate's promise to build a border wall to keep out Mexican immigrants has for months contributed to racial tensions nationwide. \"Build a wall\" chants have been used by high school students to taunt Latino opponents at sporting events in multiple states, including Iowa, Wisconsin and Indiana. At Kent State University, Latinos marching in the Homecoming parade this month said they were taunted with the same chant. \n Avila, a 32-year-old mother of one who worked at Sedgwick for three years, claims she faced similar heckling at her white-collar workplace in Coralville, Iowa, from the beginning of Trump's campaign in June 2015 until after she was fired five months later. \n \"It's been a weird political season where one candidate is taking public stances on things that, if the same words were said in the workplace, might constitute violations of our civil rights laws,\" said Avila's attorney, Paige Fiedler. \"His candidacy has emboldened some people to feel like that doesn't violate social norms anymore.\" \n Lesley Gudehus, spokeswoman for Memphis, Tennessee-based Sedgwick, declined comment on the lawsuit. \n Avila, born in California to Mexican parents, told colleagues she was upset with Trump's 2015 campaign launch when he said of Mexican immigrants: \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\" \n Soon after, the lawsuit claims, colleagues removed the photo Avila had of her young daughter as her computer screensaver and replaced it with a picture of Trump yelling and pointing his finger. When Avila removed the photo, they kept switching it back to Trump, the suit alleges. \n An email arrived from the Trump campaign last fall thanking her for the support and asking how she wanted to help, according to the suit. Avila also claims her colleagues sent offensive memes, including one showing a brown-skinned man that read: \"Found Jesus \u2014 he stabbed me twice.\" \n When her department was voting on a potluck menu, one co-worker said Avila was ineligible because she was an \"illegal immigrant,\" drawing laughter from Avila's boss, the lawsuit claims. Avila contends that after she complained about the harassment, the company accused her of falsifying timecards by claiming she worked minutes more time than she actually did. \n Avila was fired last November and escorted out, with Sedgwick saying it would send her personal property later. When her belongings arrived from FedEx, Avila says they contained a handwritten note that called her \"La Trumpa\" and added: \"Illegal immigrants can't vote or work. Good luck finding a job.\" \n \"Getting that box in the mail was a horrific experience,\" Fiedler says. \n After her firing, a co-worker sent her an invitation to a Trump rally on Facebook, the lawsuit claims. \n The lawsuit, which names Sedgwick and two supervisors, alleges Avila suffered discrimination based on national origin and that the company failed to pay wages she earned. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hispanic woman claims co-workers used Trump images to harass"}

{"date": "October 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has suggested that his presidential campaign will boost his hotel business and personal brand. But after a tumultuous run up to the election, including lewd statements about women and derogatory remarks about immigrants, there's some evidence that Trump's brand is being tarnished. \n NEW YORK >> Event planner Beth Bernstein decided she had had enough with Donald Trump after his 2005 hot-mic boasts about groping women came to light earlier this month. She removed photos of weddings she had thrown at a Trump hotel in Chicago from her website, wrote to hotel staff to remove her from the list of \"preferred vendors\" and posted a sort of call to arms on her blog. \n \"I simply cannot bring myself to walk in the door there any longer,\" wrote the owner of SQN Events. \n Bernstein is not alone. Rates for rooms at Trump's new D.C. hotel are being slashed as travelers weigh their options, and smartphone data suggest fewer people are visiting his properties compared to rival venues nearby. \n The Republican nominee for president is in danger of losing not just the election, but something dear to a man who claims the marketing value of his name alone is worth $3 billion: the many customers, mostly wealthy, who have stayed at his hotels, played a round at his golf courses or held galas at his oceanside resorts. \n Experts say the Trump brand is tarnished and at a tricky crossroads as his appeal shifts from the well-heeled, high-income people he has long courted to a more middle-class base, including the fervent fans he cultivated during the campaign. \n There is speculation that he could start a Trump media network as a right-wing alternative to major news outlets, drawing money from advertisers to make up for any weakness in his empire elsewhere. But he may have to pivot fast. \n \"The current trajectory is very harmful to his businesses,\" said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University. \"Right now his brands cater to the affluent, who are disproportionately turned off by his activities.\" \n Ever confident, the business mogul has denied his campaign has dimmed the gilded allure of his five-lettered name and has said, if anything, it has burnished the brand and boosted his business. In a statement, Amanda Miller, vice president of marketing at the Trump Organization, said: \"The Trump brand remains incredibly strong and we are seeing tremendous success across business units.\" \n Evidence of that is hard to see at Trump's new hotel in Washington, which Trump has declared the \"best\" in the city. It appears to have gotten off to a slow start. \n A room at the Trump International Hotel with a king size bed and a city view could have been yours any night of the week starting Nov. 14 for $505 or $555, according to a check of the hotel's website last week. By contrast, five major luxury competitors in the city generally charged more \u2014 sometimes hundreds of dollars more \u2014 or were sold out. For instance, the St. Regis only had rooms starting at $975 on Monday and Tuesday. The Four Seasons in Georgetown had no rooms available at any price for those days, and the Jefferson Hotel for those two days plus Wednesday. \n Rates at the Trump hotel have continued to sink, too: By the end of last week, the price of many Trump rooms had been cut by 10 percent or more. \n The managing director of Trump's new hotel, which the candidate will formally open with a ribbon-cutting on Wednesday, disputes that it is struggling. \n \"With 10 years of experience with Trump Hotels, I can easily say the opening of Trump International Hotel, Washington, D.C., has been the most successful in terms of opening bookings, interest from groups and large events,\" said Mickael Damelincourt in a statement. \"The building itself is an American icon, and we've created a world-class hotel with the largest luxury ballroom in Washington, D.C.\" \n Some customers are clearly turned off by Trump's derogatory remarks about women and immigrants, though, and the fallout is spreading beyond the hotels. \n A woman angry about Trump's groping comments, and that his daughter still supports him, has created the hashtag \"GrabYourWallet\" on Twitter to boycott the Ivanka Trump Collection, which includes handbags, shoes, jewelry and clothes. On Monday alone it was viewed more than half a million times. \n Some charities, including the Susan G. Komen Foundation, are considering moving events from Trump's properties, including the Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. On Monday, three Democratic U.S. senators sent a letter to the U.S. Golf Association urging it to move the 2017 U.S. Women's Open from a course owned by Trump following protests from others. \n It's difficult to know how any future loss of hotel bookings and weddings, charity galas and tournaments could hurt Trump, because his businesses are privately held. But he is vulnerable because so much rides on his name. Unlike his golf courses, in which he has heavily invested, many Trump hotels and residential towers are owned by others who pay him to place his name over the entrance and for marketing and management services \u2014 and could possibly cut him out someday. \n That's already being threatened at Trump Place in Manhattan. A petition to remove his name from the building, which he does not own, has gotten 328 names in a few days. One of the signers, Marjorie Jacobs, said the pressure has already led to new uniforms for doormen and other staff, ones that will no longer bear the Trump name. \n \"He's disgusting, and people are embarrassed to say where they live,\" she said. \n Brand Keys, a research firm that polled 1,536 registered voters nationwide, said Trump's comments about groping women has sent the premium you can charge for something bearing the Trump name down sharply. \n \"How consumers feel about the brand and whether or not they're more or less likely to engage with it has been affected,\" said Robert Passikoff, president of Brand Keys. \"People see a brand that had an image based on a glamorous lifestyle and a lot of money, and that is being been reevaluated by people.\" \n Foursquare, which tracks people's locations via their smartphones, said share of foot traffic at Trump branded businesses is down since Trump started his run in June 2015. Prior to Trump's presidential bid, foot traffic to his golf properties, hotels, resorts and other properties, both those owned by him and those just bearing his name, was steady year-over-year. According to its most recent data, share of foot traffic was down 19 percent in September, compared with 2014, before Trump announced his candidacy. \n In a statement, Eric Danziger, CEO of Trump Hotels, a collection of more than dozen hotels, called the Foursquare data \"manipulated\" and \"inconsequential,\" and said it does not \"provide an accurate representation of our performance.\" \n Not all the data point to a slowdown. Several big-name brands including NBC, Macy's and others severed ties in July 2015 following Trump's derogatory remarks about Mexican immigrants, but there has been no similar high-profile exodus since. \n And the home listing site Streeteasy compared prices for Trump-branded condos in 16 buildings in Manhattan to similar ones nearby and has found no evidence the brand has been damaged. In fact, Trump condos sold for 5.6 percent more in August than they did a year earlier, versus a drop for rivals. \n Still, there's evidence of a shift of Trump's demographic base, from the affluent to the more aspirational middle class. \n Will Johnson, an analyst at research firm BAV Consulting, which monitors brand perception for 3,500 brands, said that the Trump brand was \"collapsing\" among people with a household income of over $100,000 a year. \n \"He really has alienated the upper socioeconomic group and the data has consistently shown that he is down on pretty much all the metrics we measure,\" Johnson said. \"He's low on trust and high on arrogance.\" \n On the other hand, his brand is resonating more among those who make less than $100,000 a year. During the first nine months of the year, among that group, there was a 21 percent rise in people who think Donald Trump \"cares about customers\" and a 14 percent increase in those who think he is a \"visionary,\" according to BAV. \n Some say Trump could capitalize on that shift. \n \"In the short run, business gets damaged, but in the long run there's a lot of opportunity with less aspirational brands that target the middle- and lower-class,\" NYU's Galloway said. \"I think the Trump brand effectively dies in a Manhattan, but it thrives in some of the lower income, very red regions.\" \n One way to do that: start a conservative media network, as some analysts have floated. \n \"He could start the ultimate 'bro' news network that caters to his core constituency,\" Galloway said. \"He could out-offend Fox.\" \n One hurdle: He would have to get a major cable or satellite company to give him bandwidth, and there isn't much to go around. He could launch on a smaller scale on social media using Facebook or YouTube. \n Trump told a radio interviewer on Tuesday that his \"one interest\" was winning the election, not any media ventures. \n The biggest test of the brand, of course, will come Nov. 8. National polls show Hillary Clinton with a clear advantage over Trump, and possibly winning even traditional Republican states such as Arizona. \n \"I think at some point, probably after he loses the election, that we'll do a reevaluation of what the brand means and what the brand stands for,\" Brand Key's Passikoff said. \"You can't continue the kind of activities and have these revelations without significantly affecting how the people see the brand. The man and the brand are inseparable.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump brand loses luster with affluent"}

Police say he was last seen early Monday about 30 miles from the Texas border in western Oklahoma \u2014 165 miles away from where the manhunt began Sunday night in Wellston. \n The two police officers were shot and wounded as they responded to shots fired Sunday evening in Wellston, about 35 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. The Lincoln County Sheriff's Office said one person was arrested, but Vance fled in a patrol vehicle. The officers' injuries weren't life-threatening, and both are expected to recover, said Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Jessica Brown. \n Vance is suspected of later shooting a woman and stealing her vehicle at a mobile home park near Wellston, then driving about 8 miles to the mobile home of his aunt and uncle in Luther and killing them, Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office spokesman Mark Opgrande said. \n Ronald Everett Wilkson, 55, had been shot and had stab wounds to his neck \"consistent with an attempt to sever his head,\" Oklahoma County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Belanger wrote in an arrest affidavit. Valerie Kay Wilkson, 54, had similar neck wounds along with defensive wounds on her arms, the affidavit stated. \n Investigators found a large knife covered in blood inside the home, along with a blood-stained shirt and two shell casings from a round typically fired from an AK-47-style assault rifle. \n Opgrande said authorities also believe Vance filmed two Facebook Live videos documenting his run from police before going to the Wilksons' home. \n In one video, a man wearing a backward baseball cap and a shirt that appears to be covered in blood says he's about to steal another vehicle and that it's \"gonna be intense.\" In another, which seems to be filmed inside a second vehicle, the same man says: \"Letting y'all know, look, this is real,\" before panning to a long gun on the passenger seat. \n He said: \"If you want to know what's up next, stay tuned to your local news.\" \n Opgrande said today that investigators believe Wellston police shot Vance at least once Sunday evening, and that the bloodied shirt found at his aunt and uncle's home is the same one he is apparently wearing in the video as he complains, \"it hurts.\" \n Vance also is suspected of shooting a man in the leg in an attempted carjacking early Monday at a convenience store in Sayre, about 30 miles from the Texas border. Sayre Police Chief Ronnie Harrold said the man identified Vance as the man who shot him. \n The arrest warrant for Vance also includes charges of an unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and possession of a firearm after former conviction of a felony. Court records show Vance has been charged in the sexual abuse of a 15-year-old girl in Lincoln County, and has a court hearing Nov. 7. \n The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said Vance is believed to be driving a silver 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse with an Oklahoma license plate of 943LQQ.

{"date": "October 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Students arrived at Falmouth High School in Falmouth, Maine on Oct. 21. The town of Falmouth is one of several municipalities around the country that has canceled school on Election Day to avoid placing children at risk in case the heated rhetoric spills into confrontations or even violence at the polling places. \n FALMOUTH, Maine \u00bb Rigged elections. Vigilante observers. Angry voters. The claims, threats and passions surrounding the presidential race have led communities around the U.S. to move polling places out of schools or cancel classes on Election Day. \n The fear is that the ugly rhetoric of the campaign could escalate into confrontations and even violence in school hallways, endangering students. \n \"If anybody can sit there and say they don't think this is a contentious election, then they aren't paying much attention,\" said Ed Tolan, police chief in this seaside community, which decided to call off classes on Election Day and put additional officers on duty Nov. 8. \n (General Election Day is a state holiday in Hawaii, where many schools are polling places. So public schools are closed here on Nov. 8) \n School officials already are on edge because of the shootings and threats that have become all too common. They point to the recent firebombing of a Republican Party office in one North Carolina county and the shooting-up of another with a BB gun as the type of trouble they fear on Election Day. \n Some of those anxieties have been stoked by Donald Trump's repeated claims that the election is rigged and his appeal to his supporters to stand guard against fraud at the polls. Some are worried about clashes between the self-appointed observers and voters. \n Parent Alpay Balkir said he is glad children will be home. His 8-year-old son is a student in Falmouth, where the high school doubles as a polling place. \n \"If it's going to be as chaotic as they say it's going to be, it's a good thing. Kids should stay out of it,\" Balkir said. \"I don't know what the environment is going to be like.\" \n Schools are popular polling places because they have plenty of parking and are usually centrally located. It's difficult to say how many school-based polling places have been moved this year, given how decentralized the voting process is across the country. \n But state and local officials say voting has been removed or classes canceled on Election Day at schools in Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and elsewhere. \n \"There is a concern, just like at a concert, sporting event or other public gathering that we didn't have 15 or 20 years ago. What if someone walks in a polling location with a backpack bomb or something?\" said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, co-chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of State election committee. \"If that happens at a school, then that's certainly concerning.\" \n Despite the concerns, the National Association of Secretaries of State does not advocate having armed guards or police stationed at the polls because their presence could intimidate voters. \n Some of the pressure to close schools on Election Day or move voting is coming from parents. Sara Andriotis, a mother in the Easton, Pennsylvania, area, pushed for voting to be taken out of local schools. \n \"We were mostly concerned because of the risk that it puts our children in,\" she said. \n Easton Superintendent John Reinhart wanted to get voting out of schools altogether but was rebuffed by county election officials. So the school board canceled classes on Election Day. \n \"If you take the personalities away and cast the emotion with the election aside, one has to ask the question: 'Are our schools the best places for that activity to take place?'\" he said. \"I just think we've reached the point where we need to look at other locations.\" \n That's happening in Hall County, Nebraska, which got out ahead of the trend in May when it moved six polling places out of schools for a primary. Those changes will remain in place next month. Voting will be held at three churches and one community center. \n Election officials elsewhere say that schools are vital places for voting and that removing them as polling places creates logistical headaches and voter confusion. \n \"We wouldn't be able to conduct voting without them,\" said Pam Anderson, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association. She said voting in schools has not generally been a concern in Colorado but acknowledged there is likely to be more security this year. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fearing Election Day trouble, some mainland schools cancel classes"}

Duterte is on a three-day official visit to Japan. \n TOKYO \u00bb The outspoken Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte worries his Japanese hosts. Not just his policy toward the U.S. but also his informal style: Will he chew gum in front of the emperor? \n Duterte arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday for a three-day visit, his first since becoming Philippine leader at the end of June. \n For diplomats and political leaders, the main issue is his U.S. policy and how Japan can help mend those ties. \n Tokyo is a major U.S. ally, and has watched with concern as Duterte criticized the U.S. and said he would scale back his country's military engagement with America. He has also worried Japan and the United States by reaching out to China. \n Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters he planned to ask Duterte what his real intentions are when the two have dinner Tuesday. He said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will do the same on Wednesday. \n \"I think it would be important that we \u2026 directly hear opinions from President Duterte himself,\" Kishida said. \n The worries about Duterte were reinforced Tuesday when he lashed out again at the U.S. in a departure speech at the Manila airport. \n He called Americans \"foolish,\" saying their land is stricken with \"pure bigotry and discrimination,\" a day after senior American diplomat Daniel Russel criticized Duterte's controversial remarks and unclear intentions. \n \"These Americans are really foolish,\" Duterte said, adding Americans travel to the Philippines \"like somebody, without visas, these sillies.\" \n He also made a veiled threat to revoke a 2014 defense pact allowing large numbers of U.S. troops, warships and planes to enter the Philippines for combat drills. \n Referring to the pact, Duterte said, \"Forget it,\" adding that in the future, \"I do not want to see any military man of any other nation except the Philippine soldier.\" \n Duterte repeated similar comments during a packed reception at a Tokyo hotel, where he received an exuberant welcome by hundreds of Philippine residents in Japan shouting his name and holding up smartphones to photograph him. Duterte called the U.S. and the European Union \"foolish,\" according to Japan's NHK public television. \n In Japan, where formality and politeness are highly valued, some are worried about Duterte's rough side, particularly when he meets Emperor Akihito on Friday. \n Japanese TV shows have repeatedly shown Duterte apparently chewing gum at meetings and other public occasions. \n In footage of a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Duterte walked in with his hands in his pockets and chewed gum during the handshake and a signing ceremony. \n \"When he makes a courtesy visit to the emperor, his behavior could have a major impact,\" senior lawmaker Itsunori Onodera said Sunday on Fuji TV. \"I trust he understands the consequences and would not do such a thing (as chewing gum). I do hope the Philippine side will remind him of that particular point.\" \n Duterte often doesn't button the top button of his shirt, wears jeans and has been seen without socks. \n In Japan, where the emperor was considered a living god until the end of World War II, people are expected to be extra polite to him and his family. \n \"It's unbelievable. I have never seen anything like that!\" former diplomat Kunihiko Miyake said on Fuji TV. \"How could he dare to behave in ways that could cause his host to lose face.\" \n During his visit, Japan is expected to offer Manila two large Coast Guard patrol boats \u2014 on top of an earlier pledge of 10 smaller ones \u2014 and TC-90 military training aircraft to help boost the Philippine's maritime security in the South China Sea. \n Associated Press writer Jim Gomez contributed to this report from Manila, Philippines. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Japan wary of Philippine leader's visit"}

{"date": "October 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n An employee of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump grabbed his tie as they posed for photographs during an event at Trump National Doral, today, in Miami. \n DORAL, Florida \u00bb Hoping for a potent late-campaign issue against Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump declared today that \"Obamacare is just blowing up\" after the government projected sharp cost increases for President Barack Obama's health care program. \n Just two weeks before Election Day, the New York businessman addressed the health care development during an appearance at one of his Florida golf resorts that highlighted the extraordinary intersection of his business and political interests. His message in a state he described as a \"must-win,\" was somewhat scattershot, leaving questions of how well he and his party can capitalize on a revived emphasis on \"Obamacare.\" \n \"We're down in Florida. We're at Trump National Doral. And it's one of the great places on earth,\" Trump said during a visit to his golf club before encouraging his employees to praise him at the microphone. He suggested that many of his workers are having \"tremendous problems with Obamacare\" while highlighting a report that predicted premium increases of roughly 25 percent for the coming year. \n The Doral general manager later clarified that 95 percent of the club's employees are on company-provided insurance. \n Trump vowed anew to \"repeal and replace\" the president's signature health care overhaul. Clinton says she wants to keep the best of the program but make improvements. \n The Department of Health and Human Services reported Monday that premiums will go up sharply next year under the health care program, and many consumers will be down to just one choice for their insurer. Before taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less. \n The report gives some Republicans some new hope in the presidential contest's final days as Trump's path to the White House narrows. \n Clinton has yet to comment on the projected health care increases. She has previously promised to address health care cost increases and the declining insurance options if elected. \n On Monday, the Democratic nominee campaigned alongside New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, who is in a tight Senate race against Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte. The two Democrats got an assist from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was merciless as she seized on recent revelations of Trump's predatory sexual language and several allegations of sexual assault. \n \"He thinks that because he has a mouth full of Tic Tacs, he can force himself on any woman within groping distance,\" Warren charged. \"I've got news for you Donald: Women have had it with guys like you.\" \n Trump, in an interview with WGIR radio in New Hampshire, called the accusations \"total fiction.\" He lashed out at his latest accuser, former adult film performer Jessica Drake, who said Saturday that he had grabbed and kissed her without permission and offered her money to visit his hotel room a decade ago. \n \"One said, 'He grabbed me on the arm.' And she's a porn star,\" Trump said. He added, \"Oh, I'm sure she's never been grabbed before.\" \n Trump, who must win Florida to have any chance at the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, is appearing at three Florida campaign events today. Clinton, who can win the presidency with or without Florida, is making just one appearance, in the southern part of the state. \n \"I believe Florida's a must-win and I think we're winning it,\" Trump told Fox News today with most recent polls giving Clinton a slight lead. \n While they spar from a distance, hundreds of thousands of Floridians are voting. Today marks the second day of early in-person voting. Early voting by mail began two weeks ago. \n Nearly 300,000 Florida voters showed up for the first day of in-person early voting on Monday, new totals from state election officials showed. Altogether, more than 1.6 million Floridians have voted so far. \n Traditionally, Republicans have run up a large advantage in mail-in-ballots, while Democrats rely on early voting to boost their turnout numbers. But this year the parties are running nearly even. So far, slightly more than 665,000 Republican voters have cast ballots in the state, compared to slightly more than 658,000 Democrats. Another 300,000 voters with no party affiliation have also voted. \n At the same time, a new national poll shows young voters turning to Clinton now that the race has settled down to two main candidates. Clinton now leads among likely voters 18 to 30 years in age by 60 percent to 19 percent, according to a new GenForward survey. \n Young black voters already were solidly in her corner, and now young whites are moving her way, according to the survey by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. \n AP writer Gary Fineout in Tallahassee, Florida contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump hits hard at 'Obamacare' after gloomy report"}

The American Academy of Pediatrics announced new recommendations for safe infant sleeping on Monday. \n SAN FRANCISCO \u00bb The American Academy of Pediatrics is calling for infants to be kept in their parents' bedroom at night for six months to a year to reduce the risk of sleep-related death. \n The new recommendations say babies should sleep on a separate surface, in a crib or bassinet, and never on something soft. The guidelines say babies should sleep in the same room as their parents, preferably until they're a year old. The nation's most influential pediatricians' group says it updated its safe-sleep guidance because of studies suggesting that room-sharing reduces the risk of sudden infant death syndrome by as much as 50 percent. \n For two decades, the academy has advocated that babies be placed on their backs for sleeping to reduce risks of SIDS. Other recommendations include: avoiding bed-sharing; use of crib bumpers, blankets, pillows and soft toys; using pacifiers; and breastfeeding. But SIDS cases have plateaued at 3,500 unexplained deaths each year in the U.S., prompting the updated advice released Monday. \n Noting that SIDS' risks are highest in the first six months, the academy says room-sharing but not bed-sharing is most likely to prevent suffocation that can occur when infants sleep with their parents. \n \"Placing the crib close to the parents' bed so that the infant is within view and reach can facilitate feeding, comforting, and monitoring of the infant,\" the academy says. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pediatricians: Babies should sleep in same room as parents"}

{"date": "October 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Oct. 18 photo, Florida Democratic Congressional candidate Stephanie Murphy, center, meets with voters at a senior center in Altamonte Springs, Fla. \n ORLANDO, Fla. >> Clasping the $4,000 check that Orlando area real estate agents handed him, Rep. John Mica stood in the F&D Cantina restaurant and described his pathway to a 13th term in Congress. \n \"We've got to get everybody out to vote,\" the Florida Republican told supporters last week. \"Don't let it get caught up in any of the other races or issues.\" \n That seemed code for Donald Trump, whose flagging, insult-hurling GOP presidential run carries mixed blessings for Mica in his closely divided, freshly redrawn district. \n Mica, 73, says Trump's recorded comments about groping women were \"vulgar and unacceptable\" but still supports him. Yet in central Florida, a pivotal state in presidential and congressional elections, it's not just the polarizing Trump who's threatening Mica's political career, after few serious challenges before. \n In a classic battle of old school vs. new, Mica \u2014 known for bringing federal transportation dollars back home \u2014 faces Democrat Stephanie Murphy, a political newcomer at 38. Her backstory includes her family's harrowing seaborne escape from Vietnam as an infant, degrees from William & Mary and Georgetown University, positions in the Pentagon and the worlds of finance and academia. She even holds a patent for women's softball pants made by a company her husband runs. \n Mica and Murphy live blocks apart in Winter Park but say they'd never met until this campaign. Now, they're vying for one of many suburban districts that Democrats must win to achieve what seemed unthinkable until recently \u2014 House control. \n With only several dozen of the House's 435 seats competitive, Democrats need a daunting 30-seat gain to take over. But with Trump sputtering in the polls and Election Day barely two weeks off, Democrats say and Republicans fear he'll take some congressional Republicans down with him. \n \"I think we'll be within single digits either way,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said last week. \n President Barack Obama endorsed 30 House Democratic candidates today, mostly challengers and including Murphy, as his party sought to use his popularity to gain and hold competitive seats. \n Republicans expect to lose seats, and some say privately it's possible but unlikely that Trump will cost them their House majority. Some fault GOP incumbents like Mica for failing to react to the hostile political environment by raising more money and defining their opponents early. \n While Republicans are pursuing Democratic seats in California, Florida, Minnesota, Nebraska and New York, most GOP money is focused on protecting vulnerable incumbents. The Congressional Leadership Fund and American Action Network recently announced plans to defend 15 Republican districts from coast to coast, and there are new ads in 11 Republican districts by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP's political organization. \n Democrats buoyed by Hillary Clinton's rising prospects are pouring money into Republican-held districts, including some around New York City, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and even in some GOP-leaning states. \n The House Majority PAC, which helps Democrats, is spending in a vacant Republican-held district in southern Indiana and reserved $451,000 in TV advertising time against Montana's at-large freshman GOP Rep. Ryan Zinke. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, House Democrats' campaign arm, plans to spend $1 million to try ousting a Republican in Kansas City's Kansas suburbs. \n In Orlando, Mica has raised nearly double Murphy's take. But Democratic groups have spent $1.6 million to help her and plan an additional $2.5 million \u2014 compared with virtually nothing yet backing Mica from the GOP side. \n One Republican said the NRCC plans to start spending for Mica soon. Still, the discrepancy in outside spending has been striking. Mica said he'd told the committee to stay out unless he needs it. \n \"Right now, my ship is still afloat,\" he said. \n Mica has huge name recognition advantage over the little-known Murphy. As former House transportation committee chairman, he's credited for guiding money home to improve Interstate 4 and the region's airport and commuter rail system. \n Making her first run for public office, Murphy seemed slightly uneasy addressing the elderly and veterans at a senior center in Altamonte Springs. She attacked Mica for not fully disavowing Trump, cautiously answered a question about the federal gasoline tax and got her biggest applause for embracing a bill blocking lawmakers' salaries if no budget is passed. \n Her TV ad this month links Mica to a yelling, gesticulating Trump and says they \"share the same harmful policies\" on women's health and guns. \n Murphy considers firearms a major concern. Just outside the district is Orlando's Pulse nightclub, where a gunman killed 49 people in June, and it now includes Sanford, where unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin was fatally shot in 2012. \n Asked if gun control is an issue, Mica gestured at the crowd attending a barbecue benefit for student scholarships at a vast Harley-Davidson dealership in Sanford and said: \"Talk to these people. I don't think so.\" \n Court-ordered redistricting has left roughly 4 in 10 voters in the district new to Mica, including slightly more Democrats, younger voters from downtown Orlando and Hispanics and blacks. It's now around 30 percent minority. \n \"He's productive,\" said Tim Whitefield, 55, a Lake Mary banker. \"But if this election is about 'throw the bums out,' he could be gone.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Democrats, GOP think Trump could cost GOP House seats"}

{"date": "October 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama speaks about the Affordable Care Act, Thursday, at Miami Dade College in Miami. \n MIAMI \u00bb Something is missing from President Barack Obama's list. \n \"Progress is on the ballot,\" he said at a campaign rally here last week. \"Tolerance is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Equality is on the ballot. Our democracy is on the ballot!\" \n It's not as if Obama forgot that Hillary Clinton, the nominee he is campaigning for, is also on the ballot. It's just that the election is about so much more for the outgoing head of state. \n More than for most presidents, Obama's legacy rests in the hands of whoever follows him in office: Clinton, whose platform builds on his record, or Donald Trump, who has vowed to rescind many of Obama's actions. Thus, Obama is stumping more aggressively for a successor than any president has in modern U.S. history, claiming an unprecedented platform to extol his years in the White House. \n He has revived his considerable campaigning skills to sell both Clinton and his own record with the feel of a man on a victory lap, vindicated by his increasing popularity and what he sees as a mission to truth-squad the GOP message of the last eight years. \n One of Obama's main campaign tasks has been to tie Republicans to their nominee, who has been reluctantly embraced by some in his party, outright shunned by others over his divisive candidacy. \n Obama has appeared to relish explaining his view that Republicans helped give Trump his opening by their consistent opposition to the president and sitting on the sidelines while Trump amplified the lie about where Obama was born. \n Obama mocked Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's contortions this year, when Rubio went from a GOP primary opponent who tried to bait Trump by making implications about the size of his genitals to a supporter of Trump once he secured the party's presidential nomination. \n \"Republican politicians and far-right media outlets had just been pumping out all kinds of toxic, crazy stuff,\" Obama said last week in Miami, barely keeping his voice from cracking into laughter. \"And there were a lot of politicians, like Marco Rubio, who know better, but they just looked the other way.\" \n Trump, he said, \"didn't come out of nowhere.\" \n He wailed with similarly obvious glee against Rep. Joe Heck of Nevada, a Republican running for Senate, saying in North Las Vegas on Sunday that now that Trump's poll numbers have \"cratered,\" Heck is distancing himself. \n \"Too late!\" Obama said. \"You don't get credit for that.\" \n Obama, largely sidelined in the 2014 elections by wary Democrats, is starting to exhibit some of the spark of his historic 2008 campaign. Aides say he frequently asks for data from the field and talks about races down the ballot. \n He recorded TV or radio ads for three Democrats running for governor, eight for Senate and 10 for the House. He attended 21 fundraisers for Democratic congressional and governors committees and five for individual candidates. He weighed in on behalf of 150 Democrats running for state legislatures. \n \"Obama's vigorous campaigning for Hillary Clinton is a new dimension of the modern presidency,\" said Robert Schmuhl, professor of American studies and journalism at the University of Notre Dame. \"What Obama is doing this fall makes him stand out from his predecessors in a vivid and distinctive way. He's using his approval ratings and campaign skills to create what he hopes will be a new kind of coattails.\" \n This week alone, Obama is campaigning at least four days. After the stop in Las Vegas, he headed to California to raise funds Monday outside San Diego and Tuesday in Los Angeles, and he will rally for Clinton on Friday in Orlando, Fla. \n And he resurrected an old character from his 2008 stump speech: Cousin Pookie, the lazy fictional relative who hasn't gotten off the couch to vote in several elections. \n \"Don't boo. Vote!\" he told the crowd in Miami. \"And get your friends to vote! Get Uncle Joe to vote! Get Pookie to vote! And Javier to vote!\" \u2014 the last part a twist added for 2016, in which Latino voters, expected to make up 12 percent of the electorate, are more crucial to Democratic turnout than ever. \n The energetic schedule isn't without its drawbacks. Republicans question the time the president is devoting to raising money for and pitching his candidate. They have used his involvement in the race as a lever for fundraising; Rubio fired off an email seeking donations while Obama was still in Miami. \n And Trump has begun to complain during his campaign appearances that he is looking around for the commander in chief. \n \"I'd like to see him in the White House working instead of campaigning for 'Crooked Hillary,' \" Trump said at a rally Monday in St. Augustine, Fla. \n Obama welds policy into his time on the trail, as when he prefaced the rally here with an hourlong discourse on health care policy at Miami Dade College. \n Where there are imperfections, Obama blames Republicans. They didn't want health care reform, wouldn't engage with him on it, he explained to students. A total of 19 GOP governors have refused to cooperate with an expansion of Medicaid that the White House says would cover 4 million people. \n Anthony Ordonez, a Miami Dade College sophomore voting in his first election, has reservations about Obama's use of drone strikes in the Middle East. But he thinks history will smile on Obama's record on domestic policy. \n \"He's right. Obamacare did help a lot of people,\" said Ordonez, an honors student studying mechanical and aerospace engineering. \"As I look back on what he has done, the record speaks for itself. He has done a good job.\" \n Obama's legacy \u2014 on health care, climate and other progressive priorities \u2014 is at the heart of Democrats' case. \n \"I ran,\" Clinton said in Seattle recently, \"because I really believe that we need to build on the progress that we have made under President Obama.\" \n At a fundraising brunch near San Diego on Monday, Obama emphasized the importance of a big Clinton win to preserve and advance the gains of his administration. He challenged the GOP's latest argument, which acknowledges a possible Trump loss, that people should vote Republican as \"a check\" against a Clinton presidency. \n \"Let me just translate that for you,\" Obama said, labeling it as simply code for more of the obstructionism Republicans erected against his agenda. \n \"They're counting on people thinking that gridlock is the best we can do, because that plays to their basic philosophy\" that government has no role in helping people, he said. \"They're OK with gridlock. But you know what? We can do so much better than that.\" \n ", "author": "By Tribune News Service", "title": "Obama's campaign: Protect legacy, pummel GOP; Oh, and elect Hillary Clinton"}
