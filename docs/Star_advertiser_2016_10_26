{"date": "October 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Director Mel Gibson, center, interviews Desmond Doss Jr., the son of Congressional Medal of Honor recipient Desmond Doss, at a screening of the movie \"Hacksaw Ridge\" at The National WWII Museum, in New Orleans, Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016. The film depicts the life of conscientious objector and Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, Desmond Doss. \n NEW ORLEANS >> When Desmond Doss climbed up Hacksaw Ridge \u2014 a 400-foot high escarpment on the island of Okinawa with a wall of dug in Japanese soldiers at the top \u2014 he carried his Bible, his combat medic supplies and the weight of his moral convictions but no weapon. \n When the wounded American Army private eventually came back down for good, he was credited with repeatedly braving harsh enemy fire to treat fellow troops, carry them to the cliff's edge and lower them to safety. For his heroics, he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor \u2014 a rarity for a conscientious objector. \n Now his exploits on Okinawa and his struggles to serve both his country and his conscience have been made into a film, \"Hacksaw Ridge,\" directed by Mel Gibson. For Gibson, telling the story of a man whose Medal of Honor citation goes on for two full pages and includes a wounded Doss giving up his stretcher to another wounded man, the challenge was almost having too heroic of a story to work with. \n \"You couldn't even tell everything the guy did because it becomes almost unbelievable,\" said Gibson, speaking Wednesday before a screening at The National WWII Museum in New Orleans. \"You're talking about a man here who really stuck by his conviction and his faith and he went into a situation like hell on earth, an ordinary guy doing extraordinary things.\" \n Doss, a Seventh-day Adventist, felt his beliefs barred him from even carrying a weapon, let alone killing. But he wanted to serve his country and ended up in a combat infantry unit, tending to the wounded under some of the war's most dangerous conditions. The movie details how his fellow troops \u2014 initially extremely suspicious of Doss \u2014 came to admire his moral and physical courage. \n In Europe, the war with Germany was all but over when Doss's unit arrived on Okinawa in late April. But in the Pacific, it was a bloody slog against the Japanese to capture island after island. \n His unit was trying to take Hacksaw Ridge \u2014 formally called the Maeda Escarpment \u2014 and push out dug in Japanese troops. Doss's Medal of Honor citation describes how his unit was driven back down the cliff by a barrage of mortar, artillery and machine gun fire but Doss voluntarily stayed behind, evacuating the wounded by rope over the cliff, all under intense enemy fire. \n While the movie focuses mostly on that one event where Doss is credited with rescuing 75, the citation notes how he repeatedly risked his life until he was wounded nearly a month later. \n For Gibson, another challenge was making the movie realistic without being ghoulish. \n Referring to the audience, he said: \"I don't want them running out screaming. You want them to stay in there with you so you have to find a way to temper it, but keep it real.\" \n The title character of Desmond Doss is played by Andrew Garfield. Vince Vaughn plays the tough Sgt. Howell tasked with bringing the new recruits up to snuff and leading them into battle. As Gibson puts it: \"This is not 'Wedding Crashers Vince.' This is 'Sgt. Howell Vince.' Different man, tougher.\" \n \"It was nice to really just be in a movie that's about something,\" Vaughn said. \"You don't really get those a lot. I've made some really fun movies but it was definitely great for me to get a chance to work with such a great story teller as Mel and then also have a purpose behind the movie that's actually about people and something that's inspiring.\" \n Vaughn said they screened the movie for some veterans who found it \"very cathartic\" and praised it for bringing awareness to post-traumatic stress disorder through the character of Doss's father, playing by Hugo Weaving. Weaving's character is a troubled, heavy-drinking World War I vet who frequently visits the graves of men he served with in France. \n Doss's son, Desmond Doss Jr., was in New Orleans for the movie screening. Growing up he said he heard his father's story hundreds of times as the elder Doss, who died in 2006, went to various functions and shared his story. The younger Doss said his father \u2014 like many others who perform heroic feats \u2014 often said he was just doing his job. But the son said his father also felt it was for the glory of his God and he needed to share his story. \n For Doss Jr., the movie is an \"incredible love story\" wrapped in carnage. \n \"It's about a man that loved his mother. He loved his church. He loved his wife. He loved the men that he worked with even when they often times didn't much care for him. He never wavered in coming from this place of compassion, love and forgiveness,\" he said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Santana on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ruskygal . \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Armed with faith: Movie shows WWII exploits of unarmed medic"}

After struggling with joblessness because of his lack of immigration papers, homelessness and crime, Crapser, a South Korean man who was flown to the U.S. 37 years ago and adopted by an American couple at age 3 has been ordered deported back to a country that is completely alien to him, Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016. \n SALEM, Ore. >> A South Korean man flown to the U.S. 37 years ago and adopted by an American couple at age 3 has been ordered deported back to a country that is completely alien to him. \n \"It is heartbreaking news,\" said Dae Joong (DJ) Yoon, executive director of the National Korean American Service & Education Consortium, who had been in contact with Adam Crapser. \n Crapser remains confined in an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Washington, pending his deportation. \n Crapser waived an appeal during the hearing Monday because he is desperate to get out of detention, his Seattle attorney, Lori Walls, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \n \"I'm sure he doesn't have any idea what he can do in Korea,\" Yoon said in a phone interview from his group's offices in Annandale, Va. \n Crapser's plight mirrors those of thousands of others. Yoon's group says an estimated 35,000 intercountry adoptees lack U. S. citizenship. It is backing legislation in Congress to address that. \n Seven years after Crapser and his older sister were adopted, their parents abandoned them. The foster care system separated Crapser when he was 10 from his sister. \n He was housed at several foster and group homes. When Crapser was 12, he moved in with Thomas and Dolly Crapser, their biological son, two other adoptees and several foster children. \n There, he was physically abused, Crapser has said. In 1991, the couple was arrested on charges of physical child abuse, sexual abuse and rape. They denied the charges. Thomas Crapser's sentence included 90 days in jail, and Dolly Crasper's included three years of probation. \n Adam Crapser got into trouble with the law after he broke into his parents' home \u2014 it was, he said, to retrieve the Korean Bible and rubber shoes that came with him from the orphanage \u2014 and later it was for stealing cars and assaulting a roommate. \n Federal immigration officials say they became aware of Crapser after he applied for a green card. His criminal convictions made him deportable. \n Becky Belcore, who was adopted at age 1 and brought to the United States from South Korea, said she was with Crapser in the courtroom, located inside the detention center. She said the facility seems worse than jail because visitors cannot touch or hug detainees and must talk to them on a telephone. \n \"He has been in detention for almost nine months,\" Belcore said in a phone interview from her home in Chicago. \"He's been separated from his children. It is really hard for him.\" Walls said Crapser is married and has four children. \n Belcore said Crapser was wearing what looked like hospital scrubs, the uniform for detainees, and that Immigration Judge John C. O'Dell appeared matter-of-fact as he announced his deportation verdict. \n In an email, Walls said Adam was eligible for a deportation reprieve called \"cancellation of removal,\" but the \"judge decided he did not deserve this relief.\" \n \"He will be deported as soon as Immigration and Customs Enforcement makes the necessary arrangements,\" Walls said. \"Adam, his family, and advocates are heartbroken at the outcome.\" \n Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman with the Executive Office for Immigration Review of the U.S. Department of Justice, said in an email that she could not provide confirmation or details of the hearing without an alien registration number for Crapser and possibly a privacy waiver. Walls said she would seek permission from Crapser later to provide that information. \n Belcore said she feels lucky that her adoptive parents obtained her U.S. citizenship. \n \"A lot of times, parents simply didn't know that they were supposed to do it,\" she said. \n \"It seems so wrong and so inhumane\" for Crapser to be sent to South Korea, Belcore said. \"Without knowing the language and the culture, it will be so difficult to survive.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Adopted and brought to U.S., South Korean man to be deported"}

It said per capita consumption of seafood grew from 14.6 pounds in 2014 to 15.5 pounds in 2015. \n The growth brought per capita consumption of seafood to its highest point since 2010, and it's also the biggest jump of its kind in at least 25 years. \n The jump corresponds with a rise in catch, NOAA said. Fishermen brought 9.7 billion pounds of fish and shellfish ashore in 2015, an increase of 2.4 percent from 2014.

Ninety percent of them started taking preventive medicines after finding out. \n Researchers say the two-generation benefits may convince more parents to agree to cholesterol testing for their kids. An expert panel in the United States recommends this test between the ages of 9 and 11, but many aren't tested now unless they are obese or have other heart risk factors such as diabetes or high blood pressure. \n For every 1,000 people screened in the study , four children and four parents were identified as being at risk for early heart disease. That's nearly twice as many as most studies in the past have suggested. \n \"We really need to pay attention to this,\" said Dr. Elaine Urbina, director of preventive cardiology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and a member of the U.S. expert panel. \"It's reasonable to screen for something that's common, dangerous and has a treatment that's effective and safe.\" \n Dr. William Cooper, a pediatrics and preventive medicine professor at Vanderbilt University, called it \"an innovative approach\" that finds not just kids at risk but also parents while they're still young enough to benefit from preventive treatment, such as cholesterol-lowering statin drugs. \n Statins aren't recommended until around age 10, but certain dietary supplements such as plant sterols and stanols could help younger kids, Urbina said. \n \"We're not talking about putting all these kids on statins,\" she said. \n The study was led by Dr. David Wald at Queen Mary University of London. He and another author founded a company that makes a combination pill to prevent heart disease. The work was funded by the Medical Research Council, the British government's health research agency. Results were published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine. \n Researchers were testing for familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder that, untreated, raises the risk of a heart attack by age 40 tenfold. \n They did a heel-stick blood test on 10,059 children ages 1 to 2 during routine immunization visits to check for high cholesterol and 48 gene mutations that can cause the disorder.

In the U.S., cholesterol tests cost around $80 and usually are covered by health insurance, though much lower prices often are negotiated.

{"date": "October 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Protesters stood in solidarity with rape victims on April 20 on the campus of Brigham Young University during a sexual assault awareness demonstration, in Provo, Utah. BYU announced today that students who report sexual assault will no longer be investigated for possible violations of the Mormon-owned school's strict honor code that bans such things as alcohol use. \n SALT LAKE CITY \u00bb Students at Brigham Young University who report sexual assault will no longer be investigated for possible violations of the strict honor code that bans drinking and premarital sex, the Mormon-owned school announced today in a major reversal to a practice that drew widespread scrutiny. \n The college accepted several recommendations made by a faculty council that reviewed how sexual assault cases are handled. The inquiry began in May after female students and alumni spoke out against the school opening honor code investigations of students who report abuses. \n Victims advocates said the practice discourages reporting of sexual violence, which is already underreported on campuses nationwide. \n Two former BYU students who went public with their experiences said they are mostly pleased with the upcoming changes at the school, where students must agree to an honor code forbidding premarital sex, drug use and drinking. \n \"By having an amnesty clause, we hopefully will let them know that they should not hold any self-blame, that we are here to provide help to them,\" said Julie Valentine, a nursing professor who was on the council issuing the recommendations. \"It also helps educate the whole community and the campus that we can't have victim blaming, that we need to reach out and offer support.\" \n The school remains under investigation by federal and state officials. \n U.S. education officials are looking at how BYU handles sexual assault reports. Utah's Department of Public Safety, meanwhile, is investigating whether university police officers inappropriately shared information on sexual assault cases with the honor code office. \n The faculty council didn't look into the police allegations but found that the federal Title IX office on campus sometimes shared victims' names and details of their assaults with the honor code office after the investigations were complete, Valentine said. \n The only information that can be shared now is about a perpetrator who is found to be guilty of sexual assault, she said. In those cases, the victim's name will be redacted so only the suspect faces honor code discipline. \n The school also will hire a victim advocate to provide confidential counseling for victims who want to discuss their options, Valentine said. Students previously were given a handout explaining their options but didn't have somebody to talk to, she said. \n The school will replace a part-time Title IX coordinator with a full-time coordinator. The Title IX office will be moved to a different area of campus far from the honor code office. \n Students were informed of the findings and changes today in an email from BYU President Keven Worthen, Valentine said. \n Madeline MacDonald, 20, came forward after she said she was investigated by the honor code office following her report of being sexually assaulted on a 2014 date. Though she was cleared, the two-month review made her feel like a target rather than a victim. \n \"Within the bounds of how BYU already works, they've made a lot of amazing changes,\" MacDonald said about the school's recommendations. \"But we're not done.\" \n The report on the investigation's findings didn't address the way Mormon bishops handle students telling them about sexual assault. MacDonald said that's a key issue because bishops determine whether students are in good standing with the faith and therefore the university. \n The report acknowledges that students said they had \"varied\" experiences reporting sexual assaults to local church leaders. It says the university doesn't control that but will share the concerns with church officials. \n Madi Barney, another former student who spoke out, said in a statement that she's encouraged but hopes BYU ensures the changes are implemented and provides a way for students to lodge complaints. \n Barney said she was sexually assaulted and then told that she faced an honor code investigation after she reported it to police. \n \"Treating sexual assault like the heinous crime it is, and treating its victims with respect, is something that BYU should take very seriously \u2014 and it looks like they currently are,\" Barney said. \n The Associated Press doesn't normally identify victims of sex crimes, but Barney and MacDonald say they want their names to be used to change policy. \n Valentine said the decision for victims to come forward \"put everything in a pressure cooker\" and triggered an important discussion that led to the changes. \n \"Our hearts go out to all of these victims.

Two weeks ago, she gave birth to a boy, joining the ranks of the rising number of Asian women who give birth to children in the United States. \n Asian immigrant women are increasingly accounting for a larger share of foreign mothers who give birth to children in the U.S., signaling a changing landscape of immigrants in America as Asians continue to outpace Latinos in growth. \n The Pew Research Center released new data Wednesday showing that Asian immigrants account for 22 percent of U.S. births by foreign women, up from 16 percent in 2010. \n La Chica, who is 30, said she came to the United States, first San Francisco and later Hawaii, to experience living here. Her mother lives in California and helped her get permanent legal residency; La Chica is now an American citizen. \n \"I'm planning on raising and living and working here. We now own a house,\" La Chica said. \"I think Hawaii is a perfect place to raise a family.\" \n Meanwhile, fewer Latin American immigrants are having babies in the U.S. The study found the share of births from foreign-born mothers from Latin America dropped from 64 percent of foreign mothers in 2008 to 54 percent in 2014. About 7 percent of all births in the U.S. are from immigrants lacking legal status. \n The report also found that immigrants are the driving force behind births in the U.S. The number of American women who gave birth in 2014 has dropped 11 percent since 1970, while immigrant women have tripled the number of births they gave. \n The report comes amid a heated presidential election in which Republican nominee Donald Trump has garnered support \u2014 and drawn ire \u2014 by claiming he will build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and by expressing largely anti-immigrant sentiment. \n But demographers say immigrants are key to growth in the U.S. Fewer American women are having children, while immigrant women have disproportionately high birth rates compared to their U.S.-born counterparts. Women from sub-Saharan Africa have the highest annual fertility, with 106.4 births per 1,000 women, according to the Pew study. The rate for Latin American women is 80.6 per 1,000, accounting for over half of births to immigrant mothers in the U.S. \n \"We in the United States have been and are going to be dependent on immigrants and the children of immigrants in the growth of our population,\" said William Frey, a senior fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \"I think this adds to that in that the immigrant population of women is helping move that along.\" \n Frey says that if it weren't for immigrants, the country's birth rate would be much lower, which could result in future problems as the current population ages. \n Demographers say a low birth rate can result in a deficit in the labor force and strained social security and social welfare programs, among other economic problems. \n The report details a changing makeup of immigrants in the United States, even if Latina immigrants still have far more children than any other foreign-born mothers. \n A Pew study last month found that U.S. Hispanic population growth has slowed considerably while the Asian-American population grows. Another report last year found that for the first time, more Mexicans are leaving the U.S. than coming in, and migrants from Central American countries like Honduras and El Salvador account for a higher share of new immigrants from Latin America. \n \"The American immigrant population has changed throughout our history and it's changing again,\" said Kenneth M. Johnson, a senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire's Carsey School of Public Policy. \"This is just part of the continuing story of America.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Study: Asian immigrants to U.S. giving birth at higher rates"}

{"date": "October 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A Tesla Model S on display in downtown Los Angeles. Tesla Motors reports financial results Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016. \n DETROIT >> Electric car maker Tesla Motors posted its first quarterly profit in three years on Wednesday, giving investors reason to cheer after months of doubt. \n Tesla's shares have fallen since the summer as some investors questioned the company's proposed merger with solar panel maker SolarCity Corp. Goldman Sachs recently downgraded Tesla's shares from \"buy\" to \"neutral\" and lowered its price target, saying the potential merger could delay the release of Tesla's much-anticipated Model 3. \n But Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a letter to investors that the third quarter showed Tesla could meet its goals while keeping one eye on opportunities for future growth. \n Musk also reiterated that Tesla shouldn't need to raise cash to support the Model 3, and doesn't expect a capital raise through the first quarter of next year. There had been some questions about the company's ability to proceed without raising more money, but Tesla ended the quarter with positive free cash flow of $176 million. \n \"Things are looking good,\" Musk said in a conference call with analysts and media. \"It's not to say there could be some darkness ahead\u2026 (but) it's overall looking quite promising.\" \n Tesla reported net income of $21.9 million, or 14 cents per share, up from a loss of $229.9 million in last year's July-September period. \n Revenue more than doubled to $2.3 billion. That included $149.7 million in non-automotive revenue \u2014 up 78 percent from last year \u2014 in part because of growth in Tesla's energy-storage business. \n Tesla, which went public in 2010, has had only one other profitable quarter: the first quarter of 2013. But the company said it expects to report net income in the fourth quarter of this year. \n The results surprised Wall Street, which forecast a loss of 86 cents, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Analysts had expected revenue of $2.2 billion. \n Tesla's shares rose 4.5 percent to $211.33 in after-hours trading. \n Tesla delivered 24,821 vehicles during the quarter, an increase of 72 percent over the same period last year. The Palo Alto, California-based company said Wednesday it still expects to deliver just under 80,000 vehicles worldwide this year, up from 50,500 in 2015. \n Tesla said it also remains on track to start deliveries of its $35,000 Model 3 electric car in the second half of 2017. Musk wouldn't give an update on the number of reservation holders the company has for the Model 3. In May, the company said 373,000 people had put down $1,000 deposits for the car. \n Tesla could still face some challenges in the near future. The company raked in $138.5 million in the third quarter by selling zero-emission vehicle credits to other automakers, but it said revenue from such credits will be \"negligible\" in the fourth quarter. \n There are also questions about the integration of SolarCity, which lost $55.5 million in the second quarter. \n Musk, who is also SolarCity's chairman, proposed in June that Tesla buy SolarCity in an all-stock offer now worth around $2.45 billion. Shareholders of both companies will vote on the proposal on Nov. 17. \n Musk said he thinks SolarCity would be neutral or \"perhaps a cash contributor\" in the fourth quarter if the merger were approved. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tesla Motors surprises with 3rd-quarter profit"}

Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda told reporters that their alliances with the U.S. were recognized, though not in writing. \n Duterete, in his second round of talks only among close aides, reassured Abe that he has no intention to sever diplomatic ties with the U.S., Hagiuda said. \n Since Duterte took office in June, Manila's relationship with Washington has quickly become strained. \n Japan is a staunch U.S. ally and hosts 50,000 American troops, while Duterte has repeatedly spoken of distancing his country from Washington, often in crude terms. \n The presence of U.S. troops in five Philippine military camps was established under a security deal signed under Duterte's predecessor as a counter to China's growing military assertiveness in the region. \n Earlier Wednesday, Duterte said that he wants his country to be free of foreign troops, possibly within two years. \"I want them out,\" he said. \n \"I want to be friends to China,\" he told an audience of businesspeople in Tokyo. \"I do not need the arms. I do not want missiles established in my country. I do not need to have the airports to host the bombers.\" \n As president, Duterte has reached out to Beijing while criticizing U.S. foreign policy. His approach has caused consternation in both the U.S. and Japan. \n Still, Abe welcomed Duterte's recent efforts to improve ties with China. \n \"The South China Sea issue is directly linked to the region's peace and stability and a matter of interest for the entire international society,\" he said. \"In that regard, Japan welcomes the effort of President Duterte visiting China and endeavoring to improve the Philippine-China relations.\" \n Officials declined to provide details of their second round of talks, in which Abe was expected to ask Duterte specifically about his foreign policy. Their joint statement focused largely on Japan's contribution to Philippine maritime security and other projects totaling a 21 billion yen ($210 million) loan. \n The Philippine leader spoke about the U.S. at the end of his prepared remarks on economic development and investment, saying he was addressing what he knows is \"what is in everybody's mind.\" \n \"I may have ruffled the feelings of some, but that is how it is,\" he said. \"We will survive, without the assistance of America, maybe a lesser quality of life, but as I said, we will survive.\" \n Duterte has announced canceling planned joint military exercises with the United States, and preparatory meetings for next year's joint combat exercises between American and Filipino forces in the Philippines have been shrouded in uncertainty. \n Explaining his policy, Philippine Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay, also in Tokyo, said Duterte respects all bilateral security agreements with the U.S. and that he has no intention to renege or breach them, but the exercises are not helpful in fostering Manila's friendly relations with Beijing. \n \"It is in this context that we will not be undertaking (them) during (Duterte's) administration especially so that we are trying to resolve this disputes with China in a peaceful manner,\" Yasay told a separate news conference. \n On Wednesday, Japan and the Philippines signed agreements including Japan's provision of two coast guard boats and T-90 military trainer aircraft as part of its contribution to step up Philippine maritime security capability. Japan also agreed to support infrastructure and agricultural promotion projects in the Philippines to help economic development. \n \"Japan will continue to play an important role in modernizing the capabilities of the Philippines\" in maritime security, Duterte said. \"The Philippines will continue to work closely with Japan on issues of common concern in the region \u2026 and the peaceful settlements of disputes including the South China Sea.\" \n Duterte is on a three-day visit to Japan. After two rounds of talks with Abe, he is attending a banquet hosted by the Japanese leader. On Thursday, he is set to meet Emperor Akihito. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philippine leader affirms U.S. alliance but wants troops out"}

NATO defense ministers met in Brussels to discuss tense relations with Russia, how to help Middle East nations combat extremism and cooperation between the military alliance and the European Union. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Facing a public outcry, Defense Secretary Ash Carter today ordered the Pentagon to suspend its effort to seek repayments of enlistment bonuses given to thousands of California National Guard members who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n Carter's decision comes in the wake of angry reaction from congressional Republicans and Democrats who demanded he relieve the burden on Guard members following news reports that soldiers were being asked to repay debts that in some cases totaled more than $25,000. The announcement doesn't end the reimbursement process, but postpones collection efforts while the Pentagon and Congress look for a long-term solution. \n White House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama was pleased with the decision, but said it was important for the Pentagon \"to follow through\" by finding a long-term solution. Obama had warned the Defense Department earlier this week not to \"nickel and dime\" service members who were victims of wrongdoing by overzealous recruiters. \n In a statement issued during a meeting of defense ministers in Brussels, Carter said efforts to collect reimbursement from Guard members should stop \"as soon as is practical.\" Carter said he has ordered the department to set up a streamlined process by Jan. 1 to help troops get relief from the repayment obligation, because the current program has moved too slowly. \n \"This process has dragged on too long, for too many service members,\" he said. \"Too many cases have languished without action. That's unfair to service members and to taxpayers.\" \n The Los Angeles Times reported over the weekend that the Pentagon demanded that thousands of soldiers repay their enlistment bonuses after audits revealed overpayments by the California National Guard. Recruiters under pressure to fill ranks and hit enlistment goals at the height of the two wars improperly offered bonuses of $15,000 or more to soldiers who re-enlisted. \n If soldiers refuse to pay the bonus back, they could face interest charges, wage garnishments and tax liens. \n \"While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not,\" Carter said, adding that the new process will put \"as little burden as possible on any soldier who received an improper payment through no fault of his or her own. At the same time, it will respect our important obligation to the taxpayer.\" \n The Pentagon hopes to complete all cases by next July 1. As many as 6,500 California National Guard soldiers have been asked to repay the enlistment bonuses. \n \"I'm glad the Pentagon came to its senses,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who had pressed the Pentagon to suspend the program. \n House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., also welcomed the development, saying he spoke with Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work Tuesday night and told him that veterans \"have already given more than what they owe to this nation. Today's swift action demonstrates that the department agrees.\" \n McCarthy said he will work with other members of Congress to provide a legislative solution so the repayment issue does not recur. McCarthy planned to host a bipartisan conference call with Work today night to discuss the issue. \n Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, called Carter's announcement a \"good step\" but \"long overdue and far from enough.\" \n Thousands of veterans have seen their lives \"turned upside down\" and are \"now in financial ruin through no fault of their own,\" Rieckhoff said. \n \"The Pentagon needs to do more than just halt\" the collection efforts from soldiers, Rieckhoff said: It needs to repay those who already have reimbursed the government. The California Guard said Tuesday it has collected about $22 million from fewer than 2,000 soldiers who improperly received bonuses and student loan aid. \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., welcomed the Pentagon announcement, but said lawmakers need to find a permanent solution. \n \"The heroes who served our country in uniform deserve every bonus and benefit they received in good faith,\" she said. \"We all must work together to swiftly address this situation and monitor any additional issues that come up in California and other states.\" \n AP National Security Writer Robert Burns in Washington contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pentagon chief suspends National Guard bonus repayments"}
