{"date": "October 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n New fundraising reports show Hillary Clinton's campaign and joint accounts with Democrats had $153 million in the bank as of last week. \n WASHINGTON >> Hillary Clinton entered the final phase of her presidential bid with a resounding campaign cash advantage over Donald Trump. \n New fundraising reports show her campaign and joint accounts with Democrats had $153 million in the bank as of last week. That's more than double the $68 million Trump's campaign and partnership committees had on hand. \n Clinton's continued fundraising advantage helps ensure the Democratic nominee can keep her sprawling political operation at full strength in the frantic final days of the race. She maintains a staff of more than 800 \u2014 several times larger than Trump's \u2014 and has spent more on advertising than the Republican has every single week of the race. \n Over the course of the primary and general elections, Clinton's campaign has hauled in $513 million, roughly double what Trump's has. \n She outpaced him again in the first 19 days of October, the new reports show, when her campaign reaped $53 million as his brought in about $30 million. \n While Trump, a New York businessman who says he is worth $10 billion, typically makes a personal contribution of about $2 million each month, he had not done so yet in October. The latest contribution reports, up to date as of Wednesday, show he had given only about $33,000. \n The candidates and many outside groups involved in the presidential race are filing their final pre-election fundraising reports on Thursday. The filings cover the first 19 days of the month. \n Outside groups backing Clinton are better funded than those supporting Trump, the reports show. Super PACS can take unlimited contributions from wealthy donors, but they may not coordinate with the campaigns. \n The pro-Clinton Priorities USA raised $18 million in 19 days. Some of its biggest most recent donors include Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Susan Mandel, the wife of a hedge fund founder, who each put in $2.5 million this month. \n Priorities USA has been spending most of its money on TV ads. It plans to spend $21 million on ads this week and next, according to Kantar Media's political ad tracker. \n Rebuilding America Now, one of several pro-Trump groups, raised only about $215,000 through the early part of this month. As of last week, the super PAC only had about $1.2 million in cash on hand. Another, Great America PAC, raised $2 million and had about as much left to spend. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton runs up campaign cash advantage over Trump"}

He had told the media that he was fighting illegal drugs himself and supported Duterte's crackdown. \n At dawn Friday, Dimaukom and the nine others were killed they opened fire from three cars on officers at a checkpoint in Makilala town in North Cotabato province, Superintendent Bernard Tayong said. \n \"It was a legitimate anti-drug operation but the subjects opened fire on our troops,\" regional police official Superintendent Romeo Galgo Jr. told reporters. \n Police said they had received information that Dimaukom's group was planning to transport a \"huge\" amount of methamphetamine \u2014 a prohibited and extremely addictive stimulant drug locally known as shabu \u2014 from Davao city, Duterte's hometown, to Datu Saudi Ampatuan town. \n Police estimate more than 3,600 suspected drug dealers and addicts have been killed since Duterte took office on June 30. The crackdown has drawn international concern over extrajudicial killings, but Duterte has repeatedly dismissed criticism and vowed to keep his election promise to rid the country of drugs. \n Arriving from a state visit to Japan late Thursday, Duterte appeared to issue another warning, saying that thousands of drug suspects may end up dead.

Prosecutors said one of the women was assaulted multiple times during a ballroom dancing class she was attending with Cook this past spring. The other alleged victims were a woman Cook met at a party in March 2015; a woman he met in a human sexuality class in February; and a woman he met during a psychology class experiment in August. \n Cook was charged last week with sexually assaulting a woman in his apartment the night of Oct. 12 after inviting her over after studying together. \n Media reports of those charges have driven dozens of women to report to police their encounters with Cook. Officers searching Cook's apartment found a black book listing women he'd met and documenting his \"sexual desires\" and statements of \"kill,\" authorities said. \n Dane County Circuit Court Commissioner Brian Asmus set Cook's bail at $200,000 cash during a brief hearing Thursday. Cook made no statement at the hearing. \n His attorneys, Jessa Nicholson and Chris Van Wagner, told reporters after the proceeding that they believe the ballroom assaults never happened, noting the complaint didn't cite any witnesses. The rest of the encounters, they said, were consensual. Van Wagner showed reporters a page from Cook's book with the word \"Killed?\" written at the top and said it's unclear what it means. \n He said Cook has been vilified on social media but the prosecution's case is \"just dust.\" Women are coming forward because they've seen social media postings about Cook and have become frightened, he said. \n \"He's been painted as the face of evil,\" Van Wagner said. \"That's wrong.\" \n According to the complaint, the accuser from the Oct. 12 incident says she went to his apartment after studying with him at a campus library. She said he assaulted her for 2 \u00bd hours, maintaining what she described as a \"death grip\" on her arm or body. \n Cook told police the woman never told him to stop, the complaint said. \n Another woman came forward two days after charges were filed in that case. She said she met Cook at her friend's birthday party in March 2015. Two weeks later she visited his apartment, where he began kissing her forcefully, then sexually assaulted her. \n The same day that Cook was charged with the Oct. 12 assault, two other women reported being assaulted by him. \n One woman told police she was in a ballroom dance class with Cook during the spring 2016 semester. She accused him of repeatedly touching her breasts and buttocks while they were dancing despite her telling him to stop. The touching occurred 15 to 20 times over the semester, she said. \n The class instructor told investigators she got an email from the woman saying she was uncomfortable with how Cook was touching her. The instructor responded by speaking to the class about appropriate contact during dances. She said no other students complained about Cook. \n Another woman told police that she met Cook during a human sexuality class and began dating him in January, the complaint said. She said he assaulted her at his apartment in February. She told police at one point she told Cook \"OK, let's just have sex\" but she believes she said that to make herself feel as if the assault was consensual, the complaint said. \n Another woman told police on Monday that she met Cook during a psychology class experiment. They had consensual sex at his apartment in August, the woman said, during which he tried to choke her. After taking a break to smoke marijuana, Cook tried to have sex with her again, this time slapping her and leaving bruises. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Wisconsin student accused of assaulting 4 more women"}

So, of course, 'it's God,'\" he said. \n \"So, I promise God to \u2026 not express slang, cuss words and everything. So you guys hear me right always because (a) promise to God is a promise to the Filipino people.\" \n Duterte's vow was met with applause, but he cautioned: \"Don't clap too much or else this may get derailed.\" \n He shocked the dominant Roman Catholics last year when he fired an expletive while expressing his disgust over a monstrous traffic jam that trapped him while Pope Francis was visiting Manila. \"I wanted to call. 'Pope, you son of a bitch, go home.' Don't visit here anymore,\" he told a mob of supporters, some of whom laughed. \n He later apologized after Filipino bishops expressed shock and outrage. \n It's not certain if the 71-year-old president, who has been compared to U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump because of his brash language, can keep his promise. Duterte has made a similar pledge in June when it became evident that he had won the May 9 presidential elections overwhelmingly on a pledge to end crimes, especially illegal drugs, and corruption. \n He said then that he was enjoying his last moments as a \"rude person\" because \"when I become president, when I take my oath of office \u2026 that will be a different story. There will be a metamorphosis.\" \n It didn't take long for Duterte to break the promise. \n He has repeatedly leveled SOB-laced tirades against Obama, U.N.

{"date": "October 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The main entrance to the Red Earth Casino in Thermal, Calif. Bus tours have been a fixture across the American landscape for years, shuttling gamblers from cities to rural places casinos are located, particularly in California where tribal operations are often hours away. Gamblers usually get $20 to $30 in tokens or casino credits. \n LOS ANGELES >> Rosa Ruiz returned from a gambling jaunt to San Diego before dawn Saturday and was back on another bus that evening, headed for a desert casino. \n Like others who routinely board buses bound for distant casinos, Ruiz wasn't so much dreaming of striking it rich, just escaping her normal life for a few hours to socialize, snack and play the slots. \n But this night out ended in disaster on the freeway near Palm Springs when the bus slammed into a tractor-trailer in the pre-dawn darkness Sunday. Ruiz was killed along with 12 others, including the bus driver who also owned the USA Holiday bus. It was the latest in a growing number of casino bus tragedies around the country, from New York to Minnesota to Texas. \n Fatalities involving casino buses have become so frequent that the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates major crashes, is studying them for common patterns, said Earl Weener, an NTSB board member overseeing the crash probe of the USA Holiday bus. \n As casinos have proliferated, buses ferrying gamblers have become a fixture. Many, like Ruiz, travel from big cities to out-of-the-way casinos and stay for as little as four hours before the buses head home. \n The tours typically draw a similar demographic: older, lower-income and, often, minorities. Many of those killed in the crash last weekend were Latinos, and they boarded the bus in the Koreatown neighborhood of Los Angeles. \n \"They don't take off from the Santa Monica pier. They don't take off from Beverly Hills,\" said Dr. Timothy Fong, a psychiatry professor and co-director of gambling studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. \n Day and night, people line up at street corners, parking lots and fast food restaurants across the Los Angeles area where the buses arrive and depart for short casino trips. \n At the Koreatown location where Ruiz, 53, embarked on her last journey, fellow travelers gathered this week to light votive candles, stick roses and daisies in the bark of a palm tree and remember their lost friends. All the while, white buses pulled up to shuttle others to casinos in the desert or Santa Barbara and San Diego counties. \n These so-called curbside carriers are often mom-and-pop operations that have proliferated in the U.S. for tours of all kinds, including gambling trips. Government regulators are stretched to try to ensure all are abiding by safety rules. \n Attorney Katherine Harvey-Lee, who has sued bus operators, said casinos typically pay a per-passenger fee to smaller operations like USA Holiday, the one-bus operation owned by Teodulo Elias Vides, who was also the lone driver. Gamblers usually get $20 to $30 in tokens or casino credits. \n Vides charged $20 for the roundtrip to Red Earth Casino, a bare-bones operation in the community of Thermal, with about 3,000 residents living next to the Salton Sea, California's largest lake. A gas station and convenience store help draw travelers on Interstate 10, but the casino, packed with penny slots, lacks amenities and glitz. The dining area resembles a school cafeteria with basic offerings of pizza and sandwiches. \n The bus would have passed bigger, fancier and better-known Indian casinos to reach the destination 135 miles from LA. \n \"The fact that this is a way for them to bring gamblers from hundreds of miles away to a place they would never go or would ever have heard of makes one think there has to be a relationship between the operator and the casino,\" Harvey-Lee said. \"They weren't going to a place where some celebrity was playing in the lounge.\" \n The general manager at Red Earth Casino did not return a call seeking comment. \n Investigators are looking at Vides' relationship with the casino along with possible mechanical issues on the bus and what Vides did in the hours leading up to the crash to see whether alcohol or fatigue or some other factor might have contributed. \n The bus was traveling \"freeway speeds,\" and it did not appear to brake before slamming into the big rig that was moving at 5 mph as it approached utility work, California Highway Patrol Border Division Chief Jim Abele said. The crash occurred just after 5:15 a.m. when most passengers were sleeping. \n While the survivors of the crash and others who routinely board casino-bound buses said the trips are mostly for fun and socializing, there can be a darker side. \n Concerned that casinos were targeting vulnerable elders in San Francisco's Chinatown, a health care organization there tried unsuccessfully to distribute brochures about problem gambling on buses and at tour bus offices. The companies wouldn't cooperate, so workers hand out literature on sidewalks near the buses. \n \"For so many of our clients, that trip to the casino represents hope,\" said Michael S. Liao of NICOS Chinese Health Coalition. \n The reality is that most of those people end up losing, and some carry huge debts. \n \"It's not about how much you lose, but how much you can afford to lose,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Frequent fatal casino bus crashes draw attention from feds"}

{"date": "October 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Oct. 12, 1971 file photo, Charles \"Tex\" Watson, left, is led back to jail from a courtroom after he was convicted of seven counts of first-degree murder and one of conspiracy to commit murder in the Tate-LaBianca slayings, in Los Angeles. \n SACRAMENTO, Calif. >> California parole officials recommended Thursday that Charles \"Tex\" Watson, the self-described right-hand man of murderous cult leader Charles Manson, should remain in prison 47 years after he helped plan and carry out the slayings of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six other people. \n Watson's 17th parole hearing was held at Mule Creek State Prison, near Sacramento. He can seek parole again in five years. \n Watson, 70, is serving a life sentence for the murders of Tate and four others at her Beverly Hills, California, home on Aug. 9, 1969. The next night, he helped kill grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary. \n \"These were some of the most horrific crimes in California history, and we believe he continues to exhibit a lack of remorse and remains a public safety risk,\" Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement after the decision. \n Watson was initially sentenced to death in the stabbing and shooting rampage, but the sentence was later commuted to life when the California Supreme Court ruled in 1972 that the death penalty was unconstitutional. He currently is in Mule Creek State Prison, near Sacramento. \n Sharon Tate's sister, Debra Tate \u2014 the last surviving member of her immediate family \u2014 urged the panel of parole commissioners to reject freedom for the man she called \"the most active, the most prolific killer in the Manson family.\" \n \"He's a sociopath, and sociopaths are incapable having insight or empathy for anything. It's all about him. He didn't have it then, and he doesn't have it now,\" she said after the hearing. She said Watson still blames the murders on his drug use and lack of a clear goal in life rather than accepting full responsibility. \n In July, Gov. Jerry Brown reversed a Board of Parole Hearings recommendation that the state release Manson follower Leslie Van Houten, 67, who is serving a life sentence for the La Bianca killings. \n In January, he blocked the release of Bruce Davis, 74, another Manson devotee who was convicted in the killings of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald \"Shorty\" Shea. \n In prison, Watson wrote a book, \"Manson's Right-Hand Man Speaks Out,\" saying the charismatic Manson offered utopia, then persuaded his followers to act out his \"destructive worldview.\" Watson has apologized for the killings. \n Watson says he converted to Christianity in 1975, founded Abounding Love Ministries in 1980, and ministers to other inmates. He also obtained his college degree behind bars. \n Watson wrote that he was raised in Texas and headed to California at 21 against his parents' wishes in 1967 in search of \"drugs, sex and rock 'n' roll.\" \n Prosecutors said Manson ordered the murders in hopes of triggering a race war that he dubbed \"Helter Skelter,\" after a Beatles song. The words \"Death to Pigs\" were written in blood on the wall of the LaBianca residence; \"Helter Skelter\" was scrawled on the refrigerator; and \"rise\" was written in blood on the front door. \n The idea, authorities said, was that Manson and his followers would rise from the rubble to rule the world. \n \"Part of what torments me all these years and today is the severity of Charles Watson's crimes and how horribly the victims suffered,\" Anthony DiMaria, a nephew of Jay Sebring, who was killed with Tate, wrote in remarks to parole commissioners. \n He cited seven gunshots \u2014 all fired by Watson \u2014 along with 170 stab wounds and 13 blows to the victims with blunt objects. \n Watson wrote in his book that there was no concern for the victims during the rampage. \n \"There was a total disregard for life. I was concerned with destroying everyone and not getting discovered,\" he wrote. \"In some ways, punishment escaped my mind since Helter Skelter was coming down and society, as we knew it, was coming to an end.\" \n Watson's attorney, Kendrick Jan, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

{"date": "October 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The HealthCare.gov 2017 web site home page as seen in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Americans in the health insurance markets created by President Barack Obama's law will have less choice next year than any time since the program started, a new county-level analysis for The Associated Press has found. \n The analysis by AP and consulting firm Avalere Health found that about one-third of U.S. counties will have only one health marketplace insurer next year. That's more than 1,000 counties in 26 states \u2014 roughly double the number of counties in 2014, the first year of coverage through the program. \n With insurance notices for 2017 in the mail, families are already facing difficult choices, even weighing whether to stay covered. \n \"At this point we are at a loss,\" said Ryan Robinson of Phoenix. \"We don't know what the next step is.\" He and his wife, Nicole, only have plans from one insurer available next year, and the company doesn't appear to cover an expensive immune-system medication for their 11-year-old daughter. \n Phoenix is the market hardest hit by insurer exits, shrinking from eight carriers to one. With many other communities affected, however, the problem of dwindling choice may create even bigger political headaches than the rising premiums announced earlier this week. \n Largely as a result of the Affordable Care Act, the nation's uninsured rate has dropped to a historically low level, less than 9 percent. But the program hasn't yet found stable footing, and it remains politically divisive. Insurer participation rose in 2015 and 2016, only to plunge. \n Dwindling choice could be a trickier issue than rising premiums for the Obama administration and advocates of the 2010 law, including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \n Most customers get financial assistance, and their subsidies are designed to rise along with premiums, which are increasing an average of 25 percent in states served by HealthCare.gov. But there is no comparable safety valve for disruptions caused by insurers bailing out. \n \"Rising premiums get all of the political attention, but lack of choice between insurers could be a bigger problem for consumers,\" said Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president with Avalere. \n Five states \u2014 Alaska, Alabama, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming \u2014 have one participating insurer across their entire jurisdictions. Only Wyoming and South Carolina had faced that predicament this year. \n Another eight states \u2014 Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nevada and Tennessee\u2014 have only one participating insurer in a majority of counties. \n Citing big financial losses, several marquee insurers sharply scaled back their participation for next year. United Healthcare exited from more than 1,800 counties, and maintains only a minuscule presence, according to the analysis. Humana nearly halved the number of counties where it offers plans. \n Insurers say enrollment was disappointing, patients were sicker than expected, and an internal system to help stabilize premiums didn't work well. The Obama administration says insurers are correcting for initially pricing their plans too low. \n HealthCare.gov has taken steps to help consumers whose insurer is leaving by matching them to the closest comparable plan on the marketplace next year. \n Administration officials also point out that many private employers offer workers just one plan. \n The upheaval in the health insurance markets has consumers scrambling to figure out options. Sign-up season starts Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 31. \n South of Minneapolis, in Goodhue County, Minnesota, farmer Eugene Betcher said his Blue Cross Blue Shield family plan is going away. The insurer is dropping its popular preferred provider plan, which covers more than 100,000 area residents. \n Betcher has an appointment with his insurance adviser, but he expects sharply higher premiums and having to switch doctors. \n In his early 60s, he's mulling just keeping his wife on the plan. \"I'm thinking of not covering myself and hoping to get to 65 and Medicare,\" said Betcher. He'd risk a fine, but he says that financially he would probably come out ahead even if he had to pay out of pocket for medical care. \n In Birmingham, Alabama, property insurance adjuster Jacob Bodden said his Humana plan is pulling out and Blue Cross Blue Shield remains his only option. He gets no subsidy from the government, so he'd have to cover the entire premium increase himself. \n \"I don't trust the incompetents who created this mess can fix it,\" Bodden said. \n In Phoenix, Ryan and Nicole Robinson are at the epicenter of the health law's latest troubles. Maricopa County has seen the most insurers bail out, and premiums for a benchmark plan are spiking 145 percent next year, beyond any other major market on HealthCare.gov. \n Ryan Robinson, who works in sales for an out-of-state health care company, said the family's premium will go from $821 to $1,489. It's more than their mortgage and they don't qualify for an income-based subsidy. \n But what the Robinsons most worry about is that neither of their daughter's two medications appears to be covered by the remaining insurer. That includes an immune-system drug costing about $5,000 a month. \n \"I shouldn't be getting government assistance, but I shouldn't be offered a plan that's ludicrous,\" said Ryan Robinson. He says the idea behind the law \"was good and principled,\" but \"there have got to be other solutions out there.\" \n The Obama administration says consumers in such situations can seek an exception. \"The law guarantees access to necessary prescriptions, even if they aren't on a formulary, through an exceptions process,\" said spokesman Aaron Albright. \n Avalere is a consulting and data-crunching firm that provides nonpartisan analysis for health care industry and government clients.

{"date": "October 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Kelli Stewart, right, celebrated with Maureen Valdez outside the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse after the leaders of an armed group who seized a national wildlife refuge in rural Oregon were acquitted today. \n PORTLAND, Ore. >> The leaders of an armed group who seized a national wildlife refuge in rural Oregon were acquitted Thursday in the 41-day standoff that brought new attention to a long-running dispute over control of federal lands in the U.S. West. \n Tumult erupted in the courtroom after the verdicts were read when an attorney for group leader Ammon Bundy demanded his client be immediately released, repeatedly yelling at the judge. U.S. marshals tackled attorney Marcus Mumford to the ground, used a stun gun on him several times and arrested him. \n U.S. District Judge Anna Brown said she could not release Bundy because he still faces charges in Nevada stemming from an armed standoff at his father Cliven Bundy's ranch two years ago. \n The jury found Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy and several others not guilty of possessing a firearm in a federal facility and conspiring to impede federal workers from their jobs at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 300 miles southeast of Portland where the trial took place. \n The Bundys were expected to stand trial in Nevada early next year. Authorities rounded up cattle at their father's ranch in 2014 because of unpaid grazing fees but released the animals as they faced armed protesters. \n The brothers are part of a ranching family embroiled in a lengthy fight over the use of public range, and their occupation in Oregon drew an international spotlight to a uniquely American West dispute: federal restrictions on ranching, mining and logging to protect the environment. The government, which controls much of the land in the U.S. West, says it tries to balance industry, recreation and wildlife concerns to benefit all. \n The armed occupiers were allowed to come and go for several weeks as authorities tried to avoid bloodshed seen in past standoffs. \n The confrontations reignited clashes dating to the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion of the late 1970s, when Western states such as Nevada tried to win more control of vast federal land holdings. \n The group took over the bird sanctuary in remote southeastern Oregon on Jan. 2. They objected to prison sentences handed down to Dwight and Steven Hammond, two local ranchers convicted of setting fires. They demanded the government free the father and son and relinquish control of public lands to local officials. \n Ammon Bundy gave frequent news conferences and the group used social media in a mostly unsuccessful effort to get others to join them. \n The Bundys and other key figures were arrested in a Jan. 26 traffic stop outside the refuge that ended with police fatally shooting Robert \"LaVoy\" Finicum, an occupation spokesman. Most occupiers left after his death, but four holdouts remained until Feb. 11, when they surrendered after a lengthy negotiation. \n At trial, the case was seemingly open-and-shut. There was no dispute the group seized the refuge, established armed patrols and vetted those who visited. \n \"Ladies and gentlemen, this case is not a whodunit,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Ethan Knight said in his closing argument, arguing that the group decided to take over a federal workplace that didn't belong to them. \n On technical grounds, the defendants said they never discussed stopping individual workers from accessing their offices but merely wanted the land and the buildings. On emotional grounds, Ammon Bundy and other defendants argued that the takeover was an act of civil disobedience against an out-of-control federal government that has crippled the rural West. \n Federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case, finishing with a display of more than 30 guns seized after the standoff. An FBI agent testified that 16,636 live rounds and nearly 1,700 spent casings were found. \n Bundy testified in his defense, spending three days amplifying his belief that government overreach is destroying Western communities that rely on the land. \n He said the plan was to take ownership of the refuge by occupying it for a period of time and then turn it over to local officials to use as they saw fit. \n Bundy also testified that the occupiers carried guns because they would have been arrested immediately otherwise and to protect themselves against possible government attack. \n Ryan Bundy, who acted his own attorney, did not testify. \n Authorities had charged 26 occupiers with conspiracy. Eleven pleaded guilty, and another had the charge dropped. Seven defendants chose not to be tried at this time. Their trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 14. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Jury acquits leaders of Oregon standoff of federal charges"}

Decisions on Antarctica require a consensus among the 25 members, which has confounded past efforts. \n The U.S. and New Zealand have been pushing for a marine reserve for years. They first submitted a joint proposal in 2012, but it was rejected five times before Friday's agreement. \n The marine protected area covers 1.6 million square kilometers (0.62 million square miles). There will be a blanket ban on commercial fishing across about three-quarters of that area. In the remaining ocean, some monitored commercial fishing would be allowed. \n A small amount of fishing for research purposes would be allowed throughout the protected zone. \n Several countries fish in the waters surrounding Antarctica for lucrative toothfish, which are often marketed in North America as Chilean sea bass. \n Evan Bloom, who led the U.S. delegation in Hobart, said that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has been a passionate advocate for the reserve and has been pushing for it in high-level talks with Russian leaders, including President Vladimir Putin. \n Bloom said he was \"thrilled\" with the result. \n \"We've been working on this for so many years and had so many disappointments trying to get here,\" he said. \"This is a real win for marine conservation.\" \n In a statement, Kerry said the agreement \"will safeguard one of the last unspoiled ocean wilderness areas on the planet \u2013 home to unparalleled marine biodiversity and thriving communities of penguins, seals, whales, seabirds, and fish.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Countries OK world's largest marine reserve in Antarctica"}

{"date": "October 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Ron P. Broussard Jr. is seen in a photo from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's Sex Offender Registry. Records show former Trump University staffer Broussard, 48, was convicted at court martial in 1994 of sodomy and indecent acts with a child. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Donald Trump says he hand-picked only the best to teach success at Trump University. But dozens of those hired by the company had checkered pasts \u2014 including serious financial problems and even convictions for cocaine trafficking or child molestation, an Associated Press investigation has found. \n The AP identified 107 people listed as speakers and staff on more than 21,000 pages of customer-satisfaction surveys the Republican presidential nominee has released as part of his defense against three lawsuits. \n Trump and his attorneys have said repeatedly that the surveys show the overwhelming majority of participants were satisfied. However, the suits allege his namesake real-estate seminars were a massive fraud designed to \"upsell\" students into buying course packages costing as much as $35,000. \n As a candidate, Trump has said he will run the U.S. government like he runs his businesses. So his past hiring practices could offer insight into how a President Trump might fill scores of key federal positions. \n Some names from the surveys were too common to narrow down to individuals, but AP used online resumes, court filings and other public records to piece together detailed background checks on 68 former Trump staffers. The results could complicate Trump's legal defense that his Trump University \"apprentices\" got the top-flight instructors and mentors they paid for. \n Half the 68 former faculty and staff identified by AP had personal bankruptcies, foreclosures, credit card defaults, tax liens or other indicators of significant money troubles prior to teaching Trump University courses promoting \"wealth building\" and \"how to invest like a billionaire,\" according to AP's review. Many of those hired to teach did not have college degrees and were not licensed to broker real estate. \n At least four had felony convictions. \n They include Ron P. Broussard Jr., who was hired to the Trump University staff in 2007 after years serving as a motivational speaker at get-rich-quick seminars taught in hotel conference rooms. \n Though he has never been licensed as a real estate agent or broker, Broussard is listed as \"staff\" or \"coordinator\" for at least five Trump seminars titled \"Fast Track to Foreclosure.\" \n Records show the former Army sergeant was convicted at court-martial in 1994 of sodomy and indecent acts with a child. He then served five years in the military prison at Leavenworth, Kansas. \n Broussard, who now lives in Duluth, Georgia, is a registered sex offender. He told AP that his conviction involved the 8-year-old daughter of a fellow soldier. \n \"Those were trumped-up charges,\" said Broussard, 48. \"She said that I fondled her and was trying to have relations with her.\" \n He declined to answer further questions, citing a non-disclosure agreement he signed with Trump University. \n In a 2005 video targeted at prospective students, Trump said he personally vetted those hired to run his seminars. \n \"At Trump University we teach success. That's what it's all about. Success. It's going to happen to you,\" Trump said in a promotional video, looking intently into the camera. \"We're going to have professors and adjunct professors that are absolutely terrific \u2014 terrific people, terrific brains, successful. We are going to have the best of the best. \u2026 These are all people that are hand-picked by me.\" \n Trump University ceased operations in 2010 amid mounting complaints from former students and inquiries from state regulators. \n New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued in 2013, alleging that the university was a \"fraud from beginning to end,\" geared toward pressuring students into buying ever more expensive seminars, course materials and mentoring services of little educational value. Regulators say Trump University staff often targeted senior citizens or those already in dire financial straits, encouraging them to max out their credit cards to pay for classes they couldn't afford. \n In California, there are two federal class action suits filed on behalf of former students. One case is headed to trial Nov. 28, three weeks after the presidential election. In an unusual legal maneuver, Trump's lawyers last week asked the federal judge overseeing the case to exclude any statements he made during the presidential campaign, arguing that allowing jurors to hear the Republican nominee's words would irreparably prejudice them against him. \n In sworn depositions taken as part of the lawsuits, Trump said he had not met all of those hired at Trump University, though he often reviewed their resumes. \n Asked whether he could recall the names of any of his hand-picked instructors, Trump, who in the past said he had \"one of the world's greatest memories,\" said he was unable to do so. \n Timothy C. Gorsline, who taught at least eight Trump University seminars in 2008, pleaded no contest a decade earlier to felony cocaine possession, according to an electronic database of Florida court records. \n Copies of Gorsline's resume and Trump University employment questionnaire were filed as evidence in the New York lawsuit. They showed that when asked whether he had been convicted of a felony, Gorsline marked an X indicating \"Yes.\" \n Records show the IRS also filed a lien against Gorsline in 1996 for more than $15,400 in unpaid taxes and interest. \n Gorsline, 57, did not respond to multiple phone messages. A woman who answered the door at his home in Largo, Florida, confirmed that Gorsline lived there, but he did not respond to a message asking him to contact the AP. \n When a lawyer asked Trump in a December 2015 deposition if had ever heard of Gorsline, the businessman responded that \"too many years\" had passed for him to recall. \n Records also show Damian D. Pell, who helped teach at least 23 Trump University seminars from 2008 to 2010, pleaded guilty in Florida to a felony charge of trafficking cocaine. \n According to court and arrest records, Pell's car was pulled over by Charlotte County Sheriff's deputies in June 1999 as part of an ongoing narcotics investigation. Authorities recovered 62 grams of powder cocaine during the traffic stop and 1,200 grams in a subsequent search of his home \u2014 a haul with a street value in excess of $154,000 according to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration price data adjusted for inflation. \n After Pell cooperated with law enforcement against other drug dealers, a judge sentenced him to three years in state prison and a $50,000 fine, according to records. \n During the period he was working for Trump University, Pell was also sued by a debt collection company over a credit card balance of more than $7,600, records show. A judge ordered him to repay the debt with interest, according to court records. \n Pell, 35, initially indicated in a phone call he was willing to talk about his experience at Trump University at a later time, but he did not respond to subsequent messages. Street addresses listed for him on Florida business records turned out to be post office boxes at shipping stores. \n Spencer J. Raffel, who staffed a Trump University event in 2008, has a felony conviction in Florida for grand theft, according to court records. He was sentenced to serve three years of probation in 1989. \n Court records also showed that Raffel, 52, has a multi-decade history of failing to pay debts, including defaulting on real estate loans during the same period he was helping teach students how to profit from properties in foreclosure. \n Raffel did not respond to phone messages, and efforts to reach him at his listed a Cape Coral, Florida, address were unsuccessful. \n Asked about the former staffers with felony records, Trump Organization lawyer Jill Martin noted the company's internal surveys showing high rates of customer satisfaction. \n \"Three of the four individuals cherry picked by the AP were not course instructors and are certainly not representative of the professional instruction staff engaged by Trump University,\" said Martin, a member of the legal team defending Trump from the lawsuits. \"As shown by the 98 percent approval rating, students were extremely satisfied with the instruction they received and valuable information they obtained by attending Trump University.\" \n Records uncovered as part of the lawsuits show Trump University conducted criminal background checks during its screening process for potential hires, though Martin declined to discuss the records of specific employees. \n While convicted felons represent a small minority of the Trump University staff, AP's review of public records showed serious financial problems were common, including among the high-energy speakers who told students stories of their own purported riches. \n Stephen J. Goff declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2007, three months before he was hired by Trump University. \n According to his federal bankruptcy filings, Goff had racked up $750,000 in credit card bills, personal loans, mortgages and other debts. He listed $18,800 in assets. \n As with Gorsline, a copy of Goff's Trump University employment questionnaire reviewed by AP showed that he disclosed he was in bankruptcy. Goff was hired anyway, teaching more than 40 seminars with such titles as \"Quick Turn Real Estate Profits.\" \n In 2009, a reporter from the Houston Chronicle newspaper attended a Trump University seminar where Goff presented himself as a financial success story, saying he had flipped more than 200 properties. \n \"People ask me, 'Steve, if you're making so much in real estate, why do you travel the country teaching people?' \" Goff, now 48, was quoted as telling his students. \"If it was in your heart to help people, and Donald Trump asked you, what would you do? I got on the first plane.\" \n Asked in his December deposition whether he knew Goff, Trump said he could not recall the name. \n A doorman at the Austin, Texas, apartment building where Goff's address was listed in records said the name was unfamiliar to him. \n In his 2005 video, Trump said his hand-picked instructors would give his students a better education than top-level university business schools. \n \"Honestly, if you don't learn from them, you don't learn from me. If you don't learn from the people we're going to be putting forward \u2014 these are all people that are hand-picked by me \u2014 then you're not going to make it in terms of the world of success,\" Trump said. \n Associated Press writers Will Weissert in Austin, Texas, Tamara Lush in Largo, Florida, and news researcher Monika Mathur in Washington contributed. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump U staff included drug trafficker, child molester"}

He has pursued talks with two other larger Muslim insurgent groups. \n Duterte's peace negotiations with communist rebels have led to cease-fire declarations that have halted years of fighting with Maoist guerrillas, which freed up the thousands of troops now redeployed to wage one of the largest offensives ever fought against the Abu Sayyaf in southern Sulu and Basilan provinces. \n \"The ASG shifted in targeting vulnerable foreign-flagged tugboats and their crew due to the focused military operations against the group,\" the report said, adding the group was expected to intensify its kidnap-for-ransom assaults in the busy waterways around the southern Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. \n Abu Sayyaf's attacks on tugboats this year and the kidnappings of their Malaysian and Indonesian crewmen have raised security alarms from those countries, whose officials have tried to map out a strategy to protect commercial and passenger ships. \n \"Lucrative payoffs from KFR (kidnappings for ransom), the report said, \"enabled the ASG to procure firearms as well as ammunitions.\" \n Of the estimated 353 million pesos in ransom received by the Abu Sayyaf for six kidnappings of 21 people from January to June, the bulk was paid in exchange for the releases of 14 Indonesian and 4 Malaysian crewmen who had been held at Abu Sayyaf jungle bases in Sulu province, the report said. \n The militants got $413,000 in ransom for freeing Marites Flor, a Filipino woman who was kidnapped last year with two Canadians and a Norwegian from a yacht-berthing resort on southern Samal island. \n Philippine officials have said they were unaware of any ransom paid for Flor or other hostages and added they continue to adopt a no-ransom policy. \n The militants beheaded the two Canadians after ransom deadlines lapsed.

The Syrian Civil Defense first responder team and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said today that the airstrikes killed at least 35 people, mostly children. \n The Observatory said 15 students were killed, as well as four teachers and three other women. It was not immediately possible to reconcile the separate figures, but divergent death tolls are not uncommon in a conflict-torn Syria that has been largely inaccessible to international media for over two years. \n UNICEF and the Syrian Civil Defense said the death toll is likely to rise as rescue efforts continue. They said that two schools in the area were hit with 11 airstrikes around midday. \n UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake called the airstrikes an \"outrage,\" adding that if found to be deliberate the attacks would be considered a war crime. \n \"This latest atrocity may be the deadliest attack on a school since the war began,\" Lake said in a statement. \"When will the world's revulsion at such barbarity be matched by insistence that this must stop?\" \n Idlib is the main Syrian opposition stronghold, though radical militant groups also have a large presence there. It has regularly been hit by Syrian and Russian warplanes as well as the U.S.-led coalition targeting Islamic State militants. An activist at the scene said as many as 10 airstrikes were believed to have hit Hass on Wednesday. \n Juliette Touma, regional UNICEF chief of communication, said Wednesday's attack was the deadliest attack on a school in 2016, bring the overall death toll of children killed in such attacks in 2016 to 54. \n According to Touma, 591 children were killed in 2015 in Syria. \n Prior to Wednesday's attack, the deadliest assault on a school was reported in April 2014 when 30 children were killed in airstrikes that hit a school in the rebel-held part of Aleppo city, according to UNICEF. \n UNICEF said it has verified at least 38 attacks on schools this year across Syria, whether in government-held areas or rebel-controlled territory, compared to 60 attacks last year. \n \"In general there are one in three schools in Syria that can't be used anymore because they were damaged or destroyed or used for military purposes or sheltering the displaced,\" Touma told The Associated Press, speaking from Amman, Jordan. \n Syria's state TV today said two students were killed and 13 others were wounded by projectiles fired by rebel fighters at a school in the government-held western part of Aleppo. \n Elsewhere, at least eight people were killed in government shelling of Doumas, a rebel-held suburb east of the capital Damascus, according to the Syrian Civil Defense team and the Observatory. The first responders said that there was a child among the eight who died. \n UNICEF says over 1.7 million Syrian children remain out of school in 2016, a staggering figure but a drop from 2014 when 2.1 million were recorded as not attending classes. The U.N. agency says another 1.3 million are at risk of dropping out this year. In the rebel-held part of Aleppo, teachers and volunteers have set up underground schools to ensure some classes continue amid a punishing bombing campaign and a siege that has tightened since July. \n In other developments today, U.N. official Jan Egeland, speaking in Geneva, said efforts will be renewed to secure the evacuation of nearly 200 wounded from eastern Aleppo districts, and allow medical and food supplies into the besieged part of the city. \n Airstrikes by Russian and Syrian government planes on Aleppo have been halted for nine days now in expectations of the evacuations, but efforts have failed because Syrian rebels say there have been no safety guarantees for the evacuees. The rebels also say Russia and the government are not allowing aid into the besieged, eastern rebel-held districts of Aleppo that are home to some 275,000 people. \n A government ground offensive attempting to push into the rebel-held part of the city, and airstrikes in rural Aleppo have continued. \n Egeland said a lack of trust, fear, and misunderstandings, as well as unacceptable preconditions, have prevented evacuations. \n \"We are not giving up,\" Egeland said. \n However, he said the Syrian government has denied humanitarian access to eastern Aleppo as part of a monthly U.N. plan to access 25 besieged and remote areas in Syria. \n \"We need to overturn that decision because east Aleppo needs humanitarian supplies, they need it urgently,\" Egeland said. \"If not \u2026 it will be the worst winter in now the six winters we have had in the conflict.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Attack on Syrian school is potential war crime, UN says"}

{"date": "October 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Polish ambassador to Britain Arkady Rzegocki, said he was \"shocked and deeply concerned\" by the hostility toward a community whose presence in Britain goes back to World War II, when Polish pilots fought in the Battle of Britain and a Polish government-in-exile was based in London. \n HARLOW, England >> When his friend Arek was killed in the street, Eric Hind had sickening evidence that the country he'd come to call home had changed. \n But the Polish IT consultant had started to feel uneasy even before that, as Britain prepared to vote earlier this year on whether to remain in the European Union. \n As debate heated up about the U.K.'s place in Europe, Hind's outsider status was made all too clear to him. \n \"My landlord, who went abroad to Spain for five years, he got back and the first thing he did, before the referendum, was ask me when I am going back to Poland and saying he's going to vote for 'leave,'\" said Hind. \n Hind, 33, was among hundreds of thousands of Poles who seized the opportunity when the EU expanded into eastern Europe in 2004 to move to Britain: an open, welcoming country with a flexible labor market and relatively high wages. Twelve years on, he'd settled in Harlow, near London, with a family and a good job. \n After the June 23 vote, Hind says he received text messages. \"What time is my bus back home, have I got my passport and good luck in Poland.\" \n Free movement among member states is a key principle of the EU, and millions of Europeans have become used to studying, working or retiring abroad. Britain's vote to quit the EU \u2014 after a \"leave\" campaign that urged people to \"take back control\" \u2014 is in part a renunciation of that borderless ideal. \n Anti-racism groups say the vote also unleashed a wave of xenophobia that has brought insults, abuse and physical attacks. \n Much of the recorded abuse has been aimed at eastern Europeans, who have come to Britain in the hundreds of thousands over the past decade \u2014 and particularly Poles, the largest group, who number a million in the U.K. \n \"'Polish' has become a derogatory word for anybody who is from Europe,\" said Suresh Grover of the Monitoring Group, a charity that works with victims of hate crime. \n \"It's not just against eastern Europeans \u2014 we have cases of Germans, Italians and French people,\" Grover said. \"The victims are people who speak a different language.\" \n Britons from ethnic minorities also say that have been getting more abuse. Grover said the anti-immigrant tenor of the Brexit debate \u2014 one poster featured a long line of migrants beside the slogan \"breaking point\" \u2014 \"has legitimized unacceptable forms of racism that I thought couldn't exist again.\" \n \"We have cases where the n-word is used frequently,\" he said. \n Official figures back up anecdotal evidence of a rise in hate crime since the referendum. According to the Home Office, police recorded 1,546 racially or religiously aggravated offenses in England and Wales in the two weeks before referendum day, and 2,241 in the two weeks after it. The total for July was up 41 percent from the same month a year earlier. August's level was lower, but still higher than before for Brexit vote. \n Incidents reported around the country include offensive graffiti daubed on a Polish community center; cards saying \"no more Polish vermin\" left on cars; a Polish man punched and kicked in Yeovil, southwest England; another Polish man beaten by a gang of teenagers in the northern city of Leeds; and a 21-year-old Polish student stabbed in the neck with a broken bottle in the English Midlands town of Telford. \n On Aug. 27, a Saturday night, Hind's friend Arkadiusz Jozwik, known as Arek, was involved in an altercation with youths outside a pizza parlor in Harlow, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of London. The 40-year-old was felled by a single punch, hit his head and died in hospital two days later. \n Police said they were investigating the death as a hate crime, and arrested six teens aged 15 and 16. Five have been released for lack of evidence, while one remains on bail. \n Poland's ambassador to Britain, Arkady Rzegocki, said he was \"shocked and deeply concerned\" by the hostility toward a community whose presence in Britain goes back to World War II, when Polish pilots fought in the Battle of Britain and a Polish government-in-exile was based in London. \n \"The hospitality of British society was very famous, and we appreciate it,\" he said. \n Rzegocki said he is confident that common sense and British decency will prevail. He said the embassy has received many supportive letters from Britons condemning the attacks. \n And he points out that Britain is a country with low unemployment whose economy relies on migrants, including armies of Polish plumbers, nannies and fruit-pickers. \n \"I am sure that most of British society is very welcoming to immigrants \u2014 especially to the Poles which had, and still have, a huge contribution to the British economy and to the British culture,\" he said. \n He notes that for Europe, the 20th century was the era of \"borders and protectionism \u2014 and it wasn't a good century in European history.\" \n No one is arguing that the referendum introduced prejudice to Britain \u2014 earlier groups of immigrants, from Jews 100 years ago to West Indians after World War II, also experienced hostility. In the 2014 British Social Attitudes survey, about a third of people admitted to being a little or very prejudiced against other races. \n \"You've only got to hear people's conversations on the bus over the years, saying 'What's all these foreigners coming in?'\" said Dorothy Spriggs, an 85-year-old who has lived in Harlow for almost 50 years. \n Harlow is a post-World War II \"new town\" whose first residents included bombed-out Londoners. Over the years they've been joined by others \u2014 Chinese, Indians and more recently eastern Europeans, whose shops and delis sit alongside the town's fish-and-chip shops, Indian restaurants and kebab takeaways. \n Spriggs stopped recently beside a makeshift memorial near the spot where Jozwik died: bunches of flowers, a candle and three large stuffed animals lined up neatly on benches. \n \"I think people should be more tolerant,\" she said. \n That appeal may be too late to keep Hind in Harlow, or in Britain. \n He's stopped going into town after 6 p.m. He's planning to leave the U.K., so his 2-year-old British-born daughter can grow up somewhere she will feel safe. \n \"When I first moved to the U.K. I felt like it was a dream come true,\" he said with quiet sadness. \"It's the country where there are no differences, people just get on with each other, there are no questions asked about where you're from. \n \"But now I just have to watch my back. People are worried to use their own language in the streets. It's not what it is supposed to be like, or what it was like before.\" \n Hind worries he won't be allowed to remain in Britain even if he wants to. The government has refused to guarantee that the estimated 3 million EU nationals in Britain can stay unless U.K. citizens elsewhere in the EU get the same right. Europe's borders are firming up again. \n \"It's just not nice to live in a country where you don't know where you stand \u2026 if you don't know what will happen tomorrow, if someone will come to your door and say, 'OK, time for you to pack your bags and go home,'\" Hind said. \n \"Everyone wants to feel safe and I don't think this is the case now in the U.K.\" \n Follow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "For UK's Europeans, post-Brexit attacks bring shock and fear"}

Philadelphia 76ers national anthem singer Streeter said she was told by the team she could not perform because of her \"We Matter\" jersey. \n PHILADELPHIA >> Philadelphia 76ers national anthem singer Sevyn Streeter said she was told by the team she could not perform because of her \"We Matter\" jersey. \n She was scheduled to sing before the Sixers' season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder, but said in an interview with The Associated Press late Wednesday she was told she would not sing just minutes before her performance. \n \"I'd say two minutes before we were about to walk out \u2026 the organization told me that I could not wear my shirt while singing the national anthem at their game,\" the R&B singer said by phone. \"I was never given any kind of dress code. I was never asked beforehand to show my wardrobe.\" \n The Sixers declined to say why Streeter's performance was canceled. \n \"The Philadelphia 76ers organization encourages meaningful actions to drive social change. We use our games to bring people together, to build trust and to strengthen our communities. As we move from symbolic gestures to action, we will continue to leverage our platform to positively impact our community,\" the Sixers said in a statement. \n The Sixers had a member of their dance team sing the anthem. \n Streeter has written songs for Chris Brown, Ariana Grande and other stars. In 2013, she had a Top 40 hit with \"It Won't Stop,\" a duet with Brown that reached RIAA gold status. \n The singer, born Amber Denise Streeter, said she was very hurt by the NBA team's actions. \n \"I was angry, extremely, extremely angry and disappointed and honestly brought to tears by all of it. It broke my heart,\" she said. \"Honestly, I was very excited about being able to perform the national anthem.

Kaepernick cited racial injustice and police brutality among the reasons for his protest, and athletes from many sports \u2014 and many levels, from youth all the way to professional \u2014 have followed his lead in various ways. \n \"I also felt it was important to express the ongoing challenges and ongoing injustice we face as a black community within the United States of America \u2014 that's very important to me,\" Streeter said. \"Yes, we live in the greatest country in the world but there are issues that we cannot ignore.

{"date": "October 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson sits atop a horse Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016, while visiting the protest camp against the Dakota Access oil pipeline outside Cannon Ball, N.D. Jackson said he came \"to pray together, protest together and if necessary, go to jail together.\" \n CANNON BALL, N.D. >> Protesters trying to stop construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline are bracing for a confrontation with police Thursday after the demonstrators refused to leave private land in the pipeline's path. \n A months-long dispute over the four-state, $3.8 billion pipeline reached a crisis point when some 200 protesters set up camp on land owned by pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners. The disputed area is just to the north of a more permanent and larger encampment on federally owned land where hundreds of protesters have camped for months. \n Law enforcement officials demanded that the protesters leave the private land on Wednesday, but the protesters refused. It appeared only thick fog and cloudy skies kept a large contingent of law enforcement officers from moving in. Officials have frequently monitored protesters by air. \n \"At some point the rule of law has to be enforced,\" Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said Wednesday. \"We could go down there at any time. We're trying not to.\" \n Some protesters were resigned to a confrontation. On Wednesday, law enforcement included sheriff's deputies from several counties, the Highway Patrol and the National Guard, and several buses and Humvees stood at the ready. \n \"I don't have a crystal ball to know when it will happen, but we know it will happen,\" said Mekasi Camp Horinek, a member of the Ponca tribe in Oklahoma. \"We're going to hold this ground.\" \n Protesters vowed to stay put, at one point chanting \"Stand in peace against the beast.\" \n \"I'm here to die if I have to. I don't want to die but I will,\" said Didi Banerji, who lives in Toronto but is originally from the Spirit Lake Sioux reservation in North Dakota. \n About 200 activists moved onto the site last weekend to fight the nearly 1,200-mile pipeline, which they fear could harm cultural sites and drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. \n Protests supporting the Standing Rock Sioux have been ongoing for months, with more than 260 people arrested so far in North Dakota. \n The pipeline is to carry oil from western North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to an existing pipeline in Patoka, Illinois, where shippers can send it on to Midwest and Gulf Coast markets. Energy Transfer Partners has said the pipeline is nearly complete other than the work in south central North Dakota. \n Local sheriff's officials had said earlier they didn't have the resources to immediately remove activists from the private land, which is just north of the main protest camp on federal land near Cannon Ball, a town about 50 miles south of Bismarck. But officers called for reinforcements, and those were arriving from other states. \n North Dakota's Emergency Commission approved $6 million in emergency funding for law enforcement costs related to the protest \u2014 but as of Wednesday, nearly all of that had been used up. The Department of Emergency Services plans to ask for more, spokeswoman Cecily Fong said. \n The protest has drawn the attention of activists and celebrities, including actress-activist Shailene Woodley and Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein. Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson and actor Mark Ruffalo were at the protest camp Wednesday. Jackson said he was there \"to pray together, protest together and if necessary go to jail together.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Oil pipeline protesters brace for confrontation with police"}
