A powerful earthquake rocked the same area of central and southern Italy hit by quake in August and a pair of aftershocks last week, sending already quake-damaged buildings crumbling after a week of temblors that have left thousands homeless. \n ROME >> The Latest on the powerful earthquake that has rocked already stricken central and southern Italy (all times local): \n 12:30 a.m. \n Almost 8,000 people have sought assistance from Italy's Civil Protection agency and are being housed in hotels and shelters following Sunday's quake and the one last week. \n The agency said early Thursday that it was expecting to assist about 3,000 more residents Sunday night into Monday. \n The agency's figures do not include the many who are sleeping in their own tents, cars and campers, or who have found their own lodging elsewhere. \n The Sunday morning quake with a magnitude of 6.6 was centered in the mountainous area in central Italy that straddles Marche and Umbria. \n No one was killed or seriously injured, possibly because a pair of powerful jolts last week had prompted many people to leave their homes. \n The Civil Protection agency also is still housing about 1,100 people who were left homeless after the Aug. 24 quake in the same area that killed nearly 300 people. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 6:45 p.m. \n An Italian seismologist says the recent quakes in central Italy were foreshocks to the powerful 6.6 temblor on Sunday, and that more significant quakes can be expected. \n The president of Italy's National Institute for Geophysics and Vulcanology, Carlo Doglioni, told The Associated Press that the intense activity along a series of faults in the region weren't anomalous. \n He said there was a similar sequence of three seismic events within a period of months in 1703, adding \"it is normal for the Apennines,\" where there are a series of interdependent faults. \n Doglioni said that natural law dictates that after such an event that there will be more quakes, \"which means we can expect some 5 magnitude quakes and many of magnitude 4.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 5:55 p.m. \n A seismologist at the British Geological Survey says experts can't exclude the possibility that there will be more, or even stronger, aftershocks in the area near Norcia in central Italy. \n Margarita Segou told The Associated Press that the important thing to realize is that while the number of temblors will decline over time, \"we cannot exclude the possibility of larger magnitude aftershocks.\" \n She cited other regions, such as a series of quakes in Japan earlier this year, which saw a similar pattern in which a quake is followed by a larger aftershock. \n The quake Sunday that struck near Norcia in central Italy measured magnitude 6.6 and was the strongest to hit the country in 36 years. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 2 p.m. \n Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has vowed that Italy will rebuild the homes, churches and other structures destroyed in the country's latest earthquake. \n Renzi spoke Sunday hours after central Italy was struck by an earthquake with an initial magnitude of 6.6, which followed a deadly quake on August 24 and powerful aftershocks on Wednesday that left thousands homeless. \n He said the financial resources will be found to restore essential elements of the national identity. \n Among the structures that have been lost are churches, bell towers and other examples of Italy's cultural heritage. \n Sunday's quake damaged historic churches in the town of Norcia, including the 14th century St. Benedict cathedral in one of the city's main piazza. \n Renzi said at a news conference: \"We will rebuild everything \u2014 the houses, the churches, the shops. We are dealing (with) marvelous territories, territories of beauty.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 1 p.m. \n Italian Premier Matteo Renzi says so far there appears to be no loss of human life from the strong earthquake that struck Italy on Sunday morning. \n Renzi spoke more than five hours after a quake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 toppled buildings in central Italy, the strongest temblor to strike the earthquake-prone country since 1980. \n Renzi says that despite the strength of the quake \"at the moment there is no loss of human life.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 12:40 a.m. \n The powerful earthquake that shook central and southern Italy has forced the temporary closure of some of Rome's most important tourist sites. \n The Vatican's St. Paul Outside the Walls basilica was closed for several hours on Sunday after some plaster fell, but was later reopened. \n Vatican firefighters inspected St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican's other basilicas but found no hazards. \n The presidential palace also was closed so authorities could check for damage. \n Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi canceled visits to City Hall as a precautionary measure. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 12:30 p.m. \n Pope Francis is praying for people affected by Italy's latest earthquake and the people who are offering help. \n The crowds in St. Peter's Square interrupted Francis with applause when he mentioned the quake during his weekly Sunday blessing. \n He said: \"I'm praying for the injured and the families who have suffered the most damage, as well as for rescue and first-aid workers.\" \n Francis travelled earlier this month to meet with survivors of an Aug. 24 quake that killed nearly 300 people in the same regions struck by Sunday's quake. \n He stopped in all the hard-hit towns in an eight-hour road trip to offer his prayers and solidarity. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 11:30 a.m. \n A Catholic Church leader in one of the two regions where another earthquake has caused buildings to collapse is advising parish priests to avoid holding Mass inside churches. \n Cardinal Gualtiero Bassetti told priests in the Umbria region to hold Mass outdoors following the Sunday morning earthquake as well as on All Saint's Day on Tuesday, a holiday on which Catholic's remember the dead. \n The news agency ANSA said Bassetti, head of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Umbria, made the decision after consulting with the head of the region. \n The earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 has damaged historic churches in the town of Norcia, including the 14th century St. Benedict cathedral in one of the city's main piazza. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n The earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 that rocked Italy on Sunday morning is believed to be the strongest quake to strike the country since 1980. \n A 6.9-magnitude quake in southern Campania that year killed some 3,000 people and caused extensive damage. \n The Apennine region of central Italy, located along a major fault line, has been the site of dozens of significant earthquakes since then. \n A 6.1-magnitude earthquake on Aug. 24 quake killed nearly 300 people and flattened entire villages. \n Officials have blamed shoddy construction for the comparatively high death toll from the August quake. The hilltop town of Amatrice, in particular, suffered significant damage, including in newly constructed buildings. \n To date, Italy's deadliest quake in recent history remains the 1908 Messina quake that killed tens of thousands of people. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 10:10 a.m. \n The head of Italy's civil protection agency says there are no immediate reports of deaths after an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 struck regions already damaged by previous quakes. \n Fabrizio Curcio said some people suffered injuries as numerous buildings that had resisted previous temblors in August and last week collapsed. He did not provide details on the nature or extent of the injuries. \n Curcio says the agency is using helicopters to tend to the injured and to assess damage. \n He says 1,300 people displaced on Wednesday by a pair of powerful aftershocks to an August quake that killed nearly 300 had been evacuated to the coast in recent days and that the operation would continue. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 9:25 a.m. \n The ancient city of Norcia, famed for its Benedictine monastery and its cured meats, is one of the locations hardest-hit by the latest earthquake to rock Italy. \n Eyewitnesses said the St. Benedict cathedral, the 14th century cathedral in one of the city's main piazza, crumbled in the Sunday morning quake and only its facade remains standing. Priests prayed in the piazza amid the rubble. \n Norcia city assessor Giuseppina Perla tells the ANSA news agency, \"It's as if the whole city fell down.\" \n The U.S. Geological Service says the earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 was centered 6 kilometers (3 miles) north of Norcia. \n The city's ancient walls suffered damage, as did another famous Norcia church, St. Mary Argentea, known for its 15th century frescoes. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 9:15 a.m. \n Emergency workers are racing to determine if any people have been killed or injured in the latest earthquake to rock central and southern Italy. \n The Sunday morning quake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 was centered in a mountainous area straddling the central Italy regions of Umbria and Marche. \n The head of the civil protection authority in the March region, Cesare Spuri, says there have been reports of buildings collapsing in many cities. \n A pair of powerful quakes on Wednesday, technically aftershocks from an August earthquake that killed nearly 300 people, may have helped save lives on Sunday. \n Many people still were sleeping in cars or had been evacuated to shelters or hotels in other areas following those strong jolts, leaving the most quake-prone historic centers largely empty of residents. \n \u2014\u2014 \n 8 a.m. \n A powerful earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.6 has rocked central and southern Italy after a week of temblors that have left thousands homeless. \n The European-Mediterranean Seismological Center put the magnitude at 6.6 or 6.5 with an epicenter 132 kilometers northeast of Rome and 67 kilometers east of Perugia, near the epicenter of last week's temblors. It struck at 7:40 a.m. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Nearly 8,000 quake victims being helped by state agency"}

{"date": "October 30, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Philippine defense chief says aerial surveillance shows Chinese coast guard ships are still guarding a disputed shoal but Filipinos were seen fishing there \"unmolested\" for the first time in years. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said Sunday, Oct. 30, 2016, the return of Filipino fishermen to Scarborough Shoal was \"a most welcome development.\" \n MANILA, Philippines >> \n Philippine aerial surveillance showed Chinese coast guard ships were still guarding a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, but they did not harass and stop Filipinos from fishing there for the first time in years, the Philippine defense secretary said Sunday. \n The fishermen's return to Scarborough Shoal, which China effectively seized in 2012, was \"a most welcome development\" because it brings back their key source of livelihood, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said. \n China granted access to the tiny, uninhabited shoal 123 nautical miles (228 kilometers) from the northern Philippines after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte met with President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders this month. After his China trip, Duterte announced without elaborating that Filipinos may be able to return to the shoal soon. \n A Philippine navy plane spotted at least four Chinese coast guard ships around the shoal during a surveillance flight on Saturday, Lorenzana said, adding that an earlier report by the Philippine coast guard that the Chinese had left the area was incorrect. \n \"Flybys of our planes reported Chinese coast guard ships are still there, but our fishermen were fishing unmolested,\" Lorenzana told The Associated Press, adding that the government would try to carry out surveillance flights regularly in the area. \n It's unclear how long China would keep the shoal open to Filipinos or if there were any conditions attached. \n National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr. said, \"There are no written agreements or rules, but Filipino fishermen who went there lately attest that they were not driven away nor were accosted.\" \n There have also been fewer Chinese ships sighted in the area since more than a week ago or around the time Duterte made his visit to China, Esperon said. \n Duterte made clear that the dispute over the shoal was far from over. He said he insisted in his talks with Chinese leaders that the shoal belonged to the Philippines, but that the Chinese also asserted their claim of ownership. \n Since 2012, Chinese coast guard ships had driven Filipino fishermen away from the area, sometimes with the use of water cannons. Farther south in the Spratly Islands, China went on to construct seven islands in recent years despite protests from other claimants and the U.S., which insists on freedom of navigation in what it considers international waters. \n The new development brought joy to the first Filipinos who ventured back to Scarborough in flotillas of small fishing boats. \n \"We're happy that we were able to sail back there,\" said Gil Bauya, who returned Saturday with a huge catch of red snapper and other fish to Cato village in the northwestern province of Pangasinan. \n \"They just let us fish,\" Bauya said, referring to three Chinese coast guard ships fishermen saw at the shoal from a distance. \"We were waiting what they would do, but they didn't do anything like deploying small rubber boats to chase us like they used to do.\" \n After three days of fishing just outside Scarborough's lagoon, where the fish are bigger, Bauya said they ran out of ice to preserve their catch and had to sail back home for the All Saints' Day holiday. Amid the festive air in Cato, where villagers helped them unload their bumper catch, Bauya said he and his crewmen plan to travel back to Scarborough this week. \n Deputy U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Beijing on Saturday that China's withdrawal from Scarborough Shoal would be welcomed by Washington. \n He said it would be consistent with an international arbitration ruling in July that invalidated Beijing's sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea. The July 12 ruling said both Filipinos and Chinese can fish at the shoal, but China ignored it and continued to block and chase away Filipino fishermen until a few days ago. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philippines: China still guarding shoal, but Filipinos back"}

The average store card charges 23.84 percent, much higher than the national average of 15.22 percent for all credit cards. \n So before you sign up, here are a few things you should know: \n It may make sense to use one of these cards for a large purchase or if you are a regular shopper, but only if you can pay off the balance in full. Otherwise the cost of interest charged will far outweigh the benefit, said Matt Schulz, CreditCards.com's senior industry analyst. \n Be wary of zero interest or \"same as cash\" intro periods, which can backfire without timely payments too. If a consumer doesn't pay off their balance in that introductory window, they could owe interest on the entire balance for the full period of time that had passed, not just on the outstanding amount. \n \"It can be a tempting thing because of those discounts,\" Schulz said. \"Don't make the decision right then, take the brochure and read up and chances are all the perks will still be there but you'll make a more informed decision.\" \n A consumer could then use this card as a stepping stone to one with better terms. \n However, Bruce McClary of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling warns that this can be a dangerous step for someone who is having trouble managing the cards they already have. It is far better for someone in that situation to reach out for help from a nonprofit credit counselor rather than get deeper into debt. \n There are a number of cards that offer cash back or other rewards that may rival or beat those of store cards.

{"date": "October 30, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In September 2012, shortly before voters were to choose between Romney and Democratic incumbent Barack Obama, a secretly recorded video emerged that caught the GOP nominee saying 47 percent of Americans pay no taxes and consider themselves as victims. The comment only fed into an existing impression by many voters that Romney wasn't looking out for ordinary people. \n U.S. presidential campaigns are never predictable, although the number of late-breaking, surprise developments in the 2016 campaign may set the mark. \n A historical look at what politicos like to refer to as an \"October Surprise\" \u2014 an unpredictable development that roils the White House race and comes days or weeks, or even earlier than October, before people vote. \n 2016: \n Predatory language, groping allegations, sexting and an FBI emails investigation. It's been the October Surprise that keeps on giving. \n Early in the month, WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of hacked emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. The emails exposed campaign infighting and raised ethical questions about her family's charitable foundation. \n The emails would have driven news coverage entirely if not for the \"Access Hollywood\" recording in which Donald Trump bragged to TV host Billy Bush about sexually assaulting women. Trump dismissed his comments as \"locker room talk,\" but several women have come forward to say Trump made unwanted sexual advances in the past. \n Then came Anthony Weiner. The former New York congressman and estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin had already been disgraced in a string of sexting scandals. But when the FBI opened an investigation into his alleged communications with a 15-year-old girl, the bureau discovered emails that Director James Comey said appeared \"pertinent\" to a previously closed investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server. \n Comey's notice to Congress raised more questions than answers just 11 days before Election Day. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 2012: \n In September, as the race between Republican Mitt Romney and Democratic incumbent Barack Obama was drawing to a close, a secretly recorded video emerged that caught Romney saying 47 percent of Americans pay no taxes and consider themselves as victims. The comment fed into an existing impression by many voters that Romney wasn't looking out for ordinary people. \n Then in late October, Hurricane Sandy devastated the East Coast, giving Obama a chance to showcase his chief executive credentials, get an appreciative response from Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., and leave Romney struggling to strike the right tone. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 2004: \n Democrat John Kerry headed into the final weekend of the campaign feeling good about his chances of beating President George W. Bush. Then Osama bin Laden released a video lauding the 9/11 attacks and criticizing Bush. \n Kerry said he watched the polls freeze and then drop. After the election, Kerry blamed the al-Qaida leader for costing him the presidency. Kerry's theory was that bin Laden's comment had agitated voters. \"It changed the entire dynamic of the last five days,\" Kerry said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 2000: \n Five days before the election, word surfaced that Bush had been arrested on a misdemeanor drunken driving charge in 1976. Republicans said the release of 24-year-old information at such a time was a Democratic dirty trick, and a Democratic activist acknowledged he had tipped off reporters. \n Bush won anyway, but many of his advisers thought the news depressed turnout among social conservatives and made the race much closer than it would have been otherwise. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 1980: \n This was the case of the October Surprise that never happened. \n For a year leading up to the presidential election, Democratic President Jimmy Carter had been trying to secure the release of American hostages in Iran. Critics of Ronald Reagan, the Republican challenger, claim that Reagan's campaign manager and others negotiated privately with the Iranians to ensure that the hostages wouldn't be released just before the election. \n Reagan wound up beating Carter, and the 52 hostages were released the same day that Reagan was inaugurated as president. A congressional task force later concluded there was \"no credible evidence\" of such a deal. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 1972: \n In 1972, as President Richard Nixon was fending off a challenge from Democratic Sen. George McGovern, Nixon authorized national security adviser Henry Kissinger to say \"peace is at hand\" in Vietnam. The late October pronouncement was welcome news to the war-fatigued United States, and bolstered Nixon's re-election mandate. \n It turned out Kissinger's prediction was way off the mark: The heaviest bombing of the war started just before Christmas 1972. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "So far, sexting, groping is 2016's 'October Surprise'"}

{"date": "October 30, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Dakota Access Pipeline protesters sit in a prayer circle at the Front Line Camp as a line of law enforcement officers make their way across the camp to remove the protesters and relocate to the overflow camp a few miles to the south on Highway 1806 in Morton County, N.D., Thursday, Oct. 27, 2016. \n CANNON BALL, N.D. >> The crowdsourcing goal was modest: $5,000, enough to help a few dozen people camping in North Dakota to protest the nearby construction of the four-state Dakota Access oil pipeline. The fund has since topped a staggering $1 million. \n The fund is among several cash streams that have provided at least $3 million to help with legal costs, food and other supplies to those opposing the nearly 1,200-mile pipeline. It may also give protesters the ability to prolong their months-long encampments that have attracted thousands of supporters, as the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe pursues the fight in court. \n And as the number of protest-related arrests increased this week, so did contributions: Funds raked in more than $200,000 between Thursday and Friday alone. \n But demonstrators are quick to note that the amount of money raised and what they have left isn't the same. \n \"It still feels unreal sometimes because it is such an astronomical figure to me,\" said Ho Waste Wakiya Wicasa, the protester who set up the GoFundMe account that's raised more than $1 million, primarily for operating expenses at the camp that took root in April. \n \"The money goes as quickly as it comes, but without it having been as much as it is, we certainly wouldn't have been able to be as productive as we have been in the fight,\" Wicasa said. \n For months now, opponents of the $3.8 billion pipeline \u2014 which is slated to move oil from North Dakota though South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois \u2014 have been camping near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers. They worry the project will disrupt cultural artifacts and hurt drinking water sources on the Standing Rock Sioux's nearby reservation and farther downstream because the pipeline will cross the Missouri River. \n The Texas-based company building the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, insists the project is safe. The tribe is fighting the pipeline's permitting process in federal court. \n Since the number of protesters soared in August in North Dakota, donations started rolling in more frequently and more than 400 people have been arrested \u2014 including more than 140 on Thursday when officers evicted protesters camping on private land recently acquired by Energy Transfer Partners. \n But running a camp \u2014 and readying it for North Dakota's brutal winter \u2014 isn't cheap. The account Wicasa set up has only about $100,000 left as of Friday night, according to LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, a tribal historian and preservation employee who provided family land for one of the smaller encampments. \n The money has been used for grocery store trips every two days that cost about $2,000 each, 20 yurts purchased for $160,000, and around $7,000 for bail money. It has also paid for a storage area, composting toilets, tiny houses, tepees, a medical area and generators powered by solar panels and wind. \n A bookkeeper and an accountant now keep track of the crowd-sourced money. \n \"I got people to take care of,\" Brave Bull Allard said. \"I got to provide homes for people and blankets, thermal wear, socks, hats and gloves, and food. Right now, we are feeding 670 people.\" \n One online legal defense fund has raised more than $655,000 for \"the legal defense of warriors protecting land, water and human rights.\" \n Meanwhile, much of the money the tribe is using for the legal fight is from at least $1.3 million in direct donations, tribal chairman Dave Archambault recently told The Associated Press. He declined to say how much tribal officials have spent so far, saying that could give their opponents an advantage in the legal case. \n Energy Transfer Partners also has declined to provide an estimate of its legal expenses. The tribe is pursuing appeals after losing in lower courts. \n The Standing Rock Sioux didn't solicit money, Archambault said, but asked other tribes for letters of support or formal resolutions. He said it was only after other tribes, including the Red Lake Nation and the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community in Minnesota, inquired about financial contributions that leaders decided to accept money for legal costs. And as the protests continued, the tribe decided to also use part of the money for waste-management services for protesters, he said. \n \"I know the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is not alone; we have overwhelming support,\" Archambault said, adding that his tribe would in return help other tribes \"in their fight against corporations.\" \n Among the donors to online fundraisers is southern New Hampshire resident Carol DiPirro. She gave $30, motivated in part because of a fight her community waged against a natural gas pipeline. \n \"They are saying the same thing: This is our water supply. You run a pipeline through it and it leaks, you are poisoning us. That's exactly what I spent two years of my life saying,\" DiPirro said. \"This really, really struck a chord with me.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Anti-pipeline protester asked for $5,000 but got $1 million"}

{"date": "October 30, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Airbnb hosts in New York are worried about a new law that could lead to them being fined up to $7,500 for renting out their apartments. People who occasionally rent their living spaces for side income say they are getting unfairly swept up in a law aimed mostly at commercial operators. Airbnb has filed a lawsuit to block the law. \n NEW YORK >> Jordan Reeves works for a nonprofit and his partner is a puppeteer. They say there's not a lot of spare income floating around their Brooklyn apartment. That's why they sometimes rent the place through Airbnb for extra cash when they're not there. \n But a new law that carries fines of up to $7,500 for certain kinds of short-term listings is causing headaches for many Airbnb hosts, including Reeves, who say they are getting unfairly swept up in a measure that's more aimed at commercial operators who turn multiple apartments into, essentially, illegal hotels. \n \"Nobody wants illegal hotels \u2026 It seems as though we're in the same bucket as the people who are taking advantage of the situation,\" Reeves said, as he and a group of other hosts gathered across the street from Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office last week to protest the law. \n Signed by Cuomo, a Democrat, on Oct. 21, the law is one of the toughest in the country against Airbnb and other home-sharing platforms. It levies hefty fines against owners or tenants who offer to let others rent out their entire living space for less than 30 days, something that's been illegal in New York for several years but didn't previously carry such penalties. Under the new law, people can still rent out portions of their living spaces, like a single bedroom or a couch, for less than 30 days. It also doesn't apply to some dwellings, like single-family homes or row houses. \n Airbnb protested the law, saying New York was rewarding the hotel industry at the expense of New Yorkers, and has filed a lawsuit against it. \n Supporters of the law said it was necessary, that some property owners take apartments that could be homes for city residents out of circulation to make them short-term visitor rentals, hurting both the city's hotels and its housing market. \n State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office conducted an investigation of Airbnb rentals from 2010 to 2014. It found that 72 percent of the units listed in New York City were illegal, and that 36 percent of rentals came from commercial operators who made up only 6 percent of hosts. \n Eileen Guo, a Queens resident who has used Airbnb to rent out her studio apartment, said that while the industry needed to be regulated, \"there needs to be a distinction, people that live in our homes and also use it for side income and people who are doing it purely for profit.\" She said the law would limit her already occasional use of the platform, to times when she knew she would be able to offer it for more than 30 days. \n Jenny Douglas went the other way \u2014 changing the wording on her listing to make it clear of anyone looking that her Brooklyn apartment, on the garden level of her single-family home, wasn't covered by the law and available for short stays. \n \"Oh my gosh, I was a little panicked,\" she said, before she did some digging and realized the law didn't apply to her. But she was concerned potential renters, hearing about the law, would be reluctant to look at New York City listings, so she made the change. \n \"I wouldn't want them to feel anxious that they might come here and the door might be padlocked,\" she said. \n While Douglas said she hoped the law Cuomo signed wouldn't be the last word on the subject, she did think it was an issue that needs to be figured out. \"It feels like this probably needed to happen in order for us to look at what we're dealing with.\" \n Michaela Hall, who used Airbnb to find a last-minute place to stay when she came to New York City last month, said she was concerned about the impact of the law on prices. She prefers to rent out entire apartments with the residents gone, as opposed to sharing a portion of a home with the tenant there. \n If there are going to be fewer entire apartment listings, and less competition, \"then people will probably raise their prices a little bit,\" the Maryland woman said. \"Hopefully they won't go too high so that I'm not saving anything over reserving a hotel room.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Small-time Airbnb hosts say NY law unfairly targets them"}

{"date": "October 30, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Aaron Rabinowitz poses for a picture in front of the freezer where his father died, at the family's Gelato Vero Caffe in San Diego. Rabinowitz's father, Henry Rabinowitz died inside the freezer in 2007. Experts say the deaths are preventable, but it's not likely the federal government will draw up any specific regulations dealing with freezers. One reason: They're more inclined to enforce broad rules for employers, such as making clear exits available. \n ATLANTA >> Trapped in a walk-in hotel freezer with subzero temperatures, Carolyn Robinson Mangham knocked so desperately on the door that the skin on her knuckles had worn away, her husband said in a lawsuit. \n When the door finally opened 13 hours later, the coroner said, the 61-year-old kitchen worker was lying on the metal floor, wearing her black shoes and pants, a white cook's shirt and a black apron. Her head and eyes were frozen solid. \n Mangham, who died in March in Atlanta, was among a handful of workers who, in the last 15 years, were found dead in freezers, federal records show. Some were trapped by broken doors and either froze to death or were overcome by lethal fumes. \n Experts say the deaths are preventable, but it's not likely the federal government will draw up any specific regulations dealing with freezers. One reason: They're more inclined to enforce broad rules for employers, such as making clear exits available. \n \"This should never happen. It's tragic, and the families are left with devastation,\" said Kim Bartels, whose brother Jay Luther died in a walk-in freezer in 2012. \n Luther, a 47-year-old chef and co-owner of a cafe in Nashville, Tennessee, went into his restaurant's freezer and the door shut behind him. For reasons not explained, there was no release mechanism to open the door, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded in its report. Luther suffocated from breathing carbon dioxide vapors that came off dry ice inside the freezer, a medical examiner found. \n \"There's no question that technologies exist \u2014 old and new \u2014 that could address this issue,\" said David Ringholz, chairman of the industrial design department at Iowa State University. \n Motion sensors, for instance, could disable doors anytime movement is detected inside a large walk-in freezer, he said. Other experts suggested alarms, a cellphone or even an axe kept inside to help someone get out. \n Some safety upgrades would cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, and that expense can be a big obstacle to improvements. \n Adam Finkel, a former OSHA regional administrator for the Rocky Mountain states, recalled when a 55-year-old woman died inside a freezer at a lodge in Colorado in 2002. \n \"That one really struck me as a terrible way to go,\" said Finkel, now executive director of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania. \n There had been problems with the freezer door at the Westin Peachtree Plaza hotel in Atlanta, according to the lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages. Several months before her death, an exit mechanism failed inside the 12-by-10 freezer, and a hotel employee \"had to beat on a back wall in order for someone to let her out,\" the medical examiner's report states. \n When Mangham died, the medical examiner, OSHA and a representative of an equipment servicing company performed more than 30 tests on the door's exit device, and it opened properly each time, hotel spokeswoman Sally McDonald said. \n However, three weeks later, the exit button malfunctioned during a follow-up inspection, this time trapping two people, who had to beat on the door to alert others outside to free them, the autopsy report states. \n OSHA found that the hotel exposed workers to hazards, and levied a fine of more than $12,000 in Mangham's death. The hotel agreed to frequent and regular inspections of its freezers, including the door-release mechanisms, the agency said. \n After Mangham's death, her co-workers and their union, UNITE HERE, demanded that emergency buttons be placed inside the freezers so that if someone becomes trapped, that person can alert building security or the fire department. So far, the hotel hasn't said whether they plan to have the buttons. \n Such devices would be similar to those already in most elevators, said Lee Gray, an architectural historian at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte who wrote a book about the passenger elevator. \n Westin Peachtree Plaza workers are also pushing for a better way of tracking employees, so that if someone disappears as Mangham did, others will know to look for them. The hotel has agreed to develop a procedure for workers to check in and out with others when they enter remote areas, OSHA said. \n The hotel and its parent company, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, have not said whether they are considering changes at any other hotels in the company. Starwood was acquired this year by Marriott International for $13 billion, creating the world's largest hotel company. \n In the wake of Mangham's death, the government could draft new rules and regulations or issue a bulletin or safety alert about the dangers of becoming trapped in freezers, which could raise awareness, said Celeste Monforton, a former OSHA official now with Texas State University. \n But creating new, overly specific regulation is sometimes not helpful, said Wayne Li, director of the Innovation and Design Collaborative at the Georgia Institute of Technology. If regulations are too specific, they don't account for new technological advances and can become outdated and stifle innovative approaches, Li said. \n Aaron Rabinowitz found his father dead inside the freezer of his family's San Diego cafe nine years ago. He said he thinks that some type of alarm would be a good idea, though it may not have helped his father because he was quickly overcome by the dry ice fumes. \n \"I'm in there myself daily,\" said Rabinowitz, who now runs the cafe. \"There are safety latches. They can freeze up where you have to give it a really good kick. Somebody who is not strong enough might have trouble with it, so I think that (the alarms) would be a nice extra level of safety beyond a safety latch.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trapped: Deaths inside freezers can be prevented, but how?"}

{"date": "October 30, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n FBI Director James Comey prepares to testify on Capitol Hill in Washington. Comey's announcement that his bureau was reviewing new emails possibly relevant to Hillary Clinton's private email server investigation has thrust him into the public spotlight again just days before Election Day. \n WASHINGTON >> Hillary Clinton's campaign on Sunday pressured FBI Director James Comey to release more details about the emails he says could be related to the investigation into her use of a private email server, including whether Comey had even reviewed them himself. \n Tim Kaine, Clinton's running mate, said Comey owed it to the public to be more forthcoming about the emails under review by the FBI with only 10 days remaining before Nov. 8 election. Kaine's message aimed to counter Republican rival Donald Trump, who has seized on the reignited email controversy in hopes of sewing fresh doubts about Clinton's trustworthiness. \n \"As far as we know now, Director Comey knows nothing about the content of these emails. We don't know whether they're to or from Hillary at all,\" Kaine said. The Virginia senator said if Comey \"hasn't seen the emails, I mean they need to make that completely plain. Then they should work to see the emails and release the circumstances of those once they have done that analysis.\" \n Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, said Comey's handling of the matter was \"inappropriate.\" Podesta urged Comey to be more transparent because the disclosure came \"in the middle of the presidential campaign so close to the voting.\" \n Comey's actions Friday roiled the White House race, energizing Trump as polls had showed him sliding and unnerving Democrats worried about the presidency and down-ballot congressional races. \n The FBI is looking into whether there was classified information on a device belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced ex-congressman who is separated from longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Comey, in a letter to Congress on Friday, said the FBI had recently come upon new emails while pursuing an unrelated case and was reviewing whether they were classified. \n Clinton's team tried to make it cases on the Sunday news shows, joining Democratic leaders who have said it was \"unprecedented\" for such FBI action so close to an election. \n Her campaign has called on Comey to release all the facts known so far, and they have criticized his letter because, they contend, it lacks crucial details. \n Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Comey was in \"an impossible spot\" when he acknowledged the FBI was looking into the messages. \"Had he sat on the information, one can argue that he also would be interfering in the election,\" by failing to disclose the review, Conway said. \n Clinton said in Florida on Saturday that it was \"pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election\" and accused Trump of using the issue to mislead voters in the final leg of the campaign. \n Trump told a crowd in Golden, Colorado, on Saturday that the FBI's review of Clinton email practices raises \"everybody's deepest hope that justice, as last, can be properly delivered.\" His crowd cheered Clinton's email woes, which Trump has taken to calling the biggest political scandal since Watergate. \n The controversy over Clinton's email practices while she served as secretary of State has dogged her for more than a year. \n Late Saturday, four senior Democratic senators urged the Justice Department and the FBI to provide more detailed information by Monday about what investigative steps are being taken, the number of emails involved and what is being done to determine how many of the emails are duplicative of those already reviewed by the FBI. \n The letter went to Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch from Sens. Ben Cardin of Maryland, Tom Carper of Delaware, Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Dianne Feinstein of California. \n Comey spoke Saturday with the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Judiciary Committee, said Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. \n Goodlatte said he and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., encouraged Comey to make as much information as possible public before the election. He said the FBI chief \"did not give us any response in terms of what more he could say.\" \n Goodlatte said he also asked Comey about the status of the request from the House Republicans on the referral \"of potential impeachment \u2014 I'm sorry \u2014 potential perjury charges to be brought with regard to Ms. Clinton and he deferred to the Justice Department itself. He did not answer that question as well.\" \n The slip about impeachment reflected the GOP promise, if Clinton is elected, to doggedly investigate her. \n A government official told The Associated Press on Saturday that the Justice Department had advised the FBI against telling Congress about the new developments in the Clinton investigation because of the potential fallout so close to the election. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and discussed it on condition of anonymity. \n Justice officials concluded the letter would be inconsistent with department policy that directs against investigative actions that could be seen as affecting an election or helping a particular candidate, the official said. \n Kaine and Goodlatte appeared on ABC's \"This Week,\" Podesta and Conway were on CNN's \"State of the Union\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton team: Comey should say whether he's reviewed emails"}

{"date": "October 30, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A U.S. official told The Associated Press the newly discovered emails emerged through the FBI's separate sexting probe of former congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of close Clinton confidant Huma Abedin. \n NEW YORK >> Once a hard-charging young congressman, Anthony Weiner lost his career and his marriage to a habit of trading sexually explicit messages that he couldn't shake \u2014 a lurid tale of personal self-destruction that's suddenly found its way into the race for president. \n Weiner is separated from Huma Abedin, the vice chairwoman of Hillary Clinton's campaign and one of the Democratic nominee's closest aides. It's the federal investigation into his sexting habits that is the \"unrelated case\" that led the FBI to a new batch of emails, which agency director James Comey told Congress on Friday may be \"pertinent to our investigation\" into Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state. \n And that has once again cast a spotlight on Weiner, one-time rising Democratic Party star whose very name has become a punchline. \n Weiner was forced to resign his seat in Congress in 2011, after accidentally posting a picture of himself in his underwear \u2014 a private message intended for a woman who was not his wife \u2014 to his Twitter account. \n Abedin stood by him, and he had the audacity to ask for the voters' forgiveness and run for mayor two years later. He spent time atop the polls, until fresh evidence emerged that he hadn't given up his sexting habit and destroyed his campaign. \n When Weiner was caught again sending racy messages last summer, Abedin left him. Federal investigators started a probe in September into whether he had sexted with a 15-year-old girl. \n \"I am filled with regret and heartbroken for those I have hurt,\" Weiner said after he and Abedin separated, lamenting what he called his \"terrible judgment.\" \n The former congressman did not respond to repeated requests for comment Saturday, as the impact of his sexting extended far beyond his household. \n Clinton, who has referred to Abedin as a \"second daughter,\" lashed out Saturday at the FBI's handling of a new email review that arrived as unexpectedly as did the revelation that Weiner was involved. \n The development led to a chorus of Democratic leaders decrying the bureau's actions, which came with a little less than two weeks remaining before Election Day. Clinton called it \"unprecedented\" and \"deeply troubling,\" and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, said there was \"no indication this is even about Hillary.\" \n The brash, liberal, ambitious and media-savvy Weiner spent seven terms in the House, building a profile as \"a Democrat who fights\"\u2014 an amateur hockey player always ready for a face-off with Republicans. \n Some critics saw him as heavy on self-promotion and light on legislative accomplishments. But liberal supporters cheered his willingness to confront the GOP on such issues as public radio funding, Planned Parenthood, health benefits for 9/11 first responders and President Barack Obama's health care plan. \n Wise-cracking and scrappy, Weiner once suggested C-SPAN viewers start a drinking game in which they'd down a shot for every Republican misstatement during a debate on the health care plan \u2014 \"please assign a designated driver,\" he quipped. \n As Twitter became popular, he proved a natural at delivering provocations, 140 characters at a time. And then it proved to be his undoing. \n In May 2011, a photo of a man's bulging underpants appeared on Weiner's Twitter account. By then married and expecting a baby with Abedin, Weiner initially claimed his Twitter account had been hacked. \n But after more racy messages and photos emerged, Weiner acknowledged engaging in \"inappropriate\" exchanges with several women. He said he was getting treatment and resigned at a chaotic news conference, compete with hecklers shouting such comments as, \"Bye-bye, pervert!\" \n Weiner, however, wasn't out of the public eye for long. \n In 2013, he belatedly jumped into the race for mayor of the nation's biggest city, a prize he'd eyed since a strong primary run in 2005. \"I think that it's up to New Yorkers to decide whether I get a second chance or not, and I hope the answer's yes,\" he told The Associated Press. \n While some voters were aghast, Weiner topped polls of the primary field for several weeks until a woman went public with smutty messages and photos she said the candidate had sent to her, using the alias \"Carlos Danger.\" \n He acknowledged he'd found new sexting partners after his resignation from Congress, saying he'd since stopped. But his mayoral bid disintegrated into angry exchanges with voters and ended with a middle-finger farewell to reporters after he lost the Democratic primary. \n Still, Weiner didn't entirely leave the public stage. Over time, he re-emerged as an incisive political observer on a local cable news station, in one of the city's tabloids and on Twitter, until his reputation unraveled still further earlier this year. \n This past spring, a documentary feature film about his mayoral bid made viewers wince as they watched how he and Abedin had tried to keep the campaign and their marriage going. \n Then, in August, a new batch of sexts became public, including a bulging-underwear shot \u2014 with Weiner and Abdein's toddler son in the frame \u2014 that a woman said she'd received from Weiner in 2015. \n By then deeply engaged in Clinton's campaign, Abedin issued a short statement saying she had decided to leave Weiner. \"Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life,\" it said. \n Weeks later, a 15-year-old girl told DailyMail.com that Weiner had sent her sexually explicit text and video messages. Weiner acknowledged communicating with her, but suggested her claims of X-rated exchanges were a hoax. \n He added: \"I have no one to blame but me for putting myself in this position.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Anthony Weiner rocks race for president with sexting scandal"}
