{"date": "November 4, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n University of Virginia administrator Nicole Eramo, left, listens to attorney Libby Locke, right, speak with the media outside the federal courthouse in Charlottesville, Va. \n RICHMOND, Va. >> Days after Rolling Stone magazine published a shocking 9,000-word story about a brutal gang rape at the University of Virginia in November 2014, the magazine's editors received an email just before 2 a.m. with \"Our worst nightmare\" in the subject line. They needed to run a retraction, the reporter said. \n Instead, Rolling Stone kept the article on its website for four months before finally pulling it down that April and officially retracting the story. \n That decision was enough to convince a federal jury in Charlottesville on Friday that the magazine defamed a university administrator, who claimed she was cast as the \"chief villain\" in the now-discredited story \"A Rape on Campus.\" \n The 10-person jury found also found that journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely and the magazine's publisher were responsible for libel, with actual malice. \n Eramo claimed the article falsely said she discouraged the woman identified only as \"Jackie\" from reporting the incident to police. A police investigation found no evidence to back up Jackie's claims about being raped. \n Eramo was seeking $7.5 million from her lawsuit. Jurors are expected to return to court next week to decide how much to award her. \n The decision comes at a time when the public's distrust of the press runs deep and is the latest in a year that brought large judgments against other media outlets. \n In March, former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan won a $140 million invasion-of-privacy verdict against Gawker for posting a sex tape of him. Gawker settled with Hogan for $31 million this month. \n Last month, The News & Observer of Raleigh was ordered to pay about $6 million in a State Bureau of Investigation agent's libel lawsuit. \n Samantha Barbas, a law professor at the University of Buffalo, said it appears that media outlets are being threatened with and hit with more lawsuits than ever, and juries seem more willing to side with people who claim they've been injured by the press. \n \"The climate seems to be one where people, especially public figures, don't fear taking on the press as they might have in the past,\" said Barbas, who studies the intersection of the First Amendment, culture, media and privacy. \n The magazine also faces a $25 million defamation lawsuit from the University of Virginia's Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, where Jackie claimed her sexual assault took place. \n Because the judge determined that Eramo was a public figure, she had to prove Rolling Stone made statements with \"actual malice,\" meaning it knew that what it was writing about her was false or entertained serious doubts about whether it might be true. \n Jurors found that the magazine and its publisher, Wenner Media, acted with actual malice because they republished the article on Dec. 5 after they knew about the problems with Jackie's story. The magazine put an editor's note on top of the story that day acknowledging its reporting mistakes, but did not use the word retraction and kept the story online. \n Rolling Stone's attorneys argued that the editor's note was effectively a retraction, but jurors rejected that idea. The magazine did not say it was officially retracting the article until the following April. \n The jury also found that Erdely acted with actual malice on six claims: two statements in the article and four statements to media outlets after the story was published. In one instance, Erdely wrote in the story that Eramo had a \"nonreaction\" when she heard from Jackie that two other women were also gang-raped at the same Virginia fraternity. \n Libby Locke, an attorney for Eramo, said she and her client are pleased with the decision. \n \"The jury's verdict is a complete vindication of Nicole Eramo, and a complete repudiation of Rolling Stone's and Ms. Erdely's false and defamatory article,\" Locke said in an email. \n In a statement Friday, Rolling Stone apologized to Eramo and others impacted by the article. A spokeswoman for the magazine said she couldn't say whether it plans to appeal the decision. \n \"It is our deep hope that our failings do not deflect from the pervasive issues discussed in the piece, and that reporting on sexual assault cases ultimately results in campus policies that better protect our students,\" the magazine said. \n David S. Ardia, an assistant professor of law and co-director of the Center for Media Law and Policy at the UNC School of Law, said the magazine's statement Friday suggests it is likely to ultimately settle rather than appeal the verdict. \n \"Most defendants issue a statement saying they plan to fight at every level of appeal possible,\" but that's not what Rolling Stone said on Friday, he said. \n Defendants contest the jury's ruling because they often win on appeal even when they lose in front of the jury, Ardia said. But in this case, there is a great deal of evidence that seems to point to significant doubt about the story \u2014 not in the reporter's mind but in editors' minds \u2014 at the time the story was published, he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "For Rolling Stone, 'worst nightmare' continues"}

Pennsylvania is a state where Clinton has long had a solid lead; it has not voted for a Republican in six presidential elections. \n The celebrity firepower only adds to what's an already deep bench of political surrogates eager to campaign for Clinton. On Friday, Vice President Joe Biden campaigned in Wisconsin, Sen. Bernie Sanders in Iowa, and Obama in North Carolina. \n Trump, whose controversial campaign has divided the Republican Party, has appeared with a ragtag group of supporters including former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight. An event with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie scheduled for Saturday was canceled after two of his top aides were found guilty Friday on all counts for their roles in the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal. \n \"I didn't have to bring J-Lo or Jay Z,\" Trump told a crowded rally Friday night in Hershey, Pennsylvania. \"I am here all by myself. Just me. No guitar, no piano, no nothing.\" \n In a new ad, Trump tells voters that they are \"the only force strong enough to save our country\" from a \"corrupt political machine.\" \n The New York billionaire spent Friday on a tour of rural areas, hoping to boost turnout among the voters drawn to his promise to bring back a lost America. He started his day in Atkinson, New Hampshire, population 6,800 and almost 98 percent white, according to the Census Bureau. From there, he was bound for Wilmington, Ohio, another overwhelmingly white town where just 13 percent of its 12,500 residents have a college degree. \n Speaking more than 2,000 miles from the Mexican border, Trump drew loud cheers in Atkinson when he vowed to build a massive wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The crowd booed when he contended that Clinton supports open borders. \n \"Her plans would mean generations of terrorism, extremism and radicalism spreading into your schools and through your communities,\" he said. \n Trump and Clinton will be campaigning in Florida on Saturday, last-ditch efforts to win support in a state where early voting has already exceeded 2012 levels. Clinton's team was encouraged by strong Latino turnout, particularly around Miami. But the Democrats have seen their chances decline in Ohio, a key battleground state that's been leaning toward Trump, and New Hampshire, where Clinton's numbers are weakening. \n In spite of a close race in national polling, Trump's path to victory remains narrow. His campaign is increasingly looking to make up for losses among suburban voters, particularly college-educated women, by attracting new voters in out-of-the-way places. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Steve Peoples and Kathleen Hennessey in Washington and Josh Lederman in Fayetteville, North Carolina, contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump says he's fine by himself; Clinton hangs with Beyonc\u00e9"}

{"date": "November 4, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Illinois Democratic U.S. Senate candidate, Rep. Tammy Duckworth, left, and Republican U.S. Senator Robert Kirk. \n CHICAGO >> Making a final pitch to keep his U.S. Senate seat, Republican Mark Kirk kicked off a debate with Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth by again apologizing for mocking her immigrant background and her family's military service. He later added \"I am absolutely not a racist.\" \n Duckworth, a McKinley High School and University of Hawaii graduate, entered Friday night's debate at ABC7 in Chicago as the favorite in a contest that will help determine if Democrats retake control of the Senate. Illinois has historically favored Democrats for statewide office, especially in presidential election years, and Duckworth has a healthy lead in the polls. \n Kirk and Duckworth also tangled over issues like immigration. And the candidates, who are both disabled, assured voters that they're capable of serving as Illinois' next U.S. senator. \n Here's a look at some of their exchanges: \n HE SAID WHAT?  \n Kirk used his opening remarks to try to repair some of the damage from last week's debate. \n Duckworth, who was born in Thailand to a Chinese-Thai mother and American father, said during a face-off in Springfield that her family served in the U.S. military dating back to the Revolution. Kirk responded that he'd forgotten the congresswoman's \"parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.\" \n The comment made Kirk a target of social media scorn and lost two endorsements from organizations who called his remarks racist. \n Kirk apologized the next day via Twitter, and Duckworth accepted his apology. \n On Friday he thanked her for doing so, adding \"you are to be honored\" for her service. \n He later said that he wasn't thinking when he made the comment, which he called a \"mistake.\" \n \"Sometimes I've been too quick to turn a phrase,\" he said. \n HEALTH RECORDS  \n Kirk suffered a stroke in 2012, returning to work one year later after a yearlong rehabilitation in which he had to relearn how to walk and talk. Duckworth lost both legs when the helicopter she was co-piloting was shot down in the Iraq War. \n Asked if they're healthy enough to serve, both candidates said yes. \n Kirk has faced the most questions about his health. The typically conservative Chicago Tribune editorial board endorsed Duckworth, saying they didn't think Kirk could fully serve because of his stroke. \n Kirk noted Friday that his physician released a letter saying he made a full cognitive recovery. He said he's set to climb the stairs of the Willis Tower on Sunday. \n Duckworth said she also thinks Kirk is capable of doing the job, adding \"the problem is he's not doing it.\" \n Duckworth said she completed the Chicago marathon in her wheelchair last month. She released full medical records showing she has no major health problems and she said Kirk should do the same. \n IMMIGRATION  \n Duckworth and Kirk also sparred over their records on immigration, a back-and-forth that included Kirk speaking at times in Spanish. \n Kirk noted he broke with most of his party to vote in favor of comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. Switching between Spanish and English, he nodded toward Duckworth at one point and said \"she does not speak Spanish.\" \n Duckworth said Kirk has been inconsistent on the issue and that, as the daughter of an immigrant, she knows how important immigration reform is. \n \"We need to get to work on this,\" she said. \n At a post-debate news conference, Duckworth busted out some language skills of her own, speaking in Thai while answering a question posed by a reporter from Thailand. \n The debate was presented in conjunction with the Spanish-language station Univision Chicago and the League of Women Voters of Illinois. \n CLOSING ARGUMENTS  \n Kirk worked throughout the debate to persuade voters in the left-leaning state that he's independent of the GOP, noting he supports abortion rights and gun control. He also blasted Duckworth as ineffective. \n Duckworth noted Kirk's penchant for controversial comments. They've included calling an unmarried senator a \"bro with no ho.\" \n She said she wants to go to Washington to fight for working and middle-class families. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Duckworth, Kirk debate, GOP senator says he's not a racist"}

Arraj Courthouse past signs placed by those protesting against the ban to take selfie photos by voters showing a completed ballot, in Denver, Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016. Colorado is one of the states where such a ban is being challenged in court. \n DENVER >> A judge ruled that Colorado voters can post ballot selfies on social media sites, differing from recent federal court decisions on the laws just before Election Day. \n U.S. District Judge Christine Arguello ruled late Friday that Colorado can't enforce an 1891 law preventing voters from disseminating their marked ballots. The ruling said polling places may still enforce local rules banning photography due to privacy concerns. However, no resident will be prosecuted for sharing images of completed ballots on social media. \n The order comes the same week that judges in New York and California upheld bans, saying changing the rules so close to the election would create confusion for voters and polling place workers. \n Colorado election officials testified about those concerns. The judge said her ruling does not change existing elections laws. \n Denver's district attorney argued he would not bring charges against anyone who posted a ballot selfie. \n But the judge said the fear of prosecution alone, and the possibility that investigators would demand a selfie be deleted, is enough to chill free speech and could hinder political organizing via social media at a key time in the election. \n \"By issuing an injunction in this case, Coloradans get what they are entitled to\u2014clarity on an issue that implicates fundamental constitutional rights,\" Arguello wrote in her ruling. \n A recent review by The Associated Press showed ballot selfies are legal in 20 states and the District of Columbia, illegal in 17 states and the legal status is mixed or unclear in the rest. \n Colorado's Deputy Secretary of State Suzanne Staiert stood by the ban. \"We still believe it is a good protection against intimidation and vote buying and a number of other vote fraud crimes,\" she said after the ruling Friday night. \n Colorado Sen. Owen Hill, a Republican who challenged the selfie ban, called the law archaic and potentially damaging to efforts to boost voter turnout. \n \"There is something special about highlighting to people, 'Here's who I voted for, I'm proud of it,'\" said Hill, who takes his four children into the voting booth with him and sees no difference between that perfectly legal practice and sharing a ballot selfie on Instagram. \n On the other side, economist Jeffrey Zax testified that ballot selfies have the potential to revive 19th century-style vote-buying, though he could point to no modern evidence of it. \n \"When it's difficult for someone to prove the way they voted, it's much harder to sell your vote,\" Zax testified. \"With a cellphone camera, ballot secrecy is eradicated.\" \n Arguello's ruling states voters can still be prosecuted for using images as proof in vote-buying schemes. \n The ruling in Colorado is temporary and doesn't mean that the ban won't be upheld by a court later. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Judge allows Colorado voters to post ballot selfies online"}

{"date": "November 4, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People watch a TV screen showing the live broadcast of South Korean President Park Geun-hye's address to the nation, at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> Tens of thousands of South Koreans are expected to march in Seoul to demand President Park Geun-hye's resignation on Saturday, a day after she took blame for a \"heartbreaking\" scandal and rising suspicion that she allowed a mysterious confidante to manipulate power from the shadows. \n Police expect around 40,000 people in what could be the largest anti-government rally in nearly a year while organizers say as many as 100,000 will turn out. \n Dozens of police buses were parked in streets around City Hall and also a square in front of an old palace gate, which the police plan to close off to prevent protesters from marching toward the Blue House, the presidential office and residence. \n Smaller protests have taken place daily in past weeks amid growing calls for Park to step down, although opposition parties have yet to make a serious push for her resignation or impeachment for fears of negatively impacting next year's presidential elections. \n In Friday's televised apology, Park vowed to accept a direct investigation into her actions, but the opposition, sensing weakness, immediately threatened to push for her ouster if she doesn't distance herself from domestic affairs and focus on diplomacy, and accept a prime minster chosen by the parliament. \n \"I feel a huge responsibility (for the scandal) deep in my heart,\" Park said, her voice shaking. \"It is all my fault and mistake.\" \n Park's comments were rife with astonishing moments, and included a frank assessment of her relationship with the woman at the heart of the scandal, Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a late cult leader and a longtime friend of Park's. \n \"I put too much faith in a personal relationship and didn't look carefully at what was happening,\" Park said. \"Sad thoughts trouble my sleep at night. I realize that whatever I do, it will be difficult to mend the hearts of the people, and then I feel a sense of shame and ask myself, 'Is this the reason I became president?'\" \n In another exceptional moment, Park denied media speculation that she had \"fallen into worshipping cult religions or that shamanistic rituals were held at the presidential Blue House.\" \n Her comments come at what may well prove to be the crucial moment of her presidency. Park is attempting to show the contrition and sense of responsibility that South Koreans demand while also trying to re-establish her tarnished credibility. She is in the fourth year of a single five-year term and faced criticism even before this scandal, particularly for the government's response to a 2014 ferry sinking that killed more than 300 people. \n One national poll released earlier Friday had her approval rating at 5 percent, the lowest for any president in South Korea since the country achieved a democracy in the late 1980s following decadeslong dictatorships. \n \"Anyone found by the current investigation to have done something wrong must be held responsible for what they have done, and I am also ready to face any responsibility,\" Park said. \"If necessary, I'm determined to let prosecutors investigate me and accept an investigation by an independent counsel too.\" \n Last week Park surprised many when she acknowledged that she had relied on Choi for help editing presidential speeches and other undefined \"public relations\" issues. \n Anger has exploded in the days since, with media reports claiming that the influence Choi went much deeper. There are reports that Choi reviewed and made recommendations on government policy papers and pushed businesses to donate millions of dollars to two foundations that she controlled. Other reports speculate Choi also helped choose presidential aides and even picked out Park's wardrobe. \n Park has fired eight presidential secretaries and nominated three new Cabinet members, including the prime minister, but opposition parties described Park's personnel reshuffles as a diversionary tactic. \n Soon after Park's speech, the main opposition Democratic Party said her apology lacks sincerity and issued a set of demands that it says Park must immediately accept if she doesn't want see rallies calling for the end of her government. The demands include Park withdrawing her prime minister nomination in favor of a new person recommended by the National Assembly for the country's No. 2 job; and accepting separate investigations by lawmakers and an independent counsel. \n \"The president now comes right into a dead end,\" party chief Choo Mi-ae said. Park \"must comply with what the people want.\" \n Park may survive what has become the worst patch of an already rocky term. But if she is forced to name a prime minister chosen by the opposition, it will hamstring her authority and may end her ability to govern. \n Only Choi has been formally arrested in connection with the scandal. Prosecutors on Friday requested an arrest warrant for ex-Park aide, Ahn Jong-beom, for his alleged involvement in extracting $70 million in donations. On Wednesday night, prosecutors detained another ex-presidential aide, Jeong Ho-seong, for allegedly leaking confidential documents to Choi, and are reviewing whether to seek an arrest warrant for him, too. \n Park said she couldn't talk about many specifics because of the investigation, but she was frank in her comments about Choi, who has been the subject of widespread rage. \n Choi was \"a person who stood with me during the hardest moment in my life,\" Park said in her speech, apparently referring to the assassinations of Park's mother and later her father, the dictator Park Chung-hee. \"It's true that I lowered my guard and my sense of wariness\" of Choi. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Thousands to demand resignation of South Korea's Park amid scandal"}

{"date": "November 4, 2016", "text": "JORDAN STRAUSS/JOEL RYAN/INVISION/AP \n Actor Benedict Wong, right, posed for photographers upon arrival at the launch event of the film 'Doctor Strange', at Westminster Abbey in London on Oct. 24. Tilda Swinton arrived at the Los Angeles premiere of \"Doctor Strange\" at the TCL Chinese Theatre on Oct. 20. \n LOS ANGELES \u00bb Director Scott Derrickson knew he had a problem on his hands before the internet did. Two, actually. \"Doctor Strange,\" now in theaters, contained in its rich tapestry of mind-bending visuals, ideas and dimensions, two very stereotypical East Asian characters \u2014 a wise Tibetan mystic, The Ancient One, and a servant, Wong. \n Though deplorable, it wasn't uncommon for the time. The comic was first published in 1963, just two years after Mickey Rooney donned buck teeth and a horrifying accent to play the landlord Mr. I.Y. Yunioshi in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's.\" \n Derrickson knew \"Doctor Strange\" wasn't going to work as written. \n \"I went through my own mental gymnastics to try to grapple with what I was supposed to do \u2014 what the right thing was to do,\" Derrickson said. \n He settled on a twofold decision. For The Ancient One, he cast a woman, Tilda Swinton. And for Wong he cast British actor Benedict Wong and rewrote the part to be more substantial. \n However, making The Ancient One a woman, also, consequently, led to the decision to cast a non-Asian actor in the role \u2014 a move that would end up sparking a social-media firestorm. \n \"I didn't think there was any possible way to avoid the stereotypes of the old magical Asian mentor or a Dragon Lady,\" Derrickson said. \n When news of Swinton's casting broke in May 2015, blog posts and articles celebrated the decision. Some called it \"perfect casting.\" The Hollywood Reporter praised the actress's refusal \"to be pigeonholed in any way.\" \n A year later, though, the tide had turned. Swinton's casting was no longer inspired but widely regarded as \"whitewashing.\" The Hollywood Reporter scolded it for being \"well-intentioned, but thoughtless.\" \n A few things had changed in the entertainment landscape that awakened public awareness about the all-too common practice in the industry: a kerfuffle at the Oscars with Asian stereotypes; Emma Stone's half-Asian character in \"Aloha\"; and a first-look image of Scarlett Johansson playing a Japanese character in \"Ghost in the Shell\" that dropped around the same time as the first \"Doctor Strange\" teaser. Matters were further enflamed when screenwriter C. Robert Cargill said that casting a Tibetan actor would have just alienated China. \n The outrage prompted Marvel to issue a rare statement. They noted their track record of diversity, praised Swinton's casting and explained that \"The Ancient One\" was a moniker, not a character and this one was Celtic. But the whitewashing stigma persisted and even grew as further controversies emerged. \n Derrickson cringes at the term whitewashing. \n \"It's such a pejorative word that implies racist intent. I didn't have that. I had nothing but the best intent,\" he said. \n For the actors involved, it's complicated. They acknowledge and support the cries for more diversity on screen, but also support their film and the roles they play. \n \"I'm not remotely surprised that there's an outcry about the lack of accurate representation of the diversity of our world in Hollywood cinema,\" Swinton said. \"It's an unfortunate misunderstanding about this film \u2014 the irony being that (the adaptation) was trying to not perpetuate offensive racial stereotypes, and, by the by, cast a sorcerer supreme as a woman. But it can be both and it's all true and I hope that when people see the film they understand.\" \n Benedict Wong is also in the uncomfortable position of balancing celebration of the positive change seen in his and Swinton's casting with the knowledge that East Asian actors are undervalued in Hollywood \u2014 especially in big-budget superhero films. \n \"I didn't really know there were any Asian superheroes, which was always a little bit questionable when I was watching all of these Marvel movies,\" Wong said. \"I started to delve into the comics and saw that this character needed to be portrayed properly, you know, for the ancestors.\" \n He also likes that the cast of \"Doctor Strange\" is actually quite diverse. Chiwetel Ejiofor, for instance, plays a role previously drawn as a white man. But Wong understands the complaints too. \n \"It's a snowball of frustration of what's happened previously,\" he said. \"I think they're doing a great job with this. But more needs to be done.\" \n Wong is an ambassador for the advocacy group Act for Change, which is urging the industry's gatekeepers to find new, diverse talent. \n \"If these producers fall short of names, tap me up, call me. Let me show you a wealth of East Asian talent that's around,\" Wong said. \n In the end, the controversy has allowed the \"Dr. Strange\" team to reflect on the implications of even well-intentioned decisions. \n \"I care about diversity. I think diversity is the responsibility of directors and I knew I wanted a really diverse cast,\" said Derrickson. \"I just did the best I could. I made the best decisions I could. I still think they were the best decisions.\" \n But Derrickson also notes Hollywood \"has an abysmal track record when it comes to Asian representation and the only way that is going to change is by activists being angry and loud. I don't fault them.\" \n As for \"Doctor Strange,\" he hopes the movie will speak for itself. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Good intentions spark 'Doctor Strange' whitewashing controversy"}

{"date": "November 4, 2016", "text": "LOS ANGELES \u00bb In a pioneering prosecution against \"body shaming,\" the Los Angeles city attorney's office today filed criminal charges against a former Playboy playmate, alleging she secretly photographed a 70-year-old woman in the nude while she was in the shower area of a Los Angeles fitness center. \n Prosecutors often use invasion of privacy charges against peeping Toms and people who conceal cameras to take sexually suggestive photos of women. But legal experts said this marks a rare time authorities have brought charges against someone over photos making fun of someone's weight. It comes amid growing awareness and outrage about \"body shaming\" \u2014 particularly common on social media. \n Mathers later apologized for taking a photo of the woman in a locker room shower at an LA Fitness exercise center and posting it online. \n \"That was absolutely wrong and not what I meant to do,\" she said. \"I know that body shaming is wrong. That is not the type of person I am.\" \n She said the photo was meant to be sent as a private message, but was posted publicly. \n Mathers' attorney Thomas Mesereau said his client did nothing illegal. \n \"I am disappointed that Dani Mathers was charged with any violation,\" he said. \"She never tried to invade anyone's privacy and never tried to violate any laws.\" \n City Attorney Mike Feuer said today that it was important to send a message with the criminal charges filed against Mather. \n \"Body shaming is humiliating, with often painful, long-term consequences,\" he said. \"It mocks and stigmatizes its victims, tearing down self-respect and perpetuating the harmful idea that our unique physical appearances should be compared to air-brushed notions of 'perfect.' What really matters is our character and humanity. While body shaming, in itself, is not a crime, there are circumstances in which invading one's privacy to accomplish it can be. And we shouldn't tolerate that.\" \n Los Angeles police began an investigation in July after receiving a report of \"illegal distribution\" of the image. LA Fitness officials reported the posting to police as well, officials said. \n Mathers shared the photo of the naked woman July 13 with the caption: \"If I can't unsee this then you can't either.\" \n Leonard Levine, a veteran Los Angeles defense attorney who has defended cases involving gym photos, said all those cases involved alleged voyeurs. This case is different because the motive for sharing the photo appears to be solely mocking the woman. \n \"I am not aware of any case where it was done other than where prosecutors alleged it a prurient interest,\" he said. \n Former prosecutor Dmitry Gorin agreed the circumstances here are unique. \n \"Most have some lascivious intent. In this case, the aspect of the shaming is a very unusual motive that I have not seen prosecuted before,\" he said. \n Lawyers for Mathers could say the alleged victim did not have an expectation of privacy, said Louis Shapiro, a Los Angeles defense attorney. \n \"Mathers can argue though that a person has no expectation of privacy in the locker room when they are undressed and that the prosecution is simply trying to stick a square peg in a round hole because they don't have the evidence for the charge they really want to prove \u2026 ,\" he said. \n Digital technology has made the capturing of others secretly in their most private moments easier. \n A prominent Washington, D.C., rabbi last year was sentenced to six years in prison after he pleaded guilty to secretly recording 52 women as they prepared for a religious bathing ritual. \n In California, a U.S. Border Patrol supervisor admitted in federal court that he secretly recorded seven female co-workers in the bathroom of the Chula Vista office. Some states have increased the penalties for taking secret images, making it a felony. In New York offenders can get up to four years in prison for a first offense. \n ", "author": "By Tribune News Service", "title": "Ex-Playboy model charged in gym 'body-shaming' photo case"}

Kohlhepp was arrested Thursday, in connection to the discovery of a woman chained up in a storage container on a property in Woodruff, S.C. \n SPARTANBURG, S.C. \u00bb Investigators found a body today during a search of land in South Carolina where a missing woman was discovered \"chained up like a dog\" in a large storage container, and there may be more remains in the area, a prosecutor said. \n The body has not been identified, but prosecutor Barry Barnette said that the woman saw her captor shoot and kill her boyfriend. \n Referring to the possibility of other victims, the sheriff said authorities were \"trying to make sure that we don't have a serial killer on our hands.\" \n Todd Christopher Kohlhepp, a 45-year-old registered sex offender with previous kidnapping conviction, appeared at a bond hearing today in Spartanburg on a kidnapping charge. \n More charges would be filed, Barnette said in court. \n The judge did not set bond and instead referred the matter to circuit court. The suspect did not appear to have an attorney, and the judge urged him to get one. \n The missing woman was found Thursday inside a container measuring about 30 feet by 15 feet. Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said she told him the bodies of other women could be buried on the land owned by Kohlhepp. \n The woman's boyfriend, 32-year-old Charles Carver, has also been missing after the couple disappeared in late August. \n Investigators began excavating the area after cadaver dogs signaled the possible presence of remains. \n Acting on a tip, deputies found the woman after hearing her banging inside the container in Woodruff, 80 miles northwest of the state capital of Columbia, the sheriff said. \n The woman, who had worked for Kohlhepp, had a chain around her neck, Wright said. She told deputies she had been kept in the container for two months and had been fed regularly. \n Anderson Police Chief Jim Stewart said his department's investigation into the couple's disappearance led authorities to the property near Woodruff. \n \"We got computer and cellphone records that ultimately led us to the area in Woodruff,\" Stewart said. \"We knew that was the last place that a cellphone tied to this case pinged.\" \n Records indicate Kohlhepp is a licensed real estate agent and licensed pilot.

He was convicted the following year. \n In court today, Barnette said the Arizona case occurred when Kohlhepp kidnapped a 14-year-old girl, took her to his house and raped her after binding her with duct tape. \n Arizona prison records also list violations while Kohlhepp was in prison. The records say he destroyed property and fought with others while incarcerated in 1988 and 1991. \n Associated Press writers Jack Jones in Columbia, S.C.; Jonathan Drew in Raleigh, N.C.; and Paul Davenport in Phoenix contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Body discovered after woman found chained up 'like a dog'"}

{"date": "November 4, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager sat in the courtroom, today, in Charleston, S.C. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Walter Scott, left, was shot by police officer Michael Thomas Slager in Charleston, S.C., as seen in this April 4, 2015 video screenshot. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Ninth Circuit Solicitor Scarlett Wilson, left, spoke with Feiden Santana, who made the cell video showing former North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager's fatal encounter with Walter Scott, as Santana testified in Slager's murder trial, today, in Charleston, S.C. \n CHARLESTON, S.C. \u00bb Jurors at a former policeman's murder trial today viewed the cellphone video that stunned the nation, showing officer Michael Slager firing eight shots at the back of an unarmed man who was running away. \n Slager's defense team did not want the jury to see the video, made by a bystander who pressed record after spotting the white North Charleston policeman chasing after the black man. \n Feidin Santana was already late to work that day in April 2015, but he moved closer and kept recording as Walter Scott wrestled with Slager over the officer's stun gun. The video shows Scott breaking away until he's shot from a distance and crumples to the ground. \n \"For some reason I decided to use my phone to record and prevent something that might happen,\" the 25-year-old barber testified. \"It was something I will never forget.\" \n Slager's defense had sought to keep the video out of the trial, but didn't object after Santana took the stand. The defense did ask that the jury be instructed that the proper perspective to consider the action would be from the perspective of the officer. They also wanted the judge to prevent the video from being shown in slow-motion. \n Judge Clifton Newman denied both requests, saying \"I don't seek to control the manner in which the state presents its evidence.\" \n Slager, who was fired from the force and charged with murder after the video surfaced, faces 30 years to life if convicted. \n Santana testified that he was talking with a friend on his cellphone and walking to work when he suddenly saw a black man running toward him. \n \"A few seconds later I saw a second person \u2014 an officer \u2014 chasing the guy,\" Santana said. \"I froze because I didn't know what was going on,\" he recalled. \n Then, as the situation unfolded, he decided to press record and approached a fence around the grassy area where Slager and Scott briefly wrestled on the ground, before Scott broke free and ran. \n \"I continued hearing an electric sound,\" Santana said. Scott \"just kept trying to get away from the Taser I was hearing. I didn't know if it was a Taser. It was just electric.\" \n The defense says the two men fought over the Taser, but Santana said he never saw it in Scott's hands, and never saw Scott on top of the officer. He said Scott got away and began running before he was shot down. \n Santana also explained why he did not immediately give the video to the North Charleston police. \n As a legal permanent resident of the U.S., he said he didn't want to be caught up in legal proceedings before returning home to the Dominican Republic. Also, he said he initially thought Scott was still alive, so perhaps the video wouldn't really matter. \n He said he told another North Charleston police officer at the scene that he had video of the slaying, and the officer told him he should stay around, but Santana thought better of that. As a biracial man, he said he worried for his own safety in North Charleston in the days after the shooting. \n \"There were only three people there \u2014 Walter Scott, the officer and me,\" he said. \n Once he learned Scott was dead, Santana said, he reached out to representatives of the Scott family, and it was their attorneys who released it to the media. Later, he turned over his phone to agents from the State Law Enforcement Division. \n He said he didn't know the video would appear everywhere, but once it was, he agreed to interviews and later received royalties that he used to buy a car and help his son and daughter. He also said he paid his own air fare to return to South Carolina for the trial. \n On cross-examination, defense attorney Andy Savage questioned Santana, who also is a musician, about some lyrics he wrote months before the shooting, which include the phrase: \"Those who must defend us are the worst criminals. Who can I trust?\" \n Savage asked if that was how he saw things when he made the recording. \n \"I'm not against any law enforcement, any officer,\" Santana replied. \"I am against police brutality.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "S.C. jurors watch video of officer shooting fleeing unarmed man"}

Chris Christie, was held by her lawyer Michael Critchley while talking to reporters after she was found guilty on all counts in the George Washington Bridge traffic trial at Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Court, today, in Newark, N.J. \n NEWARK, N.J. \u00bb Two former aides to Gov. Chris Christie were convicted today of creating an epic traffic jam at the George Washington Bridge for what prosecutors say was political revenge, capping a trial that cast doubt on Christie's claims he knew nothing about the scheme. \n Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, a Christie appointee to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were found guilty of all counts against them. Kelly cried as the verdict was read; Baroni showed no emotion. Both defendants announced plans to appeal. \n Christie said today that the verdict affirmed his decision to terminate Baroni and Kelly and that the jury held them responsible \"for their own conduct.\" He repeated his assertions that he had no knowledge of the plot and said he would \"set the record straight\" soon about \"the lies told by the media and in the courtroom.\" \n \"I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and had no role in authorizing them,\" Christie said. \"No believable evidence was presented to contradict that fact. Anything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue.\" \n Prosecutors said Kelly and Baroni plotted with Christie ally David Wildstein to close lanes at the foot of the nation's busiest bridge \u2014 a span that connects New Jersey to New York City \u2014 and create gridlock in September 2013 to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee for not endorsing Christie for re-election. \n Kelly, Baroni and Wildstein all testified that Christie was informed about the lane closings either before or while they were going on. \n Baroni's attorney, Michael Baldassare, called the case a disgrace and said the U.S. attorney's office should be \"ashamed\" of where it drew the line on who to charge. \n \"They should have had belief in their own case to charge powerful people and they did not,\" Baldassare said. \n U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said today that prosecutors only charged people where they had \"evidence beyond a reasonable doubt\" to convict. \n The federal jury took five days to reach a verdict in the scandal that helped sink Christie's Republican campaign for president. The verdict on charges including conspiracy, misapplying the property of the Port Authority, wire fraud and deprivation of civil rights came before the judge ruled on a request by defense attorneys to declare a mistrial in the case. \n The most serious charges carry up to 20 years in prison. Sentencing was scheduled for Feb. 21. \n Democratic state Sen. Loretta Weinberg, who helped lead a legislative effort to investigate the lane closings, said it was a terrible day for New Jersey and \"a terrible day to have a spotlight on the kind of administration that was run.\" \n Wildstein, a high-ranking Port Authority official, pleaded guilty to orchestrating the scheme and was the prosecution's star witness. He faces a maximum of 15 years in prison but is expected to be sentenced to much less. His sentencing hasn't yet been scheduled. \n Kelly and Baroni testified they believed the lane closings were part of a legitimate traffic study because, they said, that was what Wildstein told them. \n The defense portrayed Wildstein as a liar and a dirty trickster \u2014 \"the Bernie Madoff of New Jersey politics\" \u2014 and argued that Christie and his inner circle had thrown the 44-year-old Kelly under the bus. \n \"They want that mother of four to take the fall for them. Cowards. Cowards,\" Kelly attorney Michael Critchley said in a thundering closing argument. \n One of the most damning pieces of evidence was an email in which Kelly wrote: \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\" Then, as the four days of gridlock unfolded and Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich complained about children unable to get to school, she texted: \"Is it wrong that I am smiling?\" \n On the stand, Kelly explained that she was referring to what she thought was a traffic study and expressing satisfaction that it was going well. As for why Kelly deleted the messages, her lawyer suggested she was afraid she was about to be made the scapegoat. \n Wildstein said that Christie was told about the traffic jam as it was happening and that he laughed and sarcastically joked that nothing political was going on when he learned of Sokolich's distress over not getting his calls returned. \n But it was not clear from Wildstein's testimony whether Christie knew the bumper-to-bumper mess was manufactured for political reasons. And Kelly testified that she told Christie the lane closings were a traffic study when she informed him of the plans about a month ahead of time. \n Siding with prosecutors, U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton told jurors they didn't have to find that Kelly and Baroni, also 44, knowingly intended to punish Sokolich in order to convict them of conspiracy. \n The gridlock began on the first day of school and held up commuters, school buses and emergency vehicles. Sokolich's pleas went unanswered for four days \u2014 on orders from Wildstein, the defendants testified. \n At the time, Christie was considered a top GOP presidential contender and was trying to run up a big landslide re-election victory to demonstrate his crossover appeal as a White House candidate. \n Christie ultimately dropped out of the presidential race after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary and said recently that the scandal probably influenced Donald Trump's decision not to pick him as his running mate. Christie is a now a top Trump adviser and has campaigned for him. \n Christie was expected to campaign for Trump in battlegrounds Pennsylvania and New Hampshire this weekend. A message left with the Trump campaign today wasn't immediately returned. \n While the trial did not definitively pin the scheme on Christie, it reinforced his reputation among his critics as a bully, with accounts of profane tirades, threats of bodily harm and tough-guy posturing among the governor and his inner circle that seemed straight out of \"The Sopranos.\" \n Christie once threw a water bottle at Kelly in anger, she testified. And Wildstein told the jury that Christie called him \"Mr. Wolf,\" after the character in the movie \"Pulp Fiction\" who is called in to clean up dead bodies. \n According to testimony, Christie's office also used the Port Authority to punish or reward local politicians. Among the goodies the agency dispensed were pieces of steel from the original World Trade Center, destroyed on 9/11. \n \"These convictions will be an essential defining feature of Christie's legacy in office, and will forever taint how his administration is perceived and will be remembered,\" Montclair State University political science professor Brigid Callahan Harrison said. \"He is damaged by the narcissistic way in which he was portrayed during the trial, a narrative that was accepted by the jury.\" \n Associated Press writers Ula Ilnytzky in Newark and Michael Catalini and Michael R. Sisak in Trenton contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Guilty of all counts, 2 ex-Christie allies vow to appeal"}

{"date": "November 4, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Paris hotel-casino employees waited outside of the establishment for updates of the power outage on Thursday, in Las Vegas. \n LAS VEGAS \u00bb Electricity was restored and a major hotel at the heart of the Las Vegas Strip reopened today after a complete blackout and overnight evacuation blamed on damage to the main basement electric line. \n The 2,900-room Paris Las Vegas was declared open shortly before daybreak \u2014 nearly 20 hours after the hotel, casino, restaurants and shopping areas plunged into what a hotel spokesman called pitch darkness. \n \"We're 100 percent open for business,\" Caesars Entertainment Corp. spokesman Rich Broome told reporters. \"We are not expecting any additional electrical issues going forward.\" \n About 3,000 guests and gamblers were forced out after the power was cut Thursday morning and a backup source failed to kick in. \n Broome said hotel fees were being waived and free stays would be provided for guests who were prevented from returning to their rooms in the 33-story hotel, and to arrivals who had to find another place to stay. \n The outage was called an accident \u2014 occurring when a worker cut into the power main during authorized and scheduled work in a sub-basement. Hotel and county officials said there was no indication of sabotage or foul play. Broome declined to identify the contractor. \n No injuries were reported, but Clark County Fire Chief Greg Cassell said 11 people were rescued from five separate elevators, and a few people suffered from anxiety-related issues. No one was hospitalized, Cassell said. \n Power was cut about 9:45 a.m. Thursday. The full evacuation was ordered after noon, when the fire alarm system battery power ran low and backup generators didn't kick in. \n Broome said officials are investigating why auxiliary power didn't function as expected. \n As night fell, the iconic faux Eiffel Tower lit up, but the hotel remained dark and authorities decided it was too late to promise to let guests back in. Only people who needed prescription medication were escorted by hotel and security officials to their rooms. \n Entrances to the hotel were draped in yellow crime scene tape and firefighters went door-to-door inside the darkened building to make sure everyone was out, the fire chief said. \n The outage drew comparisons to an Easter Sunday 2004 blackout that lasted three days at the 3,000-room Bellagio resort across Las Vegas Boulevard. Business losses in that case were estimated in the millions of dollars. \n Broome said estimates of the loss due to Thursday's outage weren't immediately known. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Vegas Strip resort reopens after power outage, evacuation"}

Kohlhepp was arrested Thursday, Nov. 3, 2016, in connection to a woman being found chained inside a storage container on a property in Woodruff, SC. \n ANDERSON, S.C. >> A woman who had been reported missing along with her boyfriend in late August was found \"chained up like a dog\" inside a storage container, a South Carolina sheriff said Thursday. \n Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright told news outlets that deputies acting on a tip found her after hearing her banging on the container from the inside Thursday in the town of Woodruff, 80 miles northwest of the state capital of Columbia. \n Wright said she had a chain around her neck. He says she told deputies she had been kept in the container for two months and had been fed regularly. \n The sheriff said the container measured 30 feet by 15 feet by 10 or 12 feet. It was chained and locked. A message seeking additional comment from the sheriff's office wasn't immediately returned Thursday. \n Anderson Police Chief Jim Stewart said his department's investigation into the disappearance of the woman and Charles Carver, her 32-year-old boyfriend, led authorities to the property near Woodruff where the woman was found. Carver is still missing. \n Stewart said more than a dozen search warrants were issued. \n \"We got computer and cellphone records that ultimately led us to the area in Woodruff,\" Stewart said. \"We knew that was the last place that a cellphone tied to this case pinged.\" \n The sheriff said a registered sex offender identified as Todd Christopher Kohlhepp has been arrested in connection with the incident. Wright said the woman, who worked for Kohlhepp, has told investigators that there may be other victims. \n \"We're trying to make sure that we don't have a serial killer on our hands,\" Wright said. \n Records indicate Kohlhepp is a licensed real estate agent as well as a licensed pilot.
