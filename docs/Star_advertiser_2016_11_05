{"date": "November 5, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump \n PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. >> Donald Trump is promising to take his campaign into traditional Democratic territory as a sign that he's not giving up on appealing to people outside the Republican Party. Hillary Clinton is focusing her efforts in the campaign's final days on energizing voters who usually support the Democratic nominee, but may need an extra boost. \n To do that, Clinton is pressing her case with music and sports celebrities, a strategy Trump dismissed. \"I just have me,\" he told supporters in North Carolina on Saturday, \"but I have my family.\" With him was his wife, Melania, who rarely campaigns with her husband. \n A brief scare Saturday night disrupted Trump's rally in Reno, Nevada, when Secret Service agents suddenly hustled the Republican nominee off the stage. The agency later said that someone near the stage had shouted \"Gun!\" but that a subsequent apprehension of a man and search revealed no weapon. Trump returned a few minutes later to resume his remarks and declared \"We will never be stopped.\" \n As if to prove that point, Trump scheduled rallies Sunday in Minnesota, which hasn't supported a Republican nominee since 1972, and Michigan, which hasn't since 1988. Polls show that unlikely to change this year, but Trump was including them in a single day of campaigning covering five states. \n Clinton faced dark skies, intense rain and strong wind in Florida on Saturday before appearing in Pennsylvania with pop singer Katy Perry. The Democratic nominee was preparing to campaign Sunday with basketball superstar Lebron James, having shared the stage Friday night with music diva Beyonc\u00e9 and hip hop mogul husband Jay Z. \n \"Tonight, I want to hear you roar,\" a smiling Clinton said before introducing Perry for a Saturday night performance in Philadelphia. \n Perry, who hugged Clinton while wearing a purple cape bearing the words, \"I'm with Madam President,\" shouted, \"In three days, let's make history!\" \n The final-days scramble highlighted sharp differences between the campaigns in a turbulent 2016 campaign season. \n Backed by President Barack Obama and her party's political elite, Clinton spent much of the last year fighting to unify Obama's coalition of minorities and younger voters, aided at times by Trump's deep unpopularity among women in both parties. \n Trump has courted working-class white voters on the strength of his own celebrity, having scared off many would-be Republican allies during a campaign marred by extraordinary gaffes and self-created crises. Just four weeks ago, a video emerged in which a married Trump admitted to kissing women and grabbing their genitalia without their permission. \n Clinton also faced extraordinary challenges of her own in recent days after the FBI confirmed plans to renew its focus on the former secretary of state's email practices. The development is seen as particularly threatening for Clinton in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire that don't offer early voting. \n At least 41 million Americans across 48 states have already cast ballots, according to an Associated Press analysis. That's significantly more votes four days before Election Day than voted early in the 2012. \n House Speaker Paul Ryan campaigned Saturday alongside Trump's running mate, Mike Pence \u2014 a rare show of unity, but not with Trump himself. \n The speaker encouraged Republicans to \"come home\" to support Trump in Ryan's home-state Wisconsin, ignoring for a day his icy relationship with the Republican nominee. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump, Clinton take different strategies to shore up votes"}

The artificial intelligence service will also be made available in Samsung's other consumer electronics products, such as refrigerators. \n The company declined to disclose what specific tasks the S8 phone will perform through its artificial intelligence feature. \n Samsung is expected to unveil the next iteration for its flagship Galaxy device in spring as it has typically done in the past. Sales of the Galaxy S8 will be crucial for the recovery of Samsung's mobile business, which saw its latest quarterly profit nearly wiped out by two global recalls of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. Samsung estimates it has lost at least $5.3 billion as it discontinued the model, which overheated and caught fire. \n The company said last month that it has not figured out what went wrong with the Note 7 phones. \n The South Korean company joined the race to create the digital assistant service when it acquired in October Viv Labs Inc., a Silicon Valley startup launched by the same entrepreneurs who sold Siri to Apple. Past and current Samsung phones offer a voice assistant service called \"S Voice\" developed internally, but the feature did not gain much traction. \n Samsung's acquisition of the Silicon Valley firm was seen as its taking another step to seek independence from Google, which offers its brand of virtual assistant service in Android-powered devices. \n Executives at Samsung and Viv Labs said that the biggest difference between the existing digital assistant and the one they are jointly developing is that the latter will be an \"open AI platform,\" meaning that third-party developers will be able to offer their services through Samsung's AI platform. \n \"Our Galaxy smartphones don't provide services that enable consumers to order pizza or coffee, but does provide third party applications. But the new AI platform will enable consumers to do things that they would usually do through a separate third party application,\" Samsung's statement said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Samsung to offer digital assistant service in Galaxy S8"}

But the apologies did little to assuage simmering public anger, which culminated in the largest anti-government rally in the capital in nearly a year on Saturday when tens of thousands of people demanded that Park step down. \n The Seoul Central District Court granted prosecutors' request for the arrest of Ahn Jong-beom, Park's former senior secretary for policy coordination who is suspected of pressuring companies into making large donations to nonprofit organizations controlled by Park's friend, court spokesman Shin Jae-hwan said. \n The court also issued an arrest warrant for Jung Ho-sung, another former presidential aide accused of passing on classified presidential documents to Choi Soon-sil, whose close relationship with Park triggered the scandal. \n Prosecutors on Sunday also summoned for questioning Woo Byung-woo, former senior presidential secretary for civil affairs who has been blamed for failing to prevent Choi from influencing state affairs and is embroiled in separate corruption allegations surrounding his family. \n Park has admitted that she sent drafts of her speeches to Choi for editing. However, she avoided more damning allegations raised by the media that Choi perhaps meddled in important government decisions on policy and personnel. Choi was arrested earlier in the week on charges of abuse of authority and attempted fraud. \n Tens of thousands of people rallied in Seoul on Saturday calling for the resignation of Park. But opposition parties, demanding that Park to step away from domestic affairs and transfer the duties to a prime minister picked by the parliament, have yet to make a serious push for Park's resignation or impeachment over concerns of negatively impacting next year's presidential race. \n Holding banners, candles and colorful signs that read \"Park Geun-hye out\" and \"Treason by a secret government,\" a sea of demonstrators filled a large square in front of an old palace gate and nearby streets, singing and thunderously applauding speeches calling for the ouster of the increasingly unpopular conservative president. \n They shifted into a slow march in streets around City Hall, shouting \"Arrest Park Geun-hye,\" \"'Step down, criminal\" and \"We can't take this any longer,\" before moving back to the square and cheering on more speeches that continued into the night. \n \"Park should squarely face the prosecution's investigation and step down herself. If she doesn't, politicians should move to impeach her,\" said Kim Seo-yeon, one of the many college students who participated in the protest. \"She absolutely lost all authority as president over the past few weeks.\" \n Choi Kyung-ha, a mother of three, said her children asked her who Choi was \"and whether she's the real president, and I couldn't provide an answer.\" \n Police estimated the crowd at 45,000, although protest organizers said about 200,000 people turned out. \n Park has tried to stabilize the situation by firing eight aides and nominating three new top Cabinet officials, including the prime minister, but opposition parties have described her personnel reshuffles as a diversionary tactic. \n One national poll released Friday had Park's approval rating at 5 percent, the lowest for any president in South Korea since the country achieved democracy in the late 1980s following decades of military dictatorship. \n Opposition parties, sensing weakness, immediately threatened to push for her ouster if she doesn't distance herself from domestic affairs and transfer the duties to a prime minister chosen by parliament. The parties have also called for a separate investigation into the scandal led by a special prosecutor. \n Park has 15 months left in her term. If she resigns, an election must be held within 60 days. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "2 former aides of Park arrested as S. Korea scandal widens"}

Two Secret Service agents quickly surrounded Trump, then hustled him away. \n In a statement, the Secret Service said a person in front of the stage had shouted \"Gun!\" but that no weapon was found after a search of the person and the immediate area.

The 23-year-old former player also took cellphone videos of the June 2013 dorm room rape and emailed them to friends in California while the crime was ongoing. \n He was found guilty in 2015 but that verdict was overturned after lawyers learned that the jury foreman had not revealed that he had been a victim of statutory rape. Vandenburg was convicted again in June, on five counts of aggravated rape, two counts of aggravated sexual battery and one count of unlawful photography. \n He faced a sentence of 15 to 25 years in prison, and his victim had asked for the maximum punishment. \n The woman, whom Vandenburg had begun dating shortly before the attack, did not appear in court Friday, but a prosecutor read her statement to Davidson County Criminal Court Judge Monte Watkins. \n \"Please do not use my absence as an excuse for leniency, as it in no way diminishes the profound and insidious impact of Mr. Vandenburg on me and my life,\" she wrote. \"I still ask that he receive the full sentence allowed under the law for orchestrating a sustained 30-minute gang rape against me, a defenseless woman who trusted him. The minimum sentence is not enough for what this man did to me.\" \n Vandenburg, already in jail since his second conviction, was also added to the state sex offender registry. \n The Associated Press does not normally identify victims of rape or sexual assault. The woman, who has since graduated from Vanderbilt and is pursuing a Ph.D. at another school, has tried to preserve her anonymity despite being forced to testify at multiple trials. \n Vandenburg apologized to her Friday. He told Judge Watkins that he was ashamed of what he had done and blamed it on alcohol. \n \"My judgment was severely impaired, and I'm sad for everyone involved,\" Vandenburg said. \n The judge reiterated that this has been one of the saddest cases he has ever heard. He said Vandenburg abused the woman's trust in the man she was dating. \"But for him, it would not have happened,\" Watkins said. \n Cory Batey, Vandenburg's former teammate, was convicted in a separate retrial and sentenced to 15 years. \n The cases of two other former teammates facing rape and other charges \u2014 Jaborian \"Tip\" McKenzie and Brandon Banks, who remain out on bond \u2014 have yet to be resolved. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ex-Vanderbilt football player gets 17 years for campus rape"}

The men, technicians working on an airport construction project, were seized Sept. 19 by armed, masked men who blocked their vehicle in Ghat, a Sahara Desert city in southwestern Libya near the border with Algeria. \n A number of criminal and extremist groups operate in the area, but it wasn't immediately clear which group was involved. \n \"Today is a moment of relief and joy that I would like to share with the families of our technicians,\" Italian Premier Matteo Renzi said, expressing special thanks to Libyan authorities and security forces. \n Italy identified the Italians as Danilo Calonego and Bruno Cacace and the Canadian citizen as Frank Poccia. Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said the two Italians had not been mistreated during their captivity and were in good health. \n Chantal Gagnon, the spokeswoman for Canada's Global Affairs department, would not comment on Poccia's health, saying his family has requested privacy. She said the Canadian government does not pay ransom requests and officials would not comment on whether or not a ransom was discussed. \n The ANSA news agency said the Italians were employed by an Italian construction company. It was not immediately clear whether Poccia worked for the same company. \n Italian prosecutors questioned the men for hours Saturday, seeking more information about possible terrorist involvement in the case.

{"date": "November 5, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Oct. 11, 2016, file photo, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., campaigned in Villanova, Pa. \n WASHINGTON >> Control of the Senate hung in the balance as candidates from Nevada to New Hampshire made their closing pitches to voters today after a tough and costly campaign. Republicans feared their slim 54-46 majority could slip away as they battled cross-currents from all sides, not least their unconventional presidential nominee, Donald Trump. \n The GOP Senate candidates in Pennsylvania and Nevada, Sen. Pat Toomey and Rep. Joe Heck, left voters guessing to the end on whether they were voting for Trump. Both refused to say, in Heck's case after initially backing Trump, then un-endorsing him last month after tape surfaced in which Trump boasts he can get away with groping women. \n In New Hampshire, incumbent GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte was neck-in-neck with Democratic challenger Gov. Maggie Hassan. Ayotte faced voter anger at home after her own un-endorsement of Trump. \n \"I would like to see her support her nominee,\" Daniel Peltier, 21, of Littleton, New Hampshire, said as he finished up breakfast at The Coffee Pot restaurant where Ayotte was campaigning Saturday morning. \n Halfway through a statewide tour with 50 stops in five days, Ayotte told diners: \"I will kick butt, but I need your vote.\" \n Overall, Republicans faced a challenging Senate map, defending 24 seats compared with 10 for the Democrats. Democrats need to pick up five seats to take the majority, or four if Hillary Clinton wins the White House and could send her vice president to break ties in a 50-50 Senate. \n Democrats seemed likely to defeat GOP incumbents in Illinois and probably Wisconsin. Republican senators in Florida, Arizona and Ohio appeared to have comfortable leads. \n But a half dozen states could go either way Tuesday: Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana. \n In Pennsylvania, Toomey sprinted across Philadelphia's critical suburbs, attending at least six different events. \n Speaking to about 80 party faithful at a Veterans of Foreign Wars post in West Chester, Toomey criticized Democrat Katie McGinty as a would-be collaborator on a tax and regulatory policy \"that is absolutely devastating our whole economy.\" \n But Toomey is running a very different message on TV, where ads showing primarily in the Philadelphia area feature praise from President Barack Obama over Toomey's work on gun issues. \n That led to a stinging rebuke from the president Saturday. \"Pat Toomey won't tell Pennsylvania voters where he stands on Donald Trump, trying instead to have it both ways by telling different people what he thinks they want to hear,\" Obama said in a statement. \n Democrats accused Ayotte of similar mixed messages as she sought to appeal to potential ticket-splitting voters in New Hampshire. Ayotte produced an online ad with images of Chelsea Clinton as the Democratic nominee's daughter campaigned at local colleges. \n Hundreds of millions of dollars were being spent by both sides, through the official party committees and super-PACs aligned with the Senate leaders, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. \n Reid's retirement after five terms created a vacancy in Nevada that is the one Democratic-held seat being seriously contested by the GOP. Heck faced former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, who would be the first Latina U.S. senator and hoped to benefit from Latino voters' suspicion of Trump and a hefty get-out-the-vote effort by Nevada unions. \n Cortez Masto stopped by a Mexican grocery store late Friday where some people waited hours to cast their votes on the final day of early voting and where elections officials extended the cutoff two hours to accommodate crowds. Nevada Republicans planned a massive weekend get-out-the-vote push to try to counteract Democrats' strong performance in early voting, but Heck himself was making fewer appearances than Cortez Masto after struggling to explain his stances on Trump. \n In North Carolina, Missouri, Indiana, Florida and Wisconsin, Republican incumbents were supporting Trump, though with varying degrees of enthusiasm. And GOP operatives complained that unlike a normal election year, when the top of the ticket would be working as a team with down-ballot candidates, that level of cooperation was absent on the Republican side even as Democratic candidates were benefiting from strong support from the Clinton campaign. \n Two GOP incumbents who arguably should be safe in Republican-friendly states were in extremely tight races: Sens. Roy Blunt in Missouri and Richard Burr in North Carolina. Blunt faced an energetic young Democrat, Secretary of State Jason Kander, who was capitalizing on voters' outsider mood to tag Blunt as a Washington insider, a message he tried to pound home on a bus tour in the final weekend of the campaign. Blunt responded with new messaging criticizing the \"Clinton-Kander\" agenda. \n In North Carolina, in keeping with a laid-back style that's given national GOP operatives fits, Burr was traveling on his own for much of the day without his campaign staff in tow, with plans to attend a fish fry in Catawba County in late afternoon. His opponent, Democrat Deborah Ross, spent part of Saturday encouraging voters on the final day of early voting. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Marc Levy in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Michelle Rindels in Las Vegas, Holly Ramer in Littleton, New Hampshire, and Gary Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina, contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Senate control in question as candidates make final pitches"}

He has no significant staffing presence on the ground in key states. And he has been unwilling to invest in a major advertising campaign to keep pace with his Democratic rival. \n Clinton's campaign has spent more than $267 million in television advertising through Election Day. Trump, who claims a net worth of roughly $10 billion, has invested $93 million, according to data collected by Kantar Media. \n His entire campaign strategy has hinged on an aggressive schedule packed with massive rallies. The path of his luxury campaign jet has been fueled by somewhat risky ambition at times, however. \n Rather than hunkering down in must-win Florida this weekend, Trump flew Saturday to Democratic-leaning territory: Wilmington, North Carolina, then Reno, Nevada, and Denver. And as defiant as ever, he promised to make subsequent appearances in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota. \n Minnesota hasn't cast its electoral votes for a Republican since 1972. A Republican nominee hasn't won Michigan or Pennsylvania since 1988. \n \"We're going into what they used to call Democrat strongholds, where we're now either tied or leading,\" he said in Florida. \n Later in the day in North Carolina appearance, he mocked Clinton's schedule: \"She doesn't have what it takes to do rallies all over the place. She wants to go home and go to sleep.\" \n Trump may not have Clinton's celebrities, but he has relied on his family for public support at times. \n On Saturday, he made a rare campaign stop with his wife, Melania Trump, whose appearance came as The Associated Press revealed more details about her early employment in the U.S. \n The AP found that Melania Trump was paid for modeling jobs in the United States worth $20,056 that occurred in the seven weeks before she had legal permission to work in the country, according to detailed accounting ledgers, contracts and related documents from 20 years ago. \n While showering his wife with affection, Trump also boasted Saturday that he doesn't need stars to fill his venues. \n He campaigned Saturday with retired football coach Lou Holtz and actor Joe Piscopo.

{"date": "November 5, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Todd Kohlhepp was escorted into a Spartanburg County magistrate courtroom on Friday in Spartanburg, S.C. \n WOODRUFF, S.C. >> When he was 15 and facing charges he raped a neighbor after forcing her into his home at gunpoint and tying her up, Todd Christopher Kohlhepp's father told court officials the only emotion the teen was capable of showing was anger, and a neighbor called him a \"devil on a chain.\" \n Fifteen years after he was released from prison for that crime, Spartanburg County deputies were brought to his property by the last known cellphone signals of two missing people. On Thursday, they found a woman chained in a container for two months. She told investigators that Kohlhepp shot and killed her boyfriend in front of her. \n It was an abrupt, but perhaps not unexpected turn for a man who spent his 20s in prison but after his release managed to get a private pilot license, build a real estate firm with more than a dozen agents and buy nearly 100 acres of land and put an $80,000 fence around it. On that land, dozens of officers continued to search Saturday for any additional bodies after the woman told investigators Kohlhepp claimed to have killed at least four others. One body has been found so far. \n Kohlhepp, handcuffed and wearing an orange jumpsuit, could be seen on the property Saturday with deputies. He was there for less than an hour, The Greenville News reported. The Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office would not confirm he was brought to the site. \n As a teen, Kohlhepp was cold and callous. He went to his 14-year-old rape victim's house after talking to her parents and making sure they wouldn't be home. He was smart, angry and felt the world owed him something, his chief probation officer wrote in court papers in Arizona in 1987. \n \"It is this type of individual, one with little or no conscious, who presents the greatest risk to the community,\" the officer wrote in the papers obtained by WHNS-TV. \n Kohlhepp remains behind bars, facing a kidnapping charge. Prosecutors said Friday many more charges were possible against the 45-year-old who had to register as a sex offender after his release. \n But that didn't stop him from becoming an apparently successful real estate agent. Kohlhepp followed the rules and admitted he had a felony conviction when he applied for his real estate license in 2006. But his letter explaining the charge was full of lies. He said he argued with his girlfriend, police were called, he had a gun and was caught up in a crackdown on gun violence. \n Police said Kohlhepp had a crush on the 14-year-old girl, who was friendly, but not romantic toward him. After raping her, he said he would kill her 6-year-old and 3-year-old siblings that she was babysitting if she called the police. His first question to officers when he was arrested was how long he was going to have to spend in prison, according to court papers. \n In the South Carolina case, the couple disappeared about Aug. 31 when they went to do the work on the suspect's nearly 100-acre property near Woodruff, said Daniel Herren, a friend who sat with the woman in her hospital room after she was rescued Thursday. \n The Associated Press is not naming the woman because the suspect is a sex offender, though authorities have not said whether she was sexually assaulted. Her boyfriend was identified as 32-year-old Charles Carver. \n Kohlhepp has a house about 9 miles away in Moore, where neighbor Ron Owen said Kohlhepp was very private, but when they did talk across the fence, he was a \"big bragger.\" \n Kohlhepp liked to talk about the money he made day trading online, for example, and about his two BMWs. He recently told Owen, 76, that he'd paid $80,000 to put the chain-link fence around his property where the woman was found. \n \"We didn't see any signs whatsoever that this was going on,\" Owen said. \"My first reaction's a baseball bat, but I know I'm not to take that in my own hands. God will deal with him.\" \n But even as his father felt he couldn't be helped, and as the neighbor recounted how Kohlhepp laughed when her son cried as he rolled him down the street locked in a dog carrier, court records show Kohlhepp's still had one supporter in 1987 \u2014 his mother. \n She wrote a letter asking the judge to send Kohlhepp to his grandparents instead of prison. \n \"He even walked the girl home,\" she wrote. \"Does that sound like a dangerous criminal?\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Chained woman's accused captor called a 'devil'"}

Cautious by nature, she was most inclined to stretch facts to their snapping point when on the defensive about her email practices, which was often. Clinton's defensive position, in essence: The dog ate my homework. \n With Election Day finally, nearly upon us, some lowlights from both candidates: \n FOR TRUMP, DAY IS NIGHT  \n \u2014On Clinton's approach to borders: \"She wants to let people just pour in. You could have 650 million people pour in and we do nothing about it. Think of it. That's what could happen.\" \n But wait, there's more. \n Trump said that under Clinton, this could happen \"in one week.\" \n This was no slip of the tongue \u2014 at several events he's spoken of 600 million coming in under Clinton; at another, 650 million. This doesn't faintly resemble anything Clinton has proposed for the U.S. (population 325 million). \n Trump is riffing off of a leaked Clinton speech to bankers in which she spoke of her dream of a \"hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders.\" The remarks in context suggested an interest in free commerce, not necessarily the free movement of people. But no one is talking about packing whole populations from other Western Hemisphere countries into the U.S. like sardines. \n Numbers are always pliable in the political arena; for Trump they are often whatever he wants them to be. He routinely overstates the U.S. trade deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars, no matter how many times he's called on it. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \u2014On the battle of Mosul, Iraq, and other operations against Islamic State militants: \"Whatever happened to the element of surprise?\" \n In the case of Mosul, signaling an assault in advance was a way for Iraqi forces to warn civilians in the city and to encourage a resistance movement to weaken IS before the battle began. Moreover, any element of surprise had been long lost; preparations for the battle began more than a year ago, with the U.S. part in it under close scrutiny by Congress. \n More broadly, Trump's theory that secrecy should surround all such operations reflects a lack of understanding of how this battle against IS has developed over the past two years, as well as certain obligations to keep Congress informed. Basic decisions like when to assault Mosul are left to the Iraqi government, because it is the Iraqis who will have to govern the place when the fighting is done. \n The U.S. wants the Iraqis to own the Mosul problem \u2013 both militarily and politically \u2014 so they don't repeat the mistakes that allowed IS to capture the city in the first place. \n Mosul was the obvious last major target of an Iraqi counteroffensive against IS, whose ability to defend the city had been undermined by months of U.S. airstrikes against its leaders and financial and military resources. Surprise was not an option. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \u2014When Clinton accused him of calling climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese: \"I did not. I did not.\" \n \u2014When asked about telling people on Twitter to check out a sex tape: \"It wasn't 'check out a sex tape.'\" \n In a 2012 tweet, he wrote: \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\" He later claimed he was kidding, but he's also repeated the claim that climate change is a hoax, and one that benefits China. In 2014: \"Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!\" \n During this campaign, he also tweeted \"check out sex tape and past\" of former 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado, whom Clinton discussed in a presidential debate as an example of Trump's derogatory comments about women. \n Machado, a Clinton supporter, criticized Trump for body-shaming her by calling her \"Miss Piggy\" when she gained weight. Was there a sex tape? In a manner, yes. Machado was filmed in a 2005 Spanish-language reality show in bed with a man; no nudity is seen but she said they were having sex in the footage. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \u2014\"I was against the war in Iraq, because I said it's gonna totally destabilize the Middle East. \u2026 I was opposed to war from the beginning. \u2026 \"I would not have had our troops in Iraq.\" \n It's true he wasn't a cheerleader for the March 2003 invasion. For example, he said a few months before the war that the economy and North Korea were bigger problems. But that's hardly opposition. In September 2002, he told Howard Stern on the radio, when asked if he would back an invasion, \"Yeah, I guess so.\" Days after the invasion, he said it \"looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.\" \n Moreover, Trump offered support for a hypothetical invasion of Iraq in his 2000 book, suggesting he would favor a pre-emptive strike if Iraq were viewed as a threat to national security. \n Trump did turn against the long-running war before many in Washington did. But that does not show the foresight he claimed when campaigning against Republican primary rivals who backed the invasion and when campaigning against Clinton, who voted in the Senate for the war. He was not against it when the decisions were being made about whether to start it. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n TRUMP: \"I watched when the World Trade Center came tumbling down. And I watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering. \u2026 It was on television. I saw it.\" \n No video or other proof of large-scale celebrations of the falling towers by Muslims in New Jersey ever emerged. \n Serge Kovaleski of the Times, who was working for The Washington Post in 2001, reported in the week after 9/11 that authorities in New Jersey detained and questioned \"a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks.\" \n Kovaleski has a congenital condition that restricts joint movement. In a speech, Trump went after the \"the poor guy, you oughta see this guy\" \u2014 making jerking gestures and taking a mocking tone. \n Trump later denied he was imitating Kovaleski and further claimed \"I have no idea\" who he is and didn't know of his condition. But Kovaleski said he had met Trump repeatedly, in face-to-face face interviews and at news conferences, and \"Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \u2014On why he continued to raise questions about Barack Obama's country of birth even after the president produced his birth certificate in 2011: \"Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.\" \n \"Was it a birth certificate?\" he asked in a 2012 interview. \"He was perhaps born in Kenya. Very simple, OK?\" Trump said in 2014. \"Who knows about Obama?\" Trump asked in January 2016. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n CLINTON: THE DOG ATE MY HOMEWORK  \n \u2014\"For those of you who are concerned about my using personal email, I understand. And as I've said, I'm not making excuses. I've said it was a mistake and I regret it.\" \n She's said she used personal email because she wanted the simplicity of a single digital device, although it turned out she carried several devices. She said her email practices were \"approved\" when they were not \u2014 they merely had not been expressly prohibited at the time for the secretary of state. \n She said she didn't understand that material marked with a \"c\" that passed through her personal communications system meant it was confidential. She said other secretaries of state did it first. That's partly true, but in a limited way and not with their own servers. She said she never passed on classified material in her system. The FBI found she passed on three email chains with information that had classified markings in the body of the emails; the State Department contended two of those chains held unclassified material. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \u2014On the Trans-Pacific Partnership: \"I did say I hoped it would be a good deal.\" \n That position became awkward if not untenable in her Democratic primary race against Bernie Sanders, a foe of the deal, and she turned against it. Her less-than-detailed explanation: The deal as finally negotiated did not measure up to her standards for protecting U.S. wages, jobs and national security. Yet the final deal contains some of the strongest labor protections of any U.S. trade agreement. \n The subject became Exhibit A in the case made by critics that she lets political currents, instead of personal conviction, guide her. \n A hacked email from Clinton adviser Joel Benenson may have inadvertently lent weight to that suspicion. \"Do we have any sense from her what she believes or wants her core message to be?\" he asked. \"Sanders has simplicity and focus.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \u2014\"I don't add a penny to the national debt.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ONE FOR THE ROAD  \n TRUMP to Clinton: \"You've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Robert Burns, Christopher S.

{"date": "November 5, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A South Korean protester holds a flag during a rally calling for South Korean President Park Geun-hye to step down in downtown Seoul, South Korea, Saturday. \n SEOUL >> Tens of thousands of South Koreans poured into the streets of downtown Seoul, using words including \"treason\" and \"criminal\" to demand that President Park Geun-hye step down amid an explosive political scandal. \n Saturday's protest, the largest anti-government demonstration in the capital in nearly a year, came a day after Park apologized on live television amid rising suspicion that she allowed a mysterious confidante to manipulate power from the shadows. \n Holding banners, candles and colorful signs that read \"Park Geun-hye out\" and \"Treason by a secret government,\" a sea of demonstrators filled a large square in front of an old palace gate and the nearby streets, singing and thunderously applauding speeches calling for the ouster of the increasingly unpopular president. \n They then shifted into a slow march in streets around City Hall, shouting \"Arrest Park Geun-hye,\" \"Step down, criminal\" and \"We can't take this any longer,\" before moving back to the square and cheering on more speeches that continued into the night. \n \"Park should squarely face the prosecution's investigation and step down herself. If she doesn't, politicians should move to impeach her,\" said Kim Seo-yeon, one of the many college students who participated in the protest. \n \"She absolutely lost all authority as president over the past few weeks,\" he said. \n Earlier in the week, prosecutors arrested Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a late cult leader and a longtime friend of Park, and detained two former presidential aides over allegations that they pressured businesses into giving $70 million to two foundations Choi controlled. \n There are also allegations that Choi, despite having no government job, regularly received classified information and meddled in various state affairs, including the appointment of ministers and policy decisions. \n \"I came out today because this is not the country I want to pass on to my children,\" said another demonstrator, Choi Kyung-ha, a mother of three. \"My kids have asked me who Choi Soon-sil was and whether she's the real president, and I couldn't provide an answer.\" \n Choi Tae-poong, a 57-year-old retiree, said he came out to protest because he thought the situation had reached a point where \"no more patience is allowed.\" \n \"I cannot bear this anymore,\" he said. \n Police estimated the crowd at 45,000, although protest organizers said about 200,000 people turned out. \n Police used dozens of buses and trucks to create tight perimeters in streets around the square in front of the palace gate to close off paths to the presidential office and residence. Thousands of officers dressed in fluorescent yellow jackets and full riot gear stood in front of and between the vehicles as they closely monitored the protesters. \n Smaller protests have taken place in the past few weeks in Seoul and other cities amid growing calls for Park to step down. While several politicians have individually called for Park's ouster, opposition parties have yet to attempt a serious push for her resignation or impeachment in fear of negatively impacting next year's presidential election. \n \"How many more astonishing things must happen before this country changes for the better?\" said Park Won-soon, the opposition mayor of Seoul and a potential presidential candidate, vowing to push for the president's resignation. \n President Park has tried to stabilize the situation by firing eight aides and nominating three new top Cabinet officials, including the prime minister, but opposition parties have described her personnel reshuffles as a diversionary tactic. \n One national poll released Friday had Park's approval rating at 5 percent, the lowest for any president in South Korea since the country achieved democracy in the late 1980s following decades of military dictatorship. \n In Friday's televised apology, Park commented on the corruption allegations surrounding Choi and her former aides and vowed to accept a direct investigation into her actions, but avoided the more damning allegation that Choi perhaps had interfered with important government decisions on policy and personnel. \n Opposition parties, sensing weakness, immediately threatened to push for her ouster if she doesn't distance herself from domestic affairs and transfer the duties to a prime minister chosen by parliament. The parties have also called for a separate investigation into the scandal led by a special prosecutor. \n Park has 15 months left in her term. If she resigns before the end of it, South Korean laws require the country to hold an election to pick a new president within 60 days. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tens of thousands call on South Korea's president to quit"}

{"date": "November 5, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Oct. 26 photo, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte delivers a speech at the Philippine Economic Forum in Tokyo. \n BAYBAY, Philippines >> Philippine police killed a town mayor in his jail cell in a purported gunbattle, the second killing in a week of a politician linked to illegal drugs under President Rodrigo Duterte's brutal crackdown. \n Rolando Espinosa Sr., the mayor of the town of Albuera in the central province of Leyte, and a fellow inmate were shot dead before dawn Saturday after they fired at officers who staged a raid in search of firearms and illegal drugs in the provincial jail in Leyte's Baybay city, police said. \n Some officials and an anti-crime watchdog have called for an investigation of the circumstances of the killings, wondering how the mayor and the other inmate got hold of guns and what prompted them to clash with several policemen while in detention. \n \"Offhand, I can smell extrajudicial killing,\" said Sen. Panfilo Lacson, a former national police chief, adding that the suspicious deaths were the \"biggest challenge\" to the credibility of the national police force, which is undertaking the anti-drug crackdown. \n Last week, police allegedly killed another town mayor, Samsudin Dimaukom, and nine of his men in a gunbattle in the southern Philippines. \n Espinosa and Dimaukom were among more than 160 officials named publicly by Duterte in August as part of a shame campaign.

Many of those killed in the initial months of the crackdown were poor drug suspects, and police said \"high-value targets,\" including mayors and drug lords, would be their next target in a new phase of the crackdown that was launched late last month. \n The unprecedented crackdown and killings have helped ease crime, but the U.S. and other Western governments, along with human rights watchdogs, have been alarmed and called for an end to the killings. One human rights advocate has called the killings under Duterte a \"human rights calamity.\" \n Duterte has lashed out at President Barack Obama and other critics, saying he was dealing with a pandemic that has afflicted politics, corrupted even generals and threatened to turn the country into what he describes as a \"narco state\" similar to some Latin American countries. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philippine police say drug-linked mayor shot dead in jail"}

{"date": "November 5, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Oct. 5, 2015 photo, the Supreme Court is seen in Washington. \n PHOENIX >> The U.S. Supreme Court reinstated an Arizona law that makes it a felony to collect early ballots, dealing a blow to Democratic get-out-the-vote efforts just days before the presidential election. \n Today's unsigned order from the nation's highest court overturns an appeals court decision from a day earlier that blocked the new law and drew celebration from Democrats. Groups immediately launched renewed effort to help voters deliver their ballots to the polls. \n The Supreme Court decision called into question what happens to ballots that have already been legally collected from voters in the approximately 20 hours that the law was blocked. \n Arizona filed an emergency appeal hours after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the law Friday. Justice Anthony Kennedy referred the case to the entire Supreme Court, and the court issued a brief order overturning the appeals court. The 9th Circuit will now consider the law in a January session that it set when it blocked the law. \n The high court decision is unusual because it takes at least five votes to issue such an order and the court is split 4-4 along conservative-liberal lines after the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia earlier this year. That means at least one of the court's liberals agreed to allow the law to go back into effect. \n The Arizona Secretary of State's office urged groups that collected ballots during that time to turn them in Monday morning. County elections officials have said they lack authority to enforce the law and any valid ballot they receive through any means would be counted. \n \"All of those ballots, regardless of whether or not they were collected as a part of a lot of ballots, they were all going to be counted anyway. There was never any danger to voters,\" said Matt Roberts, spokesman for Secretary of State Michele Reagan. \n But state Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham said the Democratic groups should return the ballots to voters. The party has trained poll watchers to observe people who return multiple ballots and report them to election officials. \n \"Because now it's up to the voter to bring it into the polling place\" Graham said. \"Really, truly they're accountable for these people voting or not voting at this particular point. This puts those people in a hard spot. \n Democratic state Rep. Martin Quezada, who represents a heavily minority district in western Phoenix and the suburb of Glendale, said there should be no legal liability for collecting during the window when the law was blocked. Backers of his campaign collected some ballots after the 9th Circuit ruling. \n \"We made a concerted effort to ensure that we documented the time when we collected these ballots, so there's proof that we collected them during that time,\" Quezada said. \"Now we just have to go turn them in first thing Monday morning and we don't expect there to be any problems with that.\" \n The Arizona Attorney General's Office said it would review all elections-based complaints on a case-by-case basis and declined further comment. \n Collecting early ballots is especially effective in minority communities, and Democrats alleged the law hurts minorities' ability to vote. The last week before an election is the most critical time for their get-out-the-vote efforts, because it is too late to mail back an early ballot. They must be dropped off at an election office if they are to be counted. \n Arizona has more than 3.5 million registered voters, and about 2.3 million of them have signed up to get a main-in ballot. As of Friday, the Secretary of State said 1.56 million ballots have already been returned. It's the remaining early ballots that parties target in the final week before an election. \n The decision comes just days ahead of a presidential election that has Arizona Democrats hoping Hillary Clinton will win the traditionally Republican state. \n Arizona's majority Republican lawmakers approved the law earlier this year over the objection of Democrats. GOP Gov. Doug Ducey called it a common-sense effort to protect the integrity of elections and eliminate voter fraud. \n A split 9th U.S. Circuit panel had said that by blocking the law it was preserving the status quo for Tuesday's election, which could come down to the wire in Arizona as Democrats spend heavily to get out the vote from Latinos and others angered by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's anti-immigrant comments. \n Both parties have used ballot collection to boost turnout during elections by going door to door and asking voters if they have completed their mail-in ballots. Voters who have not are urged to do so, and the volunteers offer to take the ballots to election offices. Democrats, however, use it more effectively. \n The law does not prevent voters' family members or caregivers from turning in ballots. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. Supreme Court reinstates Arizona ballot collection ban"}
