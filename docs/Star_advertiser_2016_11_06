{"date": "November 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Al Coleman, an IT professional who lives in Waikiki, talks outside an early voting location in Honolulu, Hawaii. \n The death of one of Hawaii's congressmen has led to an unusual ballot and voter confusion in urban Honolulu. \n The rare double election means residents in the 1st Congressional District are selecting someone to fill the late U.S. Rep. Mark Takai's seat for the two-month unfinished term and someone to represent the district for the next two years. \n Takai died in office last July. \n The situation could lead to two different people winning the same House seat on election night, to serve the two different terms. \n Former U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa is one of the candidates. The Democrat is hoping to return to her old seat in Congress, which she gave up to run for Senate two years ago. \n WHAT'S UNUSUAL ABOUT THIS ELECTION? \n Voters in the 1st Congressional District are being asked to vote twice \u2014 on the same ballot \u2014 for candidates running for the same seat. \n Hanabusa, who previously held the congressional seat, won the Democratic primary and is expected to cruise to victory for the two-year term that begins in January. \n But voters also have to decide who will finish the remaining two months of Takai's term, which begins immediately after Election Day, in a special election. And some don't understand they have to vote twice on the same ballot. \n \"Lots of voter confusion,\" Republican candidate Shirlene Ostrov said. \n ARE THE SAME PEOPLE RUNNING IN BOTH THE GENERAL ELECTION AND THE SPECIAL ELECTION? \n Not entirely. In the general election for the two-year term, there are four candidates who survived the primary election, and all four \u2014 Hanabusa, Ostrov, and the other two \u2014 are running in both races. \n But in the special election, there are a total of 10 candidates \u2014 including four additional Democrats. \n ARE VOTERS CONFUSED? \n Yes. \n Al Coleman, a 57-year-old IT professional who lives in Waikiki, said he voted for Ostrov. But after leaving the early voting location on Oct. 31, Coleman said he only voted for Ostrov once, believing incorrectly that his vote for her would count for both elections. Despite the mix-up, Coleman said he's not going to lose any sleep over it, because \"chances are my candidate won't win.\" \n Xavier Cisneros, 48, an airline maintenance supervisor who lives in East Honolulu, said it was a little confusing, but he voted for Hanabusa twice. \"I guess you had to put a little thought into it,\" Cisneros said. \"It wasn't that user-friendly.\" \n HOW DOES IT LOOK ON THE BALLOT? \n The general and special elections for the same office are listed side-by-side on the ballot. In the first column, the general election for the two-year term appears under \"Federal Contests,\" labeled \"U.S. Representative, Dist I.\" In the next column, under \"Special Election\" is the header \"U.S. Representative, Dist I Vacancy,\" followed by a list of 10 candidates. \n \"They're crunching it all up into one ballot, and there are 10 names,\" Hanabusa said. \"I think that if you weren't paying attention to it, you would be very confused.\" \n WHAT ARE THE CAMPAIGNS DOING TO CLARIFY? \n Hanabusa's campaign is running a video ad on local television stations reminding supporters to vote for Hanabusa twice. Ostrov's campaign has run radio ads and videos online to explain the situation. \n Hanabusa said the special election could have been held earlier by mail. \n \"The way it is now, the district went unrepresented from June, basically,\" Hanabusa said. \"It's a long period of time that the people deserve to have representation.\" \n WHY DOESN'T THE BALLOT MAKE IT CLEAR? \n The order that the races appear on the ballot is prescribed by state law, Chief Elections Officer Scott Nago said. \"We couldn't put it on the back or its own ballot, because the federal-state-county order,\" he said. \n The Office of Elections distributes an education packet to voters, but the office didn't include any explanation of the unusual situation in the packet because it's not a statewide race, he said. \n HAS SOMETHING SIMILAR HAPPENED BEFORE? \n Yes. In 1986, former U.S. Rep. Cecil Heftel left his House seat to run for governor. In the race to replace him, former Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie \u2014 then a state lawmaker \u2014 lost the primary election but won the special election held the same day to finish Heftel's term. Abercrombie served the three-month term, and then Republican former U.S. Rep. Pat Saiki served the full two-year term that followed. Later, Abercrombie was elected to the seat and served for nearly a decade. \n WHY WOULD SOMEONE RUN FOR A TWO-MONTH GIG? \n Democratic candidate Peter Cross, whose name appears first on the ballot, said he hasn't run for public office before. But the 44-year-old construction manager said he thought the special election would be a good opportunity to try campaigning. \n \"I believe that everybody deserves a shot, and I think that most of the people that are running out there pretty much have been there for a long time, and people are ready for something new,\" Cross said. \n Ostrov said she would be excited to serve Hawaii, even if it's just for two months, and give Hawaii a voice in the Republican majority in the U.S. House. Plus, she thinks the five Democrats listed in the special election could split the Democratic vote. \n \"I like to think it improves my chances,\" Ostrov said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "State's unusual congressional election confuses voters"}

{"date": "November 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n At Sunday services, in rallies and on social media, black pastors labored to persuade congregants they should vote, hoping to minimize an expected drop in black voter participation this Election Day compared to four years ago when Barack Obama was a candidate. \n DETROIT >> At Sunday services, in rallies and on social media, black pastors urged congregants to vote, hoping to inspire a late flood of African-American turnout that could help propel Democrat Hillary Clinton to victory in critical swing states on Tuesday. \n In Detroit, a pastor spoke of voting and citizenship. In Philadelphia, the minister reminded congregants others had died for their chance to cast a ballot. The Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke to a crowd of a few hundred people gathered in front of City Hall in Tallahassee, Florida, right before they marched a block over to the county courthouse to vote early. \n Along with women and Hispanics, African-Americans are seen as critical to Clinton's chances against Republican Donald Trump, who polls show is not popular among black voters. However, early voting data from key states indicate turnout will not be as high this year as it was four years ago, when Barack Obama, the nation's first African-American president, was on the ballot. Sunday's efforts were aimed at minimizing that decline. \n Bishop T.D. Jakes, pastor of the Texas megachurch The Potter's House, who has a national and international following, tweeted on a red, white and blue backdrop, \"Make sure your voice is heard. Vote on Nov. 8.\" \n \"Preachers are trying to strike a moral nerve and somehow penetrate the fog of indifference and try to remind people what's at stake this year,\" said the Rev. James Forbes, retired senior minister of The Riverside Church, who has been traveling the country to mobilize voters. He will speak Sunday night in New York for a national get-out-the-vote telecast from the church called \"The Revival: Time for a Moral Revolution in Values.\" \n Forbes and other pastors have taken pains to emphasize they were not endorsing a candidate, but it was hard to mistake some remarks Sunday that signaled a deep opposition to Trump. \n \"There are some folk in this country who think that to make this country great again, we've got to exclude folks,\" said the Rev. Mark Tyler, pastor of Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church in Philadelphia, founded in the 18th century as one of the first black churches in the U.S. \"We've always been great because we've always been open to strangers. If it was not for the goodness of the first Americans, there would be no America today.\" \n The number of African-American voters has increased steadily: 12.9 million in 2000, 14 million in 2004, 16 million in 2008 and 17.8 million in 2012. In the last presidential election year, blacks for the first time voted at a higher rate, 66.2 percent, than did whites (64.1 percent), or Asian-Americans or Hispanics, with rates of about 48 percent each. \n Besides the absence of a black candidate on either major-party ticket, community leaders and others blame the lower turnout so far on voter suppression efforts, such as limits to early voting hours in some communities and challenges by individuals to voter registrations. A federal judge last Friday ordered registrations to be restored in three North Carolina counties for what could be thousands of challenged voters. \n Underscoring the importance of black voters to her campaign, Clinton started her day Sunday with the largely African-American congregation of Mount Airy Church of God in Christ in Philadelphia. The Rev. Leah Daughtry, chief executive of the Democratic National Convention, spoke across town at Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church. \n Worshippers clapped and cheered as Tyler, the Mother Bethel pastor, told them \"don't let there be any excuse\" for not showing up at the polls, even with a lingering public transit strike. \"Somebody died for you to have a right,\" Tyler said. \n In Tallahassee, the event with the mayor, local pastors and Jackson evoked a street carnival amid the sizzle of thick sausages cooking on the grill and snow cones being distributed. Jackson referenced civil rights leaders and the chaotic 2000 presidential election he contended was \"stolen\" on behalf of George W. Bush by the U.S. Supreme Court. \n Roz Booker, a 56-year-old black voter, said this election season has been a \"mess,\" but her ancestors had died for the right to vote and she had already cast her ballot. Booker described herself as \"anti-Trump,\" criticizing the Republican nominee for what she called \"promoting hate\" against minorities. \n At New Destiny Christian Fellowship, a predominantly black church in Detroit, the pastor spoke of being a \"good citizen\" on Election Day. Congregant Tiffany Gunter, who is voting for Clinton, noted that enthusiasm in 2016 was lower among African-Americans than in the previous presidential race. \"What Hillary Clinton has is experience. Is she perfect? Absolutely not. There are things about her that I wish were different, but I believe that she does listen and she can adapt,\" Gunter said. \n In North Carolina, where clergy and others have led marches to early voting sites, preliminary early voting totals showed a drop in percentages for Democratic and black voters compared to 2012, while unaffiliated and Republican vote totals were higher. \n \"We better vote, simply because people have tried to take the right,\" said the Rev. William Barber, state president of the North Carolina NAACP, outside a church in Wilson, about 40 miles east of Raleigh, as he worked to mobilize voters Saturday. \n The Rev. Michael McBride, pastor of a predominantly black church in California and a leader of the PICO Network, which works for criminal justice reform and against gun violence, said the bitter tone of the campaign and the personal attacks between Trump and Clinton have \"really worn on a lot of people\" and drained interest in voting. \n \"I think we have to temper some of our disappointment with the reality that we're going to have to live with our decision for the next four years or eight years,\" said McBride, who has been traveling the country to rally voters. \"Folks are wrestling with that.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Black pastors issue urgent plea to voters at Sunday services"}

A grand jury declined to indict Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot him. The Department of Justice also opted against bringing civil rights charges against Wilson. The death of Brown, who was unarmed, led to months of sometimes-violent Ferguson protests and became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement, which rebukes police treatment of minorities. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n JOHN CRAWFORD III \n Police in the Dayton, Ohio, suburb of Beavercreek responded to a Wal-Mart store in August 2014 on a call of a man waving an apparent rifle.

Liang, an American of Chinese descent, said he had been holding his weapon safely when a sound jarred him and he accidentally fired.

The school also reached a $5.3 million settlement that includes free undergraduate tuition for DuBose's 13 children. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n DARRIUS STEWART \n A federal prosecutor announced in September there was insufficient evidence to file civil rights charges in the July 2015 fatal shooting of Stewart, 19, by Officer Connor Schilling. Schilling, a white Memphis, Tennessee, police officer, shot Stewart during a struggle following a traffic stop that escalated after an attempted arrest for outstanding warrants. Schilling has said he shot Stewart because he feared for his life. He retired due to a disability, police said, in a move that allows him to receive disability pay. A grand jury in November 2015 declined to charge the officer. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n JEREMY MCDOLE \n Jeremy McDole, 28, was sitting in his wheelchair when he was shot and killed in September 2015 in Wilmington, Delaware, after police received a 911 call about a man with a gun. A bystander's cellphone footage showed officers repeatedly telling McDole to drop his weapon and raise his hands, with McDole reaching for his waist area before shots erupted. The Delaware attorney general's office decided against criminal charges against four Wilmington police officers involved, although investigators concluded one officer showed \"extraordinarily poor\" police work. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n RICKY BALL \n Former Columbus, Mississippi, police officer Canyon Boykin, who is white, was indicted in September for manslaughter in the shooting death of Ricky Ball, 26. Boykin, facing trial Nov. 28, has said he shot Ball because the man appeared to point a gun at him during a foot chase in October 2015. The city fired Boykin as he was trying to resign, saying he had broken department policy by not turning on his body camera, by inviting his fiancee to ride along without permission, and by making derogatory social media posts about African-Americans, women and disabled people. Boykin has sued the city, claiming violations of his constitutional rights. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n DEMARCUS SEMER \n A Florida grand jury cleared two police officers in September who fatally shot Semer, an unarmed black motorist, in April 2016 as he fled. Prosecutors said the man's actions gave the officers a reasonable belief that their lives were in danger. The St. Lucie County Grand Jury cleared Fort Pierce police Sgt. Brian MacNaught and officer Keith Holmes for the shooting of Semer, 21, during a traffic stop. Prosecutors say their investigation showed he refused to get out of his car and then tried to drive away, clipping Holmes and dragging MacNaught. Both officers are white. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ALTON STERLING \n Sterling, 37, was shot to death July 5, 2016, as two white officers pinned him to the pavement outside a convenience store where he had been selling CDs. The killing was captured on cellphone video and circulated widely online, sparking widespread demonstrations across Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II were placed on administrative leave. Neither officer has been charged in the case, which was turned over to federal investigators. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n PHILANDO CASTILE \n Castile was shot and killed July 6 by officer Jeronimo Yanez, who is Hispanic, after being pulled over as he drove through a St. Paul, Minnesota, suburb with his girlfriend and her young daughter in the car. His girlfriend began livestreaming on Facebook shortly after the shooting and said Castile, 32, was shot while reaching for his ID after telling the officer he had a gun permit and was armed. Yanez and his partner, Joseph Kauser, who was present for the shooting, were placed on administrative leave. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has turned its findings over to a county prosecutor, who will review the case. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n TYRE KING \n The 13-year-old Ohio youth was fatally shot by a Columbus police officer Sept. 14 after running from police investigating a reported armed robbery. Police said he a pulled a BB gun that looked like a real firearm. Officer Bryan Mason, who is white, was put on administrative desk duty while the investigation into Tyre King's death continues. The attorney for his family has asked for a Justice Department review. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n KEITH LAMONT SCOTT \n The North Carolina State bureau of Investigation is reviewing the fatal Sept. 20 shooting of Scott by a black Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer. Scott, 43, was sitting in his vehicle in the parking lot of his Charlotte apartment complex when he was shot by police trying to find a different man. Police video showed officers shouting for Scott to drop a gun numerous times as he slowly backed out of an SUV. Scott's family said he did not have a gun and was reading a book. The shooting, part of which was recorded by his wife and shared widely on social media, caused days of violent protests and a state of emergency to be declared in Charlotte. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n TERENCE CRUTCHER \n Tulsa, Oklahoma, police Officer Betty Jo Shelby was charged with first-degree manslaughter on Sept. 22 in the shooting of Crutcher, an unarmed man. Shelby, who is white, shot the 40-year-old Crutcher on Sept. 16 shortly after she arrived on a street to find his SUV stopped in the middle of the road. Crutcher was seen without a weapon and with his hands up on videos from a patrol car dashboard and a police helicopter before Shelby shot him. Police Chief Chuck Jordan has said that Crutcher did not have a gun on his body or in his SUV when he was shot. Shelby has pleaded not guilty and is on unpaid leave. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ALFRED OLANGO \n In the San Diego suburb of El Cajon, a police officer opened fire on Ugandan refugee Alfred Olango within a minute of arriving at the scene on Sept. 27. Olango's sister had described her brother as mentally unbalanced in multiple 911 calls. Video released by police shows the officer approached the 38-year-old man with gun drawn, as Olango paced in a strip mall parking lot. Olango pulls something from his pocket, takes what police call a \"shooting stance,\" and aims something at the officer, who then fires his gun. A second officer fired his Taser simultaneously. The object in Olango's hands turned out to be a 4-inch electronic cigarette device. The two officers were placed on leave as the district attorney investigates. \n \u2014\u2014 \n DEBORAH DANNER \n New York police were responding Oct. 18 to a 911 call about an emotionally disturbed person when Sgt. Hugh Barry encountered Danner, 66, in her Bronx apartment. The mentally ill woman picked up a baseball bat in her bedroom and tried to hit Barry, who fired shots that killed her. New York's mayor rebuked him publicly the next day, and he has been stripped of his badge and gun and placed on desk duty while the state attorney general's office determines whether the case falls under its authority to investigate police shootings of unarmed civilians. Police are also investigating the officer's actions. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police encounters resulting in black deaths span U.S."}

{"date": "November 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton greets patrons at Cedar Park Cafe in Philadelphia, Sunday, Nov. 6, 2016. \n PHILADELPHIA >> FBI Director James Comey abruptly announced Sunday that Hillary Clinton should not face criminal charges related to newly discovered emails from her tenure at the State Department, lifting a cloud of uncertainty that has shadowed the final days of her presidential campaign. \n In a letter to congressional lawmakers two days before Election Day, Comey said the FBI has worked \"around the clock to process and review a large number of emails\" obtained from a device belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. \n Comey said the review has not changed the bureau's assessment from earlier this year that Clinton should not be prosecuted for her handling of classified information at the State Department. \n Clinton's campaign welcomed the FBI announcement. \n \"We're glad this matter is resolved,\" Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communications director, told reporters traveling with the campaign to Ohio. \n Clinton was infuriated by Comey's decision to alert Congress late last month that the FBI was reviewing new materials, calling it \"unprecedented\" and \"deeply troubling.\" The decision shattered what had appeared to be Clinton's solid grip on the race and emboldened Republican Donald Trump. \n Trump landed in Minnesota for a rally moments after Comey's announcement. He made no direct mention of the FBI decision and continued to insist \u2014without evidence \u2014 that Clinton would be under investigation during her potential presidency. \n \"She's protected by a rigged system,\" he said. \"She shouldn't even be allowed to run for president.\" \n The FBI began investigating the handling of classified material on Clinton's private server in New York shortly after she announced her bid in April 2015. Last July, in an extraordinary public statement on an ongoing case, Comey announced he was not recommending criminal charges against Clinton and called the decision \"not even a close call.\" \n But he also delivered blistering criticism of Clinton, calling her and her team \"extremely careless\" with her handling of national secrets. \n Clinton had appeared to be heading for a sweeping victory before the FBI review, but Comey's announcement blunted her momentum. Since then, national polls and battleground states have tightened, though Clinton still appears to hold an edge over Trump in the campaign's last moments. \n During remarks at a black church Sunday morning, Clinton urged voters to choose \"unity over division\" as she sought to close a caustic presidential campaign on an uplifting note.

{"date": "November 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This frame grab from video provided by Arab 24 network, shows officials with the U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces at a press conference in Ein Issa in northern Syria. U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian forces announced their plan Sunday to retake the Islamic State group's de facto capital of Raqqa, saying they hoped Turkey would not \"interfere in internal Syrian affairs.\" \n BEIRUT >> Kurdish-led Syrian forces began an offensive Sunday to liberate the Islamic State group's de facto capital of Raqqa, clashing with the extremists north of the Syrian city and warning neighboring Turkey not to interfere in the operation. \n The United States, France and Britain said they would provide air support for the offensive, which was announced at a news conference in Ein Issa, north of Raqqa, by a coalition of Kurds and Arabs known as the Syria Democratic Forces. But it lacked details on how the group dominated by Kurds plans to oust the militants from the city, home to nearly 200,000 mostly Sunni Arabs and an estimated 5,000 IS fighters. \n Unlike several successful military efforts to drive Islamic State militants out of cities in Iraq, the Raqqa offensive faces several political obstacles and is likely to be much more complex. \n In Iraq, a U.S.-led coalition is working with the government in Baghdad, but Washington and its partners in Syria are relying on a hodgepodge of local Arab and Kurdish opposition groups, some of which are fierce rivals. The tensions are exacerbated by Russian and Syrian forces on one side and Turkish forces on another. \n Still, the start of the Raqqa offensive, which aims initially at isolating and encircling the city, increases the pressure on the Islamic State group, making it harder for its fighters to move reinforcements between Syria and Iraq. The city, which has been under IS control since early 2014, is home to some of the group's top leaders and is seen as the key to defeating the group militarily. \n Islamic State forces already are now under attack by U.S.-backed Iraqi forces on the eastern edges of the city of Mosul, which the militant group seized two years ago when it captured territory across Iraq and Syria for its self-proclaimed caliphate. The Iraqi forces began their operation Oct. 17 and are trying to push deeper into the city, which is the militants' last urban bastion in Iraq. \n Iraq's Hezbollah Brigades, one of the main Shiite militias taking part in the government-led push to drive IS from Mosul, said Wednesday its men had taken control of a highway linking Mosul and Raqqa, severing a key supply route between the two militant strongholds. \n Senior commanders and representatives of the SDF attended the news conference in Ein Issa, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Raqqa. The Kurdish officials said the anti-IS campaigns in Mosul and Raqqa are not coordinated but simply a matter of \"good timing.\" \n \"We call on our heroic steadfast people in Raqqa and surrounding areas to stay away from enemy gatherings which will be a target for the liberating forces and the coalition forces, and to head to areas that will be liberated,\" said Cihan Ehmed, an SDF fighter. \n She said 30,000 fighters will take part in the offensive, dubbed \"Euphrates Rage,\" and that a joint operations command had been set up to coordinate various factions. \n \"I welcome today's announcement by the SDF that the operation to free Raqqa from ISIL's barbaric grip has begun,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said. \"The effort to isolate and ultimately liberate Raqqa marks the next step in our coalition campaign plan. \n \"As in Mosul, the fight will not be easy and there is hard work ahead, but it is necessary to end the fiction of ISIL's caliphate and disrupt the group's ability to carry out terror attacks against the United States, our allies and our partners,\" he added. \n Activists reported clashes Sunday between IS militants and SDF forces north of Raqqa. \n SDF forces seized control of six villages and farms, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It also reported strong activity by U.S.-led coalition warplanes and airstrikes that hit IS positions. The Observatory also said IS detonated two car bombs targeting the advancing forces. \n The Raqqa-based Syrian activist group known as Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently also reported the clashes south of Ein Issa. \n There was no immediate comment from the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad on the Kurdish announcement. \n Brett McGurk, the White House envoy to the anti-IS coalition, said the U.S. will provide air support for the Raqqa offensive and is in \"close, close contact\" with its ally Turkey. \"We want this to be as coordinated as possible, recognizing that there will be a mix of forces on the field,\" he told reporters in Jordan. \n Britain also said it is providing aerial surveillance to help the offensive. The Royal Air Force \"will support the Raqqa operation as it develops,\" Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said. \n French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said his country will provide airstrikes to aid the offensive. He told French radio Europe 1 that \"local territorial forces\" should retake Raqqa with air support from the coalition but no foreign ground troops. \n The SDF is dominated by the main Syrian Kurdish fighting force known as the People's Protection Units, or YPG. The U.S. considers the group to be the most effective force against IS, but Turkey views it as a terrorist organization linked to a Kurdish group outlawed by the government in Ankara. Turkish officials, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have said they will not accept a role for the Kurds in the liberation of Raqqa. \n Turkey's defense minister suggested last week that instead of the Kurds, Turkish-backed forces can present an \"alternative.\" \n In a speech Sunday, Erdogan did not comment on the SDF announcement but said allied Syrian opposition fighters were 9 miles (15 kilometers) from the Syrian town of al-Bab, the last stronghold of the IS group in Aleppo province. He added that Turkey's aim was to move on al-Bab and expel the militants toward the south. \n \"Our hope is that the Turkish state will not interfere in the internal affairs of Syria,\" Ahmad said at the news conference, suggesting SDF forces would defend themselves if it did. \"Raqqa will be free by its own sons.\" \n Kurdish officials acknowledged their announcement was prompted by Turkey's growing assertiveness in northern Syria. Since August, Ankara has backed Syrian fighters opposed to the Kurds with tanks and aircraft and has bombed Kurdish forces. \n \"Let's be clear: Turkey is an enemy of the Kurds,\" said Nawaf Khalil, the former spokesman for Syria's powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party, known as the PYD. \"When Turkey enters an area, it remains as an occupier.\" \n The mutual distrust puts the U.S. in a difficult position as it tries to balance SDF against Turkish interests in northern Syria. \n Political official Rezan Hiddo said the SDF had warned the international coalition it would halt its Raqqa campaign if Turkish-backed forces advanced on Manbij or other Kurdish-held towns. \n \"We cannot extinguish the fire in our neighbor's house if our home is burning. We were very clear with our allies. If there is a plan to attack Daesh, there must be limits for Turkey,\" Hiddo said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State group. \n SDF spokesman Talal Sillo told The Associated Press the Raqqa campaign will occur on several fronts. \n \"We want to liberate the surrounding countryside, then encircle the city, then we will assault and liberate it,\" he said. \n Coalition leaders have been struggling with the timing of the Raqqa campaign, not only because of the demands of the Iraqi-led Mosul operation but also because the political and military landscape in Syria is more complicated amid a civil war that has lasted more than five years and has devastated much of the country. \n Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, commander of anti-IS coalition forces, said last week more Syrian opposition fighters need to be recruited, trained and equipped for the Raqqa battle. The YPG will necessarily be part of the offensive, he said, adding: \"The only force that is capable on any near-term timeline is the Syrian Democratic Forces, of which the YPG are a significant portion.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Syrian Kurds begin campaign to oust Islamic State from Raqqa"}

Smith Park in Pembroke Pines, Fla., Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump holds up 6-month-old Catalina Larkin, of Largo, Fla., during a campaign rally Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016, in Tampa, Fla. \n PHILADELPHIA >> Hillary Clinton aimed to hit high notes Sunday in the final moments of her campaign, hoping an uplifting message would wash away voters' disgust with the grueling presidential contest. Donald Trump vowed he and his supporters would never quit, as he charged into unexpected territory. \n The candidates embarked on one of their final tours of battleground states, shifting to their closing arguments to weary voters deeply divided along racial, economic and gender lines. \n With national polls showing her retaining an edge, Clinton enlisted allies and A-listers for help at stops in Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Hampshire. She planned to campaign with Cavaliers star LeBron James in Cleveland, and rally voters in Manchester with Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father whose indictment of Trump delivered emotional high point for Democrats. \n Trump, meanwhile, planned a marathon day on the campaign trail, with stops in five states, including Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania states that have long proven unfriendly territory for Republican presidential candidates. But buoyed by a late surge of momentum, Trump declared that his loyal, white working-class voters will deliver an upset on Tuesday. \n \"Our secret weapon is the American people who are saying, 'Enough is enough,'\" vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \n Tension ran high in the final days. Trump was rushed off stage Saturday night at rally in Reno, Nevada, after someone near the stage had shouted \"Gun!,\" according to the Secret Service. The agency said a search revealed no weapon. \n Trump returned a few minutes later to resume his remarks and declared, \"We will never be stopped.\" \n The Republican candidate's son and top campaign adviser later retweeted the false rumor that the incident was an \"assassination attempt,\" and a supporter at a subsequent rally in Denver repeated the suggestion. \n Asked about the misinformation, Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway did not apologize, but said Trump's son was acting out of worry: \"It's pretty rattling to think of what may have happened to your father. So, I will excuse him that,\" Conway told CNN on Sunday. \n The Clinton campaign says it is focusing on securing its firewall in the West and upper Midwest. President Barack Obama planned to rally in Ann Arbor, Michigan Monday, before joining Clinton for a rally in Philadelphia that evening. \n Critical in both states is African American turnout. Black clergy were taking to the pulpits in a \"Souls to the Poll\" campaign to energize black voters, after early vote data shows some signs of diminished turnout. \n Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the campaign believes if Clinton wins Nevada and Michigan, she \"is going to be the next president of the United States.\" \n Clinton faced dark skies, intense rain and strong wind in Florida on Saturday before appearing in Pennsylvania with pop singer Katy Perry. The Democratic nominee was preparing to campaign Sunday with basketball superstar Lebron James, having shared the stage Friday night with music diva Beyonc\u00e9 and hip hop mogul husband Jay Z. \n \"Tonight, I want to hear you roar,\" a smiling Clinton said before introducing Perry for a Saturday night performance in Philadelphia. \n Perry, who hugged Clinton while wearing a purple cape bearing the words, \"I'm with Madam President,\" shouted, \"In three days, let's make history!\" \n At least 41 million Americans across 48 states have already cast ballots, according to an Associated Press analysis.

{"date": "November 6, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, speaks during a campaign rally late Saturday, Nov. 5, 2016, in Denver. \n WASHINGTON >> If Donald Trump wins the White House on Tuesday, he'll become America's first billionaire businessman to serve as president. But he'll be following in the footsteps of other moguls who have jumped into the political fray elsewhere in the world. \n The track record for these businessmen-turned-political leaders is decidedly mixed. Some have translated their private sector acumen into success in government. Others had tenures marked by scandal, and even a military coup. \n Americans have elected presidents with business experience before \u2014 among them, George W. Bush, who ran an oil company, and Herbert Hoover, a mining executive. But all moved into politics before running for the nation's highest office. Trump would be the first American president to never have held elected office, or other high-level government or military post. \n The real estate magnate has long promoted his business background as a selling point for voters frustrated with career politicians. \n \"We need people in Washington that know how to make a deal,\" Trump says. \n A look at some of the billionaires who blazed a trail from business to politics: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n SILVIO BERLUSCONI, ITALY \n Trump has drawn more comparisons to the brash Berlusconi, a three-term Italian prime minister, than perhaps any other world leader. \n Both are irreverent and controversial, and they like to flaunt their lavish lifestyles. Each started his careers in real estate, but made his name in the media world: Berlusconi built a fortune buying up television stations and Trump became a fixture in the New York tabloids and reality TV. \n For Trump, that's probably about where he'd like the comparisons to end. \n Berlusconi was a fixture in Italian politics for two decades, but his time in office was frequently marred by scandal. He was convicted of multiple crimes, including tax fraud and paying for sex with an underage prostitute, though the latter charge was overturned by an appeals court. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n PETRO POROSHENKO, UKRAINE \n Known as Ukraine's \"Chocolate King,\" Poroshenko made his fortune in the confectionary industry. Now he's a key Western partner in trying to resolve the heated dispute between Ukraine and Russia. \n Poroshenko was elected president in 2014 following the public uprising that led to the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Russian leader. The billionaire businessman positioned himself as a friend of Europe and the United States, and indeed speaks and meets regularly with both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. \n But Poroshenko's tenure has coincided with more Russian meddling in Ukraine, particularly along the country's shared border. The U.S. has sent Ukraine tens of millions of dollars in nonlethal aid; Obama has resisted calls to send lethal assistance. \n It's unclear what type of support Poroshenko would have from the U.S. under a potential Trump administration. Trump has spoken favorably about Russian President Vladimir Putin an Trump has said he would be \"looking at\" whether to recognize Crimea \u2014 a Ukrainian area annexed by Moscow \u2014 as Russian territory. \n Poroshenko's transition from businessman to political leader also holds warning signs for Trump's financial future. The Ukrainian leader saw his net worth decline significantly after taking office. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THAKSIN SHINAWATRA, THAILAND \n A telecommunications billionaire, Thaksin was Thailand's prime minister until he was ousted in a military coup in 2006. \n During his tenure, Thaksin drew support from poorer voters who backed his reduction in hospital feeds and other populist programs. \n But Thaksin's wealth would contribute to his political downfall. He faced corruption allegations after his family sold a company for $1.9 billion in a way that enabled them to avoid paying taxes on the sale, sparking a year of political tumult in Thailand that ended in the coup. \n Though he's been in exile for several years, Thaksin remains involved in Thai politics from affair. Earlier this year, he weighed in on American elections, saying there was \"some similarity\" between himself and Trump. \n \"The cultures are very similar, the culture of being a businessman,\" Thaksin told the Financial Times. \"And then when successful businessmen come to politics, they give fresh air to political campaigns.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n SEBASTIAN PINERA, CHILE \n Pinera's financial empire touched numerous parts of Chilean society. He held stakes in the country's largest airline, a television station and the popular soccer team Colo-Colo. \n Turning to politics, Pinera campaigned on his private sector experience and became the first conservative to lead Chile since military rule ended in 1990. But his presidency launched to an inauspicious start \u2014 a major earthquake disrupted his 2010 inauguration. \n Chile experienced solid economic growth during Pinera's four-year term, but the president himself was deeply unpopular. Chile's constitution prohibits presidents from serving two consecutive terms. Pinera is eligible to run again in 2018. \n Pinera hasn't been shy about weighing in on the U.S. election, levying sharp criticism on Trump. During an appearance in New York last fall, Pinera said the Republican would be a divisive leader and said his election would be a \"tragedy.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Julie Pace on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jpaceDC \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's trailblazers: Billionaires who turned to politics"}
