Comey is accepting on Nov. 7, 2016, a lifetime achievement award on the eve of the election at a dinner organized by a law enforcement support group. Its board includes people with longtime ties to Donald Trump. \n NEW YORK >> FBI Director James Comey was being honored Monday night by a group whose board includes several people with longtime ties to Donald Trump, including the CEO of the National Enquirer and a convicted felon who goes by the nickname \"Joey No Socks.\" \n Comey, already criticized over his handling of Hillary Clinton's email investigation in the final days of the presidential campaign, was accepting the lifetime achievement award from the nonprofit Federal Drug Agents Foundation. The group lists more than three dozen board directors on its website; another was the developer of a troubled Trump-branded tower in Toronto. \n An FBI spokesman said the foundation provides disability, bereavement and personal crisis support to federal agents and educational and charitable grants. Foundation representatives did not immediately respond to phone and email messages from The Associated Press. \n The foundation regularly hosts dinners and events honoring law enforcement officials. Past recipients of the lifetime achievement award include Attorney General Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan. \n It was not clear whether Comey \u2014 a former U.S. attorney in Manhattan \u2014 was aware of the board members' ties to Trump, or whether he decided those connections were not consequential given the group's stature with New York law enforcement. But the award and ceremony came as the FBI has been accused by partisans on both the left and right of injecting itself unnecessarily into the presidential race through Comey's statements and updates about the FBI's now-concluded review of Hillary Clinton's email practices. \n Among the Trump-connected board members is David Pecker, a friend of Trump's and the chief executive of American Media Inc., publisher of The National Enquirer. \n During the course of the presidential primary campaign, the Enquirer was a regular source of attacks on Trump political rivals, including Jeb Bush, Ben Carson and Ted Cruz. The Wall Street Journal reported last week the magazine paid $150,000 to a former Playboy playmate for her story about having an affair with Trump shortly after he married his third wife, Melania Trump, but never ran it. \n \"As a founding member of the FDAF I have been a proud and loyal supporter for several years and am honored to be at tonight's event,\" wrote Pecker, a former president of the group, in an email to the AP. \n Another board member listed for the group is Alex Schnaider, a billionaire Ukrainian-born commodities trader who built a Trump-branded hotel and condo tower in Toronto which is now in receivership. \n \"This is one of countless charities that he supports,\" said David Zucker, a lawyer in Toronto who represents Schnaider. \"He doesn't actively participate, and he had no idea there was any dinner tonight.\" \n A third board member is Joseph Cinque, also known as \"Joey No Socks,\" a convicted felon whose American Academy of Hospitality Sciences has awarded more than a dozen Trump businesses with shiny plaques called \"Star Diamond\" awards. Cinque didn't immediately return a request for comment, but a secretary at his business said he was planning on attending the Monday evening ceremony. Trump told the AP in May he didn't know Cinque well and was unaware of his criminal history for art fencing. \n The FBI director announced Sunday he would not recommend charging Clinton criminally after reviewing emails discovered on the computer of former congressman Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. \n But Comey's Oct. 28 decision to advise Congress of the newly discovered emails in the first place, before their contents had been reviewed by agents, elicited criticism by former law enforcement officials and others who questioned his judgment to make public details of an ongoing probe in the midst of a presidential election. \n The foundation, headquartered on Long Island, funds scholarships and grants to the families of federal agents who have been killed or injured in the line of duty and took in about $122,000 in revenue according to a 2014 tax filing. \n A Trump campaign spokesman declined comment. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Bad timing?

{"date": "November 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A Transportation Security Administration officer stands in front of a portrait of slain TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez during his public memorial at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. \n LOS ANGELES >> A deadly rampage at Los Angeles International Airport grew from a suicide plan that morphed into a twisted mission to die in a blaze of glory taking out federal officers, the gunman said before being sentenced Monday to life in prison. \n In explaining the roots of his rage and offering a half-hearted apology, Paul Ciancia calmly told a federal judge the steps that led from him being \"sick of life\" to gunning down a Transportation Security Administration officer at point-blank range and wounding two other officers and a teacher before he was shot in the face and subdued three years ago. \n \"I knew exactly how I wanted to die,\" Ciancia stated. \"I was going to take up arms against my own government.\" \n Ciancia, 26, was sentenced to a mandatory term of life, plus 60 years for the Nov. 1, 2013, attack that crippled the nation's second-busiest airport and disrupted travel nationwide. He previously pleaded guilty to murder and 10 other charges. \n Dressed in an all-white jail suit and shackled at the ankles, the skinny Ciancia stared at the agents he had shot and airport police who sat in the courtroom with black bands across their badges. He offered no apology to them, but said he was sorry to Brian Ludmer, a teacher who was headed to a wedding in Chicago when he was struck by gunfire. \n Ludmer was so taken aback by Ciancia's \"bizarre lack of remorse\" for the officers and the family of slain Officer Gerardo Hernandez that he decided to address the killer by reading from an eloquent statement he had filed with the court. \n Ludmer spoke about the pain he still endures and how he has lost faith in a system that allowed Ciancia to raise so many \"red flags,\" yet avoid treatment for mental illness and be able to buy an assault rifle. \n He then went off script to say that Ciancia needed to apologize to the TSA officers, the widow of Hernandez and the two children he left behind. \n \"If you can't see that, if you can't feel that, your sense of remorse is just as deranged as your actions,\" Ludmer said. \n Outside court, TSA officer Tony Grigsby, who was wounded, said he felt Ciancia was giving him a \"death stare.\" \n \"It's like he's inhuman,\" Grigsby said. \"Seeing him with no kind of remorse made me sad for him.\" \n Ciancia shot and wounded Grigsby and officer James Speer as they ran from a screening checkpoint, and he struck Ludmer, who had been in the screening area, in the calf. \n The unemployed motorcycle mechanic originally from New Jersey said he decided to kill himself in the fall of 2012. He planned to spend his $26,000 in savings and \"enjoy my retirement.\" \n The presidential race was underway and he said he was watching a lot of cable news and heard a lot of talk about gun control. After doing some research on a conservative website that peddles conspiracy theories, he decided he needed a firearm. \n Not long after that, he said he was hassled by Los Angeles police. He did not give details, but said that incident triggered his decision to take on the government. \n The TSA was not in his first or even second choice as a target but while doing research he found it was the most hated agency in America. \n \"I wanted to make a statement,\" he said. \n He threw his plan into action Nov. 1 when his money ran out and he was unable to pay rent. \n \"My retirement was over,\" he said. \n Investigators discovered a note Ciancia left in a duffel bag with hundreds of rounds of ammo. It ranted about unconstitutional searches and he said the TSA treated Americans as terrorists and he intended to strike fear in their hearts. \n \"I want it to always be in the back of your head just how easy it is to take a weapon to the beginning of your Nazi checkpoints,\" said the note signed with his name and \"Pissed-off Patriot.\" \"If you want to play that game where you pretend that every American is a terrorist, you're going to learn what a self-fulfilling prophecy is.\" \n Although the sentence carries no chance of parole, Ciancia apparently still thinks he may one day be released. \n In a court filing, one of his lawyers noted: \"Ciancia believes he will get out of prison when the revolution begins.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n This story has been corrected to show Ciancia said he \"wanted to make a statement,\" not that he \"was going to make a statement.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "LAX gunman was 'sick of life,' hatched deadly plot"}

{"date": "November 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (left) speaks at a campaign rally at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Mich. today. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (right) speaks during a campaign rally in Raleigh, N.C., today. \n SCRANTON, Pa. >> Straining toward the finish line of the wildly unpredictable White House race, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump blitzed through battleground states today in a final bid to energize supporters. Clinton urged voters to embrace a \"hopeful, inclusive, bighearted America,\" while Trump called for support to \"beat the corrupt system.\" \n The candidates planned to campaign late into the night, a frenzied end to a bitter election year that has laid bare the nation's deep economic and cultural divides. \n Clinton opened the day Monday buoyed by FBI Director James Comey's announcement Sunday that he would not recommend criminal charges against her following a new email review. The inquiry had sapped a surging Clinton momentum at a crucial moment in the race, though she still heads into Election Day with multiple paths to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become the nation's first female president. \n \"I think I have some work to do to bring the country together,\" she acknowledged as she boarded her plane for her last battleground tour. \"I really do want to be the president for everybody.\" \n Looking beyond Election Day, Clinton said in a radio interview that she hopes Trump will play a \"constructive role\" in helping bring the country together if she defeats him. \n Trump was aggressive to the end, slamming Clinton as the \"face of failure.\" Having made the new FBI review a centerpiece of his closing case to voters, he argued that the Democrat was being protected by a \"totally rigged system.\" \n \"You have one magnificent chance to beat the corrupt system and deliver justice,\" Trump said. \"Do not let this opportunity slip away.\" \n The comments were a reminder that Comey's news, delivered in a letter to lawmakers on Sunday, was a doubled-edged sword for Clinton. While it vindicated her claims that the emails would not yield new evidence, it ensured that a controversy that has dogged her campaign from the start would follow her through Election Day. \n Across the country, nearly 24 million early ballots were cast under the shadow of Comey's initial announcement of a new email review. That number represents more than half of the roughly 42.5 million people who had cast votes by Monday afternoon, according to Associated Press data. \n The inquiry involved material found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Huma Abedin, a longtime Clinton aide. Comey said Sunday the FBI reviewed communications \"to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state.\" \n Clinton tried to fly above the controversy Monday and was not expected to address the matter during stops in Michigan and North Carolina. She was also headlining an evening rally in Philadelphia with President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, along with rock stars Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi. \n Nearing the end of his two terms in the White House, Obama was nostalgic as he launched his own busy day of events, noting that he was probably making his last campaign swing for the foreseeable future. \n \"Whatever credibility I have earned after eight years as president, I am asking you to trust me on this. I am voting for Hillary Clinton,\" Obama said. \n Clinton is banking in part on high turnout \u2014 particularly among Obama's young, diverse coalition of voters \u2014 to carry her over the finish line Tuesday. Roughly half the states with advance voting have reported record turnout, including Florida and Nevada, which have booming Hispanic populations, a possible good sign for Clinton. \n In Florida alone, Hispanic participation is up by more than 453,000 votes, nearly doubling the 2012 level. Black turnout is up compared to 2012, but that share of the total vote is lower due to bigger jumps among Latinos and whites, according to University of Florida professor Daniel Smith \n In Nevada, where more than three-fourths of expected ballots have been cast, Democrats also lead, 42 percent to 36 percent. \n Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie downplayed the impact of increased Hispanic participation, telling reporters on a conference call, \"We feel that we're going to get a good share of those votes.\" However, he sidestepped two questions about the level of Hispanic vote Trump needs to win the presidency. \n Without victories in Florida and Nevada, Trump's path to 270 electoral votes would be exceedingly narrow. He already must win nearly all of the roughly dozen battleground states. \n Trump planned to campaign at a breakneck pace through Election Day. Following the rally in Florida, he headed to North Carolina and then was off to Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. After voting in New York Tuesday morning, After that, Trump was to return to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and New Hampshire. \n Midway through his travels Monday, Trump praised his supporters for having created a \"movement.\" But he warned it would all slip away if he loses Tuesday. \n \"Go vote,\" he urged. \"Or honestly, we've all wasted our time.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Kathleen Hennessey, Hope Yen, Jonathan Lemire and Steve Peoples in Washington and Josh Lederman in Ann Arbor, Michigan, contributed to this report. \n \u2014 \n Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC, Lisa Lerer at http://twitter.com/llerer and Jill Colvin at http://twitter.com/colvinj \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Elbowing each other all the way, Trump, Clinton near finish"}

It's the latest action in a long-running legal dispute over Makua Valley, the site of decades of military training. \n A 2001 settlement allows Malama Makua to access sacred sites twice a month, but the Army suddenly imposed a \"blanket ban\" in 2014 when it claimed it first needed to obtain clearance from historic preservations to cut grass on trails leading to cultural sites so that any unexploded ordnance could be avoided, the lawsuit said. \n In September 2015, the Army obtained a grass-cutting agreement but said it then needed to investigate an accident that injured two contractors. The contractors were cutting grass for military training in April 2015 when unexploded ordnance exploded. \n The Army partially lifted the ban in November 2015 and allowed access to a few locations including, a paved parking area, a pavilion and ahu, or altars the community erected to celebrate the Makahiki season, said David Henkin, an Earthjustice attorney. \n While important to cultural practitioners, the areas are not cultural sites, he said, and the Army continues to block access to sites including temples, shrines, burials and petroglyphs. \n U.S. Army Hawaii spokesman Dennis Drake says officials won't comment on pending litigation. \n There's been no live-fire training in the valley since 2004. \n \"In the \u2026 years of access there's never been anyone on an access who has stubbed their toe, much less been injured by unexploded ordnance,\" Henkin said. The contractors were cutting grass for military training, not cultural access, in an area that Malama Makua doesn't use, he said. \n \"Every excuse they've come up with we've been patient. Persistent but patient,\" he said. \n Malama Makua consists of people who are \"Hawaiian by blood and Hawaiian at heart,\" mostly from the Waianae Coast, where the valley is located, Henkin said. \n The settlement is \"meant to be an opportunity for the people of the Waianae Coast and the broader community to reconnect culturally with a valley that's been cut off by military training and the Army doesn't like that,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lawsuit: Army denies access to Hawaiian cultural sites"}

{"date": "November 7, 2016", "text": "CHICAGO \u00bb Anesthesia during early childhood surgery poses little risk for intelligence and academics later on, the largest study of its kind suggests. \n The results were found in research on nearly 200,000 Swedish teens. School grades were only marginally lower in kids who'd had one or more common surgeries with anesthesia before age 4, compared with those who'd had no anesthesia during those early years. \n Whether the results apply to sicker children who have riskier surgeries with anesthesia is not known. But the researchers from Sweden's Karolinska Institute and doctors elsewhere called the new results reassuring, given experiments in young animals linking anesthesia drugs with brain damage. \n The study authors and other doctors say the harms from postponing surgery must be considered when evaluating any potential risks from anesthesia in young children. \n The most common procedures in the study were hernia repairs; ear, nose or throat surgeries; and abdominal operations. The researchers say the operations likely lasted an hour or less. The study did not include children with other serious health problems and those who had more complex or risky operations, including brain, heart and cancer surgeries. \n The research involved about 33,500 teens who'd had surgery before age 4 and nearly 160,000 who did not. \n School grades at age 16 were less than half a percent lower on average in teens who'd had one childhood surgery with anesthesia versus the no-surgery group. Average grades were less than 2 percent lower among teens who'd had two or more surgeries with anesthesia. \n The researchers also looked at IQ tests given to Swedish boys at age 18 upon joining the military. Scores were about the same for those with one early surgery and the non-surgery group; scores were less than 3 percent lower in boys with three or more early surgeries. \n The researchers, led by Karolinska's Dr. Pia Glatz, noted that factors other than anesthesia appeared to have a much greater impact on academics and intelligence measures, including mothers' education level. \n A journal editorial says the results mean it is unlikely that early anesthesia poses a long-term risk.

{"date": "November 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Damage on a street in Cushing, Okla., after an earthquake Sunday. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Damage on a street in Cushing, Okla., after an earthquake Sunday. \n CUSHING, Okla. \u00bb Dozens of buildings sustained \"substantial damage\" after a 5.0 magnitude earthquake struck an Oklahoma town that's home to one of the world's key oil hubs, but officials said today that no damage has been reported at the oil terminal. \n Cushing City Manager Steve Spears said 40 to 50 buildings were damaged in Sunday's earthquake, which was the third in Oklahoma this year with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater. No major injuries have been reported, and Spears said the damage included cracks to buildings and fallen bricks and facades. \n Oklahoma has had thousands of earthquakes in recent years, with nearly all traced to the underground injection of wastewater left over from oil and gas production. Sunday's quake was centered 1 mile west of Cushing and about 25 miles south of where a magnitude 4.3 quake forced a shutdown of several wells last week. \n Fearing aftershocks, police cordoned off older parts of the city about 50 miles northeast of Oklahoma City to keep gawkers away late Sunday, and geologists confirmed that several small quakes have rumbled the area. Spears said an assisted living community had been evacuated after damage was reported. The Cushing Public School District canceled classes today. \n The Oklahoma Department of Transportation reported Sunday night that no highway or bridge damage was found within a 15-mile radius of the earthquake's epicenter. \n The quake struck at 7:44 p.m. Sunday and was felt as far away as Iowa, Illinois and Texas. The U.S. Geological Survey initially said Sunday's quake was of magnitude 5.3 but later lowered the reading to 5.0. \n \"I thought my whole trailer was going to tip over, it was shaking it so bad,\" said Cushing resident Cindy Roe, 50. \"It was loud and all the lights went out and you could hear things falling on the ground. \n \"It was awful and I don't want to have another one.\" \n In recent years, Oklahoma regulators have asked oil and gas producers to either close wastewater injection wells or cut back on the volume of fluids injected. The reductions have generally led to a drop-off in quakes and their severity, though not always. \n Oklahoma's strongest quake on record, a magnitude 5.8 temblor on Sept. 3, occurred in Pawnee, on the fringe of an area that had already restricted wastewater disposal. Shortly afterward, geologists speculated on whether the temblor occurred on a previously unknown fault. \n Cushing's oil storage terminal is one of the world's largest. As of Oct. 28, tank farms in the countryside around Cushing held 58.5 million barrels of crude oil, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The community bills itself as the \"Pipeline Crossroads of the World.\" \n Cushing Assistant City Manager Jeremy Frazier said two pipeline companies had reported no trouble as of late Sunday but that the community hadn't heard from all companies. Gov. Mary Fallin tweeted that no damage was reported at the storage tanks at Cushing's oil storage terminal \n Megan Gustafson and Jonathan Gillespie were working at a Cushing McDonald's when the quake hit. \n \"It felt like a train was going right through the building, actually,\" Gustafson, 17, said Sunday night as she and her co-workers stood behind a police barricade downtown, looking for damage. \"I kind of freaked out and was hyperventilating a bit.\" \n Gillespie said the building shook for about 10 seconds, but that he wasn't as alarmed as Gustafson because he lives in an area that has experienced multiple earthquakes, especially in recent years. \n \"I didn't think it was anything new,\" he said. \n According to USGS data, there have been about two dozen earthquakes in Oklahoma in the past week. When particularly strong quakes hit, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission directs well operators to cease wastewater injections or reduce volume. \n \"I was at home doing some work in my office and, basically, you could feel the whole house sway some,\" Spears, the Cushing city manager, said Sunday night. \"It's beginning to become normal.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "40 to 50 buildings damaged in Oklahoma quake"}

Filemon Tan Jr. on Monday. \n MANILA \u00bb A German kidnapped by Somali pirates eight years ago may now be held captive by Islamic militants in the southern Philippines, the country's military said Monday after finding the man's yacht and a woman's body inside. \n Regional military spokesman Maj. Filemon Tan said Abu Sayyaf spokesman Muamar Askali claimed the militants kidnapped Jurgen Gustav Kantner and killed his female companion while the couple were cruising off neighboring Malaysia's Sabah state. \n It's not clear why the woman was purportedly killed, but it's possible she may have fought back or tried to escape, Tan and another military official said. \n Villagers reported finding a dead woman lying beside a shotgun on board a light blue yacht with the German flag and marked \"Rockall\" off Laparan Island in Sulu province, Tan said. The southern province is where ransom-seeking militants have held many hostages in jungle camps. \n Kantner, 69, and his wife were reportedly kidnapped off Somalia on board the Rockall in 2008 and later freed by Somali pirates, Tan said. Authorities did not know whether the woman kidnapped in Somalia is the same woman who was killed. \n Troops took custody of the woman's body and the yacht Monday. Both were being examined by police investigators in Tawi Tawi province near Sulu, the military's Western Mindanao Command said in a statement. \n \"Alarming is that the body found was naked and had several contusions to the face and was possibly raped,\" the military said. \n In Berlin, Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer said German authorities were working with their Philippine counterparts to learn what happened. \n \"We can and will confirm such reports \u2026 only when German consular employees have really established without doubt, with their own eyes and ears or by other means, that they are correct,\" Schaefer said. \"We're not there yet.\" \n The Abu Sayyaf, which is blacklisted by the U.S. and the Philippines as a terrorist organization, holds more than a dozen foreign and local hostages. \n Abu Sayyaf and allied gunmen have committed many attacks at sea despite efforts by the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia to jointly shore up security along their busy sea border. Indonesians and Malaysians have been kidnapped from tugboats and fishing boats in recent months. \n Indonesia's Foreign Ministry confirmed receiving information about the separate kidnappings of two Indonesian skippers of vessels off Sabah over the weekend, saying it was in touch with Malaysian and Philippine government officials about the latest abductions. \n Indonesia's government has urged Indonesian crewmen in Sabah to avoid sailing in the risky waters until security has improved, the ministry said. \n The kidnappings have continued despite one of the largest military offensives against Abu Sayyaf, mainly in Sulu and the nearby island province of Basilan, involving more than 6,000 troops, navy gunboats and rocket-firing air force aircraft. \n Without a known foreign source of funds, Abu Sayyaf has survived mostly on ransom kidnappings, extortion and other acts of banditry. \n A confidential Philippine government threat assessment report seen by The Associated Press said the militants pocketed at least $7.3 million from ransom kidnappings in the first six months of the year and have turned to abductions of foreign tugboat crewmen as military offensives restricted their mobility. \n Anticipating that the Abu Sayyaf may soon demand ransom for the German, Tan appealed for people to follow the Philippine government's no-ransom policy. \n \"If we give in to ransom, a greater damage will be done. They can use the money to buy arms and to feed their bandits and that will fuel again the tendency for them to kidnap,\" Tan said. \"It becomes a lucrative business.\" \n Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who took office June 30, has ordered troops to destroy the Abu Sayyaf and has ruled out the possibility of any peace talks with them. He has pursued talks with two other larger Muslim insurgent groups. \n The government report said the Abu Sayyaf had 481 fighters with 438 firearms in the first half of the year, but the military reported last week that it had killed 70 of the militants and captured 32 others since July in Basilan and Sulu, a Muslim province about 590 miles south of Manila. \n AP writer Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philippine militants say they abducted German, killed woman"}

{"date": "November 7, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. President Bill Clinton named Janet Reno the nation's first female attorney general, in Feb. 1993, at a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington. Reno, the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney general and the epicenter of several political storms during the Clinton administration, died early today. She was 78. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno testified, in April 2004, before the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. Reno, the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney general and the epicenter of several political storms during the Clinton administration, died today. She was 78. \n MIAMI \u00bb Shy and admittedly awkward, Janet Reno became a blunt spoken prosecutor and the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney general, yet she also was the epicenter of a relentless series of political storms, from the deadly raid on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, to the seizure of 5-year-old Cuban immigrant Elian Gonzalez. \n Reno, 78, died early today of complications from Parkinson's disease, her goddaughter Gabrielle D'Alemberte told The Associated Press. D'Alemberte said Reno spent her final days at home in Miami surrounded by family and friends. \n Reno, a former Miami prosecutor who famously told reporters \"I don't do spin,\" served nearly eight years as attorney general under President Bill Clinton, the longest stint in a century. \n One of the administration's most recognizable and polarizing figures, Reno faced criticism early in her tenure for the deadly raid on the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, where sect leader David Koresh and some 80 followers perished. \n She was known for deliberating slowly, publicly and in a typically blunt manner. Reno frequently told the public \"the buck stops with me,\" borrowing the mantra from President Harry S. Truman. \n After Waco, Reno figured into some of the controversies and scandals that marked the Clinton administration, including Whitewater, Filegate, bungling at the FBI laboratory, Monica Lewinsky, alleged Chinese nuclear spying and questionable campaign financing in the 1996 Clinton-Gore re-election. \n In the spring of 2000, Reno enraged her hometown's Cuban-American community when she authorized the armed seizure of young Elian. The boy was taken from the Little Havana home of his Miami relatives so he could be returned to his father in Cuba. \n After leaving Washington, Reno returned to Florida and made an unsuccessful run for Florida governor in 2002 but lost in a Democratic primary marred by voting problems. \n The campaign ended a public career that started amid humble beginnings. Born July 21, 1938, Janet Wood Reno was the daughter of two newspaper reporters and the eldest of four siblings. She grew up on the edge of the Everglades in a cypress and brick homestead built by her mother and returned there after leaving Washington. Her late brother Robert Reno was a longtime columnist for Newsday on Long Island. \n After graduating from Cornell University with a degree in chemistry, Reno became one of 16 women in Harvard Law School's Class of 1963. Reno, who stood over 6 feet tall, later said she wanted to become a lawyer \"because I didn't want people to tell me what to do.\" \n In 1993, Clinton tapped her to become the first woman to lead the Justice Department after his first two choices \u2014 also women \u2014 were withdrawn because both had hired illegal immigrants as nannies. Reno was 54. \n \"It's an extraordinary experience, and I hope I do the women of America proud,\" Reno said after she won confirmation. \n Clinton said the vote might be \"the only vote I carry 98-0 this year.\" \n A little more than a month of taking office, however, Reno became embroiled in controversy with the raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco. \n The standoff had started even before Reno was confirmed as attorney general. On Feb. 28, 1993, agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms made a surprise raid on the compound, trying to execute a search warrant. But during the raid gunfire erupted, killing four agents and six members of the religious sect. \n That led to a 51-day standoff, ending April 19, 1993, when the complex caught fire and burned to the ground. The government claimed the Davidians died by suicide, shooting themselves and setting the fire. Survivors said the blaze was started by tear gas rounds fired into the compound by government tanks, and that agents shot at some who tried to flee. Reno had authorized the use of the tear gas to end the standoff and later called the day the worst of her life. \n \"It was a dangerous situation,\" Reno said of the incident during a 2005 lecture at Duke University. \"The tragedy is that we will never know what was the right thing to do.\" \n Things got no easier after Waco. In 1995 Reno was diagnosed with Parkinson's after noticing a trembling in her left hand. She said from the beginning that the diagnosis, which she announced during a weekly news conference, would not impair her job performance. And critics \u2014 both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 did not give her a pass because of it. \n Republicans argued she should have sought appointment of an independent counsel to investigate allegations of Clinton-Gore fundraising violations. Democrats, meanwhile, grumbled that she failed to act as a team player. \n In early 2000, Reno tried to negotiate the return to Cuba of young Elian, who had been rescued after his mother and others had drowned trying to boat from Cuba to Florida. He had been placed in the care of a Miami uncle, but his father, who lived in Cuba, wanted him returned to the island. \n When Reno decided talks had broken down that April, she ordered an early morning raid by federal agents who seized the boy, provoking the ire of Miami's Cuban-American community. Reno insisted that Elian should be with his father \u2014 she even kept a snapshot of a smiling Elian in his father's arms near her home computer. \n Reno said later that federal officials tried up until the last minute to negotiate a voluntary handover and avoid the raid \u2014 where Elian was found hiding in a closet and confronted by an agent with a gun. \n \"We have been to great lengths to resolve this case in the least disruptive manner possible,\" she said at a news conference following the raid. \n As attorney general, Reno was derided by late night talk show hosts for her homely appearance, short wash-and-wear haircut and simple black pumps. Comedian Will Ferrell memorialized her in a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit called \"Janet Reno's Dance Party\" and Reno visited the skit the night she left the Justice Department in January 2001. \n Reno began her career in Miami in the mid-1960s and had her first encounter with the \"glass ceiling,\" getting passed over for a job at a law firm because she was a woman. She later made partner. In 1972, she lost a race for a Miami-area legislative seat but learned the importance of sticking to her principles from mentor John Orr, a former state lawmaker. \n \"Don't equivocate, don't pussyfoot, don't talk out of both sides of your mouth and you'll wake up the next morning feeling good about yourself,\" he told Reno. It became one of her favorite sayings. \n After losing that election, Reno was hired by the Dade State Attorney's office, where she established herself as an organized and competent lawyer. In 1978, when State Attorney Richard Gerstein decided to step down, Reno was named his successor. \n As prosecutor, Reno built programs to help reform drug dealers and combat domestic violence. Another program strong-armed deadbeat dads into paying child support, inspiring a rap song named after her. \n It included the line: \"All the money you get, all the checks you make; Janet Reno will make sure and take.\" \n She also weathered a 1980 riot after an all-white jury acquitted five police officers for the beating death of a black insurance salesman. Eighteen people were killed in the rioting and crowds chanted Reno's name, accusing her of being a racist and demanding her resignation. Reno refused. \n \"To resign was to give into anarchy,\" she said. \n Reno eventually won the support of the city's black community, attending countless community meetings, church services and parades. \n Her last foray into politics was the race for Florida governor. Known for being down-to-earth \u2014 her home number was listed in a city directory both before and after Washington \u2014 and even folksy, she crisscrossed the state to campaign in a red Ford Ranger pickup truck. But Reno lost the primary to Tampa lawyer Bill McBride despite her name recognition. Republican Gov. Jeb Bush defeated McBride to win a second term. \n After retiring from politics she served on the boards or as an adviser to several organizations. In 2004 she joined the board of the New York-based Innocence Project, which works to free prisoners who can be proven innocent through DNA testing. \n She also spent more time with her family. Reno never married but remained extremely close to her tight-knit family. \n Asked to describe her legacy after ending her gubernatorial campaign, Reno quoted George Washington: \"If I were to write all that down I might be reduced to tears. I would prefer to drift on down the stream of life and let history make the judgment.\" \n Associated Press writers Ken Thomas and Jessica Gresko contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Janet Reno, former U.S. attorney general, has died"}

{"date": "November 7, 2016", "text": "New York \u00bb It's not just Detroit and Puerto Rico with financial problems. \n The pressure is rising on local governments around the country that are struggling with big pension obligations and other debts. Five states need to put aside more than 25 percent of their annual tax revenues just to pay pensions and other debts, an untenable amount, according to a recent study by the nonprofit Center for Retirement Research. For major cities, debt costs above 40 percent of revenue are typically an unmanageable burden, and the report counts eight of them. \n Overall, U.S. state pension plans are underfunded by at least $1 trillion, various experts and credit rating agencies say. And that funding hole will almost certainly hurt taxpayers, government workers and bondholders. \n \"It's getting harder to sweep these problems under the rug,\" says Tracy Gordon, a senior fellow with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \n After taking into account health care and other debt obligations, states like Hawaii, Kentucky and Massachusetts and cities like Houston and San Jose, California, are all above thresholds that the Center for Retirement Research considers worrisome. \n For many years, politicians hoped to make up for the funding gaps by getting strong returns from investments in stocks, bonds and hedge funds, says Gordon. But the typical public pension plan had a return of just 0.5 percent for the fiscal year that ended in June, according to credit-rating agency Moody's. \n That has increased the risk for a major crisis at municipalities with outsize debt payment, says Lisa Washburn, a managing director for Municipal Market Analytics, a municipal bond research firm. \"This is a liability that they are going to have to come to terms with eventually, and the longer they delay coming to terms with it, the worse it's going to be.\" \n How you might be affected depends on your relationship to the location in question: \n \u2014 You're a bond holder. \n For muni bond investors, the chief worry is a default. But despite the dramatic headlines, investors who hold state-issued bonds until they mature have little to fear. \"You can expect to be repaid,\" says Washburn. If your state's debt rating is downgraded, however, you may find that your bond is worth less if you need to sell it before maturity. \n Those who hold the bonds of struggling cities overburdened with debt, however, have cause for concern. \"States have sovereign ability to do just about anything they want, so they have a very wide array of options to pursue,\" says Alan Schankel, a municipal bond strategist at Janney Capital Markets. \"Depending on the level of oversight, cities and counties have much less flexibility. And many of them are dependent on state aid.\" \n When a city files for bankruptcy, judges sometimes allow payments to be curtailed to muni bondholders. That's what happened in Detroit and Stockton, California. Moreover, severe budget problems at the state government level can also have a trickle-down effect leading to less support for schools and hospitals supported by the state, which also issue municipal bonds. \n \u2014 You're an employee. \n The good news for public service workers is that, in some states, pension payments are guaranteed by law. And even in places where they may not be, legislators tend to be sympathetic to pension holders. \n Now for the bad news: If things get really bad, you still might find your benefits thwacked. Detroit workers, for example, had their pensions cut when the city filed for bankruptcy. A more likely situation is that you'll be the victim of pension \"reform,\" which could involve an increase to your annual contribution rate or fewer cost-of-living salary bumps. You may also see cutbacks in other benefits, such as health care, which are easier for states and cities to enact. Rhode Island suspended cost-of-living adjustments for retirees in 2011 and introduced a 401(k)-like funding system for current state workers, for example. \n \u2014 You're a taxpayer. \n A simple way for states to boost their sagging budgets is to increase taxes. A sales tax increase along with an income tax increase on wealthy residents helped California pull out of its massive budget hole from the Great Recession, for example. Simple, though, doesn't mean easy. Politicians are often reluctant to increases taxes on their watch. \"Politically, that's just very hard to do,\" says Washburn. \n Other places have tried different tactics to boost revenues. A few years ago, Kansas tried cutting taxes in hopes that it would boost its economy and lead to eventual gains in income tax revenue, for example. Unfortunately, the state still recently had a projected $290 billion shortfall. \n Instead of raising taxes, states sometimes cut back services in order to save money. \"Maybe the Department of Motor Vehicles is open five days a week instead of six,\" says Schankel. The challenge is that if too many services are cut, residents will become disenchanted with the community and move elsewhere. That only exacerbates the revenue problem. \n It all shows how no single approach will lift local governments out of their troubles. One thing, however, is clear, says Gordon: \"Someone has to be left holding the bag.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "State and city budget blues: Pressures keep piling up"}
