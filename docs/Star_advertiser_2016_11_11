There was word on what charges he might face. \n Yan, former chairman of Tonghua Golden Horse Pharmaceutical Group in the northeastern city of Tonghua, fled to Australia in 2001 after being accused of fraud and embezzlement, according to earlier news reports. He later became a New Zealand citizen under the name William Yan. \n Yan was on a Chinese government list of the top 100 fugitives sought abroad in a marathon dragnet known as \"Sky Net.\" As of July, 33 people on that list had been returned to China, according to the government newspaper China Daily. \n China has few extradition treaties with other governments. Beijing is expanding cooperation with foreign law enforcement but that has been hampered in some cases by concern charges might be politically motivated and that China has executed convicts for non-violent offenses such as tax evasion. \n In Yan's case, Chinese media said having him returned from New Zealand without his cooperation would be almost impossible. \n Eleven of the suspects on the \"Sky Net\" list are believed to be living in New Zealand, the No. 3 destination for Chinese fugitives after the United States and Canada, according to the business news magazine Caixin. \n A New Zealand court in August approved the seizure of assets from Yan valued at 43 million New Zealand dollars ($31 million), according to Chinese news reports. They said that was the biggest seizure in New Zealand to date of assets related to crimes alleged to have occurred in China. \n Earlier, Australian authorities also seized some $2.8 million from Yan, according to Caixin. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "China says fugitive businessman returns after 15 years"}

Authorities said vandalism and assault had taken place during the rally, which organizers had billed as peaceful earlier in the day. \n There were also spirited demonstrations on college campuses and along downtown streets were mostly peaceful following previous outbreaks of window-smashing and fire-setting. \n Evening marches disrupted traffic in Miami and Atlanta. \n Trump supporter Nicolas Quirico was traveling from South Beach to Miami.

However, they have threatened to campaign for resignation if she doesn't distance herself from state affairs. \n The protest on Saturday was expected to be the largest in the capital since June 10, 2008, when police said 80,000 people took part in a candlelight vigil denouncing the government's decision to resume U.S. beef imports amid persisting mad cow fears. Organizers then estimated the crowd at 700,000. \n In the summer of 1987, millions of South Koreans rallied in Seoul and other cities for weeks before the then-military government caved in to demands for free presidential elections. \n In an attempt to stabilize the situation, Park on Tuesday said she would let the opposition-controlled parliament choose her prime minister. But opposition parties say her words are meaningless without specific promises about transferring much of her presidential powers to a new No. 2. \n Prosecutors have arrested Choi, one of her key associates and two former presidential aides who allegedly helped Choi interfere with government decisions and amass an illicit fortune at the expense of businesses. \n Prosecutors also on Friday summoned the chairman of steelmaker POSCO over allegations that Choi and her associates tried to forcibly take over the shares of an advertisement company previously owned by the steelmaker.On Tuesday, they raided the headquarters of smartphone giant Samsung Electronics, the country's largest company, which is under suspicion of spending millions of dollars illicitly financing the equestrian training of Choi's athlete daughter. \n Under South Korea's criminal litigation law, which requires suspects to be either indicted or released within 20 days of their arrest, prosecutors have until Nov. 20 to formally charge Choi. \n There is also a possibility that prosecutors will eventually investigate Park, who in a televised apology last week said she would accept a direct investigation into her action. The president has immunity from prosecution except in cases of treason, under South Korean law, but she can be investigated. \n Park has 15 months left in her term. If she steps down before the end of it, an election must be held within 60 days. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mass rally planned in Seoul calling for Park's ouster"}

He's been hearing from scientists about the impact of climate change on the frozen continent. \n Trump has called climate change a hoax and said he would \"cancel\" U.S. involvement in the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming. \n \"We need to get more of a movement going,\" Kerry said when addressing several hundred scientists and staff at an evening event at McMurdo Station, the large base which is the hub for U.S. operations. \"We need to get more people to engage.\" \n Kerry said there was a risk that much of Antarctica's ice will eventually flow into the ocean, raising sea levels worldwide. \n Despite the Paris agreement to cut the fossil-fuel emissions causing the planet to warm, \"we haven't won the battle yet,\" Kerry said to the audience that included many young people involved in climate research. \n Earlier, a planned visit to the South Pole was scrapped because of bad weather.

He has been receiving briefings from scientists working to understand the effects of climate change on Antarctica. \n Kerry has made climate change an intensive focus of American diplomacy during his term, and had previously spent decades working on the issue as a U.S. senator. \n He planned to return to New Zealand on Saturday for a meeting with Prime Minister John Key.

He commended the students for \"forcing\" officials to discuss their safety concerns and assured them that if they do decide to protest, police will make sure they're protected. \n Marist, the Catholic high school, canceled classes Friday after the group that calls itself Black Lives Matter Youth scheduled a demonstration. One of its organizers, Eva Lewis, said the students' protest was postponed because the school district contacted their parents to warn them about potential threats. \n Johnson provided few details about the meeting but confirmed his offer to talk monthly to the group. \n \"I told them if they created a curriculum and they wanted to come in and speak to members of the (Chicago Police Department), I would facilitate,\" he said. \n The meeting came amid increased tensions in the predominantly white neighborhood that is home to many police officers, firefighters and other city employees. An off-duty police officer fatally shot Joshua Beal, a 25-year-old Indianapolis resident. Police say Beal pointed a gun at the officer during a melee that began when an off-duty firefighter told the driver of the vehicle Beal was in that it needed to be moved because it was blocking a fire station's driveway. \n Since then, activists have held at least two demonstrations \u2014 both of which attracted largely white crowds that shouted profanity and racially-charged language at the protesters. \n At Marist, administrators launched an investigation after media reports that some female students in a group text discussed the shooting and the subsequent protests, with one using the N-word. In a message posted online, school officials said they were \"devastated by the incident\" and that security at the school had been increased. The school also said that \"disciplinary action\" had already been taken but they would not elaborate. \n Some white residents of the area have said they were merely trying to stand up in support for the many police officers who live in the community. But the scene that was captured on videos showed angry crowds shouting down the demonstrators to go back to their communities and revving their motorcycles to drown out what they were saying. \n The alderman who represents the community on the City Council said he was caught off guard by what he saw on the videos of the protests. \n \"Certainly when something as ugly as we have seen in the last week in my community, I was caught by surprise and I'm saddened by it,\" Alderman Matt O'Shea said. \n The school said in a statement Friday that it called off classes to \"ensure safety and limit learning disruptions.\" School officials have launched an investigation of the students' text messages, telling parents in a message posted online that they were \"devastated by this incident\" and that security at the school had been increased.

{"date": "November 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Vice President-elect Mike Pence posed for photos after speaking at a Veterans Day ceremony at Camp Atterbury in Edinburgh, Ind., today. \n WASHINGTON >> President-elect Donald Trump is shaking up his transition team as he plunges into the work of setting up his administration, elevating Vice President-elect Mike Pence to head the operations. It amounts to a demotion for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who had been running Trump's transition planning for months. \n On the heels of Trump's upset victory this week, the Republican's team has been scrambling to identify people for top White House jobs and Cabinet posts. It's an enormous undertaking that must be well in hand by the time Trump is inaugurated on Jan. 20. \n In a statement Friday, Trump said Pence would \"build on the initial work\" done by Christie. \n \"Together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding this nation \u2014 specifically jobs, security and opportunity,\" Trump said. \n Christie was a loyal adviser to Trump for much of the campaign and came close to being the businessman's pick for running mate. But Trump ultimately went with Indiana Gov. Pence, a former congressman with Washington experience and deep ties to conservatives. \n Christie will still be involved in the transition, joining a cluster of other steadfast Trump supporters serving as vice chairs: former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. \n For Trump, who ran on a pledge to \"drain the swamp\" of Washington insiders, the team is strikingly heavy on those with long political resumes. \n In addition, three of Trump's adult children \u2014 Don. Jr., Eric and Ivanka \u2014 are on the transition executive committee, along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband. Kushner played a significant role in Trump's campaign and was spotted at the White House Thursday meeting with President Barack Obama's chief of staff. \n Pence said the transition staff is made up of the right people to \"bring about fundamental change in Washington.\" \n After ending his own failed campaign for president, Christie emerged as one of Trump's most enthusiastic supporters. He nearly became Trump's running mate but was edged out by Pence. \n Trump and Christie grew apart through the last stretch of the campaign. The governor became increasingly frustrated that Trump wouldn't listen to his advice, particularly over the response to the release of a 1995 video in which the businessman is heard making predatory comments about women. \n Christie is also facing calls for impeachment in New Jersey following the conviction of two former aides in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing trial. Christie has denied any knowledge of the lane closures until weeks or months after they occurred in September 2013. \n The governor was notably absent from the steady stream of advisers entering Trump's eponymous skyscraper in New York for meetings Friday. Among the first decisions facing the president-elect is whom to choose as chief of staff, a key post that will set the tone for Trump's White House and be a key conduit to Capitol Hill and Cabinet agencies. \n Trump is said to be considering Steve Bannon, his campaign chairman and a conservative media executive, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus for the role. Neither has significant policy experience, though Priebus is well-liked in Washington and has deep ties with key lawmakers. \n Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, is also said to be in the mix for a senior job. Conway is a veteran Republican pollster who formed a strong rapport with the candidate after taking the helm of his campaign in the general election. \n While Trump has long led a large business, the scope of the federal government exceeds any of his previous endeavors. Those around Trump, who is known as a hands-on executive, say he'll likely have to make adjustments in his leadership style and decision-making, including more delegating. \n Trump has chafed at that a bit, but he has signaled willingness to relinquish some but not all, personal control. He also seems reluctant to expand his core group of aides beyond the inner circle with whom he feels comfortable. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n AP writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Jonathan Lemire at http://twitter.com/JonLemire \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump shakes up transition team, elevates Pence's role"}
