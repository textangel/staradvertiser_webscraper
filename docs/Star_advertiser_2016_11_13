Bannon previously ran the Breitbart website, which was fiercely critical of Republican leadership, including Ryan. \n Bannon was notably given top billing in the press release announcing the appointments, a curious arrangement giving that White House chief of staff is typically considered the most powerful West Wing job. \n Under Bannon's tenure, the Brietbart site pushed a nationalist, anti-establishment agenda and became one of the leading outlets of the so-called alt-right \u2014 a movement often associated with white supremacy and a defense of \"Western values.\" \n Neither Priebus nor Bannon bring significant policy experience to their new White House roles. Chiefs of staff in particular play a significant role in policy making, serving as a liaison to Cabinet agencies and deciding what information makes it to the president's desk. They're often one of the last people in the room with the president as major decisions are made. \n Together with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the triumvirate will lead Trump's transition to the White House and help guide his presidency, Trump said in a statement. \n \"I am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country,\" Trump said. He called Priebus and Bannon \"highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory. \n Priebus called the appointment \"an honor\" and predicted the billionaire \"will be a great president for all Americans.\" \n The appointments came after a day in which Trump's tough-talking plan to rein in illegal immigration showed signs Sunday of cracking, with the president-elect backing off his vow to build a solid wall along the southern U.S. border and Ryan rejecting any \"deportation force\" targeting people living in the country illegally. \n After Trump told CBS' \"60 Minutes\" that his border wall might look more like a fence in spots, the combative billionaire took to Twitter to settle some scores. \n During a four-hour spree, Trump savaged the New York Times and gloated about the GOP stalwarts lining up to congratulate him, bragging that staunch critics and GOP rivals John Kasich, Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush had sent attaboys. Former presidents George W. and George H.W. Bush also had sent their \"best wishes on the win. Very nice!\" The New York Times, Trump wrote to his 14 million followers, is \"dishonest\" and \"highly inaccurate.\" \n As Trump revenge-tweeted, threats flew between power brokers, and protests across the country continued. \n The president-elect retreated from the campaign promise that had inspired his supporters to chant \"Build the wall!\" at Trump's massive campaign rallies. \n Would he accept a fence in some spots on the border? In an interview to be aired Sunday, Trump told \"60 Minutes\": \"For certain areas, I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. There could be some fencing.\" \n Excerpts of the interview were released in advance. \n Trump also had vowed to immediately deport all 11 million people living in the country illegally. But in the interview, he said he's focusing first on ousting or incarcerating 2 million to 3 million \"that are criminals and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers.\" Trump emphasized that securing the border is his very first immigration priority. \n On that, Ryan agreed. But on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Ryan rejected the kind of \"mass deportations\" Trump had championed during the campaign. \n \"We are not planning on erecting a deportation force,\" Ryan said. \n More tension emerged Sunday when Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid should be careful in a \"legal sense\" about characterizing Trump as a sexual predator. When asked whether Trump was threatening to sue Reid, Conway said no. \n But Adam Jentleson, Reid's deputy chief of staff, said Trump is \"hiding behind his Twitter account and sending his staff on TV to threaten his critics.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump names Priebus, Bannon to senior White House roles"}

{"date": "November 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton walks off the stage after speaking in New York, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016. Clinton conceded the presidency to Donald Trump in a phone call early Wednesday morning, a stunning end to a campaign that appeared poised right up until election day to make her the first woman elected U.S. president. \n WASHINGTON >> Hillary Clinton is blaming the FBI's decision to revive its examination of her email accounts for her devastating defeat in the presidential election. \n On a call Saturday with top campaign donors, Clinton said her campaign was winning until FBI director James Comey sent a letter to Congress on Oct. 28 announcing that the FBI had uncovered emails possibly related to its earlier probe into her use of a private server as secretary of state. The new examination was sparked by an unrelated investigation into former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of one of her top aides. \n The surprise announcement by the FBI came after three debates in which Republican Donald Trump was widely panned for his performance. Clinton told the donors that her campaign was leading by large margins in nearly every battleground state and was tied in Arizona, a traditionally Republican stronghold, until Comey released his letter. \n Trump's campaign and Republican supporters seized on the news, even though it was unclear whether Clinton's correspondence was tied up in the probe. \n Comey told lawmakers the Sunday before the election that the bureau had found no evidence to warrant criminal charges. His \"all clear\" message only served to further motivate Trump supporters, Clinton told donors on the call. \n In the nine days between Comey's initial statement and his \"all clear\" announcement, nearly 24 million people cast early ballots. That was roughly 18 percent of the expected total votes for president. \n While Clinton accepted some blame of her loss, said donors who listened to her call, she made little mention of the other factors driving Trump's victory: A desire for change by voters, possible sexism, the difficulty of a political party winning a third White House term, her campaign's all-but-dismissal of white working class voters and flaws within her own message. \n Donors on the call were not authorized to discuss her comments by name and requested anonymity to describe them to The Associated Press. \n Democrats have spent much of this week reeling for their loss, with many in the party beginning a process of soul-searching designed to sort out what exactly went wrong. Liberals like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren say Democrats must embrace a more aggressive economic message \u2014 one Clinton largely shied away from during her campaign. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton blames FBI director for presidential election loss"}

{"date": "November 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President elect Donald Trump, second from right, greets his wife, Melania Trump, after giving his acceptance speech at an election night rally, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016, in New York. Vice president elect Mike Pence, second from left, and his wife, Karen Pence, looked on. \n NEW YORK >> President-elect Donald Trump's decision to empower his running mate Mike Pence to steer the presidential transition gives the soon-to-be vice president a powerful hand in shaping the incoming government and could foreshadow that he will play an outsized role in the White House. \n Pence's ascension is in line with a recent trend toward influential vice presidents and appears similar to the last vice president who was handed the keys to a presidential transition: Dick Cheney. \n As the nation was embroiled in the recount after the 2000 election, George W. Bush informally entrusted Cheney to begin building the government even before the outcome was settled in favor of the Republican ticket. Some of the work was done sitting around Cheney's kitchen table in McLean, Virginia, remembered Ari Fleischer, who became Bush's first press secretary. \n \"This is a big test for Pence,\" Fleischer told The Associated Press. \"If it goes well, it will portend a bigger job for him in the White House.\" \n Cheney clearly passed that test and became one of the most powerful vice presidents in recent memory, particularly during Bush's first term. Cheney not only ran Bush's vice presidential search team \u2014 eventually picking himself \u2014 he stocked the administration with veteran Republicans, many of whom he had known for years. \n \"The vice president was so influential he barely spoke in meetings because he knew he would see the president alone and could convey his thoughts privately,\" said Fleischer. \"Only the truly powerful can be that silent. And when he did talk, it was pretty impactful.\" \n It is far too soon to say if Pence will have a similar voice in Trump's White House, but naming him the chairman of the transition team broadcasts to others in Washington that he will be a key player. \n \"If you're given an important role in the transition, it sends a signal to other people that you matter,\" said Joel K. Goldstein, a law professor at St. Louis University who is widely considered one of the nation's leading experts on the sometimes obscure history of the vice presidency. \"Other political actors want to deal with you due to your perceived access and influence to the president.\" \n It also gives the vice president a chance to put his own stamp on the administration. While Trump ran as a political outsider and was not shy in burning bridges to establishment Washington, Pence is a popular GOP figure who may opt to select longtime allies for key roles. \n \"Those who get new jobs may feel beholden to the vice president and feel responsive to him,\" said Goldstein. \"It's a way of guaranteeing a degree of loyalty.\" \n Unlike Bush and Cheney, who were friends for years, or Bill Clinton and Al Gore, who were both of the same generation of moderate Southern Democrats, Trump and Pence did not have much of a relationship before the celebrity businessman selected the Indiana governor to be his running mate. Trump then waffled, having second thoughts about the choice and asking aides if he could replace him. \n But those close to Trump say he and Pence, a dyed-in-the-wool social conservative who also served in Congress, have forged a friendship and there is little doubt that the selection of the Indiana governor \u2014 as opposed to embattled New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u2014 sent a reassuring signal to some mainstream Republicans who previously been ill at ease about the incendiary nominee. Pence's closing argument was that it was time \"for Republicans to come home\" and Trump won a higher percentage of Republican votes than his opponent Hillary Clinton did from Democrats, according to exit polls. \n There has also been speculation that Trump would view the presidency as a CEO role and delegate some of the decision-making elsewhere. Aides to Ohio Gov. John Kasich said that Trump's eldest son had suggested over the summer that the future vice-president would do much of the heavy lifting on both foreign and domestic policy while Trump would be in charge of \"Making America Great Again,\" a claim the Trump camp later denied. \n It seems likely that Pence will play a key role. For decades, vice-presidents were mere window dressing, given largely ceremonial tasks and left out of key decisions. That changed in 1976 when Jimmy Carter elevated Walter Mondale's role \u2014 Mondale also ran the transition \u2014 and vice-presidents since have large staffs, are often placed in charge of key administrative priorities and frequently become the administration's liaison to Capitol Hill. \n President Barack Obama tasked Vice President Joe Biden with several administration priorities, including its recent anti-cancer \"moonshot,\" and considers his running mate one of his closest friends. \n \"Trump has learned to trust Pence and Pence has years of experience in Congress,\" said Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. \"I think it's dawning on Trump that he's now got enormous responsibilities and needs the help of every experienced, competent person he can find.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pence's transition job could signal key role in White House"}

The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attacks . \n Three teams of extremists coming from neighboring Belgium targeted six bars and eateries, turning scenes of Friday night fun into bloodbaths. \n At the Stade de France, on the northern edge of Paris, Michael Dias said his father Manuel was \"living proof that integration is possible, necessary\" to end the madness of violence carried out by those who felt excluded. \n Learning to live again after extremists killed his father was \"a personal challenge, but it concerns us all,\" Dias said, crediting his father, who came to France at 18, with life lessons like the need for education. \n \"It is by knowledge, by intelligence that the children of tomorrow can stop humiliating themselves as cannon fodder in the service of criminal, mafia-style interests \u2026 as is the case today. (They are) incapable of reflection, thinking about the world and expressing the unease and social exclusion they feel.\" \n The final stop, the Bataclan concert hall \u2014 which reopened Saturday night with a concert by British pop star Sting \u2014 was the site of the bloodiest and longest attack. There, 90 people were killed by three attackers who also took a group of people hostage. The youngest and oldest victims of the night of horror were a 17-year-old and a 68 year-old \u2014 both killed at the Bataclan. \n Families of victims, security and rescue forces and some still trying to heal were among those present at the ceremonies. Jesse Holmes of the Eagles of Death Metal, the California band whose concert that night ended in a bloodbath, paid respects at the Bataclan ceremony, placing his hand on his heart as he departed. \n In addition to those killed, nine people remain hospitalized from the attacks and others are paralyzed. The government says more than 600 people are still receiving psychological treatment after the attacks. \n A sign scrawled and posted near the Bataclan, \"Love for all, hate for no one,\" captured the sense of defiance shared by many \u2014 but not all. Some residents of the lively neighborhood where most of the attacks occurred are still trying to heal. \n \"We always have this fear that weighs heavily in our hearts. We always try to be careful. And every time we pass by here, we think of them,\" Sabrina Nedjadi said. \n Soubida Arhoui said fear is now part of her life. \n \"I am afraid for my children, when they take the Metro. When my son goes to work, I am afraid. When I get into a Metro I am afraid.\" \n \"This anniversary is a further reminder of the volatile terrorist threat faced in Europe today,\" said a statement by Europol, the European police agency. \n The remembrances come after the Sting concert Saturday night that reopened the refurbished Bataclan concert hall. \n Sting, in a T-shirt with a guitar slung over his shoulder, asked concert-goers in fluent French to observe a minute of silence as he opened the show. \n \"We've got two important things to do tonight,\" the 65-year-old singer said. \"First, to remember and honor those who lost their lives in the attacks a year ago \u2026 and to celebrate the life and the music of this historic venue. \u2026 We shall not forget them.\" \n He then strummed out a string of hits, including \"Fragile\" and \"Message in a Bottle.\" \n Elodie Suigo, who lost six friends in the attack, said it was a hard night. \n \"It was difficult going through that door. I don't think I was the only one\u2026 We cannot say it was a magical moment because of everything that changed in our lives. But (Sting) is a really great man,\" she said. \n With more than 400 rounds fired within 10 minutes at the restaurants, the coordinated attacks were a wake-up call for France and for Europe. They followed the January 2015 newsroom massacre at the satiric newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris and a Kosher grocery store that left 17 dead. But the complex planning behind the Nov. 13 attacks and the high number of deaths revealed a degree of French vulnerability not previously suspected by authorities. \n Neighboring Belgium, the starting point of the attacks in Paris, was hit a few months later on March 22 with attacks on its airport and a metro station that killed 32 people. \n France declared a state of emergency after the Nov. 13 attacks. It is still in effect, and Prime Minister Manuel Valls told the BBC that it would likely be extended. Still, that failed to prevent the killing of a police couple in their home last June, the July 14 Bastille Day truck attack in Nice that killed 86 revelers and the slaying of a priest at the altar of his Normandy church in July. \n Valls warned earlier this weekend that \"Yes, terrorism will strike us again.\" But, he contended, \"we have all the resources to resist and all the strength to win.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "France marks Paris attacks anniversary with somber silence"}

{"date": "November 13, 2016", "text": "HACKENSACK, N.J. >> At dinner tables, in classrooms and in counseling offices, adults are grappling with how to help young people work through their anxieties and emotions in the aftermath of the divisive presidential election. \n In colleges, students lined up for counseling sessions and sought out peers for support at meetings and at rallies. In lower grades, teachers fielded questions about what Donald Trump's win could mean for students and stressed the importance of the democratic process. And at home, parents reassured children that they would be safe. \n For young people, anxiety may be tied to deportation fears, tensions with peers over the election and disappointment over the failed prospect of the first female president, among other concerns. Experts say it's critical for adults to talk it out, help them to feel safe and remind them to engage with others in a respectful and tolerant way. \n In one Teaneck high school classroom, social studies teacher Margot Mack said students of all political leanings seemed shocked over the results, since polling had shown Hillary Clinton as the likely winner. \n \"My lesson plans for the day were held and that's all we talked about,\" she said. \"They wanted to. It was really like a soul-searching session. They wanted answers and they wanted clarity.\" \n Some students were upset with the results, while others were confused about the role of the Electoral College. They listened to each other and channeled their emotions into research and learning, as they pulled up data and maps showing how people voted. \n \"You have to be positive,\" Mack said. She asked the students, \"What will you do? If you're happy, how will you sustain this result? If you're not happy, how will you change it?\" \n With tensions running high, there were reports in some schools across the country of election-related taunts and harassment. Yasmeen Al Shehab, said her 13-year-old daughter left school early Wednesday because she was comfortable after being taunted by a classmate after Trump's win, in what she felt was a jab about her Muslim faith. \n Officials at the Teaneck middle school dealt with it promptly, she said, but her daughter remained upset on what had already been a trying day for her three children, who feared they'd be singled for scrutiny in a Trump administration. \n \"They feel they can't look to their commander in chief to protect them. Instead of saying Islam is a peaceful religion, he's saying ban Muslims. They're kids. It's hard for them,\" she said. \n She encouraged her children to stand up for themselves and to report any problems, even as she worried privately about escalating anti-Muslim sentiment. \n \"We are relying heavily on our faith to have our discussions with our kids,\" she said. \"We ourselves are grappling. We don't know what's gong to happen.\" \n Roberta Michnick Golinkoff, professor of education, psychology and linguistics at the University of Delaware, said parents should reassure young people that they are protected and model behavior that is calm and respectful. \n \"Kids are worried, especially kids of color and children whose families originate elsewhere. We need to tell them there is a place for them here, that they belong here and that no one going to kick them out,\" she said. \n The fear may be real for families with members who are undocumented immigrants, but parents shouldn't project fear because kids will feel it too. \"If we go around talking like the end is nigh, they'll pick up on that. Children will detect our concerns,\" she said. \n Anice Thomas, director of the campus counseling center at Rutgers-Newark, said the calls started coming in beginning at 7:30 a.m. on the day after the election. \n \"Some students were in shock, in tears,\" said Thomas. \"They were not sure how to make sense of it.\" \n For some in a generation that came of age in what they saw as a hopeful era of gay rights and racial inclusiveness, Trump's ascendancy felt like a harsh \u2014 and depressing, lesson. \n \"I spent the first 48 hours after the election crying and sleeping,\" said 18-year old Ahan Sikri, a student at the university, which has been anointed the most racially and ethnically diverse campus in the nation by Forbes. \n Indeed ethnic minorities said they felt targeted and fearful. \n \"I'm scared,\" said Zarinah Raheem. \"It's not easy for people who look like me: I'm a woman, I'm black and I'm a Muslim,\" said Raheem, who wears a traditional head covering. \n Thomas said it was important for people to talk about their feelings in community, and that's just what Sikri and Raheem did during a session Thursday afternoon that drew more than 100 students at the student center in Newark's Central Ward. \n At Ramapo College, in the leafy suburbs of Bergen County, President Peter Mercer encouraged students to stay true to American values. \n \"For those of you who may feel anxious, discouraged, or even dispassionate about the societal impact of this election cycle, I encourage you to reject the false comfort of isolation and instead to engage with your peers, colleagues, faculty, and staff in ways that promote mutual understanding and respect,\" Mercer wrote in an email to students. \"We all, always, have something to learn and something to share.\" \n Christopher Cannon, an African-American student from Hackensack, said students came together for nearly three hours at the black student union on Thursday to discuss their fears of \"stepping back into the 1960s.\" \n Ramapo, like other campuses around the country, has been working to address issues surrounding sexual aggression, and the election of a man caught on tape bragging about grabbing woman was jarring. \n \"Students are concerned, men and women alike,\" said Nicole Morgan Agard, equity and diversity officer at Ramapo. \n Stephen Brock, past president of the National Association of School Psychologists, said the impact of this election was so emotional because of the divisive language during campaigns and the 24-7 coverage of the election. \n He said it was disturbing for young people to hear candidates talk about people as terrorists or about mass deportations, especially when they don't fully understand what is happening. \n School psychologists need to remain politically neutral when dealing with students and listen to them, he said. \n \"We need to answer their questions with facts, to be calm and let them know we are willing to talk. Don't be perceived as judgmental or biased one way or another,\" said Brock, a professor and school psychology program coordinator at California State University in Sacramento. \n Parents, teachers and caregivers need to watch how they talk and act around children. \n \"For any event that is potentially frightening, young children in particular are going to be looking to adults to see how they're behaving.

American Muslims are reeling over Donald Trump's victory, wondering what the next four years will bring after a campaign in which he proposed creating a national database of Muslims, monitoring all mosques and banning some or all Muslims from entering the country. \n On the morning after the election, Alia Ali had a sickening feeling as she headed to her job as a secretary at a New York City public school, her hijab in place as usual. Ali is a Muslim who lives and works in one of the most diverse places in the U.S., and yet the ascension of Donald Trump to the White House left her wondering how other Americans really viewed her. \n \"Half of America voted one way and half of America voted the other, and you're like, 'Which half am I looking at?'\" she said. \"You become almost like strangers to the people you've worked with. Is this person racist? Do they like me? Do they not like me? Because that's what this election has done.\" \n American Muslims are reeling following the election of Trump, whose campaign was rife with anti-Muslim rhetoric and proposals that included banning Muslims from entering the country and heightened surveillance of mosques across the nation. Now, among many of the 3.3 million Muslims living in the U.S., there is significant fear, along with some reports of harassment; one hijab-wearing student at San Diego State University said she was briefly choked by suspects who made remarks about Trump's victory. \n \"There are lots and lots of people who aren't going out of the house,\" said Eboo Patel, a Muslim who heads the Interfaith Youth Core, a Chicago-based organization that works with colleges and government officials to build interreligious relationships. \n At New York University late last week, hundreds of people sat shoulder-to-shoulder on a grand staircase of a student center to express solidarity after the word \"Trump!\" was scrawled on the door of a Muslim prayer space at the school. Students spoke of friends who wore headscarves or other traditional clothing and were afraid to take public transportation home for fear of being harassed. \n Sana Mayat, a 21-year-old senior who wears the hijab, said the election made her realize \"there was a large part of this country that didn't want me here.\" \n \"There is an intense state of anxiety about the future,\" said Rami Nashashibi, a parent of three and executive director of Chicago's Inner-City Muslim Action Network, which has been inundated with calls seeking support since Election Day. \"I grappled with the conversation I had to have with my children.\" \n The outcome was especially bitter following an unprecedented voter registration drive by American Muslims, including get-out-the-vote sermons at mosques and the creation of a political action committee, Emerge USA, to mobilize Arabs and Muslims. \n Enas Almadhwahi, a 28-year-old Yemeni immigrant who has been in the U.S. since 2008, became a citizen this year and voted for the first time. To mark the occasion, she brought her 7-year-old daughter, along with some co-workers. \n \"At that moment, I was so happy,\" said Almadhwahi, who lives in Brooklyn, New York, and works at an Arab-American community organization. The next day, when she told her daughter Trump had won, the girl cried. A friend had told the little girl that if Trump won, it would mean they couldn't talk anymore. \n \"Everything feels like it's upside down,\" Almadhwahi said. \"I still like to hope Trump will change his words about Muslims.\" \n Trump's policy plans remain a mystery, but his administration could radically reshape the Justice Department, which has been an ally under President Barack Obama in protecting Muslim civil rights. Trump could also repeal a key Obama program that prevents the deportation of some immigrants, including Muslims, living in the country illegally. \n Muslims had far from a perfect relationship with the Obama administration. For years, the president kept the community largely at arms-length, sending surrogates to meet with them amid a stubborn misapprehension, fueled in part by his critics, that Obama, a Christian, was secretly Muslim. Many U.S. Muslim leaders were uncomfortable with his foreign policy in Iraq and elsewhere, and objected to his program to fight extremism at home, saying the focus on Muslims ignored other threats from right-wing, anti-government extremists. \n Still, Muslim leaders had built solid ties with many government officials. Now, they face not only the loss of those connections, but potentially a closed door to their concerns. \n \"The friends we have are going to be fewer,\" said Farhana Khera, president of the California-based civil rights group Muslim Advocates, which has represented clients suing over the New York Police Department's surveillance of American Muslims. \"I think we'll be very much in a defensive posture.\" \n Since the election, mosques and Muslim groups have organized community meetings and conference calls focused on how to move forward. The Indiana-based Islamic Society of North America, the largest communal Muslim group in the U.S., issued a statement inviting Trump to engage with the community, saying \"many American Muslims are traumatized by the result of the election and the fear of what is to come.\" The group said there was no immediate response from Trump's office. \n Sheik Omar Suleiman, resident scholar at the Valley Ranch Islamic Center in Irving, Texas, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an anti-defamation group, distributed suggested sermons for juma, or Friday prayers at mosques, stressing Quranic verses about remaining strong in the face of hardships. \n \"Have hope in the people because Allah may turn their hearts toward you,\" was among the verses they cited. \n Faisal R. Khan, founder of a youth advocacy and peace organization near Chapel Hill, North Carolina, attended four Trump campaign rallies over the last year, in part to protest but also to speak with the Republican's supporters. Khan lived years ago in the Midwest, where he knew people who had grown resentful over losing Rust Belt jobs, and said he understands what drew so many working-class whites to the president-elect. \n Khan has created a Facebook page called \"Talk To Me America,\" hoping to start a conversation that can combat anti-Muslim bias. \n \"Peaceful protest is good, but at a certain point, we have to sit down and talk,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, we're all human beings. We're all Americans.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's election leaves American Muslims reeling and scared"}

Russell, who sang, wrote and produced some of rock 'n' roll's top records, has died. \n NASHVILLE, Tenn. >> Leon Russell, who sang, wrote and produced some of rock 'n' roll's top records, has died. He was 74. \n An email from Leon Russell Records to The Associated Press says Russell died in Nashville on Saturday night. The email cites Russell's wife as the source of the information. Russell had heart bypass surgery in July and was recovering from that at the time of his death. He had been planning on resuming touring in January, the email said. \n Besides his music, Russell was known for his striking appearance: wispy white hair halfway down his back and that covered much of his face. \n He wrote Joe Cocker's \"Delta Lady\" and in 1969 put together Cocker's \"Mad Dogs and Englishmen\" tour, which spawned a documentary film and a hit double album. \n As a musician, primarily a pianist, he played on The Beach Boys' \"California Girls\" and Jan and Dean's \"Surf City.\" He also played guitar and bass. \n Russell produced and played on recording sessions for Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, Ike and Tina Turner, the Rolling Stones and many others. \n He recorded hit songs himself like \"Tight Rope\" and \"Lady Blue\" and participated in \"The Concert for Bangla Desh.\" John Lennon, Ringo Starr and George Harrison played on his first album, \"Leon Russell.\" \n His concerts often ended with a rousing version of \"Jumpin' Jack Flash.\" In 1973, Billboard Magazine listed Russell as the top concert attraction in the world. About this time, he was the headline act on billings that included Elton John and at other times Willie Nelson. \n In a 1992 interview with The Associated Press, Russell said music doesn't really change much. \n \"It's cyclical, like fashion. You keep your old clothes and they'll be in style again sooner or later. \n \"There are new things, like rap. But that's a rebirth of poetry. It's brought poetry to the public consciousness.\" \n In 2011, Russell was chosen for induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. He also was honored with an Award for Music Excellence from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. \n He and Elton John released \"The Union,\" a critically received duo album in 2010. \n Russell, born in Lawton, Oklahoma, began as a night club piano player in Oklahoma at the age of 14, also backing touring artists when they came to town. Jerry Lee Lewis was so impressed with Russell that he hired Russell and his band for two years of tours. \n He relocated to Los Angeles in 1959, where he became known as a top musician, and later to Nashville. \n In the early 2000s he began his own record label, Leon Russell Records. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Rocker Leon Russell dies in Nashville"}

{"date": "November 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Target shoppers Kelly Foley, left, Debbie Winslow, center, and Ann Rich use a smartphone to look at a competitor's prices while shopping shortly after midnight on Black Friday, in South Portland, Maine. \n It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of holiday shopping, but it's not always as easy to foot the bill. \n The National Retail Federation says consumers plan to spend an average of $935.58 during the holiday shopping season \u2013 the second highest level on record. Whether that is a little or a lot for you, we have some expert tips on how to find a comfortable spending level and stick to it this year: \n ASSESS \n Be honest with yourself about your financial situation before you begin. \n If you are already struggling to pay bills or carrying debt, you probably shouldn't take on more. \n Avoid extreme measures to pay for the holidays. A recent survey of more than 1,000 parents by T. Rowe Price found that while the bulk save for the holidays throughout the year, about a quarter have at some point pulled money from their retirement account, emergency fund or taken a payday loan to cover holiday spending. \n Not sure where you stand? The National Foundation for Credit Counseling has a website that can help you assess your financial well-being before you start to buy at www.MyHolidayCheckUp.org . \n TALK \n Start by saying \"no\" to some of the more costly holiday traditions that might bust the budget, said Bruce McClary of NFCC. It can be hard to challenge those expectations, but it will be even harder to dig yourself out of a financial hole. \n Parents have a particularly hard time when it comes to their kids, said Marty Allenbaugh, a financial planner at T. Rowe Price. He said that parents sometimes find it easier to get everything on a child's wish list rather than have a more challenging conversation about wants and needs. \n This is a big mistake as these talks can help them develop a better understanding about money. That doesn't mean you have to be a scrooge though. \"It's OK to splurge a little, but just don't go overboard at the expense of your own well-being,\" Allenbaugh said. \n BUDGET \n Set and stick to a holiday spending budget. \n The first part is easy: figure out how much you want to spend and keep track of your expenses as you go. The second part is harder: sticking to this once you are in the store or online and get excited about the deals. To combat this, Heather Battison of TransUnion suggests writing your budget and shopping list out and carrying it with you or putting it on your smartphone as a reminder. \n BE SAVVY \n Credit cards are one of the most popular ways to pay for holiday gifts and that's fine, unless you cannot pay it off immediately. Think twice before accepting the offer for a store card at checkout, as those often have very high interest rates. They also have low spending limits, which can increase your utilization rate \u2014 the amount of available credit that you use. And that can hurt your credit score. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ho, ho, hold up before you spend this season"}

{"date": "November 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Fissures run along a road by the Centre Port in Wellington, Monday, November 14, 2016, after a major earthquake struck New Zealand's south Island early Monday. A powerful earthquake struck in a mostly rural area close to the city of Christchurch but appeared to be more strongly felt in the capital, Wellington, more than 120 miles away. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People evacuated from buildings along Dixon Street check their mobile phones while sitting on a bench in Wellington after a 6.6 earthquake based around Cheviot in the South island shock the capital, New Zealand, Monday. \n Wellington, New Zealand \u00bb A powerful earthquake struck New Zealand's South Island early Monday, killing at least two people, causing damage to buildings and infrastructure, and prompting emergency services to warn people along the coast to move to higher ground to avoid tsunami waves. \n The magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck just after midnight in a mostly rural area that's dotted with small towns. Near the epicenter, it opened up snaking fissures in roads and triggered landslides. \n It caused damage in Wellington, the capital, more than 120 miles to the north and was also strongly felt in the city of Christchurch to the south. Residents said the shaking went on for about three minutes, and was followed by a number of strong aftershocks. \n Speaking about six hours after the quake struck, Prime Minister John Key said he was unable to give further information on the fatalities until authorities had confirmed all the details. He said officials had no reason to believe the death toll would rise. \n \"On the very best information we have at the moment, we think it's only likely to be two. But of course there are isolated parts of the country which we don't have perfect eyes on, so we can't be 100 percent sure,\" he said. \n Key said that crews would better be able to assess the damage during the day. He said officials had decided not to declare a national emergency because the nation's regions were able to adequately cope with the situation. \n He said waves of about 6.6 feet had hit the coast but the tsunami threat had since been downgraded to coastal warnings. \n The quake temporarily knocked out New Zealand's emergency call number, 111, police reported. In Wellington, it collapsed a ferry loading ramp, broke windows and caused items to fall from shelves. It also forced hundreds of tourists onto the streets as hotels were evacuated. \n Authorities in Wellington were urging people who work in the center of the city to stay home on Monday. City officials said that some large buildings were showing signs of structural stress, and the quake would likely have caused a mess in some buildings. The city's suburban rail network was shut while crews checked tracks, bridges and tunnels. \n The quake brought back memories of the magnitude-6.3 earthquake that struck Christchurch in 2011, destroying much of the downtown area and killing 185 people. That quake was one of New Zealand's worst disasters, causing an estimated $25 billion in damage. \n Although Monday's quake was stronger, its epicenter was much farther from any major urban areas. Location, depth and other factors beyond magnitude all contribute to the destructive power of an earthquake. \n New Zealand's Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management reported that a tsunami wave struck at about 1:50 a.m. and warned residents living in low-lying areas anywhere along the country's east coast to move to higher ground. \n The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said it did not expect the quake to generate a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami. \n Within New Zealand, there was confusion about the tsunami threat throughout the morning. \n The ministry initially said there was no threat but later wrote on Twitter \"situation has changed \u2013 tsunami is possible\" before reporting that a tsunami had hit. \n When the quake hit, Hannah Gin had just sat down in her living room to watch a replay of the national rugby team's weekend match against Italy when her house started shaking. Upstairs, her mother let out a scream. \n Gin, a 24-year-old lifelong Christchurch resident, is accustomed to quakes, so she said she sat calmly and waited, figuring the rumbling would stop in a few seconds. Instead, she said by telephone, the shaking just went on and on \u2014 for at least three minutes, according to the clock on her phone. \n The quake was far less violent than the one that struck Christchurch in 2011, Gin said, adding that there was no jarring up and down or side to side, just a long, rolling sensation. But it went on for much longer than the typical quakes that strike the area, she said. She was less concerned about running for cover than she was about vomiting from the motion sickness, she said with a chuckle. \n \"I could hear the sliding door sliding back and forth, and we've got washing hanging up and I could see the washing moving,\" Gin said. \"It just kept going and going.\" \n She said that her house, which was damaged in the 2011 quake, did not appear to have sustained any new damage from Monday's quake. She also said she had heard from many of her friends who live in the city, and all were safe. \n \"As far as I know, everyone's fine,\" she said. \"We're all just really shaken.\" \n In Wellington, 132 miles north of the quake's epicenter, power was knocked out in some places, and some windows were smashed and some chimneys collapsed. \n The quake was centered 57 miles northeast of Christchurch, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. \n The USGS initially estimated that the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.4 before revising it to 7.8. It said the quake struck at a depth of 14 miles, after initially putting the depth at 6 miles. Earthquakes tend to be more strongly felt on the surface when they are shallow. \n New Zealand, with a population of 4.7 million, sits on the \"Ring of Fire,\" an arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes are common. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Powerful earthquake strikes New Zealand, killing 2 people"}
