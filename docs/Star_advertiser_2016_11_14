{"date": "November 14, 2016", "text": "NEW ZEALAND HERALD VIA AP \n The walls of a historic church are damaged in Waiau after a earthquake in New Zealand on Monday. \n WELLINGTON, New Zealand >> New Zealand on Tuesday began a rescue operation involving hundreds of tourists and residents who remain stranded in the coastal town of Kaikoura after a powerful earthquake cut off train and vehicle access. \n The operation comes as several buildings in the capital, Wellington, were evacuated Tuesday and streets cordoned off after engineers determined a nine-story building was in danger of collapsing. \n The magnitude 7.8 quake that struck the South Island early Monday left two people dead and triggered a small tsunami. It also brought down rocks and mud that swept across highways and cracked apart roads. \n The defense force said it had started ferrying people out by military helicopter and that a navy ship from Auckland was due to arrive in the area Wednesday morning. \n Home to about 2,000 residents, Kaikoura is a popular destination for travelers taking part in whale-watching expeditions or wanting a stopover with mountain views. But the quake knocked out water supplies and sewer systems and left people with no easy way out. \n \"From all directions, Kaikoura has essentially been isolated,\" Air Commodore Darryn Webb, acting commander of New Zealand's Joint Forces, told The Associated Press. \"There's a real imperative to support the town because it can't support itself.\" \n Webb said the military was using four NH90 helicopters that could each transport about 18 people at a time out of the town. He said the ship could pick up hundreds of people if weather conditions allowed. \n \"We're going to get as many people and belongings out as quickly as we can,\" Webb said. \n He said the operation could take several days and that if needed, a C-130 military transport plane could drop fuel, water, food and other supplies to the town. He said about five metric tons of supplies were ready to be delivered from Christchurch. \n Sarah Stuart-Black, director of the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, said the priority was transporting out those people with health issues or international flights booked. She said 34 people had been airlifted out by noon Tuesday. \n She said the community was rallying to help the tourists. \n \"It's fantastic that some of the locals in Kaikoura have taken in tourists into their own homes,\" she said. \n In Wellington, Brendan Nally, the regional commander for the New Zealand Fire Service, said engineers were completing an inspection of the nine-story downtown office building when they found that a major vertical beam had failed above the fifth floor. \n \"It looks somewhat like a broken bone in the leg. It's fractured through,\" Nally said. \"So the building is at significant risk of collapse.\" \n Nally said the building was empty when the quake struck because it was being renovated. \n He said the buildings evacuated included the Thai Embassy, the headquarters for New Zealand Rugby, the Anglican cathedral and the national headquarters for the Red Cross. \n Elsewhere in the capital, many returned to work after the quake shut down much of the central city on Monday. But some buildings remained closed and heavy rain and flooding compounded the difficulties for others. \n And strong aftershocks continued to shake New Zealand, rattling the nerves of exhausted residents. \n Police said one person died in Kaikoura and another in Mt. Lyford, a nearby ski resort. Several other people suffered minor injuries in Kaikoura, police spokeswoman Rachel Purdom said. \n Prime Minister John Key flew over Kaikoura by helicopter Monday as aftershocks kicked up dust from the landslides below. Cars could be seen lying on their sides and parts of the road were clearly impassable. \n \"It's just utter devastation,\" Key said. \n Three cows whose predicament captured the interest of people around the world after they became stranded on a small island of grass in an area ripped apart by the quake were rescued. The Newshub news service reported a farmer and some helpers dug a track to them and brought them out. \n New Zealand, with a population of 4.7 million, sits on the \"Ring of Fire,\" an arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes are common.

The official wasn't authorized to speak on the record and requested anonymity. \n While speaking at a Wall Street Journal CEO Council event Monday night in Washington, the former mayor and federal prosecutor said he wouldn't be attorney general in a Trump administration. He had been considered a leading prospect for that job even before Trump's victory last Tuesday. \n The position of secretary of state arose during the event, but Giuliani appeared to be coy about his own prospects. He said John Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations, would be a very good choice. Asked if there was anyone better, he replied: \"Maybe me, I don't know.\" \n As he formed his administration, Trump was considering whether to inject new diversity into the GOP by recommending a woman to lead the Republican Party and an openly gay man to represent the United States at the United Nations. \n The moves, among dozens under consideration from his transition team, follow an intense and extended backlash from Trump's decision on Sunday to appoint Steve Bannon, a man celebrated by the white nationalist movement, to serve as his chief strategist and senior adviser. \n \"After winning the presidency but losing the popular vote, President-elect Trump must try to bring Americans together \u2014 not continue to fan the flames of division and bigotry,\" said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. She called Bannon's appointment \"an alarming signal\" that Trump \"remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign.\" \n His inauguration just 66 days away, however, Trump focused on building his team and speaking to foreign leaders. He remained sequestered in Trump Tower in New York. \n Inexperienced on the international stage, the Republican president-elect spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone. His transition office said in a readout that \"he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.\" Trump has spoken in recent days with the leaders of China, Mexico, South Korea and Canada. \n At the same time, Trump was considering tapping Richard Grenell as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He would be the first openly gay person to fill a Cabinet-level foreign policy post. Grenell, known in part for aggressive criticism of rivals on Twitter, previously served as U.S. spokesman at the U.N. under President George W. Bush. \n Trump was also weighing whether to select Michigan GOP chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, a niece of chief Trump critic and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney. She would be the second woman ever to lead the Republican National Committee \u2014 and the first in four decades. \n \"I'll be interested in whatever Mr. Trump wants,\" McDaniel told The Associated Press on Monday, adding that she was planning to seek the Michigan GOP chairmanship again. \n Appointing McDaniel to run the GOP's political arm could be an effort to help the party heal the anger after a campaign in which Trump demeaned women. The appointment of Grenell, who has openly supported same-sex marriage, could begin to ease concerns by the gay community about Vice President-elect Mike Pence's opposition to same-sex marriage during his time as Indiana governor. \n The personnel moves under consideration were confirmed by people with direct knowledge of Trump's thinking who were not authorized to publicly disclose private discussions. They stressed that the decisions were not final. \n Internal deliberations about staffing come a day after Trump made overtures to warring Republican circles by appointing Bannon and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus as his White House chief of staff. \n The former media executive, who led a website that appealed to the so-called \"alt-right\" \u2014 a movement often associated with efforts on the far right to preserve \"white identity,\" oppose multiculturalism and defend \"Western values.\" \n Priebus on Monday defended the media mogul, saying the two made an effective pair as they steered Trump past Democrat Hillary Clinton and toward the presidency. He sought to distance Bannon from the incendiary headlines on his website, saying they were written by unspecified others. \n \"Together, we've been able to manage a lot of the decision making in regard to the campaign,\" Priebus told NBC's \"Today.\" \"It's worked very, very well.\" \n President Barack Obama avoided any direct criticism of Trump's personnel moves during an afternoon news conference, suggesting that the new president deserves \"room to staff up.\" \n \"It's important for us to let him make his decisions,\" Obama said. \"The American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see.\" \n The outgoing president encouraged Trump, however, to embrace a unifying tone. \n \"It's really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign,\" Obama said. \"And I think that's something he will \u2014 he will want to do.\" \n Trump's hires were, at first glance, contradictory, though they fit a pattern of the celebrity businessman creating a veritable Rorschach test that allowed his supporters to see what they wanted. Priebus, who lashed the RNC to Trump this summer despite some intraparty objections, is a GOP operative with deep expertise of the Washington establishment that Trump has vowed to shake up. He has close ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Wisconsinite. \n Bannon, meanwhile, helped transform the Breitbart News site into the leading mouthpiece of the party's anti-establishment wing, which helped fuel the businessman's political rise. Ryan has been one of his most frequent targets. \n Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League, called Bannon's selection \"a sad day.\" \n Bannon, Greenblatt said, \"presided over the rise of Breitbart as a haven online\" for the \"alt-right.\" The website under Bannon's leadership \"trafficked in the some of the worst tropes, not just only against Jews \u2014 but the anti-Semitism is real \u2014 but also against other minorities, particularly Mexicans and Muslims.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Giuliani the favorite to be secretary of state"}

He also said he plans to deport millions of criminals who are living in the country illegally. \n \"We will always be San Francisco,\" said Lee from the Rotunda of City Hall as dozens of people roared with approval at an event that featured the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus and a host of public elected officials. \n \"I know that there are a lot of people who are angry and frustrated and fearful, but our city's never been about that. We have been, and always have been, a city of refuge, a city of sanctuary, a city of love.\" \n San Francisco receives roughly $480 million directly from the federal government and more than $900 million from the state, much of it pass-through federal money, city Controller Ben Rosenfield said. \n The largest share goes toward health care, but federal dollars also fund public assistance and infrastructure, he said. The city's budget is $9.6 billion. \n It's uncertain how the city would recoup that money should Trump make good on his promise to cut off sanctuary cities. \n Also reacting to Trump's statements on deportations, Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck said his officers will stay out of immigration issues as they have for decades. \"I don't intend on doing anything different,\" Beck told the Los Angeles Times on Monday. \n \"We are not going to engage in law enforcement activities solely based on somebody's immigration status. We are not going to work in conjunction with Homeland Security on deportation efforts. That is not our job, nor will I make it our job,\" Beck said. \n Trump excoriated San Francisco last year when 32-year-old Kate Steinle was shot and killed by a Mexican native who said he had found a gun and it accidentally fired. \n Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez had a federal detainer on him, but he was released from San Francisco's jail after the district attorney declined to prosecute a decades-old marijuana sales charge. The sheriff at the time freed Lopez-Sanchez in keeping with city laws not to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. \n San Francisco's sanctuary policy, which was tweaked and re-affirmed earlier this year, bars city employees from cooperating with federal immigration officials in deportation efforts except in rare situations. The law dates to 1989. \n The current sheriff, Vicki Hennessy, also supports sanctuary policy as a public safety tool. Sanctuary advocates say people who live in the country illegally are more likely to report crimes to local police if they know they won't be deported. \n She said Monday that she's concerned but taking a wait-and-see approach to a Trump presidency \n \"I'm following Hillary Clinton's advice in her concession speech, which was to give the new president a chance to lead, and hopefully he'll lead with compassion and understanding, as well as making sure our cities are safe for everybody,\" Hennessy said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Defiant San Francisco vows to remain sanctuary city"}

Moses-EL was released from prison last year after spending more than a quarter of a century in prison for a rape he long denied committing, was acquitted of the crime on Monday. \n DENVER >> A Denver man who spent more than a quarter of a century in prison for a rape he long denied committing was acquitted of the crime on Monday, leaving a courtroom to applause from supporters and chants of \"it's over.\" \n Clarence Moses-EL, 60, was freed in December, after a judge overturned his 1988 conviction on rape and assault charges and found that he would likely be acquitted if his case went to trial again. \n Another prisoner claimed to be responsible for the attack, but prosecutors chose to try Moses-EL again. Jurors began deliberating the case last Thursday, and they issued their not guilty verdict Monday \u2014 leaving Moses-EL beaming and fighting back tears. \n Outside court, Moses-EL said he holds no grudges and hoped his case will help improve the criminal justice system. Right now, he said, he wants to enjoy his freedom. \n \"You don't know how much freedom really means until you have it taken away from you,\" he said, \"And especially if it's taken away from you for something you didn't do.\" \n Moses-EL had long maintained his innocence. Several of his efforts to appeal his conviction were unsuccessful, and the legal and political systems repeatedly failed him in his decades-long attempt to win his freedom. \n \"All I ever wanted from the very beginning was for the truth to come out,\" he told reporters, surrounded by his wife and children. \"This moment here is the moment I've fought for for a long time.\" \n The victim in the case, a neighbor, initially named three other men as possible attackers, including the inmate, L.C. Jackson, who confessed in 2013. But she accused Moses-EL, saying his face appeared to her in a dream, and a jury convicted him largely based on her testimony. \n He won a legal bid for DNA testing on the evidence to clear his name, but Denver police threw it away a month later, saying they did not receive any notice from prosecutors to hold on to it. \n In 2008, then-Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, a former Denver prosecutor, objected to legislation that would have given Moses-EL a new trial, even though lawmakers strongly supported it. \n Moses-EL's break came when Jackson wrote to Moses-EL in 2013 saying he had sex with the woman that night. Jackson, who is imprisoned for two other rapes, has not been charged in this case, and prosecutors said Monday he is not a suspect. \n Prosecutors challenged the credibility of Jackson's confession and stood by the victim. \n \"She is very disappointed\" with the verdict, Chief Deputy District Attorney Bonnie Benedetti said. \"She has maintained for years that she saw and recognized the person who attacked her, and she stands by that.\" \n Prosecutors chose to pursue the second trial because the victim wanted to proceed with the case, Benedetti said. \n Despite being free for nearly a year, Moses-EL said he is still struggling to break habits he formed in prison. He can't bring himself to walk barefoot inside his home, for example, something he never did while behind bars. \n \"I had become psychologically programmed to exist inside the system itself,\" he said. \"I have to deprogram myself and reprogram myself.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Denver man freed after 28 years in prison acquitted of rape"}

Hundreds of high school students joined protests in Portland on Monday against Donald Trumps election. \n PORTLAND, Ore. >> Facing a huge backlog of cases, prosecutors in Portland on Monday dropped more serious charges against the more than 100 protesters who have been arrested in the city since Donald Trump was elected president. \n The protests continued on Monday as hundreds of high school students took to the streets, chanting slogans like \"Peaceful Protest\" and \"No Trump, No KKK\" as they marched across the city in the rain. \n Almost a week of anti-Trump protests in Portland have ranged from peaceful to violent, when vandals smashed windows of businesses and cars and caused other mayhem. Portland Mayor Charlie Hales on Monday accused them of \"criminal behavior.\" \n Police and prosecutors focused on the vandals, putting photos of them online and asking the public to help identify them or to contribute their own photos or video of them in the act of damaging property. \n But nearly all of the more than 100 people who were arrested on charges such as attempted assault on a peace officer and disorderly conduct will instead receive traffic citations for failing to obey a police officer, according to a joint statement from Portland police and the Multnomah County District Attorney's office. That offense is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000. \n The statement said the \"sheer number of arrests during protests over the last several days has been an exceptional event.\" \n The decision came as a surprise to some of those charged and their supporters who packed a courtroom in downtown Portland. They reacted with smiles and subdued calls of \"yes!\" when a woman from the DA's office made the announcement about the more serious charges. \n Earlier in the day, students walked out of at least four high schools and began an anti-Trump march through Portland, stopping first at city hall. Police did not interfere, but tweeted: \"Parents encouraged to tell their kids to go back to school.\" \n Greg McKelvey, a protest organizer in Portland and head of an anti-Trump group called Portland's Resistance, said local protesters are trying to coordinate with counterparts in New York, Washington, Austin, Texas, Oakland, California, Boston and several other cities. \n \"We're going to go national, where we're all organizing together,\" he said in a telephone interview. \n \"Trump is going to be president, so we need to prepare for that,\" McKelvey said. \"Our group thinks the time to stop Donald Trump from becoming president was last Tuesday.\" \n He said Portland's Resistance aims to make sure city and state governments are working on issues such as limiting climate change, advocating for single-parent health care and addressing racial disparities. \n An online fundraising campaign to raise money for small businesses that were vandalized in the protests has received over $54,000. McKelvey, whose group renounces violence, is helping push for the funds. \n Hales told Oregon Public Broadcasting that demonstrations can be peaceful, he but believes those in Portland are being used as cover for \"outrageous, bad, criminal behavior.\" \n Police, meanwhile, announced that an 18-year-old who had been arrested in the shooting and wounding of an anti-Trump protester early Saturday was being released, after further investigation determined he was not the suspect. \n They instead arrested a 14-year-old boy and placed him in a juvenile detention home on charges of attempted murder and unlawful use of a weapon.

Dassey, whose homicide conviction was overturned in a case profiled in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" was ordered released Monday, Nov. 14, 2016, from federal prison while prosecutors appeal. Dassey's supervised release was not immediate and is contingent upon him meeting multiple conditions. \n MADISON, Wis. >> A man whose homicide conviction was overturned in a case profiled in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" could be celebrating Thanksgiving at home with his family in Wisconsin after a judge Monday ordered him released from prison. \n Brendan Dassey's release was ordered by U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin even as prosecutors appeal the judge's earlier ruling overturning Dassey's conviction. It's not clear how quickly Dassey will be released. He faces a Tuesday deadline to provide information on where he will live and federal probation officers must also inspect the site before he is released. Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel promised to file an emergency motion in the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to keep Dassey behind bars. \n Duffin ruled in August that investigators tricked Dassey into confessing he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape, kill and mutilate photographer Teresa Halbach at the Avery family salvage yard in Manitowoc County in 2005. Investigators allege Avery lured her there by asking her to take photos of a minivan. \n The state has appealed that ruling and argued Dassey should remain in prison while it was pending. \n Dassey was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault and mutilating a corpse. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2007. Court documents describe Dassey as a slow learner who had poor grades and has difficulty understanding language and speaking. \n In his August ruling, Duffin said investigators made specific promises of leniency to Dassey and that no \"fair-minded jurists could disagree.\" Schimel, in his appeal, said investigators didn't promise leniency and they specifically told Dassey that no promises could be made. \n Attorneys are in the process of filing legal briefs in the appeal, which is expected to be argued sometime next year. \n State prosecutors argued that in the meantime, Dassey should remain in prison because he's a serious threat to public safety. But Duffin in ordering Dassey set free cited his \"exceedingly benign\" prison disciplinary record and the fact that he had no convictions before the Halbach case. \n Dassey, now 27, was 16 when Halbach was killed. \n The judge ordered Dassey released as soon as the federal probation office approved where he was going to live and \"completed whatever additional investigation it deems necessary.\" Dassey's attorney, Steve Drizin, said he didn't know how long that would take but he hoped Dassey would be free by Thanksgiving, which was just 10 days away. \n \"That's what I'm focused on right now, getting him home, getting him with his family and then helping him to re-integrate back into society while his appeal plays out,\" Drizin said. \n Dassey had until noon Tuesday to provide the federal probation and parole office with the address of where he plans to live. Drizin would not say exactly where Dassey would be living. \n Given that his family lives in northeast Wisconsin, there is little chance Dassey will try to flee, the judge said. Under the judge's order, Dassey would be forbidden from having contact with Avery or Halbach's family. \n Dassey's attorneys filed a motion seeking his release in September after Duffin overturned his conviction. That filing said Dassey had developed a plan with a social worker that calls for him to live initially with his mother in a family-owned trailer in rural northeastern Wisconsin about 100 miles from Manitowoc, arguing that would minimize the disruption for the community, Dassey and the Halbach family. \n The plan calls for Dassey to later relocate to an apartment in Brown County that his mother and stepfather would rent for him. He would then start participating in educational and job training. \n Mike Halbach, Teresa's brother, and Barb Janda, Dassey's mother, did not return calls for comment. \n Dassey would have to meet numerous other conditions, including reporting to a probation officer, not owning a gun or other weapon, being available for home visits and getting approval before moving. Any travel outside of eastern Wisconsin would have to be approved by the court and Dassey could not get a passport. \n Avery was convicted in a separate trial and was also sentenced to life in prison. He's pursuing his own appeal. \n Their cases gained national attention after Netflix aired \"Making a Murderer\" last year. The series spawned widespread conjecture about the pair's innocence. Authorities who worked on the cases said the series was biased, but it generated calls from the public to free both men. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Nephew in 'Making a Murderer' ordered released"}

But whether marches will become a movement is an open question. \n At this early stage, the protesters who have taken to the streets to brand Trump a bigot and a sexist and chant \"Not my president!\" appear to be mostly venting their frustrations and do not seem to have coalesced behind overall leaders or a common set of demands. \n Columbia University professor Todd Gitlin, who as an early leader of Students for a Democratic Society helped organize an anti-Vietnam War demonstration that brought thousands to Washington in 1965, said the anti-Trump protests by themselves \"are not the makings of a movement.\" \n \"A movement requires that clusters of people take responsibility for creating vehicles that can carry through, focus energy, develop priorities, strategize, recruit, figure out how to govern themselves,\" Gitlin said. \n For that to happen, a critical mass of protesters has to \"transform their mindset from protest into successful politics, which is much less exciting,\" he said. Gitlin said that means \"dirtying our hands in winning local and state battles which are instrumental to changing the national balance.\" \n On Monday, hundreds of students decrying Trump's election walked out of schools in Denver, Los Angeles and Silver Spring, Maryland, after a weekend in which thousands of people demonstrated around the country and scores were arrested. Protesters threw rocks at police in Indianapolis and hurled bottles and other objects in Portland, Oregon. Marchers have also converged on Trump Tower in New York, the president-elect's transition headquarters. \n Among other things, the demonstrators have condemned Trump's behavior toward women and his stand on immigration and civil liberties. \n Ralph Young, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia who teaches a course on dissent in America and has written two books on the topic, said it is too early to predict what the marches might become. \n Once Trump becomes president and starts making policy decisions, that could crystalize opposition and focus people's attention on certain issues, he said. If the anti-Trump demonstrations are going to become a movement, they also need leaders who can articulate their grievances, he said. \n That's one thing the Occupy Wall Street movement against economic inequality never really achieved \u2014 a proper organization, Young said. \n Jamie Henn of the group 350, which organizes protests to fight climate change, said liberal activist groups are still scrambling to figure out how they will push back against a Trump presidency. \n \"There is definitely stuff coming together and being planned that looks like the messy process of everyone and their mother throwing up something on their Facebook page,\" Henn said. \n Henn said liberals haven't seen the need for this level of mobilization since the run-up to the Iraq War. But activists remember glumly how little a dent their big marches against the invasion made then, and may use different tactics this time. \n Some groups are already trying to come together, though there are differences of opinion, said Greg McKelvey, a protest organizer in Portland, Oregon. McKelvey said demonstrators are trying to organize with counterparts in New York; Washington; Austin, Texas; Oakland, California; Boston; and a few other cities. \n Some activists want to prevent Trump somehow from becoming president, while others feel that's inevitable and instead want to insulate their communities from his policies, McKelvey said. He said his group, Portland's Resistance, aims to make sure city and state governments are working on issues such as limiting climate change, pushing for better health care and dealing with racial disparities in policing. \n Trump's election has made activists out of people who haven't been part of any organized demonstrations before. \n Olivia Antezana, a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Maryland at College Park, had never been to a demonstration before creating and promoting a \"Not My President\" event on Facebook. By Monday afternoon, 18,000 people had indicated on Facebook that they would be going to the event in Washington on Inauguration Day. \n \"I will say I certainly underestimated it,\" Antezana said. \n Still, Antezana said she is not sure what she will do after the demonstration she is planning is over. She doesn't plan to join a political campaign, she said, though she would like to keep up with activism. Right now, she said, she has another priority: school. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Jessica Gresko on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jessicagresko. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "The next stage: Will anti-Trump marches become a movement?"}

{"date": "November 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n During 2016, the University of Massachusetts Amherst made its first recruiting trip to Mexico and bolstered its work in Singapore and South Korea. Many U.S. colleges are trying to attract students from the Middle East, South Asia and Latin America amid fears that fewer students are coming from China. \n BOSTON >> As a surge of students from China begins to level off, many U.S. colleges are expanding recruiting efforts in the Middle East, South Asia and Latin America in part to boost budgets that have come to rely on tuition dollars from international students. \n The number of Chinese students at U.S. colleges rose from 62,000 a decade ago to 328,000 last year, and they still make up 31 percent of all international students in the U.S., but growth is slowing. On Monday, the Institute of International Education released federal data showing that the number of Chinese students at U.S. colleges grew by 8 percent last year, the smallest uptick since 2005. \n Some schools are bracing for a decline, citing China's sluggish economy and sharper competition from colleges in Australia and other countries. \n \"For a variety of factors, we're seeing a slowdown in Chinese enrollment,\" said Todd Maurer, a California analyst who advises schools and education companies on trends in Asia. \"I think we're seeing the last years of double-digit growth.\" \n Colleges seek international students partly to boost diversity, but they also bring a financial perk. Most schools don't offer scholarships for international students, and charge them full tuition costs. Losing foreign students could hurt college budgets, especially at a time when some public universities are struggling with long-term drops in state funding. \n Stephen Dunnett, vice provost for international education at the University at Buffalo, said many colleges worry they depend too heavily on revenue from Chinese students. \n \"They would be severely hurt if there was a contraction,\" he said. \"There's no Plan B. There's no other country that would send students in those numbers.\" \n Buffalo is among many universities that have expanded global recruiting efforts in part to hedge against a possible decline from China. Along with continued work in China, Dunnett's office has turned its attention to growing countries such as Vietnam and Burma. Next year, the college plans to recruit in Iran for the first time. \n This year, the University of Massachusetts Amherst made its first recruiting trip to Mexico and also bolstered its work in Singapore and Vietnam. Instead of sending recruiters to China this year, Bucknell University in Pennsylvania focused on India and sent admissions officials to South America for the first time in about a decade. \n Other schools are exploring whether there could be a boom from sub-Saharan Africa. Nations such as Uganda, Ethiopia and Angola have growing youth populations and middle classes, two of the factors that U.S. colleges look for, but some say the region's governments don't offer enough funding to help students study abroad. \n Rising tuition at U.S. colleges, meanwhile, has raised the barrier for many African families, said Kelechi Kalu, vice president of international affairs at the University of California-Riverside. \n \"When I was in the continent earlier in the summer, some of the parents and students were telling me they can spend less to go to Australia or the UK,\" he said. \n Australia in particular has rapidly grown as a destination for foreign students, attracting 240,000 students to its colleges last year, a yearly uptick of 6 percent, according to national data. But experts say that U.S. colleges, which attracted 1 million international students last year, still have space to host far more students than other nations. \n \"We still have a lot of capacity,\" said Peggy Blumenthal, senior counselor to the president at the nonprofit Institute of International Education. \"Chinese students are going to keep finding America the best place in the world to study.\" \n Other countries where U.S. schools see recruiting promise include Cuba, Nigeria and India, which sent 165,000 students to the United States last year, a 25 percent jump in a year. According to the new data from Blumenthal's group, students from Nepal and Vietnam are also among the fastest-growing groups coming to the U.S. \n Although colleges are expanding their reach, they don't expect any single country to deliver as many students as China. Last year, Chinese students in the U.S. outnumbered their peers from the top four following countries combined. Instead, colleges say they aim to diversify their global enrollment to shield it from national swings. \n And even though some schools are scaling back their recruiting in China, many say it will remain a centerpiece of their recruiting plans for years to come. \n \"We've made some real progress over the last five years,\" said James Roche, associate provost for enrollment management at UMass Amherst. \"It would be just short of ridiculous to stop doing that kind of work.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Beyond China: U.S. colleges look afield for foreign students"}

{"date": "November 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent passes birdwatcher Nancy Hill, 81, along a section of the border wall Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016, in Hidago, Texas. President-elect Donald Trump is starting to sound a lot more like President Barack Obama on his stance on immigration and easing his pledge to build a wall across the Mexican border. \n WASHINGTON >> President-elect Donald Trump is starting to sound an awful lot like President Barack Obama on immigration. \n In his first postelection interview, Trump said he will focus on deporting criminal immigrants and not everyone living in the United States illegally. Two million or 3 million people could be immediate targets for deportation under this approach, Trump said, providing a likely inflated figure. \n And that \"big, beautiful wall\" at the Mexican border? Trump said he may be amenable to a fence along some parts of the roughly 2,000-mile border. \n The softened stance contrasts sharply with Trump's campaign rhetoric. As a candidate, he called for everyone living in the country illegally to return to their home countries and for Mexico to pay billions of dollars for the wall. \n A look at Trump's shifting immigration stance: \n FOCUS ON CRIMINALS \n Trump said in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" broadcast Sunday that immigration enforcement will concentrate on criminals. \n \"What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,\" he said. \"We have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million; we are getting them out of our country or we're going to incarcerate.\" \n Trump added: \"We're getting them out of our country; they're here illegally.\" \n Obama's Homeland Security Department has operated similarly. Since 2010, criminals comprised more than half of those deported from the U.S. Over his presidency, Obama has overseen the deportation of more than 2.5 million people. \n Trump didn't say Sunday how he will target criminals. He previously has spoken about reviving programs that gave immigration agents access to jails so they could identify people living in the country illegally. \n But if Trump does so, local jurisdictions likely will object. Local laws in some places bar cooperation with immigration authorities. And some federal court rulings make it difficult for local jails to hold immigrants beyond their criminal sentences or strictly for immigration violations. \n It is even harder to deport criminal immigrants who aren't incarcerated. Many live in the shadows. Tracking them down would take a lot of time and government money. \n Deportation costs average about $12,500 per person, according to a 2011 government estimate. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n 2 MILLION OR 3 MILLION CRIMINAL IMMIGRANTS \n Trump's estimate of criminals who are in the country illegally is probably much too high. \n In 2012, Homeland Security officials estimated some 1.9 million criminal immigrants in the United States who could be deported. But the government didn't break down how many of those people were in the country legally and how many were here illegally. \n A subsequent analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, concluded that only about 820,000 of those people were in the country illegally. The other million or so people had some sort of legal status, including green cards or visas. \n Deporting green card holders is possible, though the process can involve lengthy court proceedings. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n FENCE vs. WALL \n \"I will build a great, great wall on our southern border,\" Trump said as he launched his presidential campaign in June 2015. \"And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.\" \n He repeated the pledge at almost every rally. \n But in his weekend interview, Trump took a more nuanced approach. \n In certain areas, Trump said, \"it could be some fencing.\" Elsewhere, he added, the border wall was still appropriate. \n The president-elect didn't outline where a fence or a wall might fit better. But his willingness to consider fencing marked a considerable concession from his campaign stance. \n Border fencing is nothing new. There is fencing along about 650 miles in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, encompassing almost a third of the border. \n Under President George W. Bush, Congress authorized $1.2 billion to build hundreds of miles of double-layered fencing. The Congressional Research Service and the Army Corps of Engineers have estimated that the fencing already in place cost the United States about $7 billion. \n Any new construction along the border would be a costly and complicated endeavor. Cost estimates of a wall have ranged from $10 billion to $20 billion. \n Trump would also face myriad environmental regulations, objections from private land owners and a legally binding 1970 treaty with Mexico that governs structures along the Rio Grande and Colorado River at the Mexican border. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump starting to sound like Obama on immigration"}

Joe Biden, D-Del., left, shake hands at the end of his vice presidential debate with Republican rival, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin in St. Louis, Mo. Ifill died on Monday, Nov. 14, 2016, of cancer, PBS said. She was 61. \n NEW YORK >> Gwen Ifill, co-anchor of PBS' \"NewsHour\" with Judy Woodruff and a veteran journalist who moderated two vice presidential debates, died Monday of cancer, the network said. \n She was 61. \n A former reporter for The New York Times and The Washington Post, Ifill switched to television in the 1990s and covered politics and Congress for NBC News. She moved to PBS in 1999 as host of \"Washington Week\" and also worked for the nightly \"NewsHour\" program. She and Woodruff were named co-anchors in 2013. \n She moderated vice presidential debates in 2004 and 2008 and authored the book, \"The Breakthrough: Politics and Race in the Age of Obama.\" \n The president on Monday praised Ifill for informing today's citizens while also inspiring a young generation of journalists. \n \"I always appreciated Gwen's reporting, even when I was on the receiving end of one of her tough\" interviews, Obama said. \n Ifill took a leave from \"NewsHour\" for a month this spring for health reasons, keeping details of her illness private. Her health failing, she left \"NewsHour\" again shortly before an election night that she and Woodruff would have covered together. \n \"Gwen was a standard bearer for courage, fairness and integrity in an industry going through seismic change,\" said Sara Just, PBS \"NewsHour\" executive producer. \"She was a mentor to so many across the industry and her professionalism was respected across the political spectrum. She was a journalist's journalist and set an example for all around her.\" \n NBC News' Pete Williams, a former colleague, struggled to keep his composure Monday when announcing Ifill's death on MSNBC. \n \"She had so many awards in her office you could barely see out the window,\" Williams said. \n U.S. Rep.

Al Sharpton yesterday he realizes that, this time, he went way too far,\" Ifill wrote. \n \"Yes, he did.

Now Obama must use his last major trip abroad to try to calm shocked world leaders about the outcome of the U.S. election, and what comes next when Donald Trump is president. \n WASHINGTON >> It was supposed to be his grand valedictory tour. Now President Barack Obama must use his last major trip abroad to try to calm shocked world leaders about the outcome of the U.S. election, and what comes next when Donald Trump is president. \n Trump's unforeseen victory has triggered pangs of uncertainty at home and grave concerns around the world. Though Obama has urged unity and said the U.S. must root for Trump's success, the president's trip to Greece, Germany and Peru forces him to confront global concerns about the future of America's leadership. \n Obama departs Monday on the weeklong trip. Before leaving, Obama planned to face reporters at an afternoon White House news conference certain to be dominated by questions about the election and its consequences for U.S. policy and Obama's own legacy. \n Obama's trip, planned when it seemed certain Hillary Clinton would win, had been designed to reassure the world that the U.S. had regained its footing after a toxic campaign that unnerved foreign capitals, noted Heather Conley, a Europe scholar at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. \n \"Now the president has the unenviable task of telling his counterparts and explaining what Europeans are now coining 'the Trump effect,'\" Conley said. \n For months, Obama lent credence to those concerns as he urged Americans to reject Trump. Standing alongside Singapore's prime minister in August, Obama said Trump was \"woefully unprepared\" because he lacked \"basic knowledge\" about critical issues in Europe, Asia and the Mideast. And during a visit to Japan, Obama said he wasn't the only world leader worried about Trump. \n \"They're rattled by him, and for good reason,\" Obama said in May. \"Because a lot of the proposals that he's made display either ignorance of world affairs, or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous, and what's required to keep the world on an even keel.\" \n Now, Obama must reassure the U.S. and other countries that somehow, it will all be OK. \n Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said the president fully expects Trump's election to be a dominant theme of the trip, but would emphasize his plans to keep carrying out his approach until Trump takes over. He said Obama would argue that basic U.S. principles like honoring treaty commitments have historically survived even the most dramatic changes of administrations. \n \"He'll want to use these conversations with leaders to express that view that given all the important issues that we face, no matter what our preferred choice may have been in the election, right now we as Americans have a stake in seeing this next administration succeed,\" Rhodes said. \n On his trip, Obama is stopping first in Athens, where he'll tour the Parthenon, meet with the prime minister, and give a speech about democracy and globalization that will take on new relevance in light of Trump's election. He'll use his visit to Berlin to show gratitude to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, his closest foreign partner, and to meet with key European leaders. \n In Peru, he'll attend a major Asian economic summit in Lima, and also meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Australian Prime Minster Malcolm Turnbull. \n For the most part, foreign leaders have politely if cautiously congratulated Trump on his victory. A few have been more effusive, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose perceived sympathies for Trump became an election issue and who now says he wants to fully restore U.S. relations under President Trump. \n In Europe, where Obama has sought unity with allies to counter Russia's growing influence, NATO members are alarmed by Trump's suggestions that the U.S. might pull out of the alliance if other countries don't pay more. Many of the same nations are wrestling with whether last year's historic climate change deal can be salvaged after Trump's threats to pull the U.S. out. \n Conversely, Trump's \"America first\" motto has resonated deeply with nationalists and skeptics of globalization who see Trump as a kindred spirit. Trump had dubbed himself \"Mr. Brexit\" after the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. \n America's Mideast allies are unsure what Trump's victory means for the nuclear deal with Iran, a foe of U.S. partners Saudi Arabia and Israel, considering Trump's repeated but vague pledges to renegotiate that deal. And misgivings about Trump will certainly follow Obama to Latin America, where Trump has turned off many with his hard-line immigration stance and description of Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. \n Asian leaders who painstakingly negotiated a landmark free trade deal with the U.S. are swallowing the reality that Congress will not approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership any time soon. Obama planned to meet with TPP country leaders in Peru, but the White House acknowledged the deal is all but dead because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has ruled out a vote on it before Trump takes office. \n Trump is vehemently opposed to TPP and similar deals. That could benefit China, which is eager to fill any void in regional leadership left by a U.S. withdrawal and has its own competing free trade scheme. Yet Beijing has reason to be wary, too: Trump has threatened a trade war with China and vowed to go after the Asian powerhouse for what he deems currency manipulation. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Concerns about Trump loom over Obama's final foreign tour"}

{"date": "November 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Trump is considering Richard Grenell (left) as United States ambassador to the United Nations. \n WASHINGTON >> His nascent administration already under attack, President-elect Donald Trump was considering Monday whether to inject new diversity into the GOP by recommending a woman to lead the Republican Party and an openly gay man to represent the United States at the United Nations. \n The moves, among dozens under consideration from his transition team, follow an intense and extended backlash from Trump's decision on Sunday to appoint Steve Bannon, a man celebrated by the white nationalist movement, to serve as his chief strategist and senior adviser. \n \"After winning the presidency but losing the popular vote, President-elect Trump must try to bring Americans together \u2013 not continue to fan the flames of division and bigotry,\" said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. She called Bannon's appointment \"an alarming signal\" that Trump \"remains committed to the hateful and divisive vision that defined his campaign.\" \n His inauguration just 66 days away, however, Trump focused on building his team and speaking to foreign leaders. He remained sequestered in Trump Tower in New York. \n Inexperienced on the international stage, the Republican president-elect spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone. His transition office said in a readout that \"he is very much looking forward to having a strong and enduring relationship with Russia and the people of Russia.\" Trump has spoken in recent days with the leaders of China, Mexico, South Korea and Canada. \n At the same time, Trump was considering tapping Richard Grenell as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He would be the first openly gay person to fill a Cabinet-level foreign policy post. Grenell, known in part for aggressive criticism of rivals on Twitter, previously served as U.S. spokesman at the U.N. under President George W. Bush. \n Trump was also weighing whether to select Michigan GOP chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, a niece of chief Trump critic and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney. She would be the second woman ever to lead the Republican National Committee \u2014 and the first in four decades. \n \"I'll be interested in whatever Mr. Trump wants,\" McDaniel told The Associated Press on Monday, adding that she was planning to seek the Michigan GOP chairmanship again. \n Appointing McDaniel to run the GOP's political arm could be an effort to help the party heal the anger after a campaign in which Trump demeaned women. The appointment of Grenell, who has openly supported same-sex marriage, could begin to ease concerns by the gay community about Vice President-elect Mike Pence's opposition to same-sex marriage during his time as Indiana governor. \n The personnel moves under consideration were confirmed by people with direct knowledge of Trump's thinking who were not authorized to publicly disclose private discussions. They stressed that the decisions were not final. \n Internal deliberations about staffing come a day after Trump made overtures to warring Republican circles by appointing Bannon and RNC Chairman Reince Priebus as his White House chief of staff. \n The former media executive, who led a website that appealed to the so-called \"alt-right\" \u2014 a movement often associated with efforts on the far right to preserve \"white identity,\" oppose multiculturalism and defend \"Western values.\" \n Priebus on Monday defended the media mogul, saying the two made an effective pair as they steered Trump past Democrat Hillary Clinton and toward the presidency. He sought to distance Bannon from the incendiary headlines on his website, saying they were written by unspecified others. \n \"Together, we've been able to manage a lot of the decision making in regard to the campaign,\" Priebus told NBC's \"Today.\" \"It's worked very, very well.\" \n President Barack Obama avoided any direct criticism of Trump's personnel moves during an afternoon news conference, suggesting that the new president deserves \"room to staff up.\" \n \"It's important for us to let him make his decisions,\" Obama said. \"The American people will judge over the course of the next couple of years whether they like what they see.\" \n The outgoing president encouraged Trump, however, to embrace a unifying tone. \n \"It's really important to try to send some signals of unity and to reach out to minority groups or women or others that were concerned about the tenor of the campaign,\" Obama said. \"And I think that's something he will \u2014 he will want to do.\" \n Trump's hires were, at first glance, contradictory, though they fit a pattern of the celebrity businessman creating a veritable Rorschach test that allowed his supporters to see what they wanted. Priebus, who lashed the RNC to Trump this summer despite some intraparty objections, is a GOP operative with deep expertise of the Washington establishment that Trump has vowed to shake up. He has close ties to House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Wisconsinite. \n Bannon, meanwhile, helped transform the Breitbart News site into the leading mouthpiece of the party's anti-establishment wing, which helped fuel the businessman's political rise. Ryan has been one of his most frequent targets. \n Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League, called Bannon's selection \"a sad day.\" \n Bannon, Greenblatt said, \"presided over the rise of Breitbart as a haven online\" for the \"alt-right.\" The website under Bannon's leadership \"trafficked in the some of the worst tropes, not just only against Jews \u2014 but the anti-Semitism is real \u2014 but also against other minorities, particularly Mexicans and Muslims.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump considering woman, openly gay man for leadership posts"}

{"date": "November 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., a prominent progressive and the first Muslim elected to Congress, has emerged as an early contender to become chair of the Democratic National Committee, backed by much of the party's liberal wing. \n WASHINGTON >> Still reeling from a devastating defeat in last week's election, Democrats are beginning the process of charting the direction of their party in the Donald Trump era. \n With Hillary Clinton and her team staying out of the public eye, liberal politicians have begun jockeying for control of the party's future. While they all backed Clinton, they're now pushing for a serious shift in the party's policy positions, financial resources and grassroots organizing to focus more on motivating their base and winning back the white working class voters who went for Trump. \n \"We have to do a lot of rethinking,\" said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who mounted a fierce challenge to Clinton in the primary. \n \"Democrats are focused too much with a liberal elite, which is raising incredible sums of money from wealthy people,\" Sanders said on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \n The Democratic National Committee, the last bastion of party power in Washington, is quickly emerging as ground zero for the fight. \n After losing the White House and Congress \u2014 and likely the ideological tilt of the Supreme Court \u2014 the Democrats' new chief likely will be one of the party's most visible faces in politics, making the role a far more influential post than it was during the Obama administration. \n Already, around a dozen Democrats' names have been publicly floated to succeed interim chairwoman Donna Brazile, who replaced Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in July after she was caught up in a hacking scandal. \n Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, a prominent progressive and the first Muslim elected to Congress, has emerged as an early contender, backed by much of the party's liberal wing. \n He's also picked up support from several key Democratic leaders, including outgoing Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and Reid's likely replacement, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer. Ellison was expected to officially announce his bid on Monday. His supporters argue that Ellison's faith would send an important signal about the party's commitment to inclusivity during the Trump administration. \n \"My friend Keith Ellison is a terrific leader and a strong progressive who knows how to get things done. Now is the time for new thinking and a fresh start at the DNC. Now is the time for Keith,\" Reid said in a statement on Sunday. \n In interviews on Sunday talk shows, Ellison pushed back on concerns that he'd be unable to balance party responsibilities with the politics of his day job in Congress \u2014 a problem some Democrats believe hampered Wasserman Schultz. \n \"There're a lot of places that I can serve,\" he said, in an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"I'm looking for a place to be of use and benefit. And every single Democrat in this country better be thinking the exact same way.\" \n Ellison is far from the only contender for the job. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean announced his intention Thursday to reclaim a post he held during the Bush administration. Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, DNC National Finance Chairman Henry Mu\u00f1oz III, and South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison have also said they're considering bids. \n Others are pushing for a Latino leader, arguing that the growing demographic group is crucial to the party's future and should be represented at the highest levels of its leadership. Outgoing Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego and California Rep. Xavier Becerra are said to be weighing a bid. Jason Kander, an Army veteran who lost the Senate race in Missouri to Roy Blunt on Tuesday, is also said to be considering a run. \n The contest comes at a time of deep unrest for the party \u2014 and the country. Anti-Trump protests continued this weekend with thousands of demonstrators turning out in cities across the country. And post-election polls showed a significant minority of Clinton backers question the legitimacy of Trump's win. \n Top party leaders are urging Democrats not to despair. \n \"It's time to brush ourselves off, get back in the arena, and get ready to fight,\" President Barack Obama said in an email to supporters inviting them to join a call with him on Monday evening about moving forward. \n Clinton, meanwhile, has offered little advice to supporters after her concession speech on Wednesday. On a weekend call with top donors, she blamed her loss largely on the FBI's decision to revive its examination of her email accounts. \n She made nearly no mention of the other factors driving Trump's victory, including flaws within her own message, and offered her backers little guidance on moving forward, according to donors on the call. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Still reeling, Democrats begin battling for future"}

{"date": "November 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A landslide covers a section of state highway 1 near Kaikoura, New Zealand, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016, after a powerful earthquake. A powerful earthquake that rocked New Zealand on Monday triggered landslides and a small tsunami, cracked apart roads and homes, but largely spared the country the devastation it saw five years ago when a deadly earthquake struck the same region. \n WELLINGTON, New Zealand >> New Zealand is planning to send in military helicopters and a navy ship to rescue about 1,000 tourists and hundreds of residents who remain stranded in the coastal town of Kaikoura after a powerful earthquake on Monday cut off train and vehicle access. \n The magnitude-7.8 quake struck the South Island just after midnight. It left two people dead and triggered a small tsunami. It also brought down rocks and mud that swept across highways and cracked apart roads. \n Home to about 2,000 residents, Kaikoura is a popular destination for travelers taking part in whale-watching expeditions or wanting a stopover with mountain views. But the quake knocked out water supplies and sewerage systems and left people with no easy way out. \n \"From all directions, Kaikoura has essentially been isolated,\" Air Commodore Darryn Webb, the Acting Commander of New Zealand's Joint Forces, told The Associated Press. \"There's a real imperative to support the town because it can't support itself.\" \n Webb said the military planned to begin using four NH90 helicopters on Tuesday that could each transport about 18 people out of the town at a time. He said a ship was also leaving Auckland on Monday night that could potentially pick up hundreds of people if weather conditions allowed. \n \"We're going to get as many people and belongings out as quickly as we can,\" Webb said. \n He said the weather forecast wasn't looking great and the operation could take several days. He said that if needed, a C-130 military transport plane could drop fuel, water, food and other supplies to the town. \n Elsewhere, strong aftershocks continued to shake New Zealand on Monday, rattling the nerves of exhausted residents. The country was largely spared the devastation it saw in 2011 when an earthquake struck the city of Christchurch and killed 185 people. That quake was one of New Zealand's worst disasters, causing an estimated $25 billion in damage. \n Monday's quake caused damage in Wellington, the capital, and was also strongly felt in Christchurch. Residents said the shaking went on for about three minutes. \n Police said one person died in Kaikoura and another in Mt. Lyford, a nearby ski resort. Several other people suffered minor injuries in Kaikoura, police spokeswoman Rachel Purdom said. \n Prime Minister John Key flew over the destruction in Kaikoura by helicopter as aftershocks kicked up dust from the landslides below. Cars could be seen lying on their sides and parts of the road were clearly impassable. \n \"It's just utter devastation,\" Key said. \n He later toured the area and met with locals. He estimated the cleanup effort would run into the billions of dollars and said clearing the debris and blocked roads could take months. \n Kaikoura resident Terry Thompson said he was out of town when the quake struck but managed to reach his wife on her cellphone before the phone died. \n \"She said the glass exploded right out of the double ranch-slider,\" he said. \"The neighbor's chimney was gone, there were breakages and things smashed everywhere.\" \n Thompson said his wife helped a 93-year-old neighbor and a tourist into her car and drove to higher ground. \n \"They stayed in the car all night but couldn't sleep,\" Thompson said. \"They're all very, very tired and concerned about the state of their property.\" \n Video taken from a helicopter near Kaikoura showed three cows stranded on an island of grass in a paddock that had been ripped apart in the quake. The patch of grass was surrounded by deep ravines of collapsed earth, trapping the animals where they stood. \n The quake temporarily knocked out New Zealand's emergency call number, 111. In Wellington, it collapsed a ferry loading ramp, broke windows and caused items to fall from shelves. It also forced hundreds of tourists onto the streets as hotels were evacuated. \n Australians Paul and Sandra Wardrop and their children, Alexander, 15, and William, 12, were on the 10th floor of the Park Hotel when the shaking began. \n \"We felt that the building was going to collapse,\" Sandra Wardrop said. \"You could hear the sounds of the building shaking and see cracks appearing in the walls, in the plasterwork in the bedroom.\" \n The family was among dozens of people who took shelter in the capital's parliamentary complex, which threw open its doors. \n Police, meanwhile, stepped up their patrols after receiving several reports of burglaries in homes and businesses that had been evacuated due to the quake. \n Authorities in Wellington told people who work in the city's central business district to stay home on Monday. Officials said some large buildings were showing signs of structural stress. The city's suburban rail network was shut while crews checked tracks, bridges and tunnels. \n New Zealand, with a population of 4.7 million, sits on the \"Ring of Fire,\" an arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes are common. \n The location of Monday's quake largely helps explain why the damage was so minimal compared to the 2011 temblor, said Mark Quigley, associate professor of active tectonics at the University of Melbourne in Australia. \n The 2011 quake was located almost directly beneath Christchurch, meaning tens of thousands of people were exposed to the most violent shaking at the epicenter. Monday's quake was centered in a rural area that is home to just a few thousand people. \n The 2011 quake also had a tremendous amount of high-frequency energy, including very strong vertical ground motions that felt \"like you're being picked up by a giant and being shaken around,\" Quigley said. \n But for those in Christchurch on Monday, the shaking felt very different \u2014 more of a rolling motion. \"They were far enough away that a lot of that high-frequency energy was dissipated,\" Quigley said. \n The quake was centered 93 kilometers (57 miles) northeast of Christchurch at a depth of 23 kilometers (14 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The USGS initially estimated it had a magnitude of 7.4 before revising it to 7.8. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Kristen Gelineau in Sydney contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New Zealand plans rescue of tourists stranded by earthquake"}

{"date": "November 14, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The U.N. weather agency said on Monday, Nov. 14, 2016, that 2016 is set to break the record for the hottest year since measurements began in the 19th century. \n MARRAKECH, Morocco >> Global temperatures are soaring toward a record high this year, the U.N. weather agency said Monday, while another report showed emissions of a key global warming gas have flattened out in the past three years. \n The reports injected a mix of gloom and hope at U.N. climate talks in Marrakech this week. \n \"Another year. Another record. The high temperatures we saw in 2015 are set to be beaten in 2016,\" said Petteri Taalas, the head of the World Meteorological Organization. \n WMO's preliminary data through October showed world temperatures, boosted by the El Nino phenomenon, are 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. \n That's getting close to the limit set by the global climate agreement adopted in Paris last year. It calls for limiting the temperature rise since the industrial revolution to 2 degrees C or even 1.5 degrees C. \n WMO said 16 of the 17 hottest years have occurred this century. The only exception was 1998, which was also an El Nino year. \n Taalas said parts of Arctic Russia saw temperatures soaring 6-7 degrees C above average. \"We are used to measuring temperature records in fractions of a degree, and so this is different,\" he said. \n Environmental groups and climate scientists said the report underscores the need to quickly reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases blamed for warming the planet. \n Another report released Monday delivered some positive news, showing global CO2 emissions have flattened out in the past three years. However, the authors of the study cautioned it's unclear whether the slowdown, mainly caused by declining coal use in China, is a permanent trend or a temporary blip. \n \"It is far too early to proclaim we have reached a peak,\" said co-author Glen Peters, a senior researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo. \n The study, published in the journal Earth System Science Data, says global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry is projected to grow by just 0.2 percent this year. \n That would mean emissions have leveled off at about 36 billion metric tons in the past three years even though the world economy has expanded, suggesting the historical bonds between economic gains and emissions growth may have been severed. \n \"This could be the turning point we have hoped for,\" said David Ray, a professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved with the study. \"To tackle climate change those bonds must be broken and here we have the first signs that they are at least starting to loosen.\" \n Chinese emissions were down 0.7 percent in 2015 and are projected to fall 0.5 percent in 2016, the researchers said, though noting that Chinese energy statistics have been plagued by inconsistencies. \n Peters said it remains unclear whether the Chinese slowdown was due to a restructuring of the economy or a sign of economic instability, but the unexpected reduction in Chinese emissions \"give us hope that the world's biggest emitter can deliver much more ambitious emission reductions.\" \n China, which accounts for almost 30 percent of global carbon emissions, pledged to peak its emissions around 2030 as part of the global climate pact adopted in Paris last year. Many analysts say China's peak is likely to come much earlier \u2014 and may already have occurred. \n \"The continued decline of China's CO2 emissions, combined with knowledge of structural change in the energy system, does indicate that CO2 emissions from China may have peaked, however a few more years of data is needed to confirm this,\" said Bill Hare, of Climate Analytics, a separate group that monitors global emissions. \n Even if China's emissions have stabilized, growth in India and other developing countries could push global emissions higher again. India's emissions rose 5 percent in 2015, the study said. \n The election of Donald Trump as president of the United States \u2014 the world's No. 2 carbon polluter \u2014 could also have an impact. \n U.S. emissions fell 2.6 percent last year and are projected to drop 1.7 percent this year, as natural gas and renewables displace coal in power generation, the study showed. But it's unclear whether those reductions will continue under Trump, who has pledged to roll back the Obama administration's environmental policies, including the Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. \n Other researchers not affiliated with the study stressed that it's not enough for global emissions to stabilize; they need to drop toward zero for the world to meet the goals of the Paris deal. \n \"Worryingly, the reductions pledged by the nations under the Paris Agreement are not sufficient to achieve this,\" said climate scientist Chris Rapley of University College London. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "2016 set to break heat record despite slowdown in emissions"}

The interview will be conducted by an Ecuadorean prosecutor, with a Swedish prosecutor present. \n LONDON >> WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was being questioned by prosecutors Monday at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London about possible sexual misconduct committed in Sweden six years ago. \n Assange was being interviewed at the embassy where he sought refuge more than four years ago. The questioning was being led by an Ecuadorean prosecutor in the presence of Swedish prosecutor Ingrid Isgren and a Swedish police investigator. \n Prosecutors planned to ask Assange to consent to providing a DNA sample. \n Swedish officials are seeking information related to allegations of serious misconduct made by two Swedish women he met in 2010. Some of the alleged misconduct is no longer being investigated by police because of the statute of limitations. \n He is, however, being questioned about a possible rape of one of the women who complained to authorities. He has not been indicted. \n Prosecutors say no immediate decision on the future of Assange's case will be made on Monday. They also said no public statements will be made after the questioning, which may last several days. \n Assange's Swedish defense lawyer, Per Samuelsson, told Swedish media he has \"high hopes\" the case will be closed once prosecutors have completed the interview. He complained that he has been barred from the hearing, despite arguing that Assange's Swedish lawyer must be permitted to take part. \n \"I'm not on the list of persons that Ecuador has drawn up and allowed to be present,\" Samuelsson told the Swedish national broadcaster SVT. \"An Ecuadorean lawyer has taken up this question as a formal issue in the introduction of the hearing.\" \n Civil rights activist Peter Tatchell said outside the embassy that he and others had gathered to show \"solidarity\" with Assange and WikiLeaks. He said Assange was being \"hounded\" because of WikiLeaks' work in shedding light on the \"terrible things\" done by the U.S. government and others. \n Some supporters hoisted pro-Assange banners outside the embassy. \n Assange has denied sexual wrongdoing and says he fears being extradited to the U.S. because of his WikiLeaks work.

They sought an international arrest warrant for him that was issued in November 2010. \n Assange surrendered to police in London and was freed on bail, receiving support from a wide range of celebrities including filmmakers Oliver Stone and Michael Moore. \n He then moved into the Ecuadorean Embassy in London in June 2012, putting him out of reach of British authorities. \n He has remained in control of WikiLeaks, which released hacked emails relating to the Hillary Clinton campaign in the final weeks of her failed White House run. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Assange questioned at Ecuadorean Embassy in London"}

The indictment was filed on Oct. 31, but it was only released today after New York state police arrested Alexandria Duval on Friday. \n Authorities on Maui said Alexandria was driving a Ford Explorer on Hana Highway on May 29 with her sister Anastasia Duval in the passenger seat when the SUV crashed into a rock wall and plunged about 200 feet onto a rocky shoreline during what authorities described as a hair-pulling fight over the steering wheel. \n Anastasia Duval was killed, and Alexandria was injured. Alexandria was arrested and jailed then on a second-degree murder charge, accused of deliberately causing her sister's death. \n A judge later ordered the release of Alexandria after determining there was no probable cause for a murder charge. \n She was later indicted on the charge. \n In August, Duval was arrested in upstate New York on a drunken driving charge after authorities say she nearly struck a vehicle driven by a state police investigator. She was released about three weeks later. \n Duval was being held in Albany County Jail awaiting extradition to Hawaii. \n The Duval sisters, born Alison and Ann Dadow in the Utica, New York, area, operated popular yoga studios in Palm Beach County, Florida, from 2008 to 2014 before they changed their names.

But in a decision he now regrets, he chose to go to Gaza. \n Hamedo's family is among 12 Syrian households that found refuge in Gaza after the civil war erupted in 2011 and are now trapped in the war-battered territory, ineligible for most social services granted to Palestinians but also unable to travel abroad. \n \"We are trying to get out of Gaza to any European country or where a Syrian refugee can find care,\" said Hamedo, a chef from Aleppo who is an unofficial spokesman for the Syrian families here. \"Gaza was a phase for the Syrians. We came to it because of the conditions that forced us to.\" \n About 250 families from Palestinian refugee camps in Syria made their way to Gaza in the first two years of the Syrian civil war. As Palestinian refugees, they were eligible for services such as health care, education and food assistance from UNRWA, the U.N. agency that assists Palestinian refugees. \n About two dozen Syrian families also chose to migrate to Gaza after initially fleeing to Egypt. As the situation in Egypt deteriorated, they entered neighboring Gaza through smuggling tunnels. Some managed to leave before the Egyptian army shut most of the tunnels in 2013. But half still remain. \n Egypt closed the tunnels following the ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, who had been a close ally of Gaza's Hamas rulers. The loss of the tunnels, along with a devastating 50-day war with Israel in 2014, caused Gaza's economy to collapse. Unemployment has soared, and the cash-strapped Hamas government has failed to provide shelter for the Syrians. \n \"We got many promises, but nothing was made,\" Hamedo said. \n While UNRWA serves Palestinian refugees, the main international body assisting displaced Syrians is the U.N. refugee agency, which has no offices in Gaza. The Palestinian territories also have no official Syrian diplomatic mission, so the families can't renew passports or register their newborns. And because they entered Gaza illegally through the tunnels, they have no way of exiting. With no legal status, work or aid, the Syrians can do little but wait for a miracle to leave. \n Majed al-Attar wistfully recalled his life in Damascus, where he said he had a spacious home, two cars and a warehouse full of cement and building materials. His expired passport is full of Jordanian, Egyptian and Saudi stamps he collected in his business travels. \n The house and its surroundings were hit from the air \"and everything was wiped out,\" the 49-year-old said. So, he moved with his wife and child to Egypt in 2012. \n In the run-up to the 2013 military overthrow of Morsi, things quickly deteriorated, and the options were to join migrants on \"the death boats\" to Europe or move to Gaza, he said. The second option seemed smarter since his wife is originally Palestinian and had relatives in the Gaza border town of Rafah. \n In Gaza, al-Attar was displaced again during the 2014 war, when he had to flee bombing and sleep in U.N. school shelters for several weeks. \"It was a disaster for us,\" he said. \n Now unemployed, he cannot afford to buy kindergarten clothes for his son who was born here in 2014. The boy has no official documents or citizenship, only a hospital notification that shows his name and date of birth. Most of the money he earns as a day laborer goes to the rental of a half-finished, sparsely furnished apartment. His wife managed to qualify for some UNRWA benefits, including schooling for the boy, but most benefits are out of reach because al-Attar is not Palestinian. \n \"I regret coming here,\" he said. \"We just hope to get out from here next month or the month after with my wife and children to live in dignity and freedom and with a secure future for them.\" \n As Gaza struggles to rebuild damaged homes, over 11,200 families are still displaced after the 2014 war with Israel. That has made it even harder for the Syrian families to find adequate shelter. \n Amer Foura's family, originally from the southwestern Syrian city of Deraa, has found shelter in a hospital. \n His wife, Kholoud, a 39-year-old mother of five, has developed muscular dystrophy and is now hooked up to a respirator at Gaza's Al-Wafa hospital. Her husband and children sleep in beds and mattresses in her hospital room. \n \"I have lived in Al-Wafa hospital for about a year and a half,\" said the husband, who is unemployed. \"My only home is Al-Wafa since it's able to provide and take care of me. \n The Syrians scrape by with menial jobs and occasional donations from local charities. \n Hamedo, the chef, is full of nostalgia, spending time daily flipping through pictures from his life in Aleppo, where he ran a restaurant called Caf\u00e9 D'alep. He pointed to a photo of a blond woman. \"This was my girlfriend. She died in an airstrike,\" he said. \n He enjoyed some initial success in Gaza, opening a restaurant that enjoyed early popularity, but ultimately went out of business because of the weak economy, constant power outages and shortages of cooking gas. He has since married a local woman and last month, they had their first child, a girl. \n \"We just need to get the basics secured in our stay here,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Syrian refugees regret move to Gaza"}
