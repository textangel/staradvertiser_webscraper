{"date": "November 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Protesters in Philadelphia demonstrated in solidarity with members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota over the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. \n CANNON BALL, N.D. >> The company building the $3.8 billion Dakota Access oil pipeline has asked a federal judge's permission to circumvent President Barack Obama's administration and move ahead with a disputed section of the project in North Dakota, as opponents held protests across the country against the pipeline. \n Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners and a subsidiary asked the court today to let them lay pipe under a Missouri River reservoir, a plan the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says threatens its drinking water and cultural sites. The Army Corps of Engineers said Monday it needs more time to study the impact of the plan. \n While President-elect Donald Trump, a pipeline supporter, likely would greenlight the project when he takes office in January, the company is trying to win federal approval \u2014 or a court order \u2014 to allow it to go forward sooner. The delay has already cost nearly $100 million, the company said in court documents, \"and further delay in the consideration of this case would add millions of dollars more each month in costs which cannot be recovered.\" \n In a statement today, the company blamed the Obama administration for \"political interference\" in the pipeline review process. \n The Army Corps referred a request for comment to the Justice Department, which declined comment. \n Protests were being held Tuesday across the country, from California to Vermont. Activists called for demonstrations at Army Corps of Engineers offices and at banks financing the pipeline construction. \n More than two dozen people were arrested near Mandan, North Dakota, after a group of about 400 protesters put a truck and tree branches on BNSF Railway tracks near a pipeline work staging area and tried to set it on fire, Morton County sheriff's spokesman Rob Keller said. \n \"They had a rope soaked with kerosene,\" he said. \"A (Highway Patrol) trooper with an extinguisher doused it so it wouldn't light.\" \n Trains were delayed three hours, railroad spokeswoman Amy McBeth said. Officers in riot gear used pepper spray and in one instance a stun gun against protesters who refused to leave. \n Mandan is about 50 miles north of a camp where hundreds of protesters have gathered in recent months to oppose the pipeline. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental attorney and president of the New York-based Waterkeeper Alliance, which seeks to protect watersheds worldwide, visited the camp Tuesday, speaking out against the arrests of protesters and a project he says will benefit billionaires and not the American people. \n \"What they are doing here is a crime, an environmental crime, and there are real victims,\" he said. \n In Columbus, Ohio, police reported an activist blocked traffic by handcuffing himself under a vehicle at a downtown intersection. In Montpelier, Vermont, more than 100 people gathered outside a bank, chanting, singing songs and holding signs saying \"Water is Life\" and \"Standing With Standing Rock.\" \n \"It may seem hopeless, like David against Goliath, but we believe that if we're persistent and we recruit, that this movement will grow and hopefully these kinds of projects will stop,\" said protester Lee Shen of Thetford Center, Vermont. \n The Corps on Monday called for more study and input from the Standing Rock Sioux before it decides whether to allow the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe. The 1,200-mile pipeline that's to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois is largely complete except for that stretch, which will skirt the tribe's reservation. \n Gov. Jack Dalrymple said Tuesday that an additional delay \"does nothing but prolong and intensify the public safety issues imposed on Morton County and the state of North Dakota since the beginning of August,\" when protests against the pipeline broke out. In his statement, Dalrymple said a decision on the project easement \"is long overdue\" and that the pipeline would be safe. \n The Corps in July granted Energy Transfer Partners the permits needed for the project, but it said in September that further analysis was warranted, given the tribe's concerns. Its announcement Monday came amid speculation that federal officials were on the brink of approving the crossing. ETP last week began preparing equipment to bore under the river. \n ETP disputes that the pipeline would endanger the tribe, and CEO Kelcy Warren noted earlier that Army Assistant Secretary Jo-Ellen Darcy had informed company officials and Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault that the Corps' previous permit decisions \"comported with legal requirements.\" ETP contends that the Corps has no legal justification for the delay. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pipeline company seeks federal court OK to proceed with plan"}

Journalists were only aware that Trump was leaving home when they spotted a large motorcade pulling away from the building, including an ambulance with lights flashing. \n The movement was a surprise given that Trump's campaign had already called a \"lid\" \u2014 a signal to journalists that he would not be venturing out in public for the rest of the day. The practice is meant to ensure that journalists are on hand to witness, on behalf of the public, the activities of the president or president-elect, rather than relying on secondhand accounts. \n Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks issued the lid at 6:14 p.m. But just over an hour later, Trump's motorcade left his residence. His whereabouts became clear only after a fellow diner tweeted a picture of the president-elect arriving at the restaurant. \n Hicks said she was unaware that Trump planned to leave his home and had not intended to leave the press in the dark. She said the Trump team was working toward setting up a protective pool in the near future. \n Every president and president-elect in recent memory has traveled with a pool of journalists when leaving the White House grounds.

Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas. The pool was just steps away from President Ronald Reagan when he was shot outside a hotel in the District of Columbia, and was stationed outside his hospital as he recovered. The pool also travels on vacation and foreign trips and at times captures personal, historic moments of the presidency. \n Trump departed the 21 Club around 9:30 p.m. His daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, were seen getting into a vehicle in the motorcade. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump breaks protocol \u2014 again \u2014 on press access"}

{"date": "November 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People wait in line to apply for New York Ctiy municipal identification cards on the first day they were available, in the Bronx borough of New York. Advocates said the ID cards would help people living in the country illegally venture out of the shadows. Now some fear it could instead expose them to deportation. \n NEW YORK >> When New York City launched the nation's biggest municipal ID card program last year, advocates said it would help people living in the U.S. illegally to venture out of the shadows. \n But since Donald Trump was elected president, city officials are instead fielding questions about whether the cards could put those same people at greater risk of being deported. \n The city has vowed to protect cardholders' personal records and might even delete them using a kind of self-destruct provision that allows for the information to be destroyed at the end of the year. At least one state lawmaker has criticized that idea, saying it could make it impossible to trace people if they have obtained cards fraudulently. \n Some immigrants take comfort in the city's stance, while acknowledging they are still wary. \n Alberto Saldivia got his \"IDNYC\" card this year after spending 15 years in the country without legal authorization. \n \"It did cause me considerable concern, because they have my information, also the information of my son,\" the 53-year-old Mexico native said through an interpreter. \n But he felt reassured when Mayor Bill de Blasio said last week that the city would \"absolutely\" safeguard cardholders' identities. De Blasio, a Democrat, said officials would assess whether to delete the personal records, a provision that was built into the program partly over concerns about the possible election of a Republican president such as Trump, whose campaign promises included a vow to deport millions of people in the U.S. illegally. \n Municipal ID programs began in 2007 in New Haven, Connecticut, and have expanded to about 10 cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. New York's program is the most ambitious, with more than 800,000 cardholders, many of them U.S. citizens or legal residents. \n Officials encouraged everyone in the city to sign up, but the program was aimed at those without other forms of ID, including homeless people and, especially, the estimated 500,000 immigrants living illegally in the city. The ID would help them do such everyday things as cash a check or attend a parent-teacher conference at a public school, advocates said. \n The program quickly proved popular, with New Yorkers waiting hours in line and months for appointments to register early on. Pope Francis received a ceremonial one during his visit to the city last year, and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the card would make him \"a real New Yorker.\" \n But civil liberties advocates sounded alarms about the city collecting identity documents that immigration authorities or law enforcement could request, with a judge's approval. \n The program's backers included language that allows for destroying the applicants' identity and residency information at the end of 2016 if administrators do not move to keep them. \n \"Protecting it from a possible Republican president was just one of the reasons\" for the provision, said City Councilman Carlos Menchaca, who wrote the law that created the program. \n A critic of the program said deleting the records would only compound concerns about it. \n \"It's completely irresponsible to destroy the documentation of people who applied for a government-issued ID card,\" said state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican. \n She said the proof-of-identity requirements may not be stringent enough to prevent fraud, and deleting the records would leave authorities \"no way of knowing who these people are, how they obtained this documentation.\" \n Some immigrants and their advocates remain hopeful that the IDs won't backfire. The extent of the program should thwart using it to target immigrants here illegally, since they represent only some of the cardholders, said Javier Valdes of Make the Road New York, an advocacy group that pushed for the program. \n Juan Rosas Carrera plans to keep his appointment this weekend to get an IDNYC card, despite a friend's warning that it could be risky to give authorities his name and address. Rosas Carrera, a Mexican national and construction worker, has been living in the U.S. illegally for 17 years. \n Still, he wants an ID card to open a bank account and feels it's worth the worry. \n \"I feel safe in New York. I also think that if you don't have a criminal record, nothing bad will really happen,\" said Rosas Carrera, 48. \"But I am a bit worried about Trump.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Wary of Trump immigration threat, NY may erase ID card data"}

{"date": "November 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the keynote address at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference in San Francisco. \n NEW YORK >> Facebook is under fire for failing to rein in fake and biased news stories that some believe may have swayed the presidential election. Its predicament stems from this basic conundrum: It exercises great control over the news its users see, but it declines to assume the editorial responsibility that traditional publishers do. \n On Monday, Facebook took a minor step to address the issue, clarifying its advertising policy to emphasize that it won't display ads on sites that run information that is \"illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news.\" The company said it was merely making explicit a policy that was already implied. \n Its move followed a similar step by Google earlier on Monday, after the search giant acknowledged that it had let a false article about the election results slip into its list of recommended news stories. \n In the case of both companies, the aim is to discourage fake-news sites by depriving them of revenue. \n Facebook is also said to be facing brewing internal turmoil over its influence and what it can and should do about it. \n Employees have expressed concern over Facebook's role in spreading misinformation and racist memes largely associated with the alt-right, according to The New York Times and BuzzFeed. Some have reportedly formed an unofficial task force to investigate the role the company played in the election. \n Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, however, insists that Facebook remains a neutral technology platform where its users can share anything they want, with only a tiny fraction of it fake or problematic. \n Last week, Zuckerberg called the idea that voters might have been influenced by what they saw on Facebook \u2014 fake, uber-partisan stories, such as a false one about Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump for president \u2014 \"pretty crazy.\" \n FACEBOOK CONTROL \n People update to Facebook so frequently that the company has no choice but to filter what everyone sees in their news feeds \u2014 the main artery through which users see posts from their friends, family, businesses, news sources and celebrities they follow. \n The company's secret algorithms are designed to deliver the posts from friends and other sources that will draw people in and lead them to read and click and \"like\" and share \u2014 \"maximizing their engagement,\" in Facebook's jargon. \n Facebook frequently tweaks its algorithm to improve engagement. Various changes have been aimed at shutting out sites that promote clickbait and other garbage that users say they don't want to see, even as they click on it and share away. When users are surrounded by posts they want to see, they're more likely to stick around. \n That's key to Facebook's advertising business. But it can be problematic when it comes to false but highly interesting posts. \n Facebook's news feed \"maximizes for engagement. As we've learned in this election, bulls\u2014t is highly engaging,\" former Facebook product designer Bobby Goodlatte wrote in an Election Day post. \"Highly partisan, fact-light outlets\" on both the right and the left, he wrote, \"have no concern for the truth, and really only care for engagement. \u2026 It's now clear that democracy suffers if our news environment incentivizes bulls\u2014t.\" \n Social media companies today have to acknowledge that they are news organizations, said Jeffrey Herbst, president and CEO of the Newseum, a journalism museum in Washington. \"Not like news companies of the 20th century,\" he added. \"But not just pipes where people get their news. They determine what is news.\" \n In a post Saturday night, Zuckerberg rejected that idea. \n \"News and media are not the primary things people do on Facebook, so I find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance,\" he wrote. \"Facebook is mostly about helping people stay connected with friends and family.\" \n FACEBOOK AS NEWSPAPER \u2014 NO, SCRATCH THAT \n Back in 2013, Zuckerberg said he wanted Facebook to be people's \"own personal newspaper,\" one that delivers the stories most interesting and important to them. That's still the company's goal \u2014 though minus any reference to itself as a media company of any kind. \n Of course, fake stuff has existed on the internet long before Facebook. And under the law, Facebook is no more responsible for what appears on its site than \"the paper mills that print newspapers are responsible for their content,\" said Steve Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago who studies communication technology. \n At the same time, Jones said he thinks the broader issue of Facebook's responsibility is one that's going to be \"debated forever.\" \n \"Even the notion of truth is something that's highly contested at this point,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Facebook's fake news problem: What's its responsibility?"}

The opponents are appealing various decisions that have been made during an ongoing contested-case hearing process, including time limits for parties to question witnesses. \n \"Because of the statewide importance of the underlying contested-case hearing, the board requests that this court act as soon as possible,\" the motion said. \n In 2011, telescope opponents requested so-called contested-case hearings before the land board approved a permit to build on conservation land. The hearings were held, and the permit was upheld. Opponents then sued. \n In December 2015, the state Supreme Court revoked the permit, ruling the land board's approval process was flawed. That meant the application process needed to be redone, requiring a new hearing. \n Permit applicant University of Hawaii at Hilo also wants the appeal dismissed. Their motion suggests the court appoint a special master who would oversee the case. TMT International Observatory LLC, the nonprofit organization that wants to build the telescope, filed documents with the court Monday to join the motion. \n The opponents appealed directly to the state Supreme Court because of a law that took in effect in August that allows certain contested-case hearing decisions to bypass the Intermediate Court of Appeals. \n The motions to dismiss argue the appeal would create \"piecemeal litigation.\" \n \"Indeed, allowing appeals such as this would open the door to interlocutory appeals of nearly any decision made during the course of a fact-finding proceeding, and ultimately undermine the entire proceeding,\" the university's motion said. \n One of the reasons for the appeal is concern that the same lawyers from the state attorney general's office who argued unsuccessfully before the state Supreme Court continue to advise the land board and the hearing officer \"in what is now supposed to be a fair and impartial process,\" Richard Wurdeman, the attorney who filed the appeal, said in an email Tuesday. \n Lanny Sinkin, who is representing the traditional Native Hawaiian faith known as Temple of Lono, filed a similar appeal to the state Supreme Court on Monday. Temple of Lono, which is one of the parties in the contested-case hearings, claims violations of due process. \n The hearings began last month, and they are scheduled to last into next month, possibly January. Telescope officials have said they want a permit in place by the end of the year or early next year in order to resume construction in 2018. They recently announced that a mountain in the Canary Islands, Spain, is the primary alternative in case the telescope can't be built in Hawaii. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hawaii land board seeks quick dismissal of telescope appeal"}

Denver has approved a first-in-the-nation law allowing people to use marijuana in bars and restaurants. \n DENVER >> Denver has approved a first-in-the-nation law allowing people to use marijuana at bars, restaurants and other public spaces such as art galleries or yoga studios. \n The catch: Patrons could use pot as long as it isn't smoked and the locations would have to seek the approval of neighbors. \n Denver voters approved Proposition 300 as eight other states legalized marijuana for medical or recreational purposes last week. The Denver vote was so close that it took an entire week for supporters to claim victory and opponents to concede. \n \"It's the sensible thing to do,\" said Emmett Reistroffer, a Denver marijuana consultant and campaign manager for the pot-in-bars measure. \"This is about personal responsibility and respecting adults who want to have a place to enjoy cannabis.\" \n The city measure takes effect immediately, but it has a lot of caveats. \n First, interested bars and restaurants would have to show they have neighborhood support before getting a license to allow marijuana use. In addition, patrons would have to bring their own weed to comply with state law banning the sale of both pot and food or drink at a single location. \n Patrons at participating bars could use pot inside as long as it isn't smoked. The law does provide for the possibility of outside smoking areas under restrictive circumstances. \n Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the national Marijuana Policy Project and a Denver proponent of the consumption law, said the measure would reduce instances of tourists smoking pot on sidewalks and in parks because they have nowhere private to consume weed. \n A Denver billboard promoting the measure featured a large arrow pointing to a sidewalk below, telling voters that without a provision for social pot use, folks will keep smoking pot in plain view. \n \"We are setting up a system that is still more restrictive than what we see with alcohol consumption,\" Tvert said. \n Supporters of the measure had no guess on how many establishments would apply for the permits or how long it would take for them to demonstrate community acceptance and receive permits. So it could take many months before Denver sees any Amsterdam-style coffee shops. \n The measure sunsets in 2020, unless city officials renew the licenses or voters make the pot-in-bars measure permanent. \n Current Colorado law does not allow or ban public marijuana use. The result is a hodgepodge of local ordinances related to marijuana clubs. \n Denver is the first city to allow use in bars and restaurants. The state Legislature is expected to consider a bill next year to clarify that communities can allow on-site pot consumption if they wish. \n Alaska is the only state that allows on-site consumption at pot retailers. However, the state doesn't allow use in bars or restaurants, and it's still working on rules for how those pot shop \"tasting rooms\" would operate. \n California's recreational marijuana measure approved last week specifically allows pot clubs, and legalization measures approved in Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada don't rule out on-site pot consumption on private property. \n Opponents of the Denver measure predicted neighborhoods would resist bars, restaurants and other venues seeking pot licenses. They warned the measure won't properly protect the public from stoned patrons leaving a bar that allows smoking and drinking at the same time. \n \"How can these businesses possibly monitor patrons for marijuana intoxication?\" opponent Rachel O'Bryan said in a statement Tuesday. \n The measure would require any interested bar or restaurant to specially train staff in marijuana use and submit an operations plan to show how it would prevent marijuana use by underage patrons. Applicants must also specify strategies and procedures for identifying and responding to the potential over-intoxication of consumers. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Denver becomes first city in U.S. to OK pot in bars, eateries"}

The luxury apartment building is one of three that will have the president-elect's name stripped from it after hundreds of residents signed an online petition demanding it be removed. \n NEW YORK >> Donald Trump's name is being stripped off three luxury apartment buildings after hundreds of tenants signed a petition saying they were embarrassed to live in a place associated with the Republican president-elect. \n In all, about 600 residents of the three rental towers in Trump Place signed the online petition, which began circulating weeks ago after the public release of a decade-old recording of Trump boasting about groping women and kissing them without their consent. \n Tenants learned on Tuesday from the company that owns and manages the New York skyscrapers, which hold 1,325 rental apartments, that the huge gold letters spelling out \"Trump Place\" would be removed from the sides of the buildings within days. \n \"We're all very excited and thrilled, and it's about time,\" said Marjorie Jacobs, who has lived in one of the buildings for five years. \"We're disgusted with the results of the presidency.\" \n A spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, Hope Hicks, didn't immediately return a request for comment on Tuesday. She told The New York Times in October that removing the Trump name would cause a building to \"lose tremendous value.\" \n A spokesman for Equity Residential, the Chicago-based company that owns and manages the buildings, said its executives considered \"the input of our residents\" among other factors when making the decision to change the buildings' names. Spokesman Marty McKenna said in an email that a \"neutral building identity\" might hold more appeal to current and future residents. \n The letters spelling out Trump's name could come down as soon as Wednesday, residents said. They will be replaced with the buildings' addresses. \n Several neighboring towers that also bear the Trump Place name but have different owners are sticking with the Trump brand. \n In the early 1990s, Trump partnered with Chinese investors to develop a large area of land near Lincoln Center and the Hudson River on Manhattan's Upper West Side. When Trump's partners decided to sell the development in 2005 for $1.76 billion, he sued, arguing the price was too low. \n Trump lost that litigation and remained a minority partner. His Trump Organization still manages some buildings in the development. \n Brian Dumont, a wealth manager who has lived in his Trump Place apartment for four years, said the petition drive gained momentum after neighbors became increasingly embarrassed explaining to fellow New Yorkers that they lived in Trump buildings. \n \"You know how it is in New York, everyone asks you where you live,\" he said. \"And we found ourselves just recoiling.\" \n Voters in Manhattan resoundingly rejected Trump on Election Day. His main rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, pulled in more than a half-million votes, compared with fewer than 60,000 for him. \n Trump, asked whether his comments on the campaign trail had hurt his brand, said in an interview on Sunday, \"Who cares?\" \n \"This is big-league stuff,\" he said on CBS's \"60 Minutes.\" \"I don't care about hotel occupancy.

{"date": "November 15, 2016", "text": "NEW YORK >> In the week since Donald Trump's election, there's been a dramatic surge in donations to the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood, the Sierra Club and other progressive organizations which have pledged to resist any moves by the new administration that would undercut their causes. \n Within hours after the election was called, the ACLU unleashed feisty fundraising appeals, including one warning that if Trump implemented certain campaign promises, \"We'll see him in court.\" \n The result, according to the ACLU, has been the largest surge of support in its 94-year history, including roughly 120,000 donations totaling more than $7.2 million. \n \"We'll need to build up the most powerful legal organization mankind has ever known to fight for us over the next four years,\" wrote HIV/AIDS and gay-rights activist Peter Staley, who pledged on his Facebook page to become a monthly ACLU donor. \n The ACLU's executive director, Anthony Romero, said the infusion of new funds would help in addressing several urgent priorities, including resisting possible mass deportation efforts, protecting the civil rights of transgender Americans, and preventing \"stop-and-frisk\" police policies from being adopted nationwide. \n Among Trump's many promises is to halt federal funding for Planned Parenthood because of its role as the largest abortion provider in the U.S. \n Since the election, Planned Parenthood has reported an unprecedented outpouring of support, with more than 128,000 people making donations. The organization said at least 20,000 of the donations made reference to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who as a congressman and governor of Indiana has been an advocate of tough anti-abortion restrictions. \n \"We will never back down, and we will never stop providing the care our patients need,\" said Planned Parenthood's president, Cecile Richards. \n Like the ACLU, the Sierra Club, a leading environmental organization, moved swiftly to feature Trump in its fundraising appeals. It depicted him as an \"outlier\" who denies the dangers of climate change and would dismantle environmental protection regulations. \n The Sierra Club said it had registered 9,000 new monthly donors since the election \u2014 more than it had added from Jan. 1 until Election Day. \n \"We don't feel helpless at all,\" said Debbie Sease, the organization's national campaigns director. \n Other organizations reporting major increases in support included the NAACP, the National Immigration Law Center, and major LGBT-rights organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign and Lambda Legal. Lambda Legal said it received support from more than 1,000 first-time donors in the four days following the election. \n The Anti-Defamation League, which combats anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, said donations surged 50-fold the day after the election, and some major donors made new, six-figure commitments. Spokesman Todd Gutnick said many of the donors urged the ADL to intensify efforts to combat online hate speech. \n Some advocacy groups on the conservative side of the political spectrum also reported a post-election boost in support. \n Californians for Population Stabilization, which seeks to curtail immigration, said online donations have increased fourfold since Trump's victory. \n The group's executive director, Jo Wideman, said in an email that supporters \"are very excited that someone finally gets the implications of over-immigration's effects on population growth.\" \n The Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group which organized door-to-door canvassing on Trump's behalf, reported a similar response. \n \"Our supporters are calling us to reserve tables at our annual fundraising gala,\" said spokeswoman Mallory Quigley. \"We've had a huge increase in the number of calls and emails simply expressing thanks and support.\" \n Another beneficiary of the election results is ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit news organization that produces investigative public-interest journalism. \n Richard Tofel, ProPublica's president and founding general manager, said online donations increased sharply the day after the election, and then skyrocketed after John Oliver \u2014 on Sunday's edition of his HBO show \"Last Week Tonight\" \u2014 urged viewers to support \"actual journalism\" produced by ProPublica and other outlets. \n Tofel said it's too early to calculate the total amount of the new financial infusion, but he said more than $100,000 had been received since the election via credit-card holders donating online \u2014 compared to $300,000 received in that fashion for the entire previous year. \n \"There are a lot of people who, in response to the election, feel that they need to take some sort of civic action,\" Tofel said. \"One thing they can do is contribute to causes they think will advance their view of a healthy democracy.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow David Crary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/CraryAP \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "ACLU, other groups report post-election surge of donations"}

{"date": "November 15, 2016", "text": "DENNIS ODA/ SEPT. 22, 2015 \n City crews cleared out tents, personal items and debris left over and abandoned from the homeless encampment near the UH Medical School in Kakaako after a homeless sweep on Sept. 22, 2015. \n Cities across the country are enacting more bans on living in vehicles, camping in public and panhandling, despite federal efforts to discourage such laws amid a shortage of affordable housing, a new report said. \n Denver, which ordered about 150 homeless people living on sidewalks to clear out their belongings today, was among four cities criticized for policies criminalizing homelessness in a report by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, an advocacy group aiming to prevent people from losing their homes. \n The other cities listed in its \"hall of shame\" are in Honolulu, Dallas and Puyallup, Wash. \n People in Denver chanted, \"No handcuffs. Give us homes,\" as they packed up their belongings when police arrived. As they piled shopping carts high, a jumble of items cluttered the area: a banana, a paperback copy of Shakespeare and a pair of construction boots. \n Many cities with increasing home prices have been struggling with homelessness, including Denver and Honolulu, which were reprimanded for an anti-camping law and ban on sitting or lying on sidewalks, respectfully. \n \"These laws are unconstitutional and bad public policy,\" Maria Foscarinis, the center's executive director, said in a phone call with reporters. \"Homelessness remains a national crisis across the country. It's fueled by the growing lack of affordable housing and the shrinking safety net.\" \n The report, which was based on a review of policies enacted by 187 cities over a decade, said bans on living in vehicles increased by 143 percent. Those laws can be particularly devastating because they often lead to vehicle impoundment, and people can lose all of their belongings, disrupting their ability to work or attend school, Foscarinis said. \n In Denver, authorities had given notice that homeless people had to move their things. While some packed up and left, others resisted, so the city gave them more time, said Julie Smith, a spokeswoman for the human services department. She said the city wants to help them go to shelters and get other services. \n Bennie Henley, an Army veteran who moved to Denver two weeks ago from Kansas to get treatment at the Veterans Administration hospital, said he prefers sleeping on an advertising banner rolled out on the sidewalk rather than in a shelter. He showed a rash on his arm that he thinks came from bedbugs in a shelter. \n \"I don't like being crowded up like that,\" said Henley, sitting on a swivel office chair on the sidewalk and leaning on a cane. \n The report said Denver forces thousands of people to dismantle camps despite a waiting list for subsidized housing. \n City spokeswoman Amber Miller called the report's findings inaccurate, saying the center relied on local advocacy groups with incorrect information. She said Denver's priority is helping people find assistance. \n \"We have increased outreach workers and paired them with police patrols, expanded day and night shelter, created 250 units of permanent supportive housing and launched a day work program,\" Miller said in a statement. \n Honolulu was criticized for what the report called aggressive enforcement of its sit-lie ban. The group said the city has issued more than 16,000 warnings to people violating the ban since it was enacted in Waikiki in 2014. \n But Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell's spokesman Jesse Broder Van Dyke said the report fails to mention that since the sit-lie law took effect in September of 2014, officers have issued 21,630 warnings and made only 27 arrests after a public education and warning period. \n He also said over the last two years Honolulu has helped house more than 1,000 people who were experiencing homelessness, including over 860 veterans. \n The report also targeted Dallas and Puyallup. Dallas was criticized for issuing thousands of citations for sleeping in public, and Puyallup, for making it illegal to camp, panhandle or sit and lie down in parts of the city, despite lacking adequate space in an emergency shelter. \n Officials from those two cities didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. \n The report called several such policies unconstitutional. The group said panhandling is protected by free-speech rights and preventing sleeping in public could be considered cruel and unusual punishment. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Report faults Honolulu for criminalizing homelessness"}

{"date": "November 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte listens to a question from reporters at Manila's International Airport, Philippines on Nov. 9. \n Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte may share Donald Trump's disruptive tactics and strongman style, but that doesn't mean the two are about to form a lasting bond. \n The Philippine leader has appeared to enjoy being compared to the U.S. President-elect and was dubbed the \"Trump of Asia\" on the campaign trail. Both have a tendency to blow up at reporters over questions about their policies, and have made lewd remarks about women. \n Both also came to power with populist policies on a wave of frustration with established political parties and a sense that life for ordinary people had gotten worse amid widening income inequality, a struggle for jobs, and rising crime. \n Still, there are areas of conflict. If Trump follows through on some of his campaign promises it could potentially damage the Philippine economy. And Duterte, who was mayor of the city of Davao for decades before he ran for the presidency, has made clear he intends to continue his efforts to limit his country's economic and military reliance on the U.S., opening up a greater role for China. \n \"They seem to have the same frame of mind,\" said Lauro Baja, a former Foreign Affairs undersecretary who served as the Philippine permanent representative to the United Nations under ex-President Gloria Arroyo, speaking of the two leaders. \"But again, it will depend on whether President Trump is going to be the same as candidate Trump.\" \n A Trump administration curb on foreign workers could hit remittances from Filipinos in the U.S., while efforts to limit U.S. businesses from exporting jobs might affect another Philippines growth industry in call centers and other forms of business process outsourcing. A U.S. show of force in the South China Sea dictated by a hawkish Secretary of State could complicate Duterte's attempt to hose down tensions over the disputed waters with China. \n While Duterte's predecessor Benigno Aquino strengthened defense ties with the U.S. and opposed China's expansion in the South China Sea, Duterte has openly courted China with a state visit to Beijing that reaped investment promises worth $24 billion. \n Duterte has also downplayed a July court ruling rebuffing China's claims to more than 80 percent of the South China Sea, emphasizing his willingness to resume direct talks over the issue. At the same time he has distanced the Philippines from the U.S., telling President Barack Obama to \"go to hell\" and vowing to limit joint military exercises. \n The U.S., which governed the Philippines for decades from the late 19th century, has been a longstanding military ally. \n \"Duterte's efforts not to start off on the wrong foot will be welcomed, as the risks associated with a Trump presidency are stark for the Philippines,\" said Eufracia Taylor, Asia analyst at risk advisory company Verisk Maplecroft. \"If Trump chooses to make bilateral trade difficult for the Philippines, it will certainly hit the economy as well as the public's broadly pro-U.S. sentiment.\" \n \"I don't want to fight anymore because Trump is there,\" Duterte told hundreds of cheering Filipinos during a state visit to Malaysia last week. \"Long live\" Trump, Duterte said. \n In a congratulatory message to Trump sent by Communications Secretary Martin Andanar, Duterte said he looked forward to working with the incoming administration \"for enhanced Philippines-U.S. relations anchored on mutual respect, mutual benefit and shared commitment to democratic ideals and the rule of law.\" \n Days before the U.S. elections, Duterte appointed a Trump associate \u2014 Jose E.B. Antonio \u2014 as special envoy to America. Antonio is chairman and chief executive officer of Century Properties Group, which built the Trump Tower Manila under a licensing agreement. Shares in the company climbed to their highest-level in a year following Trump's election win. \n At the same time, Duterte's Economic Secretary Ernesto Pernia said the president's recent pivot to China had been based on his assumption that Trump would win. \"Instead of depending on the U.S. to a great extent, we are now diversifying our friendship, so you don't crash when the country you depend on is in trouble,\" he said. \n \"Some fears are founded on Donald Trump's pronouncements during the campaign period about his stance that he will protect American jobs and doing away with outsourcing is something he'd like to introduce,\" said Julius Guevara, director for valuation and advisory at Colliers International in Manila. \n \"Some fears are founded on Donald Trump's pronouncements during the campaign period about his stance that he will protect American jobs and doing away with outsourcing is something he'd like to introduce.\" \n In the end, the Philippines will have to make some adjustments on its economic, security and diplomatic strategies if Trump sticks to his campaign pledges, said former ambassador Baja. If Trump pulls back from the U.S. navy presence in the South China Sea it could mean Duterte loses one chip in any negotiations with China, he said. \n \"Whether we like it or not, we can only be as aggressive and assertive in pursuing what we got from the arbitral panel if we have somebody big behind us.\" \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "Trump-Duterte bromance no slam dunk as Manila warms to China"}

It also brought down rocks and mud that swept across highways and cracked apart roads. \n The defense force said it had started ferrying people out by military helicopter and that a navy ship from Auckland was due to arrive in the area Wednesday morning. \n Home to about 2,000 residents, Kaikoura is a popular destination for travelers taking part in whale-watching expeditions or wanting a stopover with mountain views. But the quake knocked out water supplies and sewer systems and left people with no easy way out. \n \"From all directions, Kaikoura has essentially been isolated,\" Air Commodore Darryn Webb, acting commander of New Zealand's Joint Forces, told The Associated Press. \"There's a real imperative to support the town because it can't support itself.\" \n Webb said the military was using four NH90 helicopters that could each transport about 18 people at a time out of the town. He said the navy ship could pick up hundreds of people if weather conditions allowed. \n \"We're going to get as many people and belongings out as quickly as we can,\" Webb said. \n He said the operation could take several days. \n Air Force Wing Commander Scott McKenzie said in a statement that military personnel were delivering food, water, diesel fuel and other basic necessities by helicopter. Authorities have prepared about 5 metric tons (5.5 tons) of supplies in the city of Christchurch. \n Sarah Stuart-Black, director of the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, said the priority was transporting out those people with health issues or bookings on international flights. \n She said the community was rallying to help the tourists. \n \"It's fantastic that some of the locals in Kaikoura have taken in tourists into their own homes,\" she said. \n In Wellington, Brendan Nally, the regional commander for the New Zealand Fire Service, said engineers were completing an inspection of the nine-story downtown office building on Tuesday when they found that a major vertical beam had failed above the fifth floor. \n \"It looks somewhat like a broken bone in the leg. It's fractured through,\" Nally said. \"So the building is at significant risk of collapse.\" \n Nally said the building was being renovated and was empty when the quake struck. \n He said the buildings evacuated included the national headquarters for the Red Cross, the Thai Embassy, the headquarters for New Zealand Rugby and an Anglican cathedral. \n Elsewhere in the capital, many people returned to work after the quake shut down much of the city's center on Monday. But some buildings remained closed, and heavy rain and flooding compounded the difficulties. \n Strong aftershocks continued to shake New Zealand, rattling the nerves of exhausted residents. \n Police said one person died from the quake in Kaikoura and another in Mt. Lyford, a nearby ski resort. Several other people suffered minor injuries in Kaikoura. \n Prime Minister John Key flew over Kaikoura by helicopter Monday as aftershocks kicked up dust from the landslides below. Cars could be seen lying on their sides and parts of the road were clearly impassable. \n \"It's just utter devastation,\" Key said. \n Three cows whose predicament captured the interest of people around the world after they became stranded on a small island of grass in an area ripped apart by the quake were rescued. The Newshub news service reported that a farmer and some helpers dug a track to them and brought them out. \n New Zealand, a country of 4.7 million, sits on the \"Ring of Fire,\" an arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where earthquakes are common. An earthquake in Christchurch five years ago killed 185 people and destroyed thousands of homes and other buildings. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Kristen Gelineau in Sydney contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. warship diverts to help New Zealand quake evacuation"}

{"date": "November 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Oct. 11, 2016 file photo, provided by the Syrian Civil Defense group known as the White Helmets, residents sit in rubble in rebel-held eastern Aleppo, Syria. \n BEIRUT >> Russia launched new strikes in Syria today involving carrier-borne jets and long-range missiles as opposition activists on the ground reported that the first airstrikes in nearly a month struck the besieged, rebel-held parts of the northern Syrian city of Aleppo. \n According to activists, between four and 10 people were killed in the strikes on Aleppo, raising concerns of a return to daily deadly bombardment in Syria's largest city. \n The Russian blitz began hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump discussed Syria over the phone and agreed on the need to combine efforts in the fight against what the Kremlin called their No. 1 enemy \u2014 \"international terrorism and extremism.\" \n The Obama administration has been trying for months to negotiate a cease-fire in Aleppo, a city that has become the epicenter of the war between President Bashar Assad and rebels fighting to topple him, some of whom receive U.S. aid. From the militants' side, al-Qaida's Syrian affiliate is fighting alongside the rebels, but the Islamic State group has no presence in Aleppo city. \n Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to Putin that Su-33 jets from the aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov are involved in the operation, marking its combat debut. \n \"We launched a major operation to strike the positions of the Islamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra in the provinces of Idlib and Homs,\" Shoigu said at a meeting with Putin, referring to the al-Qaida's branch in Syria by its old name. He said the Russian strikes are targeting ammunition depots, training camps and armaments factories. \n As part of the Russian operation, a navy frigate launched long-range Kalibr cruise missiles and the military also used Bastion missiles stationed in Syria to strike militant targets in the rebel-held northern province of Idlib and the central province of Homs. Shoigu said that before launching the strikes, the military intelligence had thoroughly identified and selected targets, including factories producing toxic chemical agents. \n \"It's a well-developed, industrial-scale production,\" he said, adding that the strikes will continue. He did not mention Aleppo. \n Meanwhile, Syrian activists reported strikes in all three places \u2014 Idlib, Homs and Aleppo. \n The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said missiles fired from Russian warships in the Mediterranean struck areas in Aleppo province and on the eastern edge of nearby Idlib. The Observatory's chief, Rami Abdurrahman, said the areas hit with missiles are strongholds of jihadi groups, including the al-Qaida affiliate known as Fatah al-Sham Front. \n The Observatory and other groups said airstrikes also struck at least eight neighborhoods in Aleppo city, killing at least 10 people. The Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, said the airstrikes on Aleppo killed four and wounded others. \n Ibrahim al-Haj, of the Syrian Civil Defense, said that by late afternoon his group had counted 72 air raids in nine different neighborhood of eastern Aleppo. He said four people were killed and 32 were wounded in attacks that mostly hit residential areas in the besieged city. \n Sounds of warplanes flying at low altitude could be clearly heard over the phone. \n Russian Defense Ministry Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov insisted that the Russian military did not strike any targets in the city of Aleppo, adding that Russian and Syrian warplanes have not conducted any raids on the city for four weeks. \n Activist Baraa al-Halaby, who is based in eastern Aleppo, said via text messages that warplanes are firing missiles and helicopters are dropping barrel bombs on the eastern part of the city. \n \"People are scared. The bombardment is intense,\" al-Halaby wrote. \n A reporter for Syrian state TV, speaking from the government-held western part of the city, said troops are preparing to attack eastern Aleppo from nine directions. \n Four weeks ago, Russia said it would halt weeks of deadly airstrikes to allow rebels and supporters to leave eastern Aleppo. The rebels refused to take up the offer and the United Nations failed to negotiate the delivery of aid into the besieged area. \n The Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen TV aired live footage from Aleppo, showing smoke billowing from eastern parts of the city, contested since 2012. \n On Saturday, Syrian government troops repelled a rebel offensive on the western parts of Aleppo designed to break the siege on the opposition-held east. The government siege has left an estimated 275,000 people trapped, with no aid allowed in since July, amid a punishing bombing campaign. \n In the lead-up to the offensive, which was formally declared by the Russian defense ministry on Tuesday, a number of airstrikes targeted at least three field hospitals in rural western Aleppo province, putting them out of order, the Observatory and Thiqa news agency reported. \n Syrian and Russian governments deny attacking hospitals. The U.N. rights agency, UNICEF and other U.N. agencies have repeatedly condemned airstrikes on hospitals and medical facilities. \n Konashenkov, the defense ministry official, rejected the claims that Russian warplanes had bombed hospitals in Aleppo province as \"outright lies.\" \n Since Syria's conflict started in 2011, the U.S.-based Physicians for Human Rights recorded 382 attacks on medical facilities and hospitals throughout Syria. Of those, 293 were carried out by government forces and 16 were by Russian warplanes, it said. \n In the northwestern province of Idlib, a member of the extremist Jund al-Aqsa group known as Abu-Dardaa-al-Shami told The Associated Press over the telephone that the airstrikes are \"much, much, much more intense than previous ones.\" He added that in addition to the air raids, ballistic missiles hit the province near the town of Saraqeb. \n In Geneva, meanwhile, two U.N. agencies said food production in Syria has shrunk to \"an all-time low,\" threatening to drive more people from their homes after 5-1/2 years of war. \n The World Food Program and the Food and Agricultural Organization said factors like rising prices, poor weather, general instability and the lack of fertilizer and seeds could force some farmers to stop producing. A joint report released Tuesday says the planting area in the 2015-2016 season was the smallest ever in zones controlled by the government, ethnic Kurds and the armed opposition. WFP spokeswoman Bettina Luescher said information was lacking about areas controlled by IS. \n FAO regional representative Abdessalam Ould Ahmed said 80 percent of households in Syria lack food or money to buy it. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Russia launches offensive in Syria, airstrikes hit Aleppo"}
