{"date": "November 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Kelly Mazzei, revenue audit supervisor for the state of Alaska tax division, posing with a deposit safe intended for marijuana businesses to pay their taxes in cash. \n ANCHORAGE, Alaska >> With legal marijuana sales underway in Alaska, growers will soon be submitting their first tax payments to the state. \n For most businesses, that wouldn't be a problem: They'd just cut a check. But some banks are leery about dealing with pot businesses since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. And that means, at least initially, Alaska's legal cannabis businesses could have to make their tax payments to the state by dropping off or mailing bundles of cash. \n HOW IT WILL WORK \n The Department of Revenue has set up a deposit safe in downtown Anchorage, Alaska's only in-person drop site for cash, in a state office where people pay child support and can sign up for Alaska's yearly oil wealth fund check. Businesses given a key to access the drop site will place tamper-resistant bags into a tray and close a cover. The bags will then drop into a drum and down a chute to a safe. \n The state also is offering a by-mail option, where cannabis cultivators can send cash payments via registered mail and have them picked up and brought to the state by an armed carrier. They also can pay electronically or by wire transfer, said Brandon Spanos, deputy director of the Revenue Department's tax division. \n WHO PAYS THE TAX \n Growers are required to pay taxes on sales and transfers of marijuana \u2014 $50 an ounce for buds and flowers and $15 an ounce for other parts of the plant. \n It's 320 miles roundtrip from Leif Abel's family growing operation in the tiny town of Kasilof to Anchorage. Abel, a co-owner of Greatland Ganja LLC, said the business already has to get product to retail customers around the state and take samples of its products to an Anchorage lab for testing. \n \"So you can imagine that one more stop on the way is really not that big of a deal,\" said Abel, who is also on the board of the Alaska Marijuana Industry Association. He said he just has to make sure trips are as efficient as possible. \n NEW TAX STRUCTURE \n Alaska's first cannabis stores opened last month after the launch of the state's first testing lab. This month will be the first month in which the state begins receiving marijuana tax revenue. \n It's too early to say how much the pot tax might generate, Spanos said. Legislation passed earlier this year calls for half of marijuana revenue collected in Alaska to go into a fund that can be used for programs intended to curb recidivism. The rest would go to the state general fund and could be used for anything. \n Other states with legal recreational pot also have special security measures in place for cash tax payments. In Oregon, revenue officials transformed a small space at their headquarters into a mini-fortress for dropping off, counting and transporting cash to the bank. To discourage continued use of cash amid security concerns and as banks and credit unions began working with businesses, Washington state earlier this year instituted a penalty for those choosing to pay in cash. \n Taxes paid or owed in Washington since July top $110 million, according to that state's Liquor and Cannabis Board. \n INDUSTRY CHALLENGES \n Some banks and credit unions do business with pot proprietors in other states with legalized recreational pot. But Cary Carrigan, the Alaska Marijuana Industry Association's executive director, thinks it will be an all-cash business in Alaska for now. He cited skittishness among the state's bankers. \n Washington has posted sales and compliance information for marijuana businesses online to help make it easier for banks to suss out any problems. Most businesses there now pay in some form other than cash, said Brian Smith, a spokesman for that state's Liquor and Cannabis Board. \n Oregon lawmakers have cleared the way for regulators to share certain data with banks interested in working with the industry to help prove businesses are authorized to operate there, said Mark Pettinger, a spokesman for the Oregon Liquor Control Commission who handles marijuana questions. \n DICEY SITUATION \n In states where pot has been legalized, many businesses have been able to get some kind of banking services, sometimes working with a small local institution or getting an account under a personal name or a business name that doesn't immediately signal it's a marijuana business, said Taylor West, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association. But she said banking remains a \"dicey\" prospect, and some who have gotten accounts worry about being able to maintain them. \n Resolving the banking issue is important because operating with only cash presents security concerns, she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Next milestone for Alaska's young pot industry: paying taxes"}

{"date": "November 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A wildfire burns as it approaches Bat Cave, N.C. Thick smoke has settled over a wide area of the southern Appalachians, where dozens of uncontrolled wildfires are burning through decades of leaf litter, and people breathe in tiny bits of the forest with every gulp of air. \n TIGER, Ga. >> Thick smoke has settled over a wide area of the southern Appalachians, where dozens of uncontrolled wildfires are burning through decades of leaf litter, and people breathe in tiny bits of the forest with every gulp of air. \n It's a constant reminder of the threat to many small mountain communities, where relentless drought and now persistent fires and smoke have people under duress. \n \"A lot of the ladies just went to tears and said this happens in other places, it doesn't happen here,\" pastor Scott Cates said as townspeople donated water, cough drops and other supplies for the firefighters at the Liberty Baptist Church in Tiger, Georgia. \n Here, these fires don't sleep. They burn through the night, through the now-desiccated tinder of deciduous forests accustomed to wet, humid summers and autumns. \n \"It doesn't die down after dark,\" says fire Capt. Ron Thalacker, who came from Carlsbad, New Mexico, with a fire engine that now draws water from streams and ponds to spray on hotspots in Georgia's Rabun County, near the epicenter of the southern fires. \n Large, wind-driven fires that scorch pine forests in the West often burn in the tree tops and mellow out at night, but these fires are clinging to the ground and actively burning 24 hours a day, said firefighter Chad Cullum of Billings, Montana. \n Cullum spoke briefly, as flames rolled down a mountainside behind him. Then he ordered everyone to get out. \"We need to leave,\" he said sternly, ushering people to move down a rocky dirt road. \n More than 5,000 firefighters and support personnel, including many veterans of wildfires in the arid West, and 24 helicopters are battling blazes in the fire zone, which has spread from northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee into eastern Kentucky, the western Carolinas and parts of surrounding states. \n Nationally, \"there's a pretty good ability to help out the South right now,\" said Jennifer Jones, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Forest Service. Reinforcements have arrived from at least 37 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, she said this week. \n One man died Wednesday on eastern Kentucky's Mountain Parkway, where smoke decreased visibility. Kentucky State Police said about 14 others were injured in a series of wrecks on both sides of the road. \n Trooper Scott Ferrell said a coal truck driver died when he got out of his truck to check on a driver whose vehicle had hit the truck and then was hit by a third vehicle. About 15 vehicles were involved in the chain reaction collisions that closed the highway for nearly 10 hours, Ferrell said. \n More than 30 large fires remain uncontained, and overall, a total of 128,000 acres has burned, or about nine times the size of Manhattan. \n Firefighters got a lucky break when a fire reversed direction, turning away from the Trail of Tears, which marks the route where the Cherokee and other Indians were forcibly removed from their lands in the 1800s. In national forests, following procedures approved by the tribes, heavy equipment isn't allowed within 750 feet of the trail bed unless life or property is threatened, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Terry McDonald said. \n Tim Free, a lifelong resident of Rabun County, broke down with emotion as he described how elderly neighbors are struggling with relentless smoke, so thick it blocks the sun. \"What we're fortunate to have here is people who care about people,\" he said. \n Volunteers gather each day at Liberty Baptist to assemble \"care kits\" for the firefighters; more than 1,800 have been delivered so far. Local schoolchildren write letters of encouragement, which are tucked inside. \n As several women assembled care packages Tuesday, Brittany Keener said \"we really need lubricating eye drops!\" \n Anyone living through this smoke needs them, but particularly people working to contain the blazes in the forests, where Keener said a burning ember fell into one firefighter's eye. \n \"Anybody that's outside of their homes is going to have to have something that will basically lubricate their throats \u2014 cough drops, lozenges or even a stick of peppermint,\" Free said. \"Just to get a little lubricant in your eyes is something that's needed daily because of the smoke.\" \n Just across the state line in North Carolina, three firefighters were battling the Party Rock fire near the town of Lake Lure after driving 23 hours from Albuquerque, New Mexico. \n \"There was a request for help. We have units available to assist,\" Edward Nieto said. \n There hasn't been a fire in the Lake Lure area in a long time, so the forest floor is thick with flammable material, and falling autumn leaves are encouraging the flames to spread, said Victoria Tillotson, a spokeswoman with the North Carolina Forest Service. \n A total of 850 people were fighting the Party Rock blaze, which grew to more than 5,700 acres on Tuesday and was still just 19 percent contained, she said. \n Randle Montgomery recalled watching television coverage of wildfires in California and considering himself lucky. He never expected a 4,500-acre blaze to threaten Lake Lure, where he works, and Black Mountain, where he's lived for 16 years. \n \"The way this thing takes off, they'll get it contained, and it just depends on the wind, but it's turned so many times on us,\" said Montgomery, 47. \"And it's got everybody pretty much on edge.\" \n Tom Stokesberry, an emergency medical technician from Six Rivers National Forest in California, arrived in Georgia's Rabun County on Veterans Day. \n \"The goal is to keep this line intact,\" Stokesberry said, pointing to a narrow, winding dirt road between a burning mountainside and a pasture that, so far, has been untouched by the fire. Just beyond it is a farmhouse. It wasn't clear whether the property had been evacuated. \n Burning trees falling across creeks and roads are an ever-present threat. \"A tree drops across the creek and now you've got fire on the other side,\" Thalacker explains. \n The smoke is hiding the sun in town, but out at the fire's edge, it appears blood red. \n \"We call that the red eye of the dragon,\" Cullum says. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Relentless smoke spreads fear at edge of southern wildfires"}

I know that over the past week a lot of people have asked themselves whether America is the country we thought it was,\" Clinton said at the annual gala of the Children's Defense Fund, the child advocacy organization where she started her legal career. \"But please listen to me when I say this: America is worth it.\" \n She added: \"It's up to each and every one of us to keep working to make America better and stronger and fairer.\" \n Clinton never cited the president-elect by name in her remarks, making only an oblique reference to the controversial policies that fueled his rise to the White House. \n Instead, she focused on the future, asking her backers to \"stay engaged on every level.\" \n \"We need you. America needs your energy,\" she said. \n Clinton's surprising loss threw her party into a period of intense soul-searching, with an ascendant liberal wing blaming Clinton's campaign for failing to embrace a more populist economic message. In private calls with donors and Democratic officials, Clinton has largely attributed her defeat to the decision by the FBI to reexamine her use of a private server as secretary of state. \n In her remarks, Clinton offered no accounting for any failures she may have made during her presidential campaign, though she admitted that the past week hasn't been easy. \n \"There have been a few times this past week when all I wanted to do was just to curl up with a good book or our dogs and never leave the house again,\" she ruefully admitted. \n She chose friendly ground to make her first public appearance since her emotional concession speech in New York City last Wednesday. Her first job out of law school in the 1970s was for Children's Defense Fund founder Marian Wright Edelman. She later became a staff attorney and chairman of the group's board. \n Throughout her campaign, she cited her work for the group as her \"north star,\" sparking her interest in standing up against injustice toward children and families. \n The group, which helps disadvantaged children, tried to return some of the affection on Wednesday night. \n \"We love her and we appreciate all the hard work she has done and say it's not going to be for naught,\" said Edelman, in her introductory remarks. \"We're going to say that she is the people's president.\" \n Still, in a sign of Clinton's new life as a private citizen, the event lacked many of the trappings of her presidential campaign.

{"date": "November 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Vice President Joe Biden shakes hands with Vice President-elect Mike Pence after they had lunch at the Vice President's residence, the Naval Observatory, in Washington, Wednesday. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani arrives at Trump Tower, Wednesday. \n NEW YORK >> President-elect Donald Trump and his team are battling back against charges of chaos and infighting as they race to set up an administration. The incoming Republican administration got an unlikely boost from outgoing Vice President Joe Biden, who said that \"no administration is ready on Day One.\" \n Trump stayed out of the public eye Wednesday, meeting with a stream of visitors at his New York skyscraper. But he took to Twitter to dispute reports of internal tension, declaring the transition operation was proceeding \"so smoothly.\" \n Trump's team said Wednesday night that it would be rolling out teams to interact with federal agencies during the transition, starting with national security advisers who would work with officials at the State, Justice, Defense and other national security departments. \n They also said transition and administration officials would be required to sever lobbying ties and pledge that they will not lobby the government for five years after departing the Trump administration. \n Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Thursday she expects initial announcements of Cabinet choices to come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program, \"It's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\" \n Trump's team was essentially starting its transition planning from scratch after scrapping much of the preliminary work New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie conducted during the campaign. After winning the election, Trump demoted Christie and put Vice President-elect Mike Pence in charge. \n The result has been a series of new additions to the transition team and several departures, mainly among those aligned with Christie. \n Pence met Wednesday with Biden at the Naval Observatory, the vice presidential residence in leafy northwest Washington, D.C. Biden expressed confidence that by Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, \"everything will be in good hands.\" \n Trump planned to meet Thursday in New York with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first get-together with a world leader as president-elect. The State Department has said it had yet to hear from Trump's transition team, raising the prospect of the Republican holding the meeting without any input from career diplomats with deep experience dealing with Japan. \n Trump also plans to meet Thursday with an assortment of GOP officials, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling. \n Trump aides and allies suggested some of the commotion within the transition team was to be expected given the enormous task at hand. \n \"The beginning of any transition like this has turmoil because it's just the nature of the process,\" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said as he left Trump's transition headquarters in Washington. He said the picture of Trump's administration would become clearer over the next two or three weeks. \n Former Michigan Rep. Pete Hoekstra, who has informally advised members of Trump's national security team, blamed Trump's detractors for the reports of drama. \n \"When you're doing a transition that is trying to push the kind of change that Mr. Trump wants to be doing, it's going to be even harder,\" Hoekstra, a former House Intelligence Committee chairman, said. \n But others close to the transition process described advisers \"fighting for power.\" Trump has long stoked internal rivalries among his staff \u2014 both in his businesses and his campaign \u2014 and has created ambiguity in his transition about who has authority to make key decisions. \n Eric Trump, the president-elect's son, raised expectations of imminent progress Wednesday, telling reporters in the morning that appointments were \"likely\" to come during the day. Then, other Trump aides suggested a slower pace. \n \"We're not going to rush to put names forward until we're absolutely sure,\" Trump spokesman Jason Miller said hours later. \"We're going to make sure that they're people we're confident will pass confirmation and we think can implement the president-elect's vision.\" \n Trump's team noted that President Barack Obama waited until a few weeks after the 2008 election to announce many of his Cabinet appointments. \n Trump appeared to be weighing an eclectic mix of individuals for top Cabinet posts, including longtime loyalists, former rivals and even a Democrat. Transition officials said Trump met Wednesday with Eva Moskowitz, a former New York councilwoman and charter school founder who is being considered for education secretary. \n Other meetings included Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., a potential pick for Health and Human Services, Ray Washburne, a Dallas businessman and top GOP fundraiser in the mix for Commerce secretary, and Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan. New England Patriots' owner Robert Kraft and New York Jets owner Woody Johnson were also spotted near the lobby's gilded elevators during the day. \n Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who spent two hours at Trump Tower on Wednesday, has been angling for secretary of state, though his consulting work for foreign governments has emerged as a potential roadblock. Trump is also said to be seriously considering John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, for the top diplomatic job. \n Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who tangled ferociously with Trump during the Republican primary but ultimately endorsed the businessman, could get a top job such as attorney general. An official said, however, he is not viewed as a top contender. The official, like others, wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the transition talks and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n Trump aides have released few details about the president-elect's schedule or phone calls since the election. They tried to play catch-up Wednesday, releasing a list of 29 world leaders who have spoken with Trump or Pence in recent days. Most of the calls had previously only been confirmed by those leaders' governments. \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "Trump battles back against charges of transition tumult"}

{"date": "November 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called \"alt-right\" in an apparent purge. \n NEW YORK >> Twitter has suspended the accounts of several prominent members of the so-called \"alt-right\" in an apparent crack down on accounts tied to hate speech or threats of violence. \n Twitter declined comment, but noted that its policies forbid violent threats, hate speech or harassment and promise to take action against violators. The company also announced Tuesday that it was expanding ways for users to report harassment and curb the amount of abuse they see, a reaction to a growing problem of abuse, bullying and harassment on the internet. \n The alt-right, short for \"alternative right,\" is a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. It's often associated with far right efforts to preserve \"white identity,\" oppose multiculturalism and defend \"Western values.\" \n The movement drew national attention during the presidential campaign, especially after Stephen Bannon of the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform, joined Donald Trump's campaign. Trump recently named Bannon as the White House chief strategist. \n Richard Spencer, head of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist think tank, said in an interview that his personal Twitter account and accounts for the institute and his magazine were all suspended this week without notification. \n Spencer, who is credited with popularizing the term \"alt-right,\" says he has never called for violence and hasn't tweeted anything recently that might provoke a suspension. He called the suspensions a coordinated attack against users with certain viewpoints. \n While he acknowledged that Twitter is a company and has a right to do as it pleases, he says it also needs to accept that it has evolved into something bigger and needs to act accordingly. \n \"This is 2016 and we live in a digital world,\" he said. \"Twitter is how the president releases press releases and it's also how teenage girls talk about Justin Bieber. \n \"Twitter is not just some website. It's a public space and we have to treat it that way.\" \n Pax Dickinson, who was ousted as chief technology officer of the website Business Insider in 2013 for sending offensive tweets, says he also wasn't given a reason for his Twitter suspension. But he says it likely stemmed from a tweet he sent director Joss Whedon that included an anti-gay slur. \n Dickinson says he's appealed the suspension, but has yet to hear back from Twitter. Spencer says he doesn't plan on coming back to Twitter unless he gets an apology. \n The Twitter accounts of alt-right personalities Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also were suspended as of Wednesday. Paul Town was also banned, although he said in an email to The Associated Press that his Twitter feed is a \"combination of satire and performance art\" that has been misconstrued as alt-right. \n Online harassment has long been a problem for the internet. But because Twitter allows most conversations to play out in public and allows for relative anonymity, it has been especially visible there. And it's especially challenging because Twitter harassment often resembles online mob action, with numerous pseudonymous accounts ganging up to tweet vile messages at particular individuals. \n Actress Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter in July after dealing with racial slurs, obscene photos and comments about her appearance. She called on the social networking service to do more to curb harassment on the platform. \n Twitter ultimately banned several users, including conservative provocateur and Breitbart technology editor Milo Yiannopoulos. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Twitter suspends several alt-right accounts"}

She called concerns about Bannon \"very unfair.\" \n If history is any guide, Bannon won't be putting those fears to rest anytime soon. As a conservative media brawler who became Trump's campaign chief executive, Bannon has discarded norms for discussing race, gender and religion, often framing even abstract political fights in deliberately inflammatory terms. \n \"What we need to do is bitch-slap the Republican Party,\" Bannon said in a 2010 radio interview. \n For a man aggrieved with elite educational, business and media institutions, Bannon has risen to the top of some of them. Born into a Norfolk, Virginia, family of Catholic Democrats, Bannon served in the U.S. Navy before attending Harvard Business School. Afterward, he went to Goldman Sachs, leaving to start his own media-focused boutique investment banking firm. After selling the business to French banking giant Societe Generale, he became a film producer. \n Though he created successful Hollywood films, the groundwork for his future career in politics came from a Reagan biopic, \"In the Face of Evil,\" which introduced him to conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart and author Peter Schweizer. \n After Breitbart died unexpectedly in 2012, Bannon took the helm of a relaunch of his news site. Breitbart grew quickly, from 12 million monthly page views to more than 192 million by August of this year, according to the site. \n During the Republican Convention, Bannon said Breitbart was \"the platform for the alt-right,\" a loose group espousing a provocative and reactionary strain of conservatism. Heavily influenced by the shock-based rhetoric of internet chat boards, the alt-right includes strains of white nationalism and aggressive anti-feminism. \n The alt-right's mainstream apologists describe those themes as a demonstration of free speech rather than a full-throated endorsement of prejudice. \n In interviews, Bannon has acknowledged that the alt-right may attract some racists, homophobes and anti-Semites, but said that he does not share those opinions \u2014 and that the left harbors undesirable elements as well. \n Yet Breitbart actively cultivates some of those themes, and Bannon has shown little patience for adjusting the site's tone to pacify critics. \n Under Bannon, Breitbart kept a running tab of news stories titled \"black crime,\" which catalogued the activities of supposed \"black rape gangs\" and \"black mobs.\" The site used a slur for transgender people in headlines and stories. And during the campaign \u2014 a period in which Bannon stepped aside from running the site \u2014 Breitbart.com sometimes went out of its way to identify Trump critics as Jews. \n \"I've known and worked with Steve Bannon, and he has traditional conservative non-racist, non-prejudiced views about the world,\" said Joel Pollak, a senior editor at large at Breitbart, who called The Associated Press in response to a request for comment from Bannon on this story. \"Lately, media conventions have determined that some of the traditional views of most of Western civilization are offensive.\" \n Bannon has publicly disavowed tolerance for prejudice. But allegations of anti-Semitism have also followed Bannon into his personal life as well. In 2007, his ex-wife alleged in court documents from their divorce that Bannon expressed open anti-Semitism, declaring that he didn't want their two daughters \"going to school with Jews.\" Bannon disputed saying this. \n In a 2011 radio interview, Bannon declared that conservative women, including Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachmann, infuriated liberals because they \"would be pro-family, they would have husbands, they would love their children.\" He contrasted that against a slur for lesbians. \n Regardless of Bannon's personal views on race and gender, he has heartily endorsed using inflammatory rhetoric to incite Breitbart's readership. In a December 2014 internal Breitbart email obtained by the Daily Beast, Bannon and an editor discussed a traditional Washington slight \u2014 the possibility that Breitbart might not have been invited to a press conference by Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. The conversation quickly spiraled into rage at the Republican political establishment. \n He compared leadership figures to women's genitalia. \"Let the grassroots turn on the hate because that's the ONLY thing that will make them do their duty.\" \n Such opinions make Bannon an odd pairing with Reince Priebus, the Republican chairman whom Trump has named his chief of staff. Senior members of Trump's camp have downplayed the prospects for conflict. \n \"When you're out there just criticizing, it's one thing,\" Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani said. \"When you actually get on the inside, there's a certain weight of responsibility to the American people that is on your shoulders. And I think Steve Bannon is the kind of guy who gets that.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump adviser known for provocation. Or is it prejudice?"}

One had blood running down the back of his shirt. \n Inside the locker room, police say, a 16-year-old straight-A student with no record of disciplinary trouble had attacked his classmates with a knife as they changed into their gym clothes. \n \"It was awful,\" said Martinez, her eyes filled with tears. \"It was so terrifying. I didn't know any of the kids but still it was like an awful feeling to see all those kids getting hurt.\" \n Police say the suspect, a sophomore in his first year at the high school after being home-schooled, also stabbed himself in the neck. He was cornered Tuesday by school workers until a police officer assigned to Mountain View High School got to the locker room and subdued him with a Taser shot. \n Authorities did not identify the suspect by name because of his age. \n The five victims are all expected to survive, hospital officials said. The two most seriously injured were in critical but stable condition, according to Utah Valley Hospital. \n The attack spread fear and panic among students who described a gruesome scene immediately after the stabbings. Police said the knife used in the attack had a 3-inch blade. \n Orem police posted a letter online they said was from the parents of the teen, apologizing. They said none of the victims had done anything to hurt their son and the stabbings were not racially or ethnically motivated. \n \"We are at a loss to express how deeply sorry we are for the pain and injury caused,\" the letter says. \n Police said it appears the victims weren't singled out for any reason other than being nearby when the attack started. \n School district spokeswoman Kimberly Bird said there were no indications the suspect was having problems or being bullied, she said. \n Investigators are talking to students who witnessed the attack and who knew the suspect as they try to determine a motive, said Gary Giles, the police chief in the city of Orem about 40 miles south of Salt Lake City where the attack happened. \n \"Is it a fight? Is it somebody who is upset with somebody? Is there more to it than that?\" Giles said. \"I don't have those answers.\" \n Student Paxton Ransom was in the locker room when it happened. He saw blood on the floor and thought it was fake until he looked around the corner and saw someone on the ground who had been stabbed. He ran away and hid with other students in the school's weight room, texting his mother \"There's been a stabbing but I'm ok.\" \n She joined hundreds of parents who rushed to the school to find out if their children were safe, letting him go back to classes after giving him a hug. \n The school, with 1,300 students, was put on lockdown after the stabbings for about an hour until police determined there was no danger for students. Some parents took their children home and others allowed them to finish the school day. \n Utah Gov. Gary Herbert's children attended the school years ago, and he tweeted, \"It's a community close to our hearts. My prayers are with the students and staff.\" \n The school plans to investigate if the suspect had had been acting in a way that should have been addressed by school officials prior to the attack, Bird said. \n The school bans weapons but doesn't have metal detectors or other security procedures to check students each day, she said. It's unlikely they'll implement any of those now, either, because they don't want to make the school feel like a prison, Bird said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Utah school still in shock after student stabs 5 classmates"}

He said the ship was due to leave Wednesday evening for a six-hour trip to a port near Christchurch. \n Webb said it had evacuated another 340 people by helicopter since Tuesday. \n Other tourists have left by chartering their own helicopters or having air transport provided by their embassy. Some have chosen to stay until an inland road reopens. \n \"I think it's gone really well,\" Webb said. \"We were fortunate to have a reasonable break in the weather today.\" \n Webb said warships from Australia, Canada and the U.S. were due to arrive soon and would help restock the town with water, fuel and other supplies as well as transport needed equipment. \n Australian honeymooners Kurt and Kailah Sapwell were among the tourists stuck in Kaikoura but they didn't seem too bothered by their ordeal. They said they had all the essentials they needed: a place to stay, food and water. \n \"It's been a shaky experience, all good though,\" Kurt Sapwell said when Prime Minister John Key paid a visit to the town. His wife added that their honeymoon had been \"memorable.\" \n Flying over a large landslide in a helicopter, Key expressed surprise at the amount of debris. \n \"Look at this road here, this is really stuffed and there's thousands of meters (yards) of it,\" Key said. \"I just don't see how you can ever repair that bit of road. The whole mountain has moved over.\" \n Home to about 2,000 residents, Kaikoura was a popular destination for travelers wanting to go on whale-watching expeditions before the quake hit. On Wednesday, Key promised business owners the government would provide financial assistance for them through what was going to be a tough summer. \n President-elect Donald Trump called Key today to pass on his sympathies over the quake. Key's office described the conversation as \"very warm and cordial.\" Trump had tried to get in touch earlier in the week but Key had missed the call in the confusion after the quake. \n Authorities also managed to clear an emergency inland road to Kaikoura, although it was only open for military vehicles. \n Neil Walker, the highways manager for the New Zealand Transport Agency, said the road remains high-risk and unsuitable for cars, although crews were working to open it to the public by the weekend. \n In the capital, Wellington, several streets remained cordoned off after engineers determined that a nine-story office building was in danger of collapsing. \n Brendan Nally, the regional commander for the New Zealand Fire Service, said engineers were completing an inspection of the building Tuesday when they found a major vertical beam had failed above the fifth floor. \n Wellington Mayor Justin Lester told the AP that the building would likely have to be demolished.

He said the wreckage was located about 1.3 miles mauka of 793 Kamehameha V Highway, about a half-mile north of Galiher's property, on a remote slope thick with foliage and inaccessible by foot. \n Maui police are coordinating recovery of the victims and the preservation of the scene for federal investigators, Taomoto said. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the crash, FAA spokesman Allen Kenitzer said. \n Galiher, described by colleagues as an experienced helicopter pilot with a second home on Molokai, and his passenger departed Honolulu Tuesday evening in a Hughes 369D helicopter and was expected to land on a private landing strip, authorities said. \n Galiher, 70, was the founder and senior partner of Galiher DeRobertis Waxman, and is known nationally for representing clients in mesothelioma cases over 35 years. Mesothelioma is an asbestos-related form of cancer. \n One of Galiher's employees called 911 about 6:55 a.m. after no one could get a hold of him this morning, and the search by MFD and the U.S. Coast Guard began, authorities said. \n The aircraft was scheduled to land at a private helipad at a residence on the eastern side of Molokai Tuesday night, authorities said. \n The Coast Guard deployed its C-130 plane, HH-65 helicopter and 87-foot cutter Kittiwake, while MFD launched its Air 1 helicopter. \n Coast Guard officials confirmed that a female passenger was aboard the helicopter, along with the pilot. \n \"My understanding is that's it's a friend of his, but I don't know,\" Ilana Waxman, managing partner at Galiher's law firm, told the Associated Press. \n \"He was an incredible person and an incredible lawyer,\" she said, calling Galiher's death a tragic loss for the Honolulu legal community.

{"date": "November 16, 2016", "text": "AP PHOTO/MARK THIESSEN \n Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley, surrounded by Alaska law enforcement officers, speaks at a news conference in Anchorage, Alaska, on Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016. Tolley said the gun used in the shooting of an officer over the weekend has been linked to five killings in Alaska's biggest city this year. \n Anchorage, Alaska \u00bb The horrific shooting of an Anchorage police officer has led to an unexpected break in a series of outdoor deaths that have gone unsolved for months and left people uneasy to use the city's extensive trail system. \n Ballistics tests matched the gun to two double homicides and a single killing last summer that helped set off fears a serial killer was roaming the Anchorage trails, picking off one or two people at a time. \n But the chance discovery \u2014 linking the weapon used in the wounding of an officer with five unsolved murders \u2014 doesn't mean the suspect killed in the police shooting committed the earlier murders or even had possession of the gun in July and August when five people were shot down in public places. \n \"What I'd be looking at is to see what the evidence is and which way that points us,\" Anchorage District Attorney Clint Campion said. \"I think the firearm is a significant lead in that direction, and there's other investigation that need to be done.\" \n The gun wasn't registered to James Dale Ritchie, Anchorage police spokeswoman Jennifer Castro said. \n \"We still have to determine who the suspect actually was in these cases. We've connected the weapon in these cases but still have work to do on the suspect(s),\" Castro wrote in an email. \n Alaska's largest city had 28 homicides this year, one short of the 1995 total, which was the deadliest in recent years. But it was the rash of nine unsolved homicides of people killed while in public places that set the city on edge, especially last summer when the weather was nice. It didn't help that police didn't release much information about the killings. \n The link to five of those murders started unlikely enough when a man skipped out on a cab fare about 4:40 a.m. Saturday in downtown Anchorage, according to police accounts released Tuesday. \n The cabbie called police, and Officer Arn Salao, a five-year patrol veteran with the Anchorage police department, responded. He saw Ritchie walking on a downtown street, and asked him to stop. Ritchie ignored him, so Salao pulled his cruiser over. \n Ritchie turned toward the officer, pulled a Colt Python .357 revolver and started shooting repeatedly. Salao either jumped or fell from his cruiser, but he drew his weapon and started firing. Another officer, Sgt. Marc Patzke, a nine-year department veteran, arrived at the same time and both shot at Ritchie, who was killed. \n In the three days since, police uncovered the unsettling news: the revolver used by Ritchie to strike Salao at least four times in the lower body was already known to Anchorage police. \n Ballistics matched it to the July 3 deaths of Jason Netter and Brianna Foisy on a bike path near downtown Anchorage, the July 29 murder of Treyveonkindell Thompson on an isolated street and the Aug. 28 deaths of Bryant De Husson and Kevin Turner at Valley of the Moon Park in downtown Anchorage. \n Police don't have a motive or much information about Ritchie. \n Police Lt. John McKinnon has asked members of the public to provide any information they can about him. \n \"He hadn't been on our radar for a while in Anchorage, so that's part of what they're trying to determine is, where he's been, who he'd lived with, what other contacts he had,\" Campion said. \"He hasn't had any real police contact in the last decade in Alaska.\" \n Campion said the five homicide cases remain open because the link to the gun provides investigative leads that need to be pursued. He said Anchorage police would be working with various agencies in the state in the investigation. \n McKinnon said the gun didn't match the deaths of two other people at Point Woronzof, a popular coastal park. \n Police Chief Chris Tolley said at the Tuesday news conference that the actions of Salao and Patzke in returning fire at Ritchie were heroic and \"made sure that this individual will not hurt any one of you or any one of the citizens of Anchorage. I'm so very, very proud of them.\" \n Salao was hit at struck at least four times, with bullets fracturing bones, ripping apart muscles and going through the intestine and lodging in his liver, Tolley said. \n He underwent seven hours of surgery on Saturday. Tolley said the officer is recuperating at an Anchorage hospital, and he has been moved out of the intensive care unit. \n \"The officer is a fighter,\" Tolley said. \n ___ \n Associated Press writers Rachel D'Oro in Anchorage and Becky Bohrer in Juneau contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Officer shooting probe gives Alaska police break in 5 cases"}
