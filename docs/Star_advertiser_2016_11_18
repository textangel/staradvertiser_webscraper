{"date": "November 18, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn gestures as he arrives at Trump Tower. \n WASHINGTON >> Michael Flynn, the retired Army lieutenant general and intelligence officer who is Donald Trump's pick to serve as his national security adviser, is a harsh critic of Muslim extremism and the religion itself, calling \"radical Islam\" an existential threat to the United States. \n In strident speeches and public comments, including a fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has aggressively argued that Islamic State militants pose a threat on a global scale and demanded a far more aggressive U.S. military campaign against the group. \n In a June interview with CNN, Flynn complained the U.S. needs to \"discredit\" radical Islam, but that \"we're not allowed to do that right now.\" But his comments about Islam, a religion practiced by more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, have at times gone beyond condemning radicals inside the faith. \n In Flynn's book, \"The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and its Allies,\" he condemned U.S. leaders who have called Islam a religion of peace. \"This insistence on denying the existence of jihad led President Obama to the absurd claim that the Islamic State has nothing to do with Islam,\" Flynn wrote. \n In August, he spoke at an event in Dallas hosted by the anti-Islamist group Act for America, calling Islam a \"cancer\" and a \"political ideology\" that \"definitely hides behind being a religion.\" \n Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group based in California, said in a statement that Flynn's appointment \"signals support for anti-Muslim policies and sentiment that will undermine our nation's security and exacerbate an already unsafe climate for Muslims and all Americans.\" \n The role of national security adviser has varied by administration, but usually centers on coordinating the policy positions of the secretaries of state, defense, justice and other members of a president's national security team. \n It is an especially powerful position because of the national security adviser's access to the president in the West Wing of the White House. The adviser acts as a gatekeeper on a wide range of issues, including matters of war and peace as well as diplomacy and intelligence. \n Flynn, who turns 58 in December, served for more than three decades in the Army following his commissioning in 1981 as a second lieutenant in military intelligence. His career included a stint as director of intelligence for the Joint Chiefs of Staff and intelligence chief for the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. \n It ended, however, when he was forced to resign from his post as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 after two turbulent years leading the Pentagon's top spy agency. \n After leaving the agency, Flynn became a harsh critic of the Obama administration's prosecution of the fight against the Islamic State group and emerged as one of Trump's most vocal backers. Throughout the campaign, Flynn championed many of Trump's foreign policy provisions, including renegotiating a seven-country agreement with Iran aimed at curbing its nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions. \n Yet while Flynn has publicly issued dark warnings about the risks of Islamic violence, his private consulting firm has lobbied for a company headed by a Turkish businessman tied to Turkey's authoritarian, Islamist-leaning government, which cracked down on dissent and jailed thousands of opponents after a failed coup in July against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \n The businessman, Ekim Alptekin, told The Associated Press on Friday that he had no relationship with Erdogan's government, even though he is member of a Turkish foreign economic relations board managed by the country's Economic Ministry. \n In an op-ed for the Washington newspaper The Hill just before the election, Flynn wrote that Turkey needs support and echoed Erdogan's warnings that a \"shady\" Turkish Muslim cleric living in Pennsylvania should not be given safe harbor in the U.S. \n Erdogan has accused the cleric, Fethullah Gullen, of orchestrating the July coup attempt and called for his extradition. The Obama administration has not complied. \n Alptekin said Friday that Flynn's editorial supporting Erdogan was not connected to his company's lobbying or the Turkish government. \"The Turkish government did not order that,\" he said. \n The Flynn Intel Group also lobbied Congress even as Flynn joined Trump in a presidential intelligence briefing in August \u2014 a possible security misstep, according to several ethics law experts. \n \"If the general was receiving classified information that could affect his business interests, that would be an obvious concern,\" said Joe Sandler, a campaign ethics lawyer and expert on the law that requires lobbyists for foreign governments to register their activities. \n Sandler and others also questioned why Flynn's firm registered as lobbyists with Congress instead of the Justice Department's stricter Foreign Agent unit, which requires more detailed reporting of activities under the federal Foreign Agent Registration Act. \n \"If a foreign entity is lobbying Congress with the aim of influencing U.S policy, they're required to file under the foreign agent act,\" said Lydia Bennett, an expert in foreign agent work with the non-partisan Project on Government Oversight in Washington. \n Flynn's consulting group registered with Congress as a lobbyist in September for Inovo BV, a company Alptekin set up in the Netherlands in 2005. Alptekin said the lobbying project was designed to support an energy firm that he declined to identify. \n Alptekin said a lobbyist for Flynn's firm, Robert Kelley, had suggested it aim to improve U.S.-Turkish relations as part of its work for the energy firm. \n Kelley and Flynn Intel Group did not respond to calls and emails from the AP, and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Flynn said in a statement Kelley provided to Yahoo News that \"if I return to government service, my relationship with my company will be severed.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Flynn a frequent critic of Muslim militancy, culture"}

Organizers anticipated a crowd as large as half a million. \n It will be the latest in a wave of demonstrations calling for the ouster of Park, who critics accuse of undermining the country's democracy by allegedly allowing a secretive confidante to manipulate power from the shadows and amass an illicit fortune. \n Park's supporters were planning to hold smaller counter protests in nearby streets around Seoul Station, raising concerns about potential clashes with the anti-Park activists whose gatherings in recent weeks have been peaceful. \n Prosecutors plan to formally charge Park's friend, Choi Soon-sil, by Sunday, and also are seeking to question Park in the next few days. \n Choi, the daughter of a late cult leader who emerged as Park's mentor in the 1970s, has been suspected of interfering with state affairs despite having no government job, and, with the help of presidential aides, bullying companies into donating tens of millions of dollars into foundations she controlled. \n Prosecutors also are seeking to indict two of Park's former aides who allegedly conspired with Choi. Other key suspects include a music video director who supposedly used her ties with Choi to win lucrative government culture projects, and a former vice sports minister suspected of providing business favors and financial support to sports organizations controlled by Choi and her niece. \n Emboldened by the huge protests in recent weeks, opposition parties have been stepping up pressure to force Park to quit. \n On Thursday, they used their parliamentary majority to pass a law that would allow for a special prosecutor to investigate the scandal and potentially expose the president's wrongdoings. \n Opposition parties have yet to seriously push for Park's impeachment over fears of triggering a backlash from conservative voters and negatively impacting next year's presidential election. \n However, there is a growing voice within the opposition that an impeachment attempt is inevitable because it's unlikely Park will resign and give up her immunity from prosecution. \n Park's term lasts until Feb. 24, 2018. If she steps down before the presidential vote on Dec. 20, 2017, an election must be held within 60 days. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Large anti-Park protest planned in Seoul, 4th amid scandal"}

{"date": "November 18, 2016", "text": "NEW YORK >> President-elect Donald Trump demanded an apology from the cast of the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" a day after an actor in the hit show delivered a pointed message about diversity to his running mate who was in attendance, prompting angry responses from liberals and conservatives alike and underscoring yet again the fractious aftermath of the 2016 election. \n The bitter back-and-forth came after Vice President-elect Mike Pence caught Friday's performance of \"Hamilton\" with his nephew and daughter. A mixture of boos and cheers could be heard inside the theater as Pence took his seat. When the show ended, Pence was asked by a cast member to hear a prepared speech after the curtain call from the multiracial and multicultural cast, saying it is concerned about the Trump administration. \n \"We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,\" said Brandon Victor Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, the nation's third vice president. We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.\" \n The unusual address quickly went viral and Trump on Saturday tweeted that it was \"very rude,\" arguing that Pence was \"harassed\" and theater \"must always be a safe and special place.\" He urged the cast to apologize. Dixon responded on Twitter that \"conversation is not harassment sir\" and added that he appreciated Pence stopping to listen. \n Trump transition officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for the show said none of the cast members would be available to speak Saturday. \n Melissa Kremholz, of Indianapolis, the capital of Pence's home state of Indiana, attended the show Friday night and was seeing it again Saturday afternoon. She said she could see how Dixon's speech might be interpreted as impolite and gave Pence credit for coming, but backed the Broadway cast's right to explain how uneasy many Americans feel. \n \"I think it was really important for them to speak what they had to say because the whole musical talks about how our country came to be and our American values and how our country was built on immigrants and people of all different backgrounds,\" she said. \"I think it's really important that they actually spoke their minds and I think they did so very respectfully, too.\" \n The show's official Facebook page was inundated with comments ranging from calling Dixon's speech \"disrespectful,\" \"inappropriate\" and \"uncalled for.\" Many threatened to not buy tickets to future performances. Tickets for the show are not available for another year; \"Hamilton\" is sold out through September 2017. \n The American Civil Liberties Union weighed in on the side of the Broadway cast, saying the First Amendment is a cornerstone of America \"even if it sometimes makes our leaders uncomfortable.\" \n \"President-elect Trump needs a refresher on his high school civics class. Americans don't apologize \u2014 not even to presidents or vice presidents \u2014 for the lawful and proper exercise of their constitutional rights,\" ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero wrote in a statement. \n But Noel Leifer, from Manchester, New Jersey, who was in line to see a matinee Saturday with his wife, Peggy, said he understood why so many people felt that actors lecturing the next vice president from a Broadway stage were somewhat impudent. \n \"It was a protest. It was a bit disrespectful. They are going to be the leaders of the country. I didn't vote for them \u2014 I think they're poor candidates \u2014 but they're still going to be leaders,\" said Leifer, who was celebrating his wife's birthday with tickets he bought a year ago. \n As for a boycott of the show, he didn't think that would ultimately fly. \"I don't think too many people who have spent the money for this show are going to boycott it just to make a protest statement.\" \n The musical is by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the story, music and lyrics. It stresses the orphan, immigrant roots of first U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton and has a terrifically varied score, ranging from pop ballads to gospel to sexy R&B. It has been cheered for reclaiming the nation's founding story with a multicultural cast. \n Miranda, in a tweet, said he was \"proud\" of Dixon and the \"Hamilton\" cast \"for leading with love,\" before reminding people that everyone is welcome at the theater. \n Miranda had been a big booster for the failed presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, including performing at an all-star fundraiser for her last month. The cast also put on a special \"Hamilton\" show at a Clinton fundraiser last summer. \n The person playing Alexander Hamilton that Pence saw was Javier Munoz, an openly gay actor. Pence supported numerous efforts to ban gay marriage as governor of Indiana and opposed unfettered federal funding for HIV and AIDS treatment. \n Many in the Broadway community quickly defended the actions of the \"Hamilton\" cast, including new Tony Award-winner Cynthia Erivo, who mocked: \"You want the theater full of people you have alienated to be protective of you?\" And Josh Gad, a Tony nominee for \"The Book of Mormon,\" wrote: \"I know the booing upsets some of you. But this is what happens when you run on a platform of hate.\" \n Janise Gray, of Union, New Jersey, who saw the show Saturday afternoon, considered the speech an anguished cry from those fearful they will be pushed aside under Republican rule. \n \"One way or another, we want everybody to be represented and the way the campaign was, it wasn't feeling that everybody was being represented,\" she said, adding that she was glad Pence came. \n \"From what I've heard, it sounded like it was fair and equitable. It was just a statement of 'please represent everyone. We are a diverse country and we need to be inclusive,'\" she said. \"That's what this country was founded on.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump tweets demand for apology from 'Hamilton' cast"}

{"date": "November 18, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Vitaly Smirnov, a former IOC member from Russia who runs a government-backed doping commission, speaks to the Associated Press in Yakhroma, Russia. \n MOSCOW >> As far as Vladimir Putin's anti-doping troubleshooter is concerned, Russia's doping problems are nothing more than a \"glitch.\" \n Brought out of retirement by Putin to lead Russia's future strategy on doping, 81-year-old Vitaly Smirnov is being called on to use his contacts from five decades in Olympic politics to lobby for Russian interests and play down the accusations of state-sponsored cheating. \n Even as Smirnov tries to build bridges with the IOC and World Anti-Doping Agency, and plans to address WADA's board on Sunday, Smirnov vehemently denies that the Russian government ran an industrial-scale doping program and cover-up, including at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. \n \"What has happened is a glitch. It doesn't have roots in any kind of practice which was happening over a long period of time,\" Smirnov, a former Soviet minister who spent 44 years as an International Olympic Committee member, told The Associated Press in an interview in his spacious office at the Russian Olympic Committee. \"There was no organized doping system on the state level. We believe that the participants in this were individuals, who were pursuing their own goals.\" \n Putin's love of sports as a judo black belt and recreational hockey player means the Russian government couldn't have sponsored an East German-style doping scheme, Smirnov said. \n \"I've known our president for 25 years. I got to know him when we were preparing the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg in 1994. I know him still. I know he's an athlete,\" Smirnov says he told Richard McLaren, the Canadian lawyer who produced the WADA report accusing Russian officials of complicity. \"And as an athlete and head of state, it's incompatible.\" \n Among those named in McLaren's report in July were Deputy Sports Minister Yuri Nagornykh and the ministry's anti-doping adviser, Nataliya Zhelanova, both of whom are facing investigations from the Russian authorities and have since left their jobs. Even if officials like Nagornykh and Zhelanova are found to have been complicit, they should be seen as bad apples rather than part of a government conspiracy, Smirnov argues. \n \"Certain officials \u2026 it doesn't mean the whole system, the whole ministry was taking part,\" he said. \n The second part of McLaren's report is due out next month and could further tarnish the legacy of the Sochi Games. Smirnov has been in contact with McLaren and WADA President Craig Reedie. \n However, Smirnov is scathing in his condemnation for Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of the Moscow anti-doping laboratory who turned star witness for WADA. Rodchenkov said he was involved in state-backed doping for years, providing doping substances to athletes and helping swap dirty samples for clean ones at the Sochi Games. \n Now living in the United States, Rochenkov is facing an investigation by Russian authorities over the destruction of doping samples. \n Smirnov suggests Rodchenkov was motivated by money, not Russian state prestige. \n \"If you take the case of Rodchenkov, there's pure criminality. They were just, over the course of a fairly long period of time, falsifying results and getting money for that,\" Smirnov said, later adding: \"I am counting on objectivity in this whole case. The McLaren report is sadly built on the evidence of just one man. That man is facing a criminal case and an investigation is under way.\" \n Formally, Smirnov's role is as head of the Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission, a body set up at Putin's suggestion and backed by the Russian Olympic Committee to lead the charge against what the Russian government perceives as unfair accusations. Putin didn't formally appoint Smirnov, but nominated him on state TV as a man with an \"absolutely unimpeachable reputation.\" He was swiftly approved. \n The commission, which last met in October, includes numerous sports officials but also doctors, a state TV executive and even a concert pianist, though none of the commission's members are anti-doping scientists. \n \"Our commission is absolutely independent. The commission contains people, many of whom have no connection to sport at all, but carry a lot of weight in society,\" Smirnov said, defending the participation of pianist Denis Matsuev. \"He's not just there because he can play 47 piano concertos, but because he loves sport\" and was invited to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics because of his musical skill, Smirnov added, though the commission also works with two experts from Australia and Lithuania sent by WADA to Russia to help with reforms. \n Smirnov is eager to repair relations with the IOC and WADA after a year of fierce rhetoric on all sides, and refers to former WADA president Dick Pound, author of last year's first report into Russian doping, as \"my old friend.\" In a recent conversation with Reedie, Smirnov offered to appoint a foreigner to Rodchenkov's old job as head of the Moscow lab to reactivate its \"colossal\" capacity of 20,000 tests a year. \n Smirnov's overall message is clear though \u2014 Russia is not a country of drug cheats. \n \"In the spirit of our people there is nothing about trying to deceive, to find a dishonest shortcut,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Putin's anti-doping tsar lobbies for Russia, pushes reform"}

{"date": "November 18, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump speaks on election night last week in New York. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this May 23, 2005, file photo, then-real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump, left, listens as Michael Sexton introduces him at a news conference in New York where he announced the establishment of Trump University. Trump has agreed to pay $25 million to settle three lawsuits involving his now-defunct Trump University. \n SAN DIEGO >> For more than six years, Donald Trump fought hard against a lawsuit in which former customers of his now-defunct Trump University accused him of fraud. Less than two weeks after being elected president, he agreed to a $25 million settlement. \n \"We definitely detected a change of tone and change of approach\" after the election, plaintiffs' attorney Jason Forge said when the agreement was announced Friday. \n About 7,000 students would be eligible for refunds if U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel approves the settlement. Under the terms, the Republican president-elect admits no wrongdoing in settling two federal class-action lawsuits in San Diego and a lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat. \n The agreement came 10 days before jury selection was scheduled to begin in San Diego in the oldest case, which was filed in April 2010. The complaint accused Trump University, which wasn't an accredited school, of defrauding students who paid up to $35,000 a year to enroll in programs that promised to share Trump's real estate secrets. \n Trump denied the allegations and said during the campaign that he would not settle. He told supporters at a May rally that he would come to San Diego to testify after winning the presidency. \n \"I could have settled this case numerous times, but I don't want to settle cases when we're right. I don't believe in it. And when you start settling cases, you know what happens? Everybody sues you because you get known as a settler. One thing about me, I am not known as a settler,\" Trump said at the time. \n Trump said Saturday that he settled the lawsuit \"for a small fraction of the potential award\" because he needs to focus on the country. \n \"The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!\" Trump said on Twitter. \n Two days after the election, Trump's lead attorney in the San Diego cases, Daniel Petrocelli, said he was \"all ears\" to settlement talks and accepted an offer to have U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Miller of San Diego broker negotiations. \n Forge said the agreement was reached an hour before a hearing for Curiel to weigh Trump's latest request to delay the trial until after the Jan. 20 inauguration. The plaintiffs' attorney said Miller's role as a mediator was \"very critical.\" \n \"We were at each other's throat for 6\u00bd years and were able to find the common ground with them and do something good there,\" Forge told reporters. \n The agreement canceled the trial and lifted what would probably have been a major headache for Trump as he works to fill key executive branch positions and get acquainted with foreign leaders. The trial was expected to last several weeks, guaranteeing daily news coverage of a controversy that dogged him during the campaign. \n Trump's political rivals seized on the lawsuits to try to portray him as dishonest and deceitful. Trump brought more attention to them by repeatedly assailing Curiel, who oversaw the San Diego cases. Trump suggested the Indiana-born judge's Mexican heritage exposed a bias. \n The thousands of former students covered by the San Diego lawsuits will be eligible to receive at least half and possibly all their money back, as much as $35,000, Forge said. The plaintiffs' attorneys waived their fees. \n Schneiderman called the agreement a \"stunning reversal\" for the president-elect, saying Trump \"fought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. Today, that all changes.\" \n Trump's attorneys said the settlement allows the president-elect to focus full attention on his transition to the White House. \n \"He was willing to sacrifice his personal interests, put this behind him, and move forward,\" Petrocelli said. \n Alan Garten, the Trump Organization's general counsel, said he had \"no doubt\" Trump would have prevailed at trial. \n The lawsuits allege that Trump University gave nationwide seminars that were like infomercials, constantly pressuring people to spend more and, in the end, failing to deliver on its promises. The San Diego trial would have been pinned on whether a jury believed Trump misled customers by calling the business a university and by advertising that he hand-picked instructors. \n Court documents unsealed in May revealed strategies for enticing people to enroll even if they couldn't afford it. The documents outlined how employees should guide people through \"the roller coaster of emotions\" after they express interest and told employees to be \"very aggressive during these conversations to in order to push them out of their comfort zones.\" \n Transcripts of about 10 hours of Trump depositions provided additional material to rivals, though Curiel denied a request to release video of Trump's testimony that would have likely been used in campaign attack ads. Trump acknowledged in the depositions that he played on people's fantasies, and he could not recall names of his employees despite his advertising pitch that he hand-picked them. \n Trump has repeatedly claimed a 98 percent customer satisfaction rate on internal surveys. Plaintiffs countered that students were asked to rate the product when they believed they still had more instruction to come and were reluctant to openly criticize their teachers on surveys that were not anonymous. \n The settlement came a day after watchdog groups and ethics experts who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations sent a letter to Trump urging him to make a clean break from his business to avoid \"embroiling the presidency in litigation.\" \n One of the authors, Richard Painter, an ethics lawyer at the White House under Republican President George W. Bush, said the Trump University settlement might backfire if lawyers think Trump is eager to settle to avoid court cases while president. \n \"The plaintiffs' lawyers,\" he said, \"are going to smell blood in the water.\" \n ", "author": "David Klepper & Elliot Spagata Associated Press", "title": "Trump quickly settles university lawsuits after a long fight"}

{"date": "November 18, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. president Barack Obama waves as he departs from Tegel airport in Berlin today. \n BERLIN >> It's the last thing President Barack Obama ever expected he'd be doing in his final months in office: Coaching Donald Trump on how to be a world leader. \n As the president-elect holes up in his skyscraper, Obama is giving Trump policy advice, style tips and gentle nudges to let the fervor of the campaign give way to the sobriety of the Oval Office. And as Obama completes his last world tour, he's been thrust into the unexpected role of Trump translator to anxious U.S. allies. \n Standing next to German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, Obama said Trump would quickly see that a president's responsibilities can't be treated casually and that diverse countries can only be governed by \"listening and reaching out.\" \n \"It is my hope that that is what will happen,\" Obama said. \"And I'm going to do everything I can over the next two months to help assure that that happens.\" \n Though the outgoing president made clear his profound disdain for Trump throughout the campaign, perhaps no one is better positioned than Obama to get him up to speed in a matter of weeks. \n It's unclear, though, how much help Trump wants or will accept from Obama. And no one expects that the executive tutoring will substantially change Trump's vast differences with Obama, who he called the worst president in U.S. history. \n After meeting with Trump following the election, Obama resolved to spend more time helping prepare Trump than he might under different circumstances \u2014 say, if Hillary Clinton had been elected, aides said. \n Trump, to the surprise of many, seemed game. He said he wanted Obama's \"counsel\" and looked forward to \"many, many\" more meetings. \n In the run-up to the election, the White House had planned only perfunctory, refresher-style briefings for Clinton, who is no stranger to the White House and whose transition team had prepared extensively for an expected takeover. \n Soon after Trump's victory, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough directed that his preparatory materials be thickened and his intelligence briefings expanded to include more basic information, according to U.S. officials, who weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity. \n Obama and his closest advisers were irritated when it leaked out that Trump, during his White House visit, had displayed a lack of thorough knowledge about key issues while Trump's aides appeared unfamiliar with the process of staffing up a White House, officials said. \n They were concerned if Trump felt insulted or aggrieved, he might pull the plug on accepting Obama's advice and help. After all, Obama's aides had been pleasantly surprised when Trump, after their Oval Office chat, had agreed to preserve key elements of the \"Obamacare\" health law, which he'd pledged during the campaign to repeal. \n If Trump has felt patronized by Obama, so far he hasn't shown it. Asked why Trump's meeting this week with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was closed to the press, senior transition adviser Kellyanne Conway pointed out that Obama was traveling overseas. \n \"We are very deferential and respectful of the fact that we already have a president of the United States, Barack Obama,\" Conway told reporters. \"President Obama is still in office for the next two months, and we won't be making diplomatic agreements today.\" \n Though Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have spoken by phone to more than 30 heads of state since the election, Trump hasn't been heard from publically, save for one television interview and occasional tweets. From his suite in Trump Tower, he and top aides have been interviewing candidates for the 4,000-odd roles they must fill. \n Unsure how Trump as president may shake up foreign relations, world leaders have turned to Obama for information about what to expect. Traveling this week to Greece, Germany and Peru, Obama has tried to reassure U.S. partners that Trump, in their Oval Office meeting, expressed a \"full commitment\" to NATO. \n \"I am encouraged by the president-elect's insistence that NATO is a commitment that does not change,\" Obama said in Germany. \n During the campaign, Trump said the U.S. didn't \"really need NATO in its current form,\" calling it obsolete and threatening not to defend NATO allies unless they pay more into the alliance. Though Trump has since softened those comments, he hasn't offered the explicit reassurances in public that Obama said he offered in private. \n But Obama said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" that transitioning from candidate to president-in-waiting would force Trump to focus and get serious about \"gaining the trust even of those who didn't support him.\" \n \"That has to reflect itself not only in the things he says, but also how he fills out his administration,\" Obama said. \"And my hope is that that's something he is thinking about.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Unlikely apprentice: Obama coaches Trump to be world leader"}

{"date": "November 18, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. and Kellyanne Conway, campaign manager for President-elect Donald Trump, speaks to reporters at Trump Tower in New York, Thursday. \n NEW YORK >> President-elect Donald Trump signaled a sharp rightward shift in U.S. national security policy today with his announcement that he will nominate Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, turning to a pair of staunch conservatives as he begins to fill out his Cabinet. \n Trump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. A former military intelligence chief, Flynn has accused the Obama administration of being too soft on terrorism and has cast Islam as a \"political ideology\" and driver of extremism. \n Sessions and Flynn were ardent Trump supporters during the campaign, and their promotions were seen in part as a reward for their loyalty. \n The selections form the first outlines of Trump's Cabinet and national security teams. Given his lack of governing experience and vague policy proposals during the campaign, his selection of advisers is being scrutinized both in the U.S. and abroad. \n Trump's initial decisions suggest a more aggressive military involvement in counterterror strategy and a greater emphasis on Islam's role in stoking extremism. Sessions, who is best known for his hard-line immigration views, has questioned whether terror suspects should benefit from the rights available in U.S. courts. Pompeo has said Muslim leaders are \"potentially complicit\" in attacks if they do not denounce violence carried out in the name of Islam. \n Pompeo's nomination to lead the CIA also opens the prospect of the U.S. resuming torture of detainees. Trump has backed harsh interrogation techniques that President Barack Obama and Congress have banned, saying the U.S. \"should go tougher than waterboarding,\" which simulates drowning. In 2014, Pompeo criticized Obama for \"ending our interrogation program\" and said intelligence officials \"are not torturers, they are patriots.\" \n Transition officials said the president-elect's senior team would be carrying out Trump's policies, not their own ideas. \n \"Anyone's personal view isn't what matters,\" said Sean Spicer, a transition communications aide. \n Trump did not appear, instead releasing a statement announcing his decisions. He has made no public appearances this week, holing up in his New York skyscraper for meetings. He is spending the weekend at his New Jersey golf club. \n Sessions and Pompeo would both require Senate confirmation before assuming their designated roles; Flynn would not. \n Most of Trump's nominees are expected to be confirmed relatively easily given the GOP majority in the Senate. However, potential roadblocks exist, particularly for Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump and one of the chamber's most conservative members. \n His last Senate confirmation hearing, in 1986 for a federal judgeship, was derailed over allegations that he made racist comments, including calling a black assistant U.S. attorney \"boy\" in conversation. Sessions denied the accusation, but withdrew from consideration. \n Some Democrats slammed Sessions' nomination Friday, including Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois, who said the senator was the right pick \"if you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen.\" \n Still, Republicans were supportive. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called his Senate colleague \"principled, forthright, and hardworking\" and said he looked forward to the chamber's \"fair and expeditious\" handing of the nomination. \n Sessions would bring to the Justice Department a consistently conservative voice. He has objected to the planned closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and has given prominence to the specter of voting fraud, a problem that current Justice Department leaders believe is negligible. \n Pompeo, who graduated first in his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, is a conservative Republican and a strong critic of Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. He has said former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden should enjoy due process and then be sentenced to death for taking and releasing secret documents about surveillance programs in which the U.S. government collected the phone records of millions of Americans. \n Anthony Romero, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said Pompeo's views raise concerns about \"privacy and due process.\" \n Of Trump's new personnel picks, Flynn will have the most direct access to the president. The national security adviser works from the West Wing and is often one of the last people to meet with the president before major foreign policy decisions are made. \n Flynn built a reputation in the military intelligence community as an astute professional and unconventional thinker. He asserted that he was forced out of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 because he disagreed with Obama's approach to combating extremism, though his critics claimed he mismanaged the agency. \n In advising Trump's campaign, Flynn has emphasized that he believes the Islamic State poses an existential threat on a global scale. He shares Trump's belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow, and his warmth toward Russia worries some national security experts. \n Flynn traveled last year to Moscow, where he joined Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials in a celebration of the RT network, a Russian government-controlled television channel. Flynn said he was paid for taking part in the event, but brushed aside concerns that he was aiding a Russian propaganda effort. \n The president-elect is still weighing a range of candidates for other leading national security posts. Possibilities for secretary of state are said to include former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who met with Trump Thursday. \n On Saturday, Trump is to meet with retired Gen. James Mattis, a contender to lead the Pentagon. He was also meeting with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who lambasted Trump as a \"con man\" and a \"fraud\" in a stinging speech in March. Trump responded by repeatedly referring to Romney as a \"loser.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Shifting U.S. policy to right, Trump taps Sessions, Flynn"}

{"date": "November 18, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this photo provided by Kim Cobb, shows Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb in November at the remote Pacific island of Kiritimati, finding a bit of hope and life amid what in April was a ghost town of dead coral. Cobb used bags and drills to examine the coral and take core samples. Yellow coral is healthy, white is sick and some of the other colors are actually algae over dead coral. \n WASHINGTON >> In a ghost town of dead coral off a remote Pacific island, scientists have found a bit more life. \n In excursions a year ago and then last April, scientists examined the normally stunning coral reefs around the island of Kiritimati and pronounced it mostly a boneyard of dead coral. About 85 percent of the coral was dead, 10 percent was sick and bleached but still technically alive, and only 5 percent was doing OK. \n The same scientists returned this month and found that 6 to 7 percent of the coral is alive and not bleached, said University of Victoria coral reef scientist Julia Baum, speaking by Skype from the island. \n \"We left with a sense of dread and came back with a renewed purpose because there are some corals that literally came back from the brink,\" said Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb, who returned from the expedition earlier. \"It's the best we could have hoped for.\" \n Many of the fish that rely on the reef and had been absent seem to be back, Cobb said. \n Hot water \u2014 mostly from El Nino, the natural occasional warming of the Pacific that changes weather worldwide, and man-made global warming \u2014 had made the area one of the worst hit coral spots in the world. Later, nearby Jarvis Island was even more damaged. And the death of 85 percent of the coral of the better known and much larger Great Barrier Reef has been reported, said C. Mark Eakin, coral reef watch coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \n \"But despite this mass mortality, there are a few small signs of hope,\" Baum said. \"It's clear that coral reefs have great resilience and the coral here is trying to recover.\" \n Not only has some of the bleached coral recovered, she said, but \"there are coral babies that have settled on the reef sometime in the last year to year and half and these are the reef's best hope for recovery.\" \n A study published Thursday in the journal Current Biology goes back more than a million years and finds that even during mass die-offs, coral species are able to rebound. \n Eakin points to Scott reef off western Australia where 12 years after the damaging 1998 El Nino coral die-off, nearly half the original reef revived. But it was damaged again by the recent El Nino. \n Even after the recovery seen at Kiritimati, Baum is wary: \"It's like having a patient who is very sick and instead of letting them recover we keep infecting them with more and more illnesses. There's only so much that any person \u2014 or any natural system \u2014 can take.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Scientists report signs of life in Pacific coral reef hurt by El Nino"}

Enraged pro-democracy activists, however, stressed the decades-long debate over the ex-president's final resting place was far from over and protested across the metropolis. \n Bonifacio Ilagan, a left-wing activist who was detained and tortured during Marcos's rule, said the dictator was buried \"like a thief in the night\" in a stealthy fashion similar to when he suddenly placed the country under martial rule. A lawmaker considered asking the Supreme Court to exhume the newly buried Marcos. \n \"It's very much like when he declared martial law in 1972,\" Ilagan told The Associated Press. \"This is so Marcos style. I want to rush to the cemetery to protest this. I feel so enraged.\" \n Marie Hilao Enriquez, a former political detainee whose sister, a fellow activist, was raped and killed by policemen, wept upon learning the news. \n \"Marcos died in the arms of his family\" but many Marcos-era activists remain missing after being allegedly abducted by state forces, Enriquez said at a protest. \"We are still searching for the victims' bodies, trying to find out where they buried the bodies.\" \n Imee Marcos thanked those who \"were with us in hoping and praying for nearly three decades to see this day.\" \n President Duterte, who gave the go-ahead signal for the burial, called for calm. \n \"Hopefully, both sides will exercise maximum tolerance and come to terms with the burial,\" Duterte's spokesman, Ernesto Abella, quoted him as saying after the president landed in Peru, where he is attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders. \n Military spokesman Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla said Marcos's remains were flown by air force helicopter from his northern Ilocos Norte hometown for burial at the military-run cemetery in Manila. \n Marcos's widow, Imelda, who was clad in black, and her children attended the simple ceremony, along with dozens of relatives and friends. \n After landing at an air base, Marcos's remains were brought by a black limousine to the cemetery, where his flag-draped wooden coffin was placed on a caisson and later carried by military pallbearers to the gravesite, military spokesman Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla said. \n A 21-gun salute by military honor troops rang out during the burial ceremony. \n \"We rendered the simplest of honors befitting the former president in compliance to the desire of the family,\" Padilla said. \n Asked why the burial was kept from the public, Padilla said it was the Marcos family's desire \"to keep it private.\" \n Still, the burial shocked many democracy advocates and human rights victims who had planned protests nationwide Friday against Marcos's interment at the cemetery, where former presidents, soldiers and national artists have been buried, unaware that funeral plans were already underway. \n Burying someone accused of massive rights violations and plunder at the heroes' cemetery has long been an emotional and divisive issue in the Philippines, where Marcos was ousted by a largely nonviolent army-backed uprising in 1986. At the height of the political turbulence, Marcos flew to Hawaii, where he lived with his wife and children until he died in 1989. \n The powerful family has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and Imelda Marcos and two of her children eventually ran for public office and won stunning political comebacks. One son, Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., ran for vice president earlier this year and lost by a slim margin. \n In 1993, Marcos's body was taken to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, where it has been displayed in a glass coffin and became a tourist attraction. But his family fought for his remains to be transferred to the heroes' cemetery. \n Duterte, who took over the presidency in June, backed Marcos's burial at the cemetery, saying it was his right as a president and soldier. It was a political risk in a country where democracy advocates celebrate Marcos's ouster each year. \n Last week, the Supreme Court dismissed seven petitions, including from former torture victims, which argued that an honorable burial for the dictator was \"illegal and contrary to law, public policy, morals and justice.\" \n Opponents planned to appeal the court decision within a 15-day period but were pre-empted by Friday's surprise burial. They said the Marcos family should be cited by the court for contempt. \n The court ruled that Marcos was never convicted by final judgment of any offense involving moral turpitude, adding that the convictions cited by anti-Marcos petitioners were civil in nature. \n While critics may disregard Marcos as president due to his human rights abuses, the court said he cannot be denied the right to be acknowledged as a former legislator, a defense secretary, a military member, a war veteran and a Medal of Valor awardee. \n \"While he was not all good,\" the 15-member court said, \"he was not pure evil either.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Amid protests, Marcos buried at heroes cemetery in Manila"}

They featured the use of sniffer dogs to find victims in debris, a water rescue and building a pontoon bridge and refugee shelter. \n \"It has been a very successful exchange of ideas between our two militaries and it will definitely benefit us in organization in the future,\" said U.S. Army Capt. Jeremy Reynolds. \n Deng Yuguang of the Chinese army said the drill offered new perspectives for Chinese troops who have shown greater capacity in dealing with disasters within China, but lack the overseas experience of their U.S. counterparts. \n \"We have similar exercises by ourselves, but this joint drill is very impressive because the drill helps a lot in improving our disaster rescue and relief capability,\" Deng said. \n Along with the Kunming drills, the Chinese and U.S. militaries have joined in naval exercises off the coast of Hawaii and other limited multinational drills mainly aimed at dealing with humanitarian disasters. They've also tried to improve mutual trust through agreements on dealing with unexpected encounters at sea. \n Despite those, China deeply resents the presence of the American Navy in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety, while the U.S. has been moving to strengthen alliances with friends and partners throughout Asia. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "China, U.S. militaries stage joint humanitarian relief drill"}

Students who were dropped off early were staying in the air-conditioned library until their parents could pick them up. \n The winds blew both makai and mauka, making it difficult for firefighters to contain the flames. \n The Honolulu Fire Department set up two divisions, one for makai and another for mauka fronts of the fire. \n Many residents felt threatened by the fire and self-evacuated. \n Firefighters arriving at 7:20 p.m. found a 30-acre brush fire near the Cultural Learning Center at Kaala on the eastern or Lualualei side of Waianae Valley, that quickly spread and intensified as the night wore on, burning along the top of the mountain that separates Waianae and Makaha. \n Eighteen fire companies and 50 firefighters fought the fire in difficult terrain, trying to protect homes with limited water supplies delivered by tanker trucks. \n Angel's Towing and Diamond D Ranch were in the vicinity of the fire. \n Ac'Lynne Uesugi drove up with her daughter to check on her 69-year-old mother who lives near the ranch and Angel's. \n Her mother texted her, \"The flames are bigger now and the sky is lit up.\" \n Uesugi said her mother was wetting down her acre property to protect it. \n But Department of Emergency Management officials would not allow Uesugi and her daughter to walk or drive along the road that leads to the property. \n Uesugi noted a \"ring of fire,\" with some flames getting closer to Mt. Kaala, where a friend of hers lives. That friend told her not to worry about him, but her mother's house was closer to the fire. \n Her daughter, Phoenix Maimita Valentine, 13, commented, \"Spectacular view. Something worth witnessing.\" \n The ranch has horses, goats and cows, Uesugi said. \n But Angel's Towing was closer to the blaze, according to one Waianae resident who was visiting friends in the area. \n Randy Mariani, 31, said Angel's has a lot of vehicles, and there is a lot of gasoline spilled on the soil there. \n At about 11:45 p.m., the Fire Department moved some of their operations makai to protect homes in the area of Piliuka Place. \n Earlier in the evening, Arthur Gualdarama, 20, whose family lives near Angel's, said he thought someone's house was on fire. \"I seen the mountain on fire. It amazed me.\" \n He and a buddy drove up to get close to the fire when it was smaller. \n \"I hope everybody and their families are safe,\" Gualdarama said. \n \"It was coming so fast,\" said Lauden McLean, 18. \"The wind took the flame and lit everything up.\" \n \u2014\u2014- \n Star-Advertiser reporters Craig Gima and Nanea Kalani contributed to this story. \n ", "author": "Rosemarie Bernardo & Leila Fujimori", "title": "Firefighters battle blaze at junkyard near scene of Waianae brush fire"}

Watson on Thursday sentenced Calvin Kim, 55, to 36 months in prison. His wife, Chun Cha Kim, 64, was sentenced to 12 months, according to the U.S. Attorney's office in Honolulu. \n Calvin Kim pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the government and Chun Cha Kim pleaded guilty to willfully failing to pay taxes, according to a press release.

According to information produced to the court, the Kims already have paid more than $4 million in back taxes and interest, U.S. Attorney Florence T. Nakakuni said. \n The Kims operated two companies that sold heating pads and other products, and in October 2000 became followers of so-called \"tax protesters,\" according to the U.S. Attorney's office. \n Court documents show that from 2005 to 2012, their business tax returns showed earnings ranging from $418,238 to $971,983 for Calvin Kim for each year, and $271,564 to $1,000,562 for Chun Cha Kim. \n ", "author": "Star-Advertiser staff", "title": "Hawaii couple sentenced to prison after evading $4 million in taxes"}
