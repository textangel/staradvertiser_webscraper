{"date": "November 19, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A South Korean protester wearing a mask listened to a speech during a rally calling for South Korean President Park Geun-hye to step down in Seoul, South Korea, today. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> South Korean prosecutors said they believe President Park Geun-hye conspired in criminal activities of a secretive confidante who allegedly manipulated government affairs and exploited her presidential ties to amass an illicit fortune \u2014 a damning revelation that may convince opposition parties to push for her impeachment. \n Prosecutors are planning to soon question Park, who has immunity but can be investigated, said Lee Young-ryeol, chief prosecutor of the Seoul Central Prosecutors' Office. \n Prosecutors on Sunday formally charged Park's longtime friend, Choi Soon-sil, on suspicion of interfering with state affairs and bullying companies into giving tens of millions of dollars to foundations she controlled. \n In a televised news conference, Lee said that based on the evidence, \"the president was involved as a conspirator in a considerable part of the criminal activities by suspects Choi Soon-sil, Ahn Jong-beom and Jung Ho-sung.\" He was referring to two presidential aides who also were formally charged Sunday for allegedly helping Choi. \n \"However, because of the president's impunity from prosecution stated in Article 84 of the constitution, we cannot indict the president. The special investigation headquarters will continue to push for an investigation of the president based on this judgment,\" Lee said. \n Park is facing growing calls to resign over the scandal critics say has undermined the country's democracy. Emboldened by huge protests in recent weeks, opposition parties have been stepping up pressure on Park to quit. \n Opposition parties have so far refrained from seriously pushing for Park's impeachment over fears of triggering a backlash from conservative voters and negatively impacting next year's presidential election. \n However, there are growing voices within the opposition saying that an impeachment attempt is inevitable because it's unlikely Park will resign and give up her immunity. \n Ahn Jong-beom, Park's former senior secretary for policy coordination, has been under suspicion of pressuring companies into making large donations to foundations Choi controlled. \n Jung Ho-sung, another former presidential aide who was also indicted, has been accused of passing on classified presidential documents to Choi, including information on ministerial candidates. \n Prosecutors are also seeking to indict Cha Eun-taek, a famous music video director who allegedly used his close relationships with Choi to win lucrative government culture projects, and former vice sports minister Kim Chong, suspected of providing business favors to sports organizations controlled by Choi. \n Kim is also under suspicion of influencing the ministry's decision to financially support a sports foundation run by Choi's niece, who prosecutors detained on Friday. \n On Saturday, police said about 170,000 people turned out for the latest anti-Park protest in streets near City Hall and a boulevard fronting an old palace gate in Seoul. \n Demonstrators also marched in streets near the presidential offices, carrying candles and illuminating cellphones, and shouting \"Park Geun-hye step down\" and \"Arrest Park Geun-hye.\" \n Park's term lasts until Feb. 24, 2018. If she steps down before the presidential vote on Dec. 20, 2017, an election must be held within 60 days. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "South Korean prosecutors say Park conspired with her friend"}

{"date": "November 19, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Police in riot gear held counter-protestors away from a White Lives Matter rally in front of the Texas State Capitol in Austin, Texas, today. \n AUSTIN, Texas >> Eight people were arrested on Saturday as White Lives Matter protesters were confronted by counter-demonstrators supporting Black Lives Matter at the Texas State Capitol near where Gov. Greg Abbott had earlier dedicated a monument recognizing the contribution of African-Americans to the state. \n Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Sgt. Victor Taylor said four of the arrests were for assault, two for evading arrest, one for disorderly conduct and one for \"interference with public duty.\" Two of those arrested were on Capitol grounds and the others on adjacent streets. \n \"Some protesters assaulted other protesters,\" Taylor said. \"We don't know for sure which side they were on. A lot of them were co-mingled.\" \n Austin police and state troopers dressed in riot gear had tried to keep the two groups separated. \n Taylor said the confrontation did not affect the unveiling of the monument, which was in a different part of the grounds. \n About two dozen individuals with the White Lives Matter group demonstrated against what they called the unequal application of hate crimes laws, which they say are applied in a way that favors minorities. The group said it was a coincidence that its protest was held at about the same time as the ceremony for the monument. \n The White Lives Matter group was shouted down by a group of several hundred counter-protesters, who held up signs that said \"Stand Against Hate\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" \n During the unveiling ceremony, Abbott told a crowd in attendance that the monument honors African-Americans who helped grow Texas. \n \"The fact is African Americans have shaped this land that we are on today since long before it was even named the state of Texas. They fought for their own freedom. They fought for the freedom of Texas and the freedom of the United States of America,\" Abbott said. \n The monument is located on the Capitol's south lawn, close to other monuments that honor Confederate soldiers for their service during the Civil War. \n The new monument features the African-American experience in Texas, from exploration in the 1500s to slavery and emancipation to achievement in arts and science. \n It will be the 21st monument on the Capitol grounds and the second memorial dedicated to a specific ethnic group.

{"date": "November 19, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Cell phones light up the beaches of Cape Canaveral and Cocoa Beach, Fla., north of the Cocoa Beach Pier as spectators watched the launch of the NOAA GOES-R weather satellite today. \n CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. >> The most advanced weather satellite ever built rocketed into space Saturday night, part of an $11 billion effort to revolutionize forecasting and save lives. \n This new GOES-R spacecraft will track U.S. weather as never before: hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, volcanic ash clouds, wildfires, lightning storms, even solar flares. Indeed, about 50 TV meteorologists from around the country converged on the launch site \u2014 including NBC's Al Roker \u2014 along with 8,000 space program workers and guests. \n \"What's so exciting is that we're going to be getting more data, more often, much more detailed, higher resolution,\" Roker said. In the case of tornadoes, \"if we can give people another 10, 15, 20 minutes, we're talking about lives being saved.\" \n Think superhero speed and accuracy for forecasting. Super high-definition TV, versus black-and-white. \n \"Really a quantum leap above any satellite NOAA has ever flown,\" said Stephen Volz, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's director of satellites. \n \"For the American public, that will mean faster, more accurate weather forecasts and warnings,\" Volz said earlier in the week. \"That also will mean more lives saved and better environmental intelligence\" for government officials responsible for hurricane and other evacuations. \n Airline passengers also stand to benefit, as do rocket launch teams. Improved forecasting will help pilots avoid bad weather and help rocket scientists know when to call off a launch. \n The first in a series of four high-tech satellites, GOES-R hitched a ride on an unmanned Atlas V rocket, delayed an hour by rocket and other problems. NOAA teamed up with NASA for the mission. \n The satellite \u2014 valued by NOAA at $1 billion \u2014 is aiming for a 22,300-mile-high equatorial orbit. There, it will join three aging spacecraft with 40-year-old technology, and become known as GOES-16. After months of testing, this newest satellite will take over for one of the older ones. The second satellite in the series will follow in 2018. All told, the series should stretch to 2036. \n GOES stands for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. The first was launched in 1975. \n GOES-R's premier imager \u2014 one of six science instruments \u2014 will offer three times as many channels as the existing system, four times the resolution and five times the scan speed, said NOAA program director Greg Mandt. A similar imager is also flying on a Japanese weather satellite. \n Typically, it will churn out full images of the Western Hemisphere every 15 minutes and the continental United States every five minutes. Specific storm regions will be updated every 30 seconds. \n Forecasters will get pictures \"like they've never seen before,\" Mandt promised. \n A first-of-its-kind lightning mapper, meanwhile, will take 500 snapshots a second. \n This next-generation GOES program \u2014 $11 billion in all \u2014 includes four satellites, an extensive land system of satellite dishes and other equipment, and new methods for crunching the massive, nonstop stream of expected data. \n Hurricane Matthew, interestingly enough, delayed the launch by a couple weeks. As the hurricane bore down on Florida in early October, launch preps were put on hold. Matthew stayed far enough offshore to cause minimal damage to Cape Canaveral, despite some early forecasts that suggested a direct strike. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Best weather satellite ever built rockets into space"}

Fed by gusty winds on Friday, it threatened homes and engulfed a used auto parts dealer, torching hundreds of cars on the lot. But Honolulu Fire Department personnel managed to fight it back. \n With the fire contained to the forest reserve, DLNR's Division of Forestry and Wildlife took the lead today. The Honolulu Fire Department shifted to a support role, offering its tender vehicle for refueling and maintenance of helicopters and a water tank, but not deploying its own firefighters on the ground. \n DLNR spokeswoman Deborah Ward said her department sent 16 ground personnel and contracted helicopters to fight the fire this morning in the lower part of the Waianae Kai Forest Reserve. \n \"It's steep terrain, but it's not in the upper areas of the Waianae mountains,\" Ward said this morning. \"As of yet, it's not likely that native or endangered species are being affected, but we'll have to see what happens today.\" \n The affected area has dense guinea grass, haole koa, silk oak and other non-native species. \n Meanwhile, the Fire Department reported that the lower, populated section of Waianae Valley was safe. \n \"The lower area is secured,\" said Capt. David Jenkins, public information officer for the Honolulu Fire Department. \"It's totally contained. Everything down in the valley is OK.\" \n \"If there is a need or there are concerns, people can still call the Honolulu Fire Department,\" he added. \"We will go out and assess and do what's needed to keep the community safe.\" \n Jenkins said investigators have not determined what first triggered the fire, but the weather whipped it up. \n \"The winds were a definite major factor in regards to this,\" he said. \"It caused the fire to quickly spread and hampered fire-fighting efforts in the initial stages of fighting the fire.\" \n The last major fire in the upper valley are burned 1,200 acres in June 2012, including 400 acres of forest reserve. \n ", "author": "By Susan Essoyan sessoyan@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Waianae fire burns 1,000 acres of watershed, forest reserve"}

{"date": "November 19, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence pause for photographs as they arrive at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster clubhouse in Bedminster, N.J., today. \n BEDMINSTER, N.J. >> Mitt Romney said he had a \"far-reaching conversation\" with President-elect Donald Trump. \n The 2012 GOP presidential nominee met privately with Trump for about an hour today at Trump's private golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. Romney told reporters afterward that the two had a \"very thorough and in-depth discussion\" and said he appreciated \"the chance to speak with\" Trump. \n Romney did not respond to questions about whether he would consider joining the administration. \n Trump walked Romney out at the end of the meeting and said \"it went great.\" \n The sit-down comes after an acrimonious election year. Romney was a harsh critic of Trump, calling him a \"con man.\" Trump called Romney a \"choke artist\" because of his loss to President Barack Obama. Trump and Romney have been trying to mend fences since then. \n Trump will meet Sunday with two leading supporters, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani. \n On Friday, Trump picked Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, signaling a sharp rightward shift in U.S. security policy as he begins to form his Cabinet. \n Trump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. A former military intelligence chief, Flynn has accused the Obama administration of being too soft on terrorism and has cast Islam as a \"political ideology\" and driver of extremism. \n The selections form the first outlines of Trump's Cabinet and national security teams. Given his lack of governing experience and vague policy proposals during the campaign, his selection of advisers is being scrutinized both in the U.S. and abroad. \n Trump's initial decisions suggest a more aggressive military involvement in counterterror strategy and a greater emphasis on Islam's role in stoking extremism. Sessions, who is best known for his hardline immigration views, has questioned whether terrorist suspects should benefit from the rights available in U.S. courts. Pompeo has said Muslim leaders are \"potentially complicit\" in attacks if they do not denounce violence carried out in the name of Islam. \n Pompeo's nomination to lead the CIA also opens the prospect of the U.S. resuming torture of detainees. Trump has backed harsh interrogation techniques that President Barack Obama and Congress have banned, saying the U.S. \"should go tougher than waterboarding,\" which simulates drowning. In 2014, Pompeo criticized Obama for \"ending our interrogation program\" and said intelligence officials \"are not torturers, they are patriots.\" \n Sessions and Pompeo would both require Senate confirmation; Flynn would not. \n In a separate matter Friday, it was announced that Trump had agreed to a $25 million settlement to resolve three lawsuits over Trump University, his former school for real estate investors. The lawsuits alleged the school misled students and failed to deliver on its promises in programs that cost up to $35,000. \n Trump has denied the allegations and had said repeatedly he would not settle. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who announced the settlement, called it \"a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.\" \n Trump tweeted to his 15 million followers Saturday that he only settled to better focus on leading the U.S. \n On Friday night, Pence became the latest celebrity to attend the Broadway hit show \"Hamilton\" \u2014 but he was the first to get a direct message from a cast member from the stage. \n Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, the nation's third vice president, recited a message from the stage: \"We, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights.\" He went on: \"We truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values, and work on behalf of all of us.\" \n Pence's appearance at the show was tense from the outset, drawing cheers and boos as he arrived. Pence ducked out before Dixon finished but heard the rest of the remarks in the hallway. \n Trump is still weighing a range of candidates for other leading national security posts. Possibilities for secretary of state are said to Giuliani, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who met with Trump on Thursday. \n Most of Trump's nominees are expected to be confirmed relatively easily given the GOP majority in the Senate. However, potential roadblocks exist, particularly for Sessions, the first senator to endorse Trump and one of the chamber's most conservative members. \n His last Senate confirmation hearing, in 1986 for a federal judgeship, was derailed over allegations that he made racist comments, including calling a black assistant U.S. attorney \"boy\" in conversation.

He told The Associated Press he won't vote for Clinton under any circumstance. \n \"As a Christian, I came to the conclusion that Mr. Trump is not biblically qualified for that office,\" he said. \n He said he has heard from ecstatic Clinton supporters and even supportive Republicans, but also from outraged Trump backers writing \"threatening and vile things.\" \n Sisneros signed a state party pledge to support the GOP's standard-bearer, but that was before Trump was the official nominee. He said one of his options is to resign, allowing the state party to choose another elector. \n Electors are chosen by party officials and are typically the party's most loyal members. Presidential electors are not required to vote for a particular candidate under the Constitution. Even so, the National Archives says more than 99 percent of electors have voted as pledged throughout the nation's history. \n Some state laws call for fines against \"faithless electors,\" while others open them to possible felony charges, although the National Archives says no elector has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote as pledged. In North Carolina, a faithless elector's vote is canceled, and he or she must immediately resign and be replaced. \n Layne Bangerter and Melinda Smyser, two of Idaho's four Republican electors, said they have been flooded with emails, telephone calls and Facebook messages from strangers urging them to reconsider their vote. \n \"It's just not going to work,\" Bangerter said. \"I hope it dies down, but I don't see that happening.\" \n The volume and tone of the messages caught the attention of Idaho's secretary of state, who urged the public to remain civil as electors prepare to cast their ballots on Dec. 19 while meeting in their states. \n Republican Party officials in Georgia and Michigan said their electors also have been bombarded with messages, and Iowa reported increased public interest in obtaining contact information for electors. \n Michael Banerian, 22, one of Michigan's 16 Republican electors, said he has received death threats from people who do not want him to vote for Trump. But he said he is undeterred. \n \"It's mostly just a lot of angry people who don't completely understand how the process works,\" said Banerian, a political science major at Oakland University. \n P. Bret Chiafalo, a Democratic elector in Washington state, said he and a small group of other electors from the party are working to contact their Republican counterparts and ask them to vote for any GOP candidate besides Trump, preferably Mitt Romney or John Kasich. \n Under the Constitution, the House \u2014 currently under Republican control \u2014 decides the presidency if no candidate reaches the required electoral vote majority.

She said they had given her family strength as they kept the hope for nearly 30 years to have Marcos buried at the country's Heroes' Cemetery, which is reserved for former presidents, national artists and soldiers. \n Thousands of pro-democracy activists who rallied in Manila on Friday said the decades-long debate over Marcos' final resting place was far from over, and they were planning more protests in the days and weeks ahead. \n President Rodrigo Duterte, who gave the go-ahead for the burial, appealed for calm. \n \"I know Ferdinand will at last be at rest here at the Heroes' Cemetery,\" Imelda Marcos said in front of a black tomb surrounded by wreaths of white flowers. \"But I know we still have a lot of criticisms to face.\" \n Her daughter, Ilocos Norte provincial Gov. Imee Marcos, and son Sen. Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. also thanked supporters and apologized for keeping the burial secret. The son said there were reports that anti-Marcos groups would create trouble. \n The burial threatens to open old wounds in the Philippines, where Marcos' 20-year iron-fist rule was marked by massive human rights violations and corruption. He was ousted in \"people power\" street protests in 1986 that sent him and his family into exile in Hawaii, where he died three years later. \n Vice President Leni Robredo, who ran in May elections under Duterte's rival party, questioned why the burial was carried out even before a Supreme Court decision allowing it has become final. \n \"We are alarmed by the brazenness of its execution,\" she said in a speech. \"Hidden wealth, hidden human rights abuses, and now a hidden burial with complete disrespect for the rule of law.\" \n Bonifacio Ilagan, a left-wing activist who was detained and tortured during Marcos' rule, said the dictator was buried \"like a thief in the night.\" \n \"This is so Marcos style. I want to rush to the cemetery to protest this. I feel so enraged,\" Ilagan told The Associated Press on Friday. \n A lawmaker considered asking the Supreme Court to exhume the newly buried Marcos. But Duterte, who is attending an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima, Peru, said through his spokesman that \"hopefully both sides will exercise maximum tolerance and come to terms with the burial.\" \n The powerful Marcos family has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and after returning from U.S. exile in 1991, Imelda Marcos and two of her children eventually ran for public office and won stunning political comebacks. Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ran for vice president in May and lost by a slim margin to Robredo. \n In 1993, Marcos' body was taken to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, where it was displayed in a glass coffin and became a tourist attraction. But his family fought for his remains to be transferred to the Heroes' Cemetery. \n Duterte backed Marcos' burial, saying it was his right as a president and soldier. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Kin gather at Philippine dictator Marcos' tomb amid protests"}
