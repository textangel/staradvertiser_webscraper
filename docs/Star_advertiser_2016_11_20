{"date": "November 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Obama, speaking on the margins of an Asia-Pacific summit, said tensions over trade are likely under the new Trump administration and trade pacts may be modified. But he predicted that once the administration sees how the deals are working, \"they'll determine that it's actually good both for the United States and our trading partners.\" \n LIMA, Peru >> President Barack Obama said Sunday he'd avoided ethical scandals throughout his administration by trying to follow the spirit, not just the letter of the law, and suggested President-elect Donald Trump would be wise to follow his example. \n Closing out his final foreign trip, Obama was asked about the complex conflict-of-interest questions Trump faces as he transitions from real estate mogul to Oval Office occupant. Though Obama declined to explicitly offer Trump advice, the president said he'd been served well by selling his assets and investing them in Treasury bills. \n \"It simplified my life,\" Obama said. \"I did not have to worry about the complexities of whether a decision that I made might even inadvertently benefit me.\" \n Good government advocates have criticized Trump's decision not to liquidate his sprawling business interests, but put them in a blind trust entrusted to his children, who are playing major roles in helping him form his administration and are expected to remain involved in one capacity or another. \n Obama said he was proud his administration hadn't faced the scandals he said have \"plagued\" other administrations. He said after eight years, he felt he could tell Americans he'd lived up to his promise to run an accountable and ethical government. \n He summed up the rule of thumb his first White House counsel used to come up with policies for his administration: \"If it sounds like it would be fun, then you can't do it.\" \n Obama's remarks came as he concluded his final world tour as president. For Obama, it was the last time he'd take questions on foreign soil, a staple of his overseas trips that his administration has seen as an important symbol of America's commitment to a rigorous free press. \n Obama chatted briefly earlier Sunday with Russian President Vladimir Putin as the summit got under way. The conversation, which was likely to be the leaders' last face-to-face interaction, lasted just four minutes. \n Obama later told reporters he encouraged Putin to uphold his country's commitments under the Minsk deal aimed at ending the Ukraine conflict. Both the White House and the Kremlin said the leaders had agreed that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov should keep working throughout Obama's final months on initiatives to lower violence in Syria and alleviate suffering. \n Putin, speaking later in Lima, said he and Obama had noted that while their working relationship had been difficult, they'd \"always respected each other's positions \u2014 and each other.\" \n \"I thanked him for the years of joint work, and said that at any time, if he considers it possible and will have the need and desire, we will be happy to see him in Russia,\" Putin said. \n The short interaction came amid intense speculation and concern about whether Trump's election might herald a more conciliatory U.S. approach to Russia. Under Obama, the U.S. has enacted severe sanctions on Russia over its aggressive behavior in Ukraine and has sought unsuccessfully to persuade Moscow to stop intervening in Syria's civil war to help prop up Syrian President Bashar Assad. \n Questions about Trump trailed Obama throughout his final overseas trip, as anxious world leaders quizzed him on Trump's stances on key issues like trade, foreign policy and the NATO alliance. On his final day in Peru, Obama sought to reassure world leaders gathered here that their longstanding ties with the U.S. wouldn't falter under Trump. \n Sitting down with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia, Obama said he assured Turnbull that the alliance between their countries would remain as strong as ever. Turnbull said he and Obama were of the mind on trade \u2014 an issue Trump sees quite differently. Still, he added that Australia wanted the U.S. to succeed under Trump. \n Both the U.S. and Australia helped negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade agreement involving 10 other Pacific Rim countries. But Congress is unlikely to ratify the deal, dealing a blow to Obama's once high hopes of having the agreement become part of his presidential legacy. Trump says trade deals can hurt U.S. workers, and he opposes TPP. \n Obama, who met with TPP country leaders the day before, said they'd told him they want to move ahead with the deal. \n \"Preferably, they'd like to move forward with the United States,\" Obama said. \n He alluded to a competing deal China is trying to broker that he said would be worse for workers and environmental concerns. \n Meeting with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Obama said he had no doubt the close and important U.S.-Canada relationship will persist after he leaves office, saying that's been constant with Republican and Democratic administrations alike. Trudeau said he's invited President-elect Donald Trump to visit Canada soon after Inauguration Day and hopes to welcome him to Canada. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama suggests Trump follow his example on business conflicts"}

{"date": "November 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Eric Trump, son of President-elect Donald Trump, arrives at Trump Tower, Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016, in New York. \n NEW YORK >> Nearly every morning since their father's stunning victory on Election Day, three of Donald Trump's grown children walk through the Trump Tower lobby and board an elevator. But are Don Jr., Ivanka and Eric going to the campaign office on the fifth floor? Their business offices on the 25th floor? The president-elect's penthouse on the 56th floor? \n That uncertainty highlights the multiple roles the children play for their father. For the past year, the lines were constantly blurred between political campaign and business empire, raising questions about a possible conflict of interest between Trump's White House and his sprawling business interests. \n The children are poised to wield incredible influence over their father, even if they don't follow him to Washington. Trump said consistently during the campaign that if he won, those children would stay in New York and run his business. But the three \u2014 plus Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner \u2014 were all named to the transition team's executive committee. \n So far, they've been heavily involved in shaping the new administration. They've sat in on meetings and taken late night calls from their father. They advocated for making Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, the White House chief of staff. They counseled against bringing back Corey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, who was fired in June on their advice. \n On Thursday, Ivanka Trump and Kushner were present for the president-elect's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Trump Tower. \n Trump has insisted he will build a wall between his White House and his company by placing his holdings into a blind trust, but with his children as its trustees. Federal requirements are that independent outsiders run such trusts. \n \"We are in the process of vetting various structures with the goal of the immediate transfer of management of The Trump Organization and its portfolio of businesses to Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump as well as a team of highly skilled executives,\" Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said. She said the structure \"will comply with all applicable rules and regulations.\" \n Trump's company would be the largest business portfolio to belong to a modern sitting president. Federal ethics rules would allow Trump to run his business interests from the White House, or, perhaps more likely, influence decisions made by his children. \n That raises conflict of interest concerns. For example, Trump could set domestic policy while making deals abroad that could affect his corporation, even if it were technically in his children's hands. \n Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser, disputed the idea that the Trump children's involvement in the transition could lead to a breach of trust. \n \"You're presuming that they are doing certain things that they should not be doing,\" Conway said. \"They are his children. And they've been his business colleagues for a long period of time. They obviously will support their father as president.\" \n But the potentially problematic entanglement revealed itself this past week when Ivanka Trump's company promoted a $10,800 bracelet she wore during a \"60 Minutes\" interview on CBS. The spokeswoman for the company later apologized. \n The children \u2014 they were not made available for interviews \u2014 are limited in what formal role they could take in a Trump administration. \n Congress passed an anti-nepotism law in 1967 that prohibits the president from appointing a family member to work in the office or agency they oversee. The measure was passed as a reaction to President John F. Kennedy appointing his brother Robert as attorney general. \n But the law does not appear to prevent the children \u2014 or Kushner, who is one of Trump's closest aides and is said to be weighing a White House role \u2014 from serving as unpaid advisers or providing informal counsel. \n The three grown children \u2014 their mother is Ivana Trump, Trump's first wife \u2014 delivered well-received speeches at this summer's Republican National Convention in which they tried to humanize their father. \n Don Jr. and Eric were staples on conservative radio and on the road, trekking to campaign offices and small rallies across battleground states like Ohio and North Carolina. Ivanka Trump, meanwhile, was utilized in some of the campaign's biggest moments, including introducing her father before his convention speech, unveiling his family leave plan and campaigning across the crucial Philadelphia suburbs. \n Another daughter, Tiffany Trump, a recent college graduate whose mother is Trump's second wife, Marla Maples, also made appearances on her father's behalf. Trump's youngest child, 10-year-old Barron, whose mother is the president-elect's current wife, Melania, is enrolled at a private Manhattan school. Trump on Sunday told reporters that Mrs. Trump and their son will move to Washington after the school year ends. \n For the three eldest Trump kids, there were bumps in the road. \n Eric and Ivanka were the subject of some embarrassing headlines when it was revealed that they were not registered to vote in time for their father in the New York primary. An African big-game safari Eric and Don Jr. took drew criticism from animal rights activists. And Don Jr. has received criticism for tweeting images likening Syrian refugees to a poisoned bowl of Skittles candy and a cartoon character appropriated by white supremacists. \n But now they stand poised to be the most influential presidential children in decades, as recent White House offspring have been far younger than the eldest Trump children, who are all in their 30s. During the campaign, Eric Trump insisted that the children's main focus \"was the company,\" but \"we'd always be one phone call away\" if needed, the younger Trump told The Associated Press in May. \"We'd do anything for the man.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump children's roles blur line between transition, company"}

{"date": "November 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Rescuers search among the debris after 14 coaches of an overnight passenger train rolled off the track near Pukhrayan village Kanpur Dehat district, Uttar Pradesh state, India, Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016. Dozens were killed and dozens more were injured in the accident. \n PUKHRAYAN, India >> Rescuers worked through the night to pull people out of mangled coaches after an overnight passenger train derailed early Sunday in northern India, killing at least 115 people, police said. \n The death toll was expected to rise further because rescue workers had yet to gain access to one of the worst-damaged of the 14 coaches that derailed, said Daljeet Chaudhary, a director general of police. About 150 people were injured, he said. \n The train derailed at around 3:10 a.m., jolting awake passengers who had settled in for the long trip. Survivors and bodies were retrieved from mangled coaches that had fallen on their side. \n Ramchandra Tewari, a passenger who suffered a head injury, said he was asleep when he was suddenly flung to the floor of his coach. \n \"There was a loud sound like an earthquake. I fell from my berth and a lot of luggage fell over me,\" Tewari told reporters from his hospital bed in the city of Kanpur. \"I thought I was dead, and then I passed out.\" \n Another passenger, Satish Kumar, said the train was traveling at normal speed when it stopped suddenly. \n \"It restarted, and then we heard a crash,\" Kumar, whose coach remained standing on the track, said at the derailment site. \"When we came out of the train, we saw a few coaches had derailed.\" \n The cause of the derailment was not immediately clear. Accidents are relatively common on India's sprawling rail network, which is the world's third largest but lacks modern signaling and communication systems. Most accidents are blamed on poor maintenance and human error. \n The impact of the derailment was so strong that one of the coaches landed on top of another, crushing the one below, said Brig. Anurag Chibber, who was heading the army's rescue team. \n \"We fear there could be many more dead in the lower coach,\" he said, adding that it was unclear how many people were in the coach. \n Javeed Ahmad, the police chief of Uttar Pradesh state, where the derailment took place, said 115 bodies had been recovered from the wreckage. \n The derailment occurred near the village of Pukhrayan, outside of Kanpur, an industrial city about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southeast of New Delhi. The Patna-Indore Express train, linking the central Indian city of Indore to the city of Patna to its northeast, completes its 1,360-kilometer (845-mile) journey in 27 hours. \n Rescue workers, soldiers and members of India's disaster management force reached Pukhrayan within an hour of the derailment and began pulling out people trapped in the overturned coaches. \n Rescuers used cutting torches to open the derailed train cars to try to reach those trapped inside, while cranes were deployed to lift the coaches from the tracks. However, rescuers moved cautiously because some of the coaches were precariously tilted, and there was a danger that they could topple over, possibly injuring those trapped inside. \n \"We are being very careful in using the cutting torches,\" Chaudhary said. \n Medical teams provided first aid near the site, while the more seriously injured were moved to hospitals in Kanpur, Chaudhary said. Of the roughly 150 injured, 72 were in serious condition, he said. \n Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu arrived at the site by Sunday evening to monitor the rescue and relief operations. He said a special train has been arranged to take passengers from the derailed train to Patna, according to the PTI news agency. He said thousands of food packets, water bottles and cups of tea were being provided to the stranded passengers. \n Anxious relatives of passengers searched for their family members among the injured and the dead at hospitals in Kanpur. \n Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his concern over the derailment. \n \"Anguished beyond words on the loss of lives due to the derailing of the Patna-Indore express. My thoughts are with the bereaved families,\" Modi posted on his Twitter account. \n Kanpur is a major railway junction, and hundreds of trains pass through the city every day. After the derailment, several trains using the line were diverted to other routes, Anil Saxena, spokesman for Indian Railways, said in New Delhi. \n Rail authorities have ordered an investigation into the incident, Saxena said. \n In 2012, an Indian government report said about 15,000 people are killed every year in train accidents in the country, caused mainly by outdated equipment and overstretched staff. \n The country's worst railway accident occurred in 1981, when a passenger train fell into the Baghmati River in northern India, killing nearly 800 people. \n Prime Minister Modi has pledged to invest $137 billion over the next five years to modernize India's railway network, which is used by around 23 million passengers a day. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Biswajeet Banerjee in Lucknow, India, and Nirmala George in New Delhi contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "115 dead as train derails in north India; some still trapped"}

{"date": "November 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2016 photo provided by Denverite.com shows spray painted anti-transgender graffiti on the car of Amber Timmons, a transgender woman, in Denver. After the sweeping Republican election victory on Nov. 9, 2016, transgender people \"are concerned for their safety, survival and legal rights in the coming years,\" said Chase Strangio, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who often works on transgender issues. \n NEW YORK >> Anxiety is high among many transgender Americans after the sweeping Republican election victory. They fear stronger resistance to their push for civil-rights protections, including broader access to public restrooms, and wonder if their newly won right to serve openly in the military is in jeopardy. \n Transgender people \"are concerned for their safety, survival and legal rights in the coming years,\" said Chase Strangio, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who often works on transgender issues. \n Among the specific concerns: \n \u2014 Many transgender people expect that Republican President-elect Donald Trump's administration will abandon or weaken the efforts by President Barack Obama's administration to enable transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice at public schools. Republican officials in numerous states have opposed that campaign, saying schools should not be required to let such students use bathrooms or locker rooms based on their gender identity. \n \u2014 There are fears that more GOP-governed states will approve legislation limiting transgender rights and will reject proposals to expand such rights. \n \u2014 There's uncertainty about the Pentagon's recently adopted policy of allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military. Some conservative groups, including the Family Research Council and the Center for Military Readiness, have suggested a reversal of the policy. So has GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, who serves on the House Armed Services Committee. \n \"The question needs to be asked: Does this make our military more effective and more lethal?\" said Hunter's chief of staff, Joe Kasper. \"It's hard to see how.\" \n Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, was cautiously optimistic that the military's new policy would survive. \n \"I don't know if anything will happen, but we're certainly alert and ready to fight,\" she said. \"Hopefully, good, smart people will prevail.\" \n More broadly, transgender-rights advocates have been dealing with an outpouring of dismay and apprehension in their community. \n Keisling's organization, for example, held a call-in session Friday to provide advice to transgender people worried that changing their gender designation on federal and state identity documents might become more difficult in the new political environment. \n Since his election, Trump has not publicly addressed transgender issues, though he did ease some concerns among gays and lesbians by saying that he considered same-sex marriage to be settled law. Transgender-rights activists remain wary, depicting Vice President-elect Mike Pence and some members of Trump's transition team as hostile to their causes. \n Jennifer Finney Boylan, a transgender author who teaches at Barnard College in New York, said in an email that she fears conservatives will now seek to \"isolate and marginalize transgender people\" and make them feel separated from the broader gay rights movement. \n On the state level, transgender activists have taken heart that Republican North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, who incurred sharp criticism for signing a bill limiting transgender people's bathroom access, is trailing slightly in still-incomplete returns. Prospects for repealing the bill are uncertain, however, given continued GOP control of the legislature, and a similar bill already has been introduced in Texas. \n Republican Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is president of the state Senate, listed what he called a \"Women's Privacy Act\" as one of his top 10 priorities when the legislature reconvenes in January. \n \"A majority of Texans in both political parties and in every ethnic and demographic group believe that women and girls should have privacy and safety in their restrooms, showers and locker rooms,\" Patrick said. \"Unfortunately, legislation is necessary to assure that they do.\" \n Another proposed Texas bill would overturn nondiscrimination ordinances protecting LGBT people at the local level. Dallas, Austin and Fort Worth are among the cities with such protections. \n Shannon Minter, a transgender man who is legal director of the San Francisco-based National Center for Lesbian Rights, said many transgender civil-rights gains of recent years are based on federal statutes and court precedents that cannot be quickly undone. However, he expressed dismay at the willingness of some conservatives to target transgender people with so-called bathroom bills. \n \"Like others in our country, transgender people want to be able to live safely, to be able to work and have access to decent health care, and to be able to live with dignity,\" Minter said in an email. \"We don't want to be in the crosshairs of a trumped-up culture war.\" \n Sunday's Transgender Day of Remembrance, an annual commemoration of transgender people who have been killed in bias-related homicides, added to the community's somber mood. According to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs, 23 transgender or gender-fluid people have been homicide victims in the U.S. so far this year, one more than the coalition tallied in all of 2015. Nearly all were black or Latina transgender women. \n Some activists fear that violence could worsen in the aftermath of the election. \n Dana Beyer, executive director of Gender Rights Maryland, said she is encouraging transgender people, and the parents of transgender youths, to move to \"safe spaces\" \u2014 cities and states with legal protections and a supportive culture. \n Dru Levasseur, Transgender Rights Project director for the LGBT-rights group Lambda Legal, said postelection worries were particularly intense among transgender youths and immigrants, and transgender people of color. \n \"I've heard from many people that they feel scared and alone, but they are not alone, especially now,\" Levasseur said. \"There is an army of smart lawyers and activists who are committed to protecting them and fighting for them.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "GOP sweep heightens anxiety for many transgender Americans"}

He said he doesn't know if the passengers from Sacramento knew there was a Gold Star family on board or whether people sitting in the coach section complained. \n \"It was just disgusting behavior from people in first class; it was terrible to see,\" Perry said. \n Perry, 30, and another American soldier died of injuries inflicted by an improvised explosive device Nov. 12 inside Bagram Airfield. \n The husband and father of two young children died a hero, his father said. \n \"He made a decision that saved a lot of people,\" he said. \"I was told that he was found protecting a female soldier. . He didn't get to live a full life, but he lived.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Gold Star family of slain California soldier booed on flight"}

{"date": "November 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Nov. 11, 2016 photo, a gravestone, left, with the inscription UNKNOWN U.S. SAILOR, is adorned with a flower and a small pumpkin at Long Island National Cemetery in Farmingdale, N.Y. A WWII researcher says he has documents showing the grave is one of four that each holds the body of a sailor who perished on Jan. 3, 1944, when their ship, the USS Turner, exploded and sank at the entrance to New York Harbor. That researcher believes many more victims of the disaster were buried in the graves together. The Pentagon still lists 136 sailors from the disaster as missing. \n It's a confounding mystery of World War II: What happened to the 136 missing sailors from the explosion and sinking of the USS Turner? \n After all, the ship did not go down in battle or even in the open sea, but while anchored near New York Harbor in 1944, so close to the city that shockwaves from the onboard munitions blasts shattered windows in some buildings. \n Now, newly discovered documents show that the remains of four of the missing sailors were indeed found and buried not long after the disaster in separate graves for unknowns in a Long Island veterans cemetery. \n And the researcher who found the documents suspects many more remains could have been found and buried along with them in those same simple gravesites, marked only with the words \"Unknown U.S. Sailor\" and \"January 3, 1944,\" the day the destroyer sank. \n \"Just don't throw them in the ground and forget about them,\" said military historian Ted Darcy, who is turning over his findings to the Pentagon. \"These guys have been neglected by our government. It's not fair, especially to their families.\" \n Darcy's hope is that the military will exhume the four gravesites, identify the remains and rebury them with a proper memorial. \n The Pentagon still officially lists 136 Turner sailors as missing. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the federal office responsible for recovering and identifying the nation's missing war dead, didn't respond to repeated requests from The Associated Press about Darcy's findings. \n The Turner, a 10-month-old destroyer returning from convoy duty in the Atlantic, was anchored a few miles off Sandy Hook, New Jersey, when an explosion erupted below deck, setting much of the ship ablaze. More explosions followed, the last breaking the ship in two. \n While no cause of the initial blast was ever determined, a Navy report mentioned anti-submarine munitions were being defused around the time. \n More than 150 men were rescued, but 136 others went down with the ship, according to Darcy's research. He said the Navy's National Archives file on the yearlong salvage operation contains no information, including how many sets of remains were eventually recovered from the 55 feet of water where the ship sank. Darcy contends many of the bodies would have likely been intact on the ship in compartments sealed with watertight doors. \n According to 1944 interment records for the Long Island veterans cemetery in Farmingdale, the remains of four Turner sailors were buried in individual graves within a year of the disaster. \n But Darcy, a retired Marine from Locust Grove, Virginia, believes all or most of the remains were found and comingled in the four graves. \"I went to the Navy and they said, 'Hey, we don't know how many are in there,'\" he said. \n Darcy said comingling of unidentified remains was a fairly common practice, particularly when the Navy was overburdened at the height of World War II. The Long Island cemetery has multiple graves containing the remains of more than one WWII serviceman, while the remains of 388 USS Oklahoma crewmembers disinterred in 2015 for identification were buried in 45 mass graves in Hawaii. \n Another WWII MIA expert, Mark Noah, founder of Florida-based History Flight, said he \"wouldn't doubt it at all\" if Turner graves contained the remains of multiple sailors. \"Skeletal remains can pack out a full coffin with more than a dozen people,\" he said. \n Loved ones from the Turner disaster were initially told only that their sailor was missing. If remains had been found and buried, they were never informed. \n \"Oh, my goodness. I would've liked to have known that,\" 82-year-old Marjorie Avery, of Corsicana, Texas, told the AP by phone. Her father, Henry S. Wygant Jr., was the Turner's captain and still officially listed as missing. \n Several relatives of now-deceased Turner sailors who survived the disaster told the AP their loved ones also were never told about the graves. Two of the last Turner survivors still living \u2014 James Thomas, of Leivasy, West Virginia, and Robert Mowry, of Irwin, Pennsylvania \u2014 also said they didn't know. \n More than 70 years later, their memories of the disaster remain clear yet tinged with stoicism typical of so many WWII veterans. \n \"It's just one of those things that happen in a war,\" said Mowry, 91. \"It was just us at the wrong place at the wrong time, that's all.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "WWII mystery: Are 'missing' sailors actually in NY cemetery?"}

{"date": "November 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this image made from a video provided by Hamilton LLC, actor Brandon Victor Dixon who plays Aaron Burr, the nation's third vice president, in \"Hamilton\" speaks from the stage after the curtain call in New York, Friday, Nov. 18, 2016. Vice President-elect Mike Pence is the latest celebrity to attend the Broadway hit \"Hamilton,\" but the first to get a sharp message from a cast member from the stage. \n NEW YORK >> President-elect Donald Trump, in the midst of choosing his Cabinet, took time out Sunday for a second day to criticize the cast of the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" and demand an apology for a message an actor delivered from the stage to Trump's running mate about the need for diversity in America. But Vice President-elect Mike Pence said he wasn't offended by the message. \n Pence said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he heard the boos and cheers when he walked into the Richard Rodgers Theatre with his nephew and daughter on Friday night to see the show. He said he told his daughter: \"That's what freedom sounds like.\" \n Trump had a different take on the message from cast member Brandon Victor Dixon, who had expressed his concerns in a prepared speech after the curtain call about the incoming Republican administration. \n \"We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,\" said Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, the nation's third vice president, as his fellow actors joined hands. \"We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.\" \n Trump tweeted Saturday that Pence had been \"harassed\" by the cast. He called them \"very rude\" and demanded they apologize. On Sunday, while awaiting a second day of meetings as he works to vet potential candidates for his administration, he repeated his order for an apology \u2014 and added a dig at the critically acclaimed show, which is sold out until September. \n \"The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior,\" he tweeted. \n But Pence told Fox News that \"Hamilton\" was an \"incredible production\" involving a very talented cast. On whether he thought an apology was necessary, he said: \"I'll leave it to others whether that was the appropriate venue to say it.\" \n When prompted by Trump for an apology, Dixon responded on Twitter that \"conversation is not harassment sir\" and added that he appreciated Pence stopping to listen. \n Reaction to the debacle was mixed, with some calling Dixon's speech \"disrespectful\" and threatening to boycott the show and others saying it was an important message that needed to be delivered. \n The musical is by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the story, music and lyrics. It stresses the orphan, immigrant roots of first U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton and has a terrifically varied score, ranging from pop ballads to gospel to sexy R&B. It has been cheered for reclaiming the nation's founding story with a multicultural cast. \n Miranda, in a tweet, said he was \"proud\" of Dixon and the \"Hamilton\" cast \"for leading with love,\" before reminding people that everyone is welcome at the theater. \n Miranda had been a big booster for the failed presidential campaign of Trump's opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, including performing at an all-star fundraiser for her last month. The cast also put on a special \"Hamilton\" show at a Clinton fundraiser last summer. \n The person playing Alexander Hamilton that Pence saw was Javier Munoz, an openly gay actor. Pence supported numerous efforts to ban gay marriage as governor of Indiana and opposed unfettered federal funding for HIV and AIDS treatment. \n \"Hamilton\" wasn't the only show that Trump took issue with over the weekend. He tweeted that \"Saturday Night Live\" a \"totally one-sided, biased show \u2013 nothing funny at all.\" He was portrayed in the cold open on Saturday's show as overwhelmed with his new duties as president \u2014 so much so that when told he would soon have to reveal his plans for defeating the Islamic State group, he had to search online for \"Google, what is ISIS?\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump again slams 'Hamilton'; Pence says he wasn't offended"}

{"date": "November 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump gives the thumbs-up as Mitt Romney leaves Trump National Golf Club Bedminster in Bedminster, N.J., Saturday, Nov. 19, 2016. \n BEDMINSTER, N.J. >> Mitt Romney is a key contender to become the nation's next secretary of state and Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis was an \"impressive\" prospect for defense secretary, President-elect Donald Trump and his No. 2 Mike Pence said Sunday. \n \"Gov. Romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as secretary of state of the United States,\" said Pence, the vice president-elect who is leading the search for Trump's cabinet members, in an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \n The remark made clear Trump and Romney's meeting a day earlier in New Jersey was more than a public attempt to bury the hatchet after trading ferocious insults during the campaign. \n Trump met with Ret. Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis a few hours after Romney. On Sunday, the billionaire interrupted his tweeted criticisms of \"Saturday Night Live,\" the hit musical, \"Hamilton\" and Democrats to write that, \"General James 'Mad Dog' Mattis, who is being considered for secretary of defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General!\" \n The comments were indications that Trump could be nearing additional Cabinet announcements soon as he works toward rounding out his foreign policy and national security teams. He took a hard line on both subjects during the presidential campaign, proposing a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and more. \n But even as Trump and his team discussed some of the weightiest matters facing the country, the president-elect continued tweeting about an array of matters. \n His targets Sunday included incoming Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer, another media-savvy New Yorker, who Trump said was \"far smarter\" than retiring Democratic Leader Harry Reid. He also complained that \"Saturday Night Live,\" which thrives on making fun of politicians, is \"biased\" and not funny. The night before, actor Alec Baldwin portrayed Trump as Googling, \"What is ISIS?\" \n Trump also insisted again that the cast and producers of \"Hamilton\" should apologize after the lead actor addressed Pence from the stage Friday night, telling the vice president-elect that \"diverse America\" was \"alarmed and anxious\" about the incoming administration. Pence said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that he enjoyed the show and wasn't offended. \n Meanwhile, Trump received more visitors to his golf club in New Jersey Sunday. His schedule in Bedminster was to include former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. \n Trump said he may announce some of his picks on Sunday. \n Both Romney and Trump put on a show of smiles, a public handshake and a thumbs-up Saturday, a marked shift in tone after a year in which Romney attacked Trump as a \"con man\" and Trump labeled him a \"loser.\" But the two have started to mend fences since Trump's victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. \n Trump started filling key administration positions on Friday, picking Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo to head the CIA, signaling a sharp rightward shift in U.S. security policy as he begins to form his Cabinet. Trump also named retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn as his national security adviser. \n Trump's initial decisions suggest a more aggressive military involvement in counterterror strategy and a greater emphasis on Islam's role in stoking extremism. Sessions, who is best known for his hard line immigration views, has questioned whether terrorist suspects should benefit from the rights available in U.S. courts. Pompeo has said Muslim leaders are \"potentially complicit\" in attacks if they do not denounce violence carried out in the name of Islam. \n Pompeo's nomination to lead the CIA also opens the prospect of the U.S. resuming torture of detainees. Trump has backed harsh interrogation techniques that President Barack Obama and Congress have banned, saying the U.S. \"should go tougher than waterboarding,\" which simulates drowning. In 2014, Pompeo criticized Obama for \"ending our interrogation program\" and said intelligence officials \"are not torturers, they are patriots.\" \n Sessions and Pompeo would both require Senate confirmation; Flynn would not. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump, Pence address potential of Romney, Mattis in Cabinet"}
