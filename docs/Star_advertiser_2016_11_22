It was not immediately clear if a meeting between the two has been planned. Such meetings usually draw protests from Beijing, who accuses the Dalai Lama of seeking to split Tibet from China. \n The 81-year-old monk said he has always regarded the U.S. as the leader of the \"free world\" and wasn't concerned about remarks made by Trump during the election campaign. Some of those comments have been cited as offensive to Muslims, Hispanics and other U.S. minority groups. \n \"I feel during the election, the candidate has more freedom to express. Now once they (are) elected, having the responsibility, then they have to carry their cooperation, their work, according (to) reality,\" he told reporters. \"So I have no worries.\" \n China had demanded Mongolia scrap his visit for the sake of the \"general picture of a sound and steady development of bilateral ties.\" Mongolia's fragile economy is heavily dependent on China, and the countries are in discussions on a $1.2 billion Chinese loan to help pull it out of a recession. \n Mongolian television station Eagle TV's website reported that China had delayed talks on the loan and on cooperation in mining, apparently in response to the Dalai Lama's visit. Mongolia's foreign ministry said it had not received any notice on that and China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n In his comments, the Dalai Lama said his visit to the landlocked, primarily Buddhist, nation had no political purpose and said he had not publicly advocated independence for Tibet since 1974. The Dalai Lama has long called for Tibet to remain under Chinese rule, but with greater political participation by Tibetans and stronger protections for its traditional Buddhist culture. \n China says Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, although many Tibetans say they were effectively an independent country for much of that time. \n Asked to comment on climate change \u2014 which Trump has denounced as a hoax \u2014 the Dalai Lama said he was heartened by the turn to alternative energy sources such as solar and wind power. \n \"I think \u2026 we must now concentrate on these things. I don't know whether we can reduce cars or not. People everywhere busy, busy. I don't know if it will be possible to re-introduce by walk,\" he said. \n Referencing past efforts to minimize damage to the ozone layer, the Dalai Lama said that raised the chances of similar cooperation on climate change. \n \"So that gives us hope, there is possibility,\" he said. \n While the U.S. has in the past called on China to respect civil liberties in Tibet, Trump has praised authoritarian rulers such as Russia's Vladimir Putin who have been strongly criticized by human rights groups. \n Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulated Trump in a phone call and the country's state media has welcomed his election as harkening a less confrontational policy toward China. Those outlets have also applauded Trump's announcement that he would abandon a U.S.-led free trade agreement in Asia that had excluded China. \n However, Trump has also accused Beijing of unfair trade practices and pledged to bulk-up the U.S. military, leaving questions as to his ultimate approach to relations with the world's second-largest economy. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Dalai Lama not worried about Trump's election"}

The trucks weigh about 16 tons empty and up to twice that with sand. \n \"You can ram a New York City Sanitation Department sand truck with a lot of things, but you're not going to move it,\" said John Miller, the New York Police Department's top counterterrorism official. \n While the trucks have been used like this before \u2014 most recently to protect Trump Tower \u2014 the New York Police Department says they will play a bigger role at this year's parade in the wake of the cargo truck attack in Nice, France, that killed more than 80 people and a recent posting in an English-language Islamic State magazine that called the parade \"an excellent target.\" \n As scary as that sounds, authorities say there's no confirmation of a credible threat and they have repeatedly urged spectators to not stay away. \n Miller said that while such postings are psychological warfare intended to spread a message of fear, \"We never accede to that.\" A front-page headline in Tuesday's Daily News creatively paraphrased the message the NYPD seeks to send: \"Truck You, ISIS!\" \n Aside from the trucks, security for the parade includes teams of officers armed with assault weapons, bomb-sniffing dogs and portable radiation detectors. Plainclothes officers will blend in with the crowd, and other officers will be posted on rooftops along the parade route. \n The effort comes at a time when the nation's largest police department already is stretching its resources to protect the midtown Manhattan home of President-elect Donald Trump. On Election Day, at least a half-dozen dump trucks walled off Trump Tower's entrance on Fifth Avenue, making for photos that went viral on the internet. \n There was a similar dump truck spectacle with Ronald Reagan as president in 1983, when the Secret Service stationed them at the White House. Officials at the time indicated it was a response to unspecified threats in the wake of the truck bomb attack on a Marine compound in Beirut that killed 239 American soldiers. \n In recent years, authorities also have used the trucks to help safeguard the United Nations General Assembly and President Barack Obama's motorcades when he visits the city \u2014 an instant formula for epic gridlock. They also were deployed last year for the visit of Pope Francis. \n Authorities say the Islamic State group is trying to incite followers to rent trucks of their own to ram into crowds. In response, the NYPD has stayed in touch with rental companies and urged them to report anything suspicious. \n Paperwork filed on Monday in a federal case was yet another reminder of the truck threat. It quoted the man charged with seeking to join the terror group saying it wanted someone to commandeer a garbage truck for a \"Times Square operation.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Sanitation trucks protect Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade"}

But Spencer said he understands \"where he's coming from politically and practically,\" adding that he will \"wait and see\" how the real estate mogul's administration takes shape. \n Still, Spencer argued Trump needs the alt-right movement and should be wary of shunning it because of a few news cycles of bad publicity \"that do not define what we're doing.\" Spencer said Trump needs people like him \"to actualize the populism that fueled his campaign.\" \n Trump's denunciation also comes amid continued criticism over Trump tapping Steve Bannon, who managed the final months of the billionaire businessman's presidential campaign, as chief White House strategist. Bannon was previously the leader of Breitbart News, an unapologetically conservative outlet that Bannon has described as a \"platform for the alt-right.\" \n At the Times, Trump said Breitbart \"is just a publication\" that \"covers subjects on the right\" and is \"certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than The New York Times.\" \n Before Trump's latest denunciations, Spencer told AP earlier Tuesday that he doesn't see either Trump or Bannon as members of his movement, though \"there is some common ground.\" \n He said he and like-minded \"identitarians\" \u2014 his preferred label for white identity politics \u2014 see Trump's election as validating their view that the United States is flailing because it has embraced multiculturalism and political correctness at the expense of its European heritage. \n Spencer said \"without an intellectual vanguard\" that white nationalists can provide, Trump would have a \"meaningless\" tenure mired in the \"mainstream conservative movement\" that he's railed against. \"The whole promise of his campaign was that he wouldn't do that,\" Spencer said. \n Throughout his campaign, white nationalists have embraced Trump's hard-line approach on immigration and other issues. He sometimes used his Twitter account to distribute comments and links from white supremacist accounts, including a famous quotation from Benito Mussolini, the 20th century fascist leader of Italy. \n The president-elect's son, Donald Trump Jr., also became a flashpoint by using social media to distribute imagery with xenophobic or racist connotations. In September, the younger Trump posted a doctored image of himself, his father and several other prominent Trump allies next to Pepe the Frog, a cartoon character that Spencer chose as a mascot for his movement. Trump Jr. also retweeted an academic who argued that anti-Semitism is a \"logical\" response to a belief that Jews control the world's banks. \n In February, the elder Trump refused during a CNN interview to denounce the Ku Klux Klan and one of its former leaders, David Duke, saying he \"didn't know anything\" about Duke. Initially, he said a faulty ear piece left him unable to hear the questions clearly, but days later he issued a clearer condemnation. \n \"David Duke is a bad person,\" he said in an MSNBC interview. \"I disavowed the KKK,\" he added. \"Do you want me to do it again for the 12th time?\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump again disavows alt-right, white supremacists"}

{"date": "November 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama made remarks during his news conference at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in Lima, Peru on Sunday. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb President Barack Obama surpassed the 1,000 mark for commutations granted during his presidency today after shortening sentences for 79 people. \n Obama has been granting commutations at rapid-fire pace in his final months in office. All told, he's commuted more sentences than the past 11 presidents combined, the White House said. \n Most of those who have received clemency are nonviolent drug offenders, though many were also convicted of firearms violations related to drug crimes. A significant portion had been serving life sentences. \n \"It makes no sense for a nonviolent drug offender to be serving decades, or sometimes life, in prison,\" Obama wrote in a Facebook post. \"That's not serving taxpayers, and it's not serving the public safety.\" \n Yet Obama's call for clemency has run into opposition from some corners, including from President-elect Donald Trump. Though Obama is expected to grant more commutations in his final weeks, officials acknowledged a large number of applications will be pending when Obama leaves office. \n That means it will be up to Trump's administration to decide whether to grant or reject them, said Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates. \n Trump, during the campaign, warned Americans that their safety could be at risk because of Obama's move to set prisoners free ahead of schedule. That critique fits into Trump's broader call for restoring \"law and order\" in the U.S. and cracking down on crime. \n \"Some of these people are bad dudes,\" Trump said in October after another batch of Obama commutations. He said those individuals were out \"walking the streets,\" and added, \"Sleep tight, folks.\" \n Not all of those receiving commutations will be set free right away. Some will see their sentences end in 2017 or 2018 \u2014 long after Obama leaves office \u2014 and in some cases on the condition they participate in drug treatment programs. \n Shauna Barry-Scott of Ohio said her experience of having her sentence shortened in 2015 was surreal. She described her initial reaction as \"shock, overwhelming joy, fear of the unknown.\" \n \"I had to pinch myself,\" said Norman Brown, a Maryland man whose life sentence for cocaine distribution Obama commuted last year. He said after lawyers informed him of the decision, he sat speechless for three minutes as he absorbed what it would mean to have a second chance. \n Obama's bid to lessen the burden on nonviolent offenders reflects his long-stated view that decades of onerous sentencing requirements put tens of thousands behind bars for far too long. He has used the aggressive pace of his commutations to increase pressure on Congress to pass a broader fix while using his executive powers to address individual cases where possible. \n Though both parties in Congress have called for a criminal justice overhaul, momentum has petered out, creating dim prospects for a legislative breakthrough in the near future. \n Obama has been calling for years for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With his support, the Justice Department in recent years directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. \n The Obama administration has also expanded criteria for inmates applying for clemency, prioritizing nonviolent offenders who have behaved well in prison, aren't closely tied to gangs and would have received shorter sentences if they had been convicted a few years later. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama hits 1,000-mark for commutations granted"}

Trump said during the campaign that Clinton would \"be in jail\" if he were president, but the FBI director has declared on two occasions there is no evidence warranting charges over her use of a private email account. \n It wasn't immediately clear whether Conway was referring only to congressional investigations. But she said that Trump believes it's time for Republicans to move on, despite his vows to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate her. \n \"I think Hillary Clinton still has to face the fact that a majority of Americans don't find her to be honest or trustworthy, but if Donald Trump can help her heal, then perhaps that's a good thing,\" Conway said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \n \"I think he's thinking of many different things as he prepares to become the president of the United States, and things that sound like the campaign aren't among them,\" she added, suggesting broader changes from Trump's political rhetoric.\" \n Today, the president-elect heralded \"more great meetings\" in his Manhattan tower as he continued shaping his administration before heading to Florida for Thanksgiving late in the day. He tweeted today that he was \"seriously considering\" former Republican presidential rival Ben Carson to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development. And he met at The New York Times with some of the paper's journalists after scheduling, then abruptly canceling, the session. \n As for further investigations of Clinton, Trump seemed to waver in a post-election interview on CBS' \"60 Minutes.\" Justice Department investigations are historically conducted without the influence or input of the White House. \n Asked about investigations in that interview, he said, \"I'm going to think about it. I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on health care, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on \u2014 all of these other things that we've been talking about.\" \n Conway suggested Trump's new posture is aimed at Republicans in Congress who have relentlessly investigated the former secretary of state, including whether classified information passed through her private email server and how she acted in connection with the deadly raid on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans. \n The signal to move on from investigating Clinton sparked outrage in some conservative circles. \n The conservative legal group Judicial Watch said that if Trump's appointees do not follow through on his pledge to probe Clinton for criminal violations, \"it would be a betrayal of his promise to the American people to 'drain the swamp' of out-of-control corruption in Washington.\" \n The remarks come after months of Trump calling Clinton \"Crooked Hillary,\" questioning whether the Clinton Foundation is a pay-for-play scheme and raging against the Justice Department for refusing to prosecute her for blending private and official business on her email server. He told her face-to-face at a presidential debate that if he won the presidency, she'd \"be in jail.\" \n But Trump has been promising to unite the country around his presidency, saying repeatedly he will be president of \"all Americans.\" Not everyone is buying it \u2014 protests continue across the country \u2014 but the billionaire has been hosting a politically diverse parade of officials to his golf course in New Jersey as he's tried to fill out his Cabinet. The visitors have included Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential candidate who called Trump unfit for office.

Walker, the driver of a school bus that was filled with elementary students when it crashed, Monday, in Chattanooga, has been charged with vehicular homicide in the deaths of five children. \n CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. \u00bb A school bus driver was behind bars today after a crash killed five youngsters and plunged Chattanooga into mourning over what the mayor called the \"most unnatural thing in the world\" \u2014 a parent losing a child. \n Police said Johnthony Walker, 24, was speeding along a narrow, winding road Monday afternoon with 35 elementary school students aboard when he wrapped the bus around a tree. Walker was arrested and charged with five counts of vehicular homicide. \n Reeling from the tragedy, Chattanoogans lined up to donate blood, created a memorial of flowers and stuffed toys at the crash scene and planned an evening prayer vigil. Parents who send their children off to school every day struggled to come to grips with the shock and break the news to their loved ones. \n \"It's real tough, said Dujuan Butchee, whose daughters, Jamya and Janesa, are eighth-graders who used to go to the same school as the youngsters killed in the wreck. \"It's tough on my kids because they know some of the victims as well.\" \n Butchee said it wasn't the first time he heard about a bus speeding: \"I think it should wake up more bus drivers to be more cautious because you're dealing with a lot of kids' lives.\" \n Police said Walker was driving well over the posted 30 mph limit when he lost control of the bus. He was jailed on $107,500 bail for a court appearance Nov. 29 on charges that also included reckless driving and reckless endangerment. \n Twelve children remained hospitalized Tuesday, six in intensive care, said Kirk Kelly, interim school superintendent. \n Three of the children killed were in fourth grade, one was in first grade and another in kindergarten, Kelly said. Their families were notified, but their names were not released. All the children aboard went to Woodmore Elementary School. \n \"The most unnatural thing in the world is for a parent to mourn the loss of a child,\" Mayor Andy Berke said. \"There are no words that can bring comfort to a mother or a father. So today, the city is praying for these families.\" \n Armanie Bryant, a Chattanooga middle-schooler, said: \"They didn't get to live their lives. They didn't get married. They didn't have no kids, anything about their future.\" \n The National Transportation Safety Board sent a team to investigate, and police obtained a warrant to remove the bus' black box, which contains data on the vehicle's movements. \n Craig Harris, a parent of two children who were on the bus, told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that the bus driver sometimes drove too fast. \n \"There has been times where I've seen him going a little faster than he probably should be going,\" Harris said. He said his daughter and stepson were in shock and pain after the crash. \n Walker had an accident involving property damage in September, and his license was suspended for about a month in 2014 for failure to show proof of insurance, according to state commercial driver records. He appeared to have no criminal record in Tennessee, authorities said. \n Hamilton County School District spokeswoman Amy Kutcher declined to say whether the district had received any complaints involving Walker, who was employed by an outside bus contractor, Durham School Services. She referred all questions about his performance and that of other Durham drivers to the company. \n \"Legally there is no way that we could discipline someone who is not our employee,\" Kutcher said. \"We've got 192 Durham bus drivers. Obviously, this is a bad one.\" \n Durham CEO David A. Duke issued a statement on Twitter saying the company was \"devastated\" by the accident and working with police and school officials to investigate. Company officials did not return calls and emails seeking comment. \n Durham has had other drivers who have run into legal trouble in the school district that includes Chattanooga, according to news reports. Last year, one driver pleaded guilty to aggravated statutory rape, and another was arrested on child-porn possession charges. Both were fired. \n Durham, based in Warrenville, Illinois, operates about 13,700 vehicles around the U.S. and has nearly as many drivers, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. It had a \"satisfactory\" safety rating from the agency in July 2015. \n The company has had 346 crashes over two years, including three resulting in deaths and 142 with injuries, federal figures show. During that period, it had 53 incidents involving unsafe driving violations. \n Demetrius Jenkins said he had yet to tell his first-grade son, Jermaine Bradley, that the boy's best friend had died in the crash. \n \"It's sad. He's going to eventually find out,\" Jenkins said. \"I know he's going to be full of tears.\" \n On Tuesday morning, the heap of mangled metal that used to be a bus was loaded on a trailer and taken away, and counselors were on hand for the students and staff as classes resumed at the school. Pastor Tavner Smith and a dozen staffers from the Venue Church went to offer support. \n \"It's devastating,\" Smith said. \"You send your kids to school and think you're going to see them that evening.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "School bus driver charged in deadly Chattanooga crash"}

King, Jr., speaks on a panel with first lady Michelle Obama to college-bound students participating in the Reach Higher initiative's third annual Beating the Odds event in the East Room of the White House in Washington. King is urging governors and school leaders in states where student paddling is allowed to end a practice he said would be considered \"criminal assault or battery\" against an adult. \n Buffalo, N.Y. \u00bb Education Secretary John B. King Jr. is urging governors and school leaders in states that allow student paddling to end a practice he said would be considered \"criminal assault or battery\" against an adult. \n King released a letter Tuesday asking leaders to replace corporal punishment with less punitive, more supportive disciplinary practices that he said work better against bad behavior. \n More than 110,000 students, including disproportionate numbers of black and disabled students, were subjected to paddling or a similar punishment in the 2013-14 school year, said King, citing the Education Department's Civil Rights Data Collection. \n Corporal punishment is legal in 22 states. \n \"The practice has been clearly and repeatedly linked to negative health and academic outcomes for students,\" King said during a conference call with reporters. \"It is opposed by parent organizations, teachers unions, medical and mental health professionals and civil rights advocates as a wholly inappropriate means of school discipline.\" \n Coming toward the end of President Barack Obama's term, the push to end corporal punishment builds on the administration's \"Rethink Discipline\" campaign to create safe and supportive school climates, King said. It also lines up with Obama's \"My Brother's Keeper\" initiative, meant to address persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color, he said. \n Eighty organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, NAACP, Association of University Centers on Disabilities and American Federation of Teachers, signed an open letter released by the National Women's Law Center supporting an end to the practice. Students are regularly paddled for minor or subjective infractions like dress code violations, cellphone use or disrespecting staff, the letter said. \n \"Corporal punishment of adults has been banned in prisons and in military training facilities, and it's time we do the same for our nation's schoolchildren,\" said Fatima Goss Graves of the Women's Law Center. \n Although its use has been diminishing, there are corners of the country where corporal punishment remains deeply woven into culture and tradition. School administrators say it has broad support from parents and preserves learning time that would be lost to a suspension. \n Fifteen states expressly permit corporal punishment: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming. In seven states, there is no state law prohibiting it. They are: Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire and South Dakota. \n \"There are better, smarter ways to achieve safe and supportive school environment,\" King said, adding that the education law passed late last year supports using funding for positive intervention and supports. \n President-elect Donald Trump has not yet announced his choice for education secretary. He met last week with Michelle Rhee, a former chancellor of the District of Columbia schools. \n \"It doesn't actually matter who the secretary of education is or what people's view is about the election,\" AFT President Randi Weingarten said on the call with King. \"This is a moral matter \u2026.

{"date": "November 22, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016, photo, a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent passes birdwatchers Rayborn and Nancy Hill along a section of border wall in Hidalgo, Texas. The idea of a concrete wall spanning the entire 1,954-mile southwest frontier collides head-on with multiple realities, like a looping Rio Grande, fierce local resistance, and cost. \n LOS EBANOS, Texas \u00bb All along the winding Rio Grande, the people who live in this bustling, fertile region where the U.S. border meets the Gulf of Mexico never quite understood how Donald Trump's great wall could ever be much more than campaign rhetoric. \n Erecting a concrete barrier across the entire 1,954-mile frontier with Mexico, they know, collides head-on with multiple realities: the geology of the river valley, fierce local resistance and the immense cost. \n An electronically fortified \"virtual wall\" with surveillance technology that includes night-and-day video cameras, tethered observation balloons and high-flying drones makes a lot more sense to people here. It's already in wide use and expanding. \n If a 30- to 40-foot concrete wall is a panacea for illegal immigration, as Trump insisted during the campaign, the locals are not convinced. And few were surprised when the president-elect seemed to soften his position five days after the election, saying that the wall could include some fencing. \n \"The wall is not going to stop anyone,\" said Jorge Garcia, who expected to lose access to most of his 30-acre riverside ranch after the U.S. Border Fence Act was enacted a decade ago. \n Under the law, 652 miles of border barrier were built, mostly in Arizona. The 110 miles of fences and fortified levees that went up in Texas are not contiguous but broken lines, some as much as a mile and a half from the river. \n Eight years after government surveyors marked Garcia's land, he and his wife, Aleida, are still waiting to see if the Border Patrol will sever their property. \n \"This lets me know that whenever they want to build the wall, they can,\" said Aleida, holding up a tax bill that shows the nominally expropriated sliver of property. \n If a fence or wall goes up, the couple will be paid $8,300. So far, the Garcias and the rest of the village of Los Ebanos have been spared because the erosion-prone clay soil is simply too unstable, she believes. \n Geology conspires against wall-building up and down the Rio Grande Valley. So does a boundary water treaty with Mexico and endangered-species laws. Catwalks and tunnels had to be built into existing fences to accommodate endangered ocelots and jaguarundi, two species of wild cat. \n The gaps in the border barrier include an entire flank of the River Bend golf club and resort in Brownsville. University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley political scientist Terence Garrett calls them \"gaps of privilege\" because many landowners were politically connected. \n Other landowners fought the Border Patrol in court. \n \"The wall might make mid-America feel safer, but for those of us that live on the border, it's not making us feel any safer when we know that people can go over it, around it, under it and through it,\" said Monica Weisberg-Stewart, security expert for the Texas Border Coalition, a consortium of regional leaders. \n The coalition wants federal dollars to go instead to bolstering security at border crossings, where heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine are smuggled in. A poll conducted in Southwest border cities in May found 72 percent of residents opposed to building a wall. The Cronkite News-Univision-Dallas Morning News poll had a margin of error of 2.6 percentage points. \n The wall is popular in distant cities \"because you can see, feel and touch it. But politically it just doesn't make sense,\" said J.D. Salinas, the coalition's chairman. \n As commissioner of the border county of Hidalgo from 2007 to 2009, Salinas won public backing for 20 miles of border barrier by reinforcing an existing levee with concrete and topping it with a fence. In 2010, the project paid off. The levee held back flooding from Hurricane Alex. The cost was about $10 million a mile, though. \n In the Nov. 8 election, only three Texas border counties \u2014 all sparsely populated \u2014 went for Trump. The rest are solidly Democratic, at odds with the Republicans who control most state capitals and have been demanding more border barriers. \n Rural ranchers worried about drug traffickers and other criminals are less likely to benefit from border walls and fences than city-dwellers, said Adam Isacson, a security expert with the nonprofit advocacy group Washington Office on Latin America. \n \"What a wall ultimately does is slow a border crosser for 10 to 15 minutes,\" Isacson said. \"In an urban area, that 15 minutes is crucial.\" Border patrol agents can arrive quickly. In rural areas, they may be an hour or more away. \n The U.S. side of the border is quite safe, said Weisberg-Stewart. \"We are not in a war zone.\" \n In fact, cross-border trade has been booming. In 2014, more than $246 billion worth of goods and 3.7 million trucks crossed the Texas-Mexico border, according to coalition figures. \n Trump needs to remember that Mexico is the second-largest U.S. export market, said Rep. Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat whose district includes most of the valley. Only Canada buys more American goods. \n \"There's no way in hell he's going to see his great wall,\" Vela said. \n The region bears the usual hallmarks of American prosperity: strip malls, well-maintained interstates, prosperous gated communities with hacienda-style McMansions. Cold-storage warehouses proliferate for northbound Mexican okra, avocados and tomatoes while other warehouses brim with southbound used clothing. Cotton, grapefruit and corn fields abound. \n Much of the Mexican side of the border has been afflicted by drug cartel-related violence, but crime in the Rio Grande Valley, which is home to 1.3 million people, has been consistently lower than other Texas cities. \n If lots of \"bad hombres\" are crossing the border, as Trump has claimed, they are mostly taking their lawbreaking elsewhere. Further, there's no record of anyone sneaking across the border to commit acts of terrorism. \n The Border Patrol's buildup after 9/11 is one reason, argues David Aguilar, who was named to the agency's top job in 2004 by a fellow Texan, then-President George W. Bush, and is now a private consultant. Since then, the number of agents has climbed from 9,500 on the southwest border to 17,500 in 2015. \n Meanwhile, the number of apprehensions along the border is down from a peak of 1.6 million in 2000 \u2014 when Aguilar said at least as many got away \u2014 to 409,000 in the year ended in September. Nearly half were caught in the Rio Grande Valley. \n Many analysts believe the Great Recession was a bigger factor than Border Patrol enforcement in making the U.S. less attractive to Mexican migrants in particular. \n Since tower-mounted video surveillance cameras began going up in 1999 in the Brownsville area, illegal cross-border traffic in the area \"dried up by 85 to 90 percent,\" said Johnny Meadors, the sector's assistant chief for technology. He said the traffic moved west, where there were no cameras. \n Seventy-two more of the towers, which are 80 to 120 feet tall, are to be installed in the valley by 2021, and could include motion sensors and laser pointers, Meadors said. \n Since 2013, the Border Patrol has also had five blimp-like aerostats that float from 1,000 to 5,000 feet above the valley on tethers. High-flying Predator drones have patrolled vast areas of southwest borderlands since 2011. The agency also has underground sensors along the border. How many, Meadors wouldn't say. \n All the gadgetry has been a bonanza for defense contractors. The government spent $450 million last fiscal year on border security fencing, infrastructure and technology. \n \"If you had a sensible immigration policy, there would be no need for all this,\" said Garrett, the political scientist. \n What Trump's policy will be remains a mystery. \n During the campaign, he said he would deport all the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States. Days after the election, he appeared to back down somewhat, saying he would expel the criminals among them. \n Whether fear of a Trump victory has anything to do with a recent spike in arrivals from violence-wracked Central America isn't clear. They account for more than half of Border Patrol apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley, where many migrants turn themselves in at frontier bridges. \n After processing, released migrants are given court dates in destination cities where relatives typically await. Others are sent to detention centers. \n An average of 350 migrants, some adults wearing ankle monitors, now arrive daily at the Sacred Heart parish community center in the border city of McAllen, up from 100 a day in August, said Gaby Lopez, a volunteer at the makeshift shelter that opened in June 2014. \n New arrivals get a shower, a hot meal and can pick through donated clothing. \n Ingrid Guerra, 21, a Guatemalan who is eight months' pregnant and bound for Kansas, said she was fleeing an abusive relationship and didn't tell the father.
