(John Ehlke/The Daily Tribune via AP) \n As Americans feasted on turkey during the nation's first major post-election holiday, some took to social media to describe the political gloating, loathing and subject avoiding they experienced around the Thanksgiving table. \n Facebook and Twitter posts, many even before dinner was served, revealed some people still struggling to come to grips with Donald Trump's victory and others expressing relief that his rival, Hillary Clinton, didn't win. \n Some explained through posts and interviews that celebrating a holiday centered on gratitude and sustenance provided some healing of divisions, even if just temporarily. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n CRISIS AVERTED  \n Sarah Littlefield feared the worst as she processed the election results and looked ahead to Thanksgiving dinner. \n \"If Trump wins b/c of Michigan, thanksgiving with my Marxist Michigander grandparents is going to be so painful,\" she posted on Twitter earlier this month. \n But on Thursday, Littlefield said things were going more smoothly than feared when her liberal grandmother and partner visited the home of her independent but conservative parents in Alexandria, Virginia. \n \"There is a lot of common ground \u2014 no one here found a perfect candidate,\" said Littlefield, a 21-year-old who is studying American government and global studies as a senior at the University of Virginia. \n Littlefield said she voted for Clinton but doesn't know how her parents voted \"because I don't want to open that can of worms.\" Her grandmother and partner said they opted for Clinton, but Littlefield said they don't seem \"most enthusiastic.\" \n Littlefield said the real concerns have involved dinner itself. Her family discovered Wednesday that the oven was broken, so they bought a turkey roaster. This is also Littlefield's first Thanksgiving as a vegetarian, so, she said, \"I'm making rice for myself.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n TURNING THE TABLES  \n Mike Mower considered setting up three tables at the Thanksgiving lunch he and his wife were hosting for a large group in Salt Lake City, Utah: one for Trump supporters, one for Clinton supporters and one for backers of independent candidate Evan McMullin. \n But Mower, a longtime Republican and deputy chief of staff for Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, tweeted that there were too many Clinton supporters to go forward with that plan. \n His wife overruled the plans for separate seating anyway, declaring that people would mix despite political affiliations. They did, however, intentionally put their eldest daughter, a 23-year-old liberal who lives in Brooklyn, far from her grandfather, an 86-year-old Trump supporter. \n One son, a political science major and Clinton supporter, wanted to make the pie a representative chart showing Clinton won more of the popular vote. \n \"I told him 'We're not using dessert for political posturing,'\" said Mower, laughing. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE KIDS ARE LISTENING  \n In the run-up to the holiday, Bernadeia Johnson took to Twitter with some advice: \"Thanksgiving is the first holiday after the election. children may not be at the adult table but they hear your convo. Model civility\" \n On Thanksgiving Day, the Minneapolis grandmother and educator acknowledged there still could be some \"talking smack\" around the dinner table at her cousin's house. \n \"It'll be loud and lively at our table,\" said Johnson, former Minneapolis schools' administrator who is now an assistant professor of education leadership at Minnesota State University, Mankato. \n \"We will argue and there will be conflict \u2014 in good fun,\" she said. \"Even if there wasn't something going on, we'd have to find something for people to get riled up about.\" \n Johnson said she believes everyone at the gathering generally agree on political topics, and \"we will make Trump the turkey.\" However, if one cousin who predicted a Trump victory attempts to underscore that point, \"We'll just look at each other and roll our eyes,\" she said. \n She said it's important for children to see people coming together \u2014 even in disagreement. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n HOLD THE ANGER  \n With relatives scattered across the country, photographer Meri Bond was celebrating Thanksgiving with like-minded friends at a home on the Massachusetts coast outside Boston. \n The political conversation among the Clinton supporters was largely an election post-mortem, not angry condemnation of the other side, she said. \n That morning, Bond took to Facebook to encourage both sides to listen to each other, writing \"Let's celebrate our shared humanity. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.\" \n At her recent 50th high school reunion, she was struck by how difficult it can be for people with differing ideologies to do that. \n \"Even though I tried really hard to be upbeat on my posts, it's pretty bruising try to communicate with people who don't watch the same news, they don't hear things the same way, they see Hillary in a completely different way than I do,\" she said. \n Still, she remains optimistic. \n \"Part of me is really curious to give (Trump) a shot and see where it goes,\" she said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n IN HOT WATER?

The group, called Showing up for Racial Justice, says the idea was spurred after hearing from \"newly politicized\" people from around the country nervous about the holiday. \n The hotline is designed to help people who get stuck in tough spots during racial conversations. They can text \"SOS\" and choose from a menu of options to get helpful facts or talking points so they can have respectful conversations without alienating family members, said Heather Cronk, co-founder of a group formed in 2009 amid backlash to election of President Barack Obama. \n \"I would liken it to the Butterball hotline, but it's not about turkeys, it's about your racist uncle,\" said Cronk from her home in Washington, D.C. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "No holiday for political talk, social media posts suggest"}

{"date": "November 24, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n New People's Army new regional rebel commander and spokesman Jaime Padilla, who uses the nom de guerre Comrade Diego, raises his clenched fists after a clandestine news conference in a encampment tucked in the harsh wilderness of the Sierra Madre mountains southeast of Manila Wednesday. \n SIERRA MADRE MOUNTAINS, Philippines >> Communist guerrillas warned that a peace deal with President Rodrigo Duterte's government is unlikely to be reached if he won't end the Philippines' treaty alliance with the United States and resist foreign control by other countries he's trying to befriend, like China and Russia. \n In a clandestine news conference in a New People's Army guerrilla encampment tucked in the harsh wilderness of the Sierra Madre mountains southeast of Manila, regional rebel commander and spokesman Jaime Padilla outlined the advantages and downside of talking with Duterte to end one of the world's longest-running Marxist insurgencies. \n The dozens of mostly young guerrillas in muddy boots in their rain-soaked encampment on a wooded plateau reflected their resiliency but also showed the tough conditions that have long hampered their insurgency. Young rebels cooked rice, pork and chicken in soot-covered pots over wood fire while others gingerly puffed cigarettes while watching the peripheries. The nearest army camp lies just 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) away. When an air force Huey helicopter flew overhead, rebels at the news conference briefly paused and watched the passing aircraft. \n Founded in 1968, the rebels' communist party has held peace talks with six Philippine presidents, including Duterte, whose rise to power in June sparked rebel optimism due to his searing anti-U.S. rhetoric, populist pro-poor stance and appointments of at least two left-wing Cabinet members. \n But the guerrillas have also found themselves in a dilemma due to the tough-talking Duterte's moves they find reprehensible, including the killings of large number of poor drug users that sparked accusations of massive human rights violations against him, a recent decision to allow dictator Ferdinand Marcos to be buried in a heroes' cemetery and threats to shift to dictatorial rule if rival politicians derail his anti-drug crackdown and try to impeach him. \n While the president has gotten attention with his angry threats to end the presence of American forces in the country, stop joint combat exercises with U.S. troops and terminate a defense accord with Washington, Padilla said Duterte has, so far, not formalized these utterances and instead has walked back on many publicly-stated policies. \n \"While the Duterte government hasn't abrogated all these treaties, the New People's Army will have no reason to enter into a friendship or alliance with him,\" Padilla, 69, told a small group of journalists escorted into an encampment ringed by mostly young rifle-wielding guerrillas. \n \"That's not negotiable because as long as the U.S. military has a presence, the imperialist influence on Duterte's government will remain,\" said the bespectacled Padilla, who wore a Mao cap with his 9mm pistol within reach on a wooden table. \n Other rebels echoed Padilla's remarks. \"We support Duterte but not 100 percent,\" said a 24-year-old rebel who identified himself as Guiller. \"He's projecting himself as anti-U.S. and pro-poor but that's still mostly rhetoric. If the problems persist, the revolution will go on.\" \n Duterte's reaching out to China and Russia also disturbs the communists. \"They hide behind what we call a communist (facade) or socialism but essentially, and in their core, they are imperialist nations, which control parts of the world,\" Padilla said. \"Even if it's China that controls us, we're not free, and we should fight their control on us.\" \n Coinciding with the rebel warning, the Philippine armed forces chief, Gen. Ricardo Visaya announced Wednesday that most joint exercises with the U.S. military would proceed next year, including the largescale Balikatan maneuvers. Most would be refocused, though, on disaster-response, humanitarian missions and counterterrorism from previous maneuvers centered on territorial defense that Duterte worries may offend China. \n Visaya's statement came after he met U.S. Pacific Command in an annual defense meeting on Tuesday. \n Despite thorny issues, Padilla said Maoist guerrillas remain committed to pursue talks with Duterte while criticizing his wrong moves, like allowing Marcos's heroes' burial and carrying out the bloody anti-drugs crackdown. \n Philippine police should target drug lords and syndicate leaders and not poor addicts, who the rebels consider victims and not criminals,\" he said, adding they have targeted big drug dealers in the past. \n \"We are sincere with the peace talks, we are honest and we want to end 47 years of armed struggle,\" Padilla said when asked if the rebels were just trying to extract concessions from a president with whom they may not likely forge a peace deal. \n The guerrillas, he said, would not simply surrender their firearms unless their major demands are not met, including social and economic reforms, land reform and an industrialization program that favor the poor, who make up about a fourth of more than 100 million Filipinos. \n \"If he remains in the right direction, he will be with us,\" Padilla said. \"But if he veers off from the direction that we seek, we will break away from him.\" \n Battle setbacks, surrenders and infighting have weakened the rebel group, which is blacklisted as a terrorist organization by the United States. A confidential government assessment obtained by The Associated Press says the guerrillas have declined to 3,800 fighters with more than 4,500 firearms in the first half of the year, with about 700 of the country's 42,000 villages affected by the insurgency. \n The insurgent group \"remains as a threat to national security due to its stance of not abandoning the armed struggle,\" the report said. \"Although the communist movement had been weakened \u2026 it continues to pursue recovery efforts nationwide.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Duterte's anti-U.S. rhetoric not enough for communist rebels"}

{"date": "November 24, 2016", "text": "WWW.SEONGNAM.GO.KR \n Seongnam Mayor Lee Jae-myung \n He respects Donald Trump and enjoys being compared to Bernie Sanders. \n Lee Jae-myung, mayor of a city near Seoul, is rising in opinion polls with about a year to go until South Korea's next presidential election. He wants to break up the country's biggest companies, meet unconditionally with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and throw President Park Geun-hye in jail over an influence-peddling scandal. \n \"Americans impeached their establishment by electing Trump,\" Lee, 52, said in an interview Wednesday at his office in Seongnam city. \"Our own elections will mirror that.\" \n With populist movements gaining traction globally, Lee is tapping into anger in South Korea over corruption and a lack of jobs. In recent weeks, Seoul has seen some of the biggest protests since the 1980s as ordinary Koreans decry the links between politicians and big business that have stifled competition in Asia's fourth-biggest economy. \n Read more: South Korea's unfolding political scandal \n Lee moved into third place in presidential polls released in the past week, behind United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and front-runner Moon Jae-in, the runner-up to Park in 2012. While Lee has declared his candidacy, neither Ban nor Moon have committed to running. Lee expects to compete with Moon to be the candidate for the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea. \n While an election is currently a year off, the timetable could quickly accelerate. If Park were to resign or be removed from office, an election would be held within 60 days. \n \"Lee's fast rise does seem to suggest that his supporters are sick of business as usual in the Blue House,\" said Steven Ward, who teaches political science at South Korea's Chosun University. \"Voter discontent with the establishment very well might be high enough to propel a populist into office on the protest vote, and Lee could be that person.\" \n Working-Class \n Unlike U.S. President-elect Trump, Lee, a former lawyer, comes from a working-class family. His left arm remains twisted after it was pressed under a machine in a factory accident when he was a teenager. \n He entered politics a decade ago after working as a human rights lawyer in Seongnam \u2014 a city that grew with an influx of workers unable to afford homes in Seoul during the country's high-growth years. With a population of one million, the city now generates some of the highest tax revenue in the country and houses technology companies such as Naver Corp., the nation's biggest portal website. \n Lee and Trump both use social media to harangue critics and communicate with supporters. During a public speech in September, Lee told a woman her son would die as tragically as the victims of the Sewol ferry disaster, after she complained about a yellow-ribbon pin he wore in memory of the catastrophe. \n In 2004, when he was working as a lawyer, Lee got into a scuffle in the city council chamber when he was protesting a decision not to build a hospital. He went into hiding in a cramped church basement room, where he said he decided to seek office. He received a fine after turning himself in. \n After running unsuccessfully for mayor in 2006, Lee was elected in 2010. \n 'Revolutionary' Change \n Lee said growing income disparities offered him a chance and that South Koreans shouldn't repeat the mistake of American voters, who chose Hillary Clinton over Sanders in the Democratic primary. \n Lee invoked Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in saying that, if he became president, he'd eliminate an \"establishment cartel\" that had catered to dictators including Park's father, Park Chung-hee, and which survived the country's shift to democracy. \n His proposal for a \"revolutionary\" change includes dividing up family-run conglomerates, known as chaebol, and expanding welfare payments for workers. He blames slowing growth on the chaebol-led economy, likening the nation to a man whose heart has grown so big that other parts of the body die from a lack of blood. \n Northern Neighbor \n Lee said he wouldn't hesitate to seek a summit with North Korea if he became president, and would be able to work with Trump should he open negotiations with the isolated nation. \n \"I'm hopeful about Trump,\" Lee said. \"He sounds brash, but I expect him to be a rational man sensitive to his interests at the end of the day, and he will know America's interests lie in talking North Korea out of advancing its nuclear arms and selling them to others.\" \n While the U.S.-South Korea alliance should strengthen, he said, Japan should be dubbed a security foe because it hasn't shown enough contrition for its aggression against Korea in the early 20th century. \n He called Park a \"haughty\" criminal who belongs to the establishment. Park has denied she coaxed conglomerates into donating tens of millions of dollars to foundations controlled by her friend, Choi Soon-sil. She has admitted to allowing Choi to interfere in government affairs and apologized twice to the nation. \n While there's no sign Park is considering resigning, parliament has agreed to appoint a special prosecutor and is moving to impeach her. She has about 15 months left in her single, five-year term. \n \"We need to make sure people see Park handcuffed and jailed the moment she leaves the Blue House,\" Lee said. \"We need to show graphically that all men are equal under law and must be prosecuted for wrongdoing.\" \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "Harnessing Trump and Sanders, Korean populist rises in polls"}

You can't spend your life worrying about what could happen.\" \n The Hawaii All State Marching Band, also known as Na Koa Alii, played and danced to tunes such as \"Tahiti Tahiti\" and \"Mele Kalikimaka.\" Band members wore raffia skirts and custom-made aloha shirts. \n The band \u2014 the parade's largest musical ensemble \u2014 comprises select high school students from 41 public and private schools statewide \n While authorities had said there was no confirmation of any credible threat, they stepped up safety measures in the wake of the July cargo truck attack on a holiday crowd in Nice, France, and a recent posting in an English-language Islamic State group magazine that called the Thanksgiving parade \"an excellent target.\" \n Revelers cheered and yelled, \"Thank you!\" to officers along the route today, giving special attention to the New York Police Department marching band. \n Many of the police officers were enveloped in the merriment. On Central Park West, a counterterrorism officer named Chris Matz stood briefly on the parade route holding his 5-year-old daughter, Samantha, in his arms, before passing her back over the barricade. \n At 57th Street, in front of a truck blockade, a detective named T.J. Martine wore a lei of purple orchids. It had been given to him by members of Na Koa Ali'i, Hawaii's all-state marching band. Every so often he tossed handfuls of rainbow confetti at the crowd. \n Spectators sometimes stood 10 deep to see the parade and its signature giant balloons, including Ronald McDonald, SpongeBob SquarePants, Charlie Brown and other characters. Marching bands from across the country entertained revelers, as did such celebrity singers as Tony Bennett and Sarah McLachlan. \n Annie Quinn traveled more than three hours from Albany to attend the parade with her cousin and two sisters \u2014 all three dressed in turkey costumes \u2014 scoring prime front-row seats along the route. \n \"We sat here for hours, but it was worth it,\" she said. \"This was the best parade I've seen in a while.\" \n But amid the fun and high-fives, there was intensive security. \n Officers with assault weapons and portable radiation detectors walked among the crowds, and more than 80 sanitation trucks filled with sand were parked at intersections and other places, acting as barriers against any kind of attack. \n Police have used sanitation trucks as barricades before. But the NYPD had said the trucks would play a bigger role at this year's parade after the Nice attack, which killed more than 80 people. \n Na Koa Alii, formed in 2002, performed in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in 2005 and 2011. The band also traveled to California in 2003, 2009 and 2013 to perform in the Rose Parade. \n The students marched near a float made in collaboration with King's Hawaiian bakery.

{"date": "November 24, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos posed for photographs at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster clubhouse in Bedminster, N.J. on Nov. 19. \n PALM BEACH, Fla. \u00bb His Cabinet beginning to take shape, President-elect Donald Trump is offering a Thanksgiving prayer for unity after \"a long and bruising\" campaign season. \n \"Emotions are raw and tensions just don't heal overnight,\" the incoming president said in a video message released on the eve of the national holiday. He continued, \"It's my prayer that on this Thanksgiving we begin to heal our divisions and move forward as one country strengthened by shared purpose and very, very common resolve.\" \n Trump, who was gathered with family today at his Palm Beach estate, was expected to pause for a day after a two-week scramble to shape his nascent administration from scratch. \n He injected the first signs of diversity into his Cabinet-to-be the day before, tapping South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and charter school advocate Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education. They are the first women selected for top-level administration posts. Haley is the daughter of Indian immigrants, so she also would be his first minority selection after a string of announcements of white men. \n The South Carolina governor has little foreign policy experience, yet Trump praised her as \"a proven dealmaker.\" DeVos, like Trump, is new to government but has spent decades working to change America's system of public education. \n Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson on Wednesday said \"an announcement is forthcoming\" on his role, which would make him the first black choice \u2014 possibly as secretary of Housing and Urban Development \u2014 but he also suggested he'd be thinking about it over the Thanksgiving holiday. \n \"I feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,\" Carson wrote on his Facebook page. \n Trump is also expected to select billionaire investor Wilbur Ross Jr. to lead the Commerce Department, a senior Trump adviser said Wednesday, speaking only on condition of anonymity because the adviser was not authorized to disclose internal deliberations. The 78-year-old Ross, who is white, is chairman and chief strategy officer of private-equity firm W.L. Ross & Co., which has specialized in buying failing companies. \n Wednesday's picks came as Trump worked to distance himself from the \"alt-right,\" a movement of white supremacists who continue to cheer his election. His first appointments included chief counselor Steve Bannon, who previously led a website popular among the alt-right. \n Trump today was with his family behind closed doors at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach estate. He's spending the Thanksgiving holiday there after a week of interviewing potential appointees in New York, punctuated by announcements of members of his national security team. \n \"It's time to restore the bonds of trust between citizens, because when America is unified there is nothing beyond our reach,\" the president-elect said in his Thanksgiving message, which was posted on social media. \n The nasty campaign season included clashes between Trump and his new Cabinet selections. \n \"The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!\" Trump wrote in March. Haley denounced several of his campaign comments and urged voters to \"reject the siren call of the angriest voices.\" \n DeVos, who is from Michigan, told The Associated Press in July, \"A lot of the things he has said are very off-putting and concerning.\" \n On Wednesday, however, Trump and his colleagues had nothing but kind words for each other. And while other Republicans largely praised the Haley pick, DeVos faced immediate criticism from left and right. \n The president of the National Education Association, Lily Eskelsen Garcia, said in a statement that for years DeVos \"has lobbied for failed schemes, like vouchers \u2014 which take away funding and local control from our public schools \u2014 to fund private schools at taxpayers' expense.\" \n And Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, tweeted, \"Trump has chosen the most ideological, anti-public ed nominee since the creation of the Dept of Education.\" \n At the same time, some conservatives warned that the longtime Republican donor, who along with her husband has spent millions of dollars to promote candidates who favor charter schools and school vouchers, also supports the Common Core education standards that Trump railed against during the campaign. \n DeVos addressed criticism head-on, posting a \"Q&A\" statement that said directly about Common Core: \"I am not a supporter \u2014 period.\" \n Trump will be sworn into office in less than 60 days. Beyond his Cabinet, he must fill hundreds of high-level administration posts. \n He is expected to stay in Florida through the weekend. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "In Thanksgiving pause, Trump calls for national healing"}

{"date": "November 24, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Hillary Clinton \n NEW YORK \u00bb A group of election lawyers and data experts has asked Hillary Clinton's campaign to call for a recount of the vote totals in three battleground states \u2014 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 to ensure that a cyberattack was not committed to manipulate the totals. \n There is no evidence that the results were hacked or that electronic voting machines were compromised. The Clinton campaign on Wednesday did not respond to a request for comment as to whether it would petition for a recount before the three states' fast-approaching deadlines to ask for one. \n President-elect Donald Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by razor-thin margins and has a small lead in Michigan. All three states had been reliably Democratic in recent presidential elections. \n The group, led by voting-rights attorney John Bonifaz and J. Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society, contacted the Clinton campaign this week. That call, which was first reported by New York Magazine, raised the possibility that Clinton may have received fewer votes than expected in some counties that rely on electronic voting machines. \n But Halderman, in an article posted on Medium on Wednesday, stressed that the group has no evidence of a cyberattack or voting irregularities. He urged that a recount be ordered just to eliminate the possibility. \n \"The only way to know whether a cyberattack changed the result is to closely examine the available physical evidence \u2014 paper ballots and voting equipment in critical states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania,\" Halderman wrote. \n Recounts, which are often costly and time-intensive efforts, would likely only be initiated if the Clinton camp pushed for one, though Wisconsin independently announced that it would conduct an audit of its vote. A call for a recount, particularly coming on the heels of a fiercely contested and sharply partisan election, would likely be cheered by Democrats but denounced by Republicans eager to focus on governing. \n A request to the Trump transition team for comment was not immediately returned. \n Trump's campaign had long believed that his message of economic populism would resonate in the Rust Belt. He frequently campaigned in Pennsylvania and made a late push in both Wisconsin and Michigan, successfully turning out white working-class voters whom pollsters may have missed. \n Many pre-election polls showed Clinton with slight leads. While advocating for the recounts, Halderman writes that \"the most likely explanation\" for Trump's surprise win \"is that the polls were systematically wrong.\" \n The deadlines for petitioning for a recount in all three states are in the coming days, with Wisconsin's on Friday. Green Party candidate Jill Stein announced a fundraising effort Wednesday to pay for such recounts. \n The focal point of any possible electoral cyberattack presumably would have been electronic voting machines that, whether or not they are connected to the internet, could be infected with malware that could change vote totals. But many of those machines produce a paper record of the vote that could be checked to see if the vote tabulations are accurate. \n Pennsylvania is considered one of the states most susceptible to hacking because 96 percent of its voting machines have no paper trail. Wisconsin is far less vulnerable because it uses electronic machines with voter-verifiable paper trails in most counties. Michigan is considered the safest of the three because it uses paper ballots. \n Officials in the three states confirmed that no recounts have been ordered. A spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department says it is not tallying the number of voting complaints to determine whether federal action is warranted. \n Many election experts have called for routine post-election audits designed to boost public confidence in vote outcomes, by guarding against both tampering and natural vote-counting mistakes. These could involve spot-checks of the voting records and ballots, typically in randomly selected precincts, to make sure that votes were accurately recorded. \n In many states, audits involve hand-counting the votes on paper ballots and comparing the results to the totals stored in the state's electronic voting system. Such audits do sometimes turn up mistakes that reverse an election. That happened in Florida's Palm Beach County in 2012, when a post-election audit determined that the \"winners\" in two city council races were actually losers. \n Routine audits also make it possible to confirm the accuracy of elections without putting the onus on losing candidates to call for a recount. In states without regular audits, a candidate who questions the results gets \"painted as a sore loser,\" Pamela Smith, president of the nonprofit Verified Voting, said in an interview earlier this year. \"If you do a regular audit, you often don't need a recount. It either shows the count was right or you find something.\" \n Any attempted hack to swing the results in three states would have been a massive and unprecedented undertaking. But electoral security was an issue that loomed large in many Americans' minds this year as the Democratic National Committee and several Clinton staffers had their emails breached and later released. U.S. security officials believe that hack of email was orchestrated by Russian hackers. \n Associated Press writer Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.  \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton being pushed to seek vote recount in 3 states"}
