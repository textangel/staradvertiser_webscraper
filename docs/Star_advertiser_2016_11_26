Wisconsin officials announced late Friday they are moving forward with the first presidential recount in state history. \n \"The people have spoken and the election is over,\" Trump declared Saturday. He added, \"We must accept this result and then look to the future.\" \n At the same time, Trump was scrambling to address unfilled administration jobs, having barely scratched the surface of creating the massive team needed to run the government before his Jan. 20 inauguration. \n Experts say presidential transitions are periods of great vulnerability for the nation, and among the vacancies on the Trump team are leaders of the departments of State, Defense and Homeland Security. \n Trump, who has virtually no experience in foreign affairs, offered a one-line tweet Saturday morning in reaction to the death of Cuban leader Fidel Castro \u2014 \"Fidel Castro is dead!\" \u2014 before issuing a more detailed statement. \n \"While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve,\" Trump said. \n His transition team did not respond to requests to clarify his Cuba policy, which was inconsistent during the campaign. \n The incoming president paid little if any attention Stein's recount push, but Democratic rival Hillary Clinton forced his hand on Saturday by formally joining the effort. Stein, who drew 1 percent of the vote nationally, is raising millions of dollars to fund the recounts. \n \"Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves,\" Clinton campaign attorney Marc Elias wrote Saturday in blog post. \"But now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.\" \n Elias said Clinton would take the same approach in Pennsylvania and Michigan if Stein were to follow through with recount requests those states, even though that was highly unlikely to change the election outcome. \n \"Regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself,\" Elias wrote. \n Clinton leads the national popular vote by close to 2 million votes, but Trump won 290 electoral votes to Clinton's 232, with Michigan still too close to call. It takes 270 to win the presidency. \n Trump, who repeatedly challenged the integrity of the U.S. election system before his win, called the recount push \"a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded.\" \n \"The results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing,\" he said in the statement, which didn't mention Clinton's involvement. \n Trump was spending the Thanksgiving holiday weekend with family at his Palm Beach estate, Mar-a-Lago. He had planned to focus on filling key administration posts over the working vacation. On Friday, he named Fox News analyst Kathleen Troia \"KT\" McFarland as deputy national security adviser and appointed campaign attorney Donald McGahn as White House counsel. \n McFarland has worked for three presidents, although none since Ronald Reagan. Fox News said Saturday that her contract has been terminated in light of the appointment. \n Trump planned to return to his New York home on Sunday ahead of a series of Monday meetings with prospective administration hires, including Sheriff David Clarke of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. He's seen as a possible Homeland Security pick. Clarke's vocal opposition to the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement has made him popular with many conservatives. \n Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence also have Monday meetings scheduled with Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., former Security and Exchange Commission commissioner Paul Atkins, World Wide Technology chairman David Steward and General Growth Properties CEO Sandeep Mathrani. \n Internal divisions over his choice for secretary of state have delayed that critical decision. The options include former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who lacks foreign policy experience, but was intensely loyal to Trump, and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who aggressively opposed Trump's candidacy but is largely regarded as more qualified. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker is also a possibility. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump slams recount push as 'a scam,' says election is over"}

High school graduates have fallen nationwide since 2011 and won't peak again until 2023, according to the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education. \n Some universities in rural areas with declining populations \u2014 including Mississippi's Alcorn State, Delta State and Mississippi Valley State \u2014 now charge all students the in-state rate, abolishing out-of-state surcharges. \n Some schools that get no shortage of applicants are sharply increasing non-resident tuition, and also getting criticized. The University of California charges out-of-staters much more, but critics allege Californians are being cast aside to offset state budget cuts by making room for more higher-paying outsiders. \n \"State disinvestment in public higher education compels public universities to behave like private universities by focusing on attracting paying customers,\" concluded Ozan Jaquette, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who studies college pricing, in a study of flagship state institutions he co-authored last year. \n The AP documented the across-the-board price cuts at schools such as West Texas A&M University, Michigan's Lake Superior State University, and Nebraska's Peru State College. Most hope revenue from additional students will outweigh expenses, much like airlines sell empty seats cheaply to fill undersold flights. \n \"For institutions with additional capacity to serve students, there is an emerging trend of rethinking out-of-state tuition levels,\" said Thomas Harnisch of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. \n USM has cut staff, but still has a larger university's buildings and faculty. \"I'm telling you, as the CFO, this is what we have to do or else we're going to have to reduce our footprint in terms of academic programs,\" Vinzant said. \n Wynter Seymour, a theater major from suburban New Orleans, had her heart set on going out of state. It was USM's waiver of out-of-state charges that led her to become a Golden Eagle in Hattiesburg, a short drive up Interstate 59. \n \"I wanted to find not the closest out-of-state option, but the one that was the cheapest,\" Seymour said. \n One widely noticed move was made by the University of Maine in Orono, which charges high-achievers from nine other states the same tuition they'd pay at their home state's flagship. This saves them $12,000 to $17,000 from Maine's out-of-state tuition of $29,498; applicants with lower grades and test scores get $9,000 off. \n \"The state of Maine needs young people, and we're not producing enough of them,\" said University of Maine Provost Jeffrey Hecker. \"Why don't we just be upfront about what students can expect? No more haggling.\" \n It's working: Applications jumped, freshman enrollment rose 9 percent to 2,260 students this fall, and Maine is spending less on financial aid now as a share of the typical tuition sticker price than it did in 2015. \n But complaints continue elsewhere. The University of Minnesota Twin Cities has attracted more students from beyond the upper Midwest since it slashed out-of-state tuition in 2008, but under legislative pressure it agreed this year to raise rates again and subsidize Minnesotans with any additional revenue. \n Even at USM, some in-state students wonder if they're being left behind. \n \"I wish there were more scholarship opportunities for nontraditional students,\" said Michelle Formby, a 30-year-old sophomore from nearby Petal who's studying special education. \"What about the people who live here?\" \n Vinzant says new pricing is meant to help Mississippians. \n \"The whole point of this effort is to raise revenue so we can invest it in the quality of education for Mississippi kids,\" he said. \"It is not anything more complicated than that.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Seeking students, public colleges reduce out-of-state prices"}

{"date": "November 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Protesters against the Dakota Access oil pipeline congregate Monday, Nov. 21, 2016, near Cannon Ball, N.D., on a long-closed bridge on a state highway near their camp in southern North Dakota. The bridge was the site of the latest skirmish between protesters and law officers, in which officers used tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray, and authorities say protesters assaulted officers with rocks and burning logs. \n CANNON BALL, N.D. >> North Dakota officials are encouraging the hundreds of Dakota Access oil pipeline protesters to respect the mandate to leave the sprawling, months-old encampment that's on federal land. \n According to Standing Rock Sioux tribal leader Dave Archambault, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sent him a letter Friday that said all federal lands north of the Cannonball River will be closed to public access Dec. 5 for \"safety concerns,\" including the oncoming winter and the increasingly contentious clashes between protesters and police. \n The largest encampment, Oceti Sakowin, is on Corps land in southern North Dakota, a place where several hundred people fighting against the four-state, $3.8 billion pipeline have created a self-sustaining community and put up semi-permanent structures in advance of the harsh winter. \n The encampment is near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers, and more than a mile from a Missouri River reservoir under which the pipeline will pass. That final large segment is yet to be completed, held up while the Corps consults with the tribe, who believe the project could harm the tribe's drinking water and Native American cultural sites. \n In early October, the Corps said it would not evict the encampment, which started as overflow from smaller private and permitted protest sites nearby and began growing in August, due to free speech reasons. Representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers didn't immediately return multiple messages Friday or Saturday seeking comment and verification of the letter. \n It isn't clear whether the protesters will move voluntarily to another site or where that site might be; the Corps says in its letter that a free speech zone will be set up south of the Cannonball River. A news conference is planned later Saturday. \n On Friday, Archambault, whose tribe offered protesters land on its reservation that's south of the river earlier this fall, said \"our resolve to protect our water is stronger than ever.\" \n President Barack Obama raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline in that area earlier this month, something Kelcy Warren, CEO of Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners, told The Associated Press is not an option from the company's standpoint. Obama said his administration is monitoring the \"challenging situation\" but would \"let it play out for several more weeks.\" \n Some of the protests have resulted in violent confrontations and more than 500 people have been arrested since August. The Corps' letter said that those who stay on the land after the deadline may be prosecuted, Archambault said. \n But it's the federal government's job to peacefully close the camp because it allowed people to stay there in the first place, Gov. Jack Dalyrmple said in a statement Saturday. \n \"Our state and local law enforcement agencies continue to do all they can to keep private property and public infrastructure free from unpermitted protest activities, and its past time that the federal government provides the law enforcement resources \u2026 to enforce their own order to vacate,\" the Republican said. \n Republican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven and Democratic U.S. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp said the protesters need to move for public safety. \n \"The well-being and property of ranchers, farmers and everyone else living in the region should not be threatened by protesters who are willing to commit acts of violence,\" Hoeven said in a statement Friday. He also called on the Obama administration to let work on the pipeline move forward, saying, \"this difficult situation has gone on too long and we need to get it resolved.\" \n Heitkamp said the Corps' order is \"a needed step to support the safety of residents, workers, protesters and law enforcement.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "North Dakota officials: Protesters should leave federal land"}

{"date": "November 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Cuban community in Miami celebrates the announcement that Fidel Castro died in front of La Carreta Restaurant, early Saturday, Nov. 26, 2016, in Miami. Within half an hour of the Cuban government's official announcement that former President Fidel Castro had died, Friday, Nov. 25, 2016, at age 90, Miami's Little Havana teemed with life - and cheers. \n HAVANA >> Music fell silent, weddings were canceled and people wept in the streets Saturday as Cubans faced their first day without the leader who steered their island to both greater social equality and years of economic ruin. \n Across a hushed capital, dozens of Cubans said they felt genuine pain at the death of Fidel Castro, whose words and image had filled schoolbooks, airwaves and front pages since before many were born. And in private conversations, they expressed hope that Castro's passing will allow Cuba to move faster toward a more open, prosperous future under his younger brother and successor, President Raul Castro. \n Both brothers led bands of bearded rebels out of the eastern Sierra Maestra mountains to create a communist government 90 miles from the United States. But since taking over from his ailing brother in 2006, the 85-year-old Raul Castro has allowed an explosion of private enterprise and, last year, restored diplomatic relations with Washington. \n \"Raul wants the country to advance, to do business with the whole world, even the United States,\" said Belkis Bejarano, a 65-year-old homemaker in central Havana. \"Raul wants to do business, that's it. Fidel was still holed up in the Sierra Maestra.\" \n In his twilight years Fidel Castro largely refrained from offering his opinions publicly on domestic issues, lending tacit backing to his brother's free-market reforms. But the older Castro surged back onto the public stage twice this year \u2014 critiquing President Barack Obama's historic March visit to Cuba and proclaiming in April that communism was \"a great step forward in the fight against colonialism and its inseparable companion, imperialism.\" \n Ailing and without any overt political power, the 90-year-old revolutionary icon became for some a symbol of resistance to his younger sibling's diplomatic and economic openings. For many other Cubans, however, Fidel Castro was fading into history, increasingly at a remove from the passions that long cast him as either messianic savior or maniacal strongman. \n On Saturday, many Cubans on the island described Fidel Castro as a towering figure who brought Cuba free health care, education and true independence from the United States, while saddling the country with an ossified political and economic system that has left streets and buildings crumbling and young, educated elites fleeing in search of greater prosperity abroad. \n \"Fidel was a father for everyone in my generation,\" said Jorge Luis Hernandez, a 45-year-old electrician. \"I hope that we keep moving forward because we are truly a great, strong, intelligent people. There are a lot of transformations, a lot of changes, but I think that the revolution will keep on in the same way and always keep moving forward.\" \n In 2013, Raul Castro announced that he would step aside by the time his current presidential term ends in 2018, and for the first time named an heir-apparent not from the Castro's revolutionary generation \u2014 Miguel Diaz-Canel, 56. \n Fidel Castro's death \"puts a sharper focus on the mortality of the entire first generation of this revolution,\" said Philip Peters, a Cuba analyst and business consultant, \"and brings into sharper focus the absence of a group of potential leaders that's ready to take over and politically connected to the public.\" \n For Cubans off the island, Castro's death was cause for celebration. In Miami, the heart of the Cuban diaspora, thousands of people banged pots with spoons, waved Cuban and U.S. flags in the air and whooped in jubilation. \n \"We're not celebrating that someone died, but that this is finished,\" said 30-year-old Erick Martinez, who emigrated from Cuba four years ago. \n The Cuban government declared nine days of mourning for Castro, whose ashes will be carried across the island from Havana to the eastern city of Santiago in a procession retracing his rebel army's victorious sweep from the Sierra Maestra to Havana. State radio and television were filled with non-stop tributes to Castro, playing hours of footage of his time in power and interviews with prominent Cubans affectionately remembering him. \n Bars shut, baseball games and concerts were suspended and many restaurants stopped serving alcohol and planned to close early. Official newspapers were published Saturday with only black ink instead of the usual bright red or blue mastheads. \n Many Cubans, however, were already imagining the coming years in a Cuba without Fidel Castro. \n \"Fidel's ideas are still valid,\" said Edgardo Casals, a 32-year-old sculptor. \"But we can't look back even for a second. We have to find our own way. We have to look toward the future, which is ours, the younger generations'.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Weeping, hopeful, Cubans look to future without Fidel Castro"}

{"date": "November 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump speaks during his meeting with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Trump promised big tax cuts for the middle class, but for nearly 8 million families, the opposite would occur: They'd pay more. \n WASHINGTON >> President-elect Donald Trump's proposals would modestly cut income taxes for most middle-class Americans. But for nearly 8 million families \u2014 including a majority of single-parent households \u2014 the opposite would occur: They'd pay more. \n Most married couples with three or more children would also pay higher taxes, an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found. And while middle-class families as a whole would receive tax cuts of about 2 percent, they'd be dwarfed by the windfalls averaging 13.5 percent for America's richest 1 percent. \n Trump's campaign rhetoric had promoted the benefits of his proposals for middle-income Americans. \n \"The largest tax reductions are for the middle class,\" said Trump's \"Contract With the American Voter,\" released last month. \n The tax hikes that would hit single parents and large families would result from Trump's plan to eliminate the personal exemption and the head-of-household filing status. These features of the tax code have enabled many Americans to reduce their taxable income. \n His other proposed tax changes would benefit middle- and lower-income Americans. But they wouldn't be enough to offset those modifications. \n \"If you're a low- or moderate-income single parent, you're going to get hurt,\" said Bob Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. \n Unlike Trump's polarizing proposals on immigration and trade, his tax plan is in line with traditional Republican policy. His steep tax cuts in many ways resemble those carried out by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, and the Republican-run Congress is expected to welcome them. \n During the campaign, Trump said his tax cuts \u2014 for individuals and companies \u2014 would energize the economy by boosting business investment in factories and equipment, while leaving consumers with more cash to spend. His proposals, he contended, would help create 25 million jobs over the next decade. \n But Lily Batchelder, a visiting fellow at the Tax Policy Center and former deputy director of President Barack Obama's National Economic Council, estimates that roughly 7.9 million families with children would pay higher taxes under his proposals. About 5.8 million are led by single parents. An additional 2.1 million are married couples. \n Other analysts, including economists at the conservative Tax Foundation and right-of-center American Enterprise Institute, have agreed with Batchelder's conclusions. \n Here's what her analysis finds: \n Right now, a single parent with $75,000 in income and two children can claim a head of household deduction of $9,300, plus three personal exemptions. Those steps would reduce the household's taxable income by $21,450, to $53,550. \n Trump's plan would more than double the standard deduction to $15,000. But that change would be outweighed by his elimination of personal exemptions and head-of-household status. So the family's taxable income would be $60,000, and their tax bill would be $2,440 more than it is now. \n A married couple with four children and income of $50,000 would absorb a tax increase of $1,090 because of their loss of personal exemptions. \n Kelly Rodriguez, 47, who lives in Tampa, Florida, voted for Trump and is a single mother who claims two of her four children as dependents. (Her ex-husband claims the other two.) She made roughly $90,000 last year, including alimony payments. Her taxes would likely rise under Trump's plan, according to Batchelder's analysis. \n \"I would want him to explain that to me,\" she said. \"Taxes have to make sense to the people paying them.\" \n Still, Trump's plan will likely evolve during congressional negotiations before it becomes law. \n \"This is not anywhere close to a final plan,\" Williams said. \n Kyle Pomerlau, director of federal projects at the conservative Tax Foundation, noted that House Speaker Paul Ryan's own tax-cut proposal is similar to Trump's but wouldn't raise taxes on single-parent families. In theory, the two plans could be melded, and Trump's elimination of the head of household status could be dropped. \n But leaving the head of household filing status and personal exemptions intact would lower tax revenue by $2.1 trillion over the next decade, the Tax Policy Center says. \n Trump's advisers deny that he will raise taxes on middle-income Americans but don't provide details. Previously, the campaign suggested that Trump would broadly instruct Congress to avoid raising taxes on lower- and middle-income workers. \n \"We will cut taxes massively for the middle class and working class and protect everyone in the middle class and working class,\" Stephen Miller, Trump's top policy adviser, said in an email. \n Yet all independent analyses show most of the benefit flowing to the wealthiest Americans. Nearly half of Trump's tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent of earners, the Tax Policy Center found. Less than a quarter of the cuts would benefit the bottom 80 percent. \n Trump proposes to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. That would slash the top rate from the current 39.6 percent. He would repeal the estate tax, which affects only about 0.2 percent of estates \u2014 those worth above $5.45 million. \n For middle-income earners as a whole, the Trump proposals would cut taxes, even taking into account the increases on single-parent families. Those earning nearly $50,000 to about $83,000 \u2014 the middle one-fifth \u2014 would receive an average cut of $1,010, according to the Tax Policy Center. That would lift their after-tax incomes 1.8 percent. \n By contrast, the wealthiest 1 percent \u2014 those earning over $700,000 \u2014 would enjoy a tax cut averaging nearly $215,000, boosting their after-tax incomes 13.5 percent. And the richest 0.1 percent \u2014 those making above $3.7 million \u2014 would receive a bonanza: An average tax cut exceeding $1 million. \n \"Trump's campaign rhetoric may have been populist, but his tax plan isn't,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the policy center, wrote on its website. \n His tax proposals suggest what may be a challenge for Trump's administration: Providing his middle- and working-class supporters with tangible signs of economic progress. Middle-income Americans already pay a relatively modest share of federal income taxes compared with the wealthy. That limits the scope of what tax cuts could do for them. \n \"The thing that he needs to worry about is making life better for his supporters, and that involves more than tax cuts,\" Williams said. \n Middle class finances have also been squeezed by high and rising costs for health care, higher education and housing, noted Joseph Cohen, a sociologist at Queens College in New York City. \n \"We've been cutting taxes since Reagan, and things have been getting worse for the middle class since Reagan,\" he said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Contact Chris Rugaber on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/ChrisRugaber \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "For some in middle class, Trump plan would mean tax increase"}

A $20,000 reward has been posted for the capture of Rogelio Chavez and Laron Campbell. \n Smith said authorities believe the two are still in the area, noting search dogs tracked them to a nearby river before losing their scent. \n \"We will find these two and any person who is harboring or aiding and abetting in their escape we will attempt to prosecute,\" she said. \n The sheriff also told reporters that authorities have received numerous credible tips from people who believe they saw the two, including one tip that came from the area that search dogs had chased them to. \n She encouraged people to keep reporting such information but warned they should not to try to confront the men. \n \"I want to remind the community that these are dangerous people,\" she said. \"They are not to be approached. Please just dial 911.\" \n The pair escaped with two other prisoners by cutting through the bars covering a second-story window of the county's main jail and then rappelling to the ground. The others were quickly apprehended. \n Chavez, 33, and Campbell, 26, are facing possible life sentences if convicted of burglary, extortion, false imprisonment and other charges they were being held on. Chavez had been held at the jail since August and Campbell since February 2015. \n Chavez, who is from San Jose, is recognizable by a distinctive face tattoo resembling an inky gash going through his left eye. Campbell, who is from Palo Alto, stands 6-feet-4. \n Smith said authorities still haven't found the tools used to cut through the bars and don't know how they were obtained. \n \"That's one of our big concerns,\" she said. \"To think that we have inmates in there with those kinds of tools is pretty disheartening.\" \n The escapees were being held in a dormitory designed to hold 20 people. Conditions there are often very loud, Smith said, making it hard for guards to hear any suspicious noise that might have been made. \n That section of the jail, built in the 1950s, doesn't have cameras either, which helped facilitate the escape. \n \"From the officers' station you cannot see in,\" Smith said, adding there are plans to put cameras there in the future. \n Wednesday's escape was discovered by a deputy patrolling the jail's perimeter. \n \"He kind of thought he saw some movement in the shadows, looked up and saw some bedding in the window,\" said Sgt. Rich Glennon. \n A similar escape was made from a Southern California jail in January by three men authorities later determined had planned it for weeks. \n They cut through the main Orange County jail's fifth-floor bars with tools smuggled in by an outsider, rappelled to the ground and escaped in a get-away car. \n They later abducted a cab driver and forced him to drive them to Northern California. \n The escape began to unravel when one of the men, fearful the others would kill the driver, fled to Southern California with him and surrendered. The others were captured soon after in San Francisco. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "$20K reward offered as sheriff vows to capture jail escapees"}

{"date": "November 26, 2016", "text": "CHATTANOOGA TIMES FREE PRESS VIA AP \n Teddy bears, mementos, and balloons make up a makeshift memorial at the site of Monday's fatal school bus crash in Chattanooga, Tenn. \n ATLANTA >> The 10-line report, written on wide-ruled notebook paper by an elementary school student in Chattanooga, Tenn., arrived Nov. 16.  \n \"The bus driver drives fast,\" the Woodmore Elementary School student wrote. The driver of Bus No. 366, the child added, drove so fast that it felt \"like the bus is going to flip over.\" And when a student stood in the aisle, the child wrote, the driver \"stops the bus and he makes people hit their head.\" \n Five days later, the bus driver, Johnthony K. Walker, driving 37 children home from Woodmore, strayed from his route and crashed, leaving six children dead in one of the country's deadliest school bus wrecks in recent years. \n The crash, for which Walker has been charged with vehicular homicide, is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Chattanooga police. Records released today by the Hamilton County Department of Education showed that Walker's behavior was a frequent worry this semester. \n In a statement, the school district acknowledged that its records contained \"many emails of complaint and concern.\" Walker, 24, is not a district employee and instead worked for Durham School Services, a contractor based in Illinois that says it carries more than 1 million schoolchildren each day. \n Complaints about Walker flowed into \u2014 and from \u2014 Woodmore. In September, a parent, Jasmine Mateen, wrote to a teacher that the bus driver was cursing students and slamming on his brakes, \"making them hit they heads and fall out\" of their seats. \n \"He did intentional stuff to them kids on the bus all the time,\" Mateen said in an interview Tuesday, a day after one of her 6-year-old daughters was killed in the wreck. Two of Mateen's other children were injured. \n More than a month after Mateen's letter, one of Woodmore's behavioral specialists investigated when Walker complained about disrespectful students. According to the records released, the specialist, Carlis Shackelford, said that Walker \"stated he did not care about the students and proceeded to tell the students he did not care about them.\" An administrator spoke with Walker soon afterward. \n About the time that school officials wrote emails expressing alarm about how often Walker was making referrals for behavioral issues aboard his bus, they also documented concerns about his driving. \n \"On Tuesday, 11/8, the driver, in my opinion, was driving way too fast when he pulled out of our school,\" Woodmore's principal, Brenda Adamson-Cothran, wrote in an email on Nov. 11. \"It was not as bad as yesterday, but still not optimal.\" \n On Nov. 16, records show, the principal warned in an email that six students had reported that Walker \"was swerving and purposely trying to cause them to fall today.\" \n A Chattanooga police officer, in an arrest affidavit that was released Tuesday, said that Walker had been driving \"at a high rate of speed, well above the posted speed limit of 30 mph\" on Monday afternoon. The police said Wednesday that Walker, who had been involved in a minor bus crash in September, was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of Monday's wreck. \n Durham has not responded to questions about its hiring practices or Walker's tenure in his part-time job. On Wednesday, the company's chief executive, David A. Duke, apologized for the wreck and said Durham would \"cooperate fully\" with investigators. \n The school district said Friday that it \"does not have any records of any accidents or disciplinary records pertaining to Durham employees.\" A spokeswoman for Durham, Molly Hart, said the company had no comment about the documents the school district released. \n ", "author": "New York Times", "title": "Records show complaints about driver in school bus crash"}
