The reviewing stand is where then President Donald Trump will view the inaugural parade on Jan. 20, 2017. \n WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. >> President-elect Donald Trump claimed without evidence Sunday that \"millions\" voted illegally in the national election, scoffing at Hillary Clinton's nearly 2 million edge in the popular vote and returning to his campaign mantra of a rigged race even as he prepares to enter the White House in less than two months. \n Trump and his lieutenants assailed an effort \u2014 now joined by Clinton \u2014 to recount votes in up to three battleground states, calling the push fraudulent, the work of \"crybabies\" and, in Trump's estimation, \"sad.\" \n The president-elect went on to cast a shadow over the legitimacy of an election that he actually won, tweeting that \"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\" He provided further contended that if the popular vote determined the presidency, \"It would have been much easier for me to win\" it because he would have altered his campaign to pile up overall vote totals, not Electoral College votes. \n In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally \n There's been no indication of widespread vote manipulation, illegal voting or hacking that materially affected the outcome one way or the other. It's that very lack of evidence that suggests Trump is likely to prevail in recounts. \n As Trump worked to fill foreign policy and national security posts in his Cabinet, a top adviser expressed astonishment that 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney remained under consideration for secretary of state after his campaign-long questioning of Trump's character, intellect and integrity. \n Trump on Sunday tweeted part of Clinton's concession speech, when she told supporters they must accept that \"Donald Trump is going to be our president,\" and snippets from her debate remarks, when she denounced the Republican nominee for refusing to say in advance that he would accept the Election Day verdict. \n This came on top of his saying it was a \"scam\" that Green Party nominee Jill Stein was revisiting the vote count in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and as of Wednesday, held a lead of almost 11,000 votes in Michigan, with the results awaiting state certification Monday. His Michigan margin was a hair's breadth 0.22 percent of the state's votes. \n Clinton leads the national popular vote by close to 2 million votes, but Trump won 290 electoral votes to Clinton's 232, not counting Michigan. She could conceivably tip the electoral balance in the remote event that all flipped to her in recounts. \n Trump planned to return to New York on Sunday after spending Thanksgiving weekend at his West Palm Beach estate. His transition team said the president-elect had scheduled a series of meetings Monday with prospective administration hires. \n Among the jobs Trump has still yet to fill: secretary of state. Internal division over the position again spilled out into the open on Sunday as Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway voiced her concerns with the possibility of Romney landing such a significant position. \n Trump supporters \"feel a bit betrayed that you can get a Romney back in there after everything he did,\" Conway said. \"We don't even know if he voted for Donald Trump. He and his consultants were nothing but awful to Donald Trump for a year.\" She added that she was \"reflecting what the grassroots are saying.\" \n Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker are among other prospects to serve as the country's top diplomat. \n \"I'm all for party unity, but I'm not sure we have to pay for that with the secretary of state position,\" Conway said. \n Trump's incoming chief of staff, national party Chairman Reince Priebus, acknowledged that Romney would represent \"a team of rivals concept.\" \n Trump was mostly silent on the brewing recount effort until it became known that Clinton would join it, at least in Wisconsin. On Saturday, a day after Wisconsin officials said they would conduct the first presidential recount in the state's history, Clinton campaign attorney Marc Elias said: \"We intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.\" \n Elias said Clinton would take the same approach in Pennsylvania and Michigan if Stein were to follow through with recount requests in those states. \n That loosened Trump's tongue. \n \"Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in,\" Trump tweeted Sunday. \"Nothing will change.\" \n He quoted from her concession speech \u2014 \"We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead\" \u2014 and he concluded: \"So much time and money will be spent \u2013 same result! Sad.\" \n On NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Conway said Stein, \"the Hillary people\" and others supporting recounts have to decide whether they are going to back a peaceful transition \"or if they're going to be a bunch of crybabies and sore losers about an election that they can't turn around.\" \n Priebus, on \"Fox News Sunday,\" called the effort a \"total and complete distraction and a fraud and something that they should drop.\" \n Clinton's lawyer said her team has been combing through the results since the election in search of anomalies that would suggest hacking by Russians or others and found \"no actionable evidence\" of an altered outcome. Moreover, Elias said, Trump has a vote lead even in the closest states that well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. \n But \"we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself,\" he said. \n Trump beat Clinton in Wisconsin by fewer than 22,200 votes, less than 1 percent of votes cast. He won Pennsylvania by some 70,600 votes, just more than 1 percentage point over Clinton. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump assails recount push, claims millions voted illegally"}

{"date": "November 27, 2016", "text": "BEIRUT >> Simultaneous advances by Syrian government and Kurdish-led forces into eastern Aleppo on Sunday set off a tide of displacement inside the divided city, with thousands of residents evacuating their premises, and threatened to cleave the opposition's enclave. \n Rebel defenses collapsed as government forces pushed into the city's Sakhour neighborhood, coming within one kilometer (0.6 miles) of commanding a corridor in eastern Aleppo for the first time since rebels swept into the city in 2012, according to Syrian state media and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group. \n Kurdish-led forces operating autonomously of the rebels and the government meanwhile seized the Bustan al-Basha neighborhood, allowing thousands of civilians to flee the decimated district to the predominantly Kurdish Sheikh Maqsoud, in the city's north, according to Ahmad Hiso Araj, an official with the Syrian Democratic Forces. \n The government's push, backed by thousands of Shiite militia fighters from Lebanon, Iraq, and Iran, and under the occasional cover of the Russian air force, has laid waste to Aleppo's eastern neighborhoods. \n An estimated quarter-million people are trapped in wretched conditions in the city's rebel-held eastern districts since the government sealed its siege of the enclave in late August. Food supplies are running perilously low, the U.N. warned Thursday, and a relentless air assault by government forces has damaged or destroyed every hospital in the area. \n Residents in east Aleppo said in distressed messages on social media that thousands of people were fleeing to the city's government-controlled western neighborhoods, away from the government's merciless assault, or deeper into opposition-held eastern Aleppo. \n \"The situation in besieged Aleppo (is) very very bad, thousands of eastern residents are moving to the western side of the city,\" said Khaled Khatib, a photographer for the Syrian Civil Defense search-and-rescue group, also known as the White Helmets. \n \"Aleppo is going to die,\" he posted on Twitter. \n The Britain-based Observatory, which monitors the conflict through a network of local contacts, said around 1,700 civilians had escaped to government-controlled areas and another 2,500 to Kurdish authorities. \n More than 250 civilians have been killed in the government's bombardment of eastern Aleppo over past 13 days, according to the Observatory. \n Locals reported thousands more were moving within the eastern neighborhoods, away from the front lines, but staying inside areas of opposition control. \n \"The conditions are terrifying\" said 28-year-old Modar Sakho, a nurse in eastern Aleppo. \n Wissam Zarqa, an English teacher in eastern Aleppo and outspoken government opponent, said some families would stay put in the face of advancing government forces. \n Syrian state media reported government forces had seized the Jabal Badro neighborhood and entered Sakhour Sunday after it took control of the Masaken Hanano neighborhood Saturday. \n Syrian state TV broadcast a video Saturday showing a teary reunion between a soldier and his family after nearly five years apart, according to the report. It said the family had been trapped in Masaken Hanano. \n The Lebanese Al-Manar TV channel reported from the neighborhood Sunday morning, showing workers and soldiers clearing debris against a backdrop of bombed-out buildings on both sides of a wide thoroughfare. Al-Manar is operated by Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group aligned with the Syrian government. \n The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces' advance into Bustan al-Basha dealt the opposition a further blow. \n Rebels and opposition figures have long accused the SDF and its predecessor groups of conspiring with the government to quash a nationwide revolt. \n Araj denied there was any coordination between government and Kurdish-led forces. \n \"We were responding to calls from residents in Bustan al-Basha to secure the neighborhood,\" he said. He added the SDF had entered the area handily as rebel militants fled. \n Aleppo used to be Syria's largest city and commerce capital before its neighborhoods were devastated by the country's more than five-year-long civil war. \n The U.N.'s child agency warned Sunday that nearly 500,000 children were now living under siege in Syria, cut off from food and medical aid, mostly in areas under government control. That figure has doubled in less than a year. \n Many are now spending their days underground, as hospitals, schools and homes remain vulnerable to aerial bombardment. \n \"Children are being killed and injured, too afraid to go to school or even play, surviving with little food and hardly any medicine,\" said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake. \"This is no way to live \u2014 and too many are dying.\" \n Activists also reported Sunday tens of civilian casualties from a presumed government or Russian airstrike on a village outside Aleppo. \n The Local Coordination Committees activist network in Syria reported 15 civilians killed in a Russian airstrike on the village of Anjara, controlled by the opposition in the western Aleppo countryside, and tens of others wounded. Activists usually identify planes by their silhouettes and home base. \n The Observatory said the strike was accompanied by raids on other opposition-held villages in the Aleppo countryside. \n Meanwhile, Anadolu also reported Sunday that the Islamic State group had used chemical weapons against Turkish-backed Syrian opposition fighters in northern Syria, wounding 22. The report cited a statement by the chief of general staff's office. The report could not be immediately verified independently. \n Later Sunday, Turkey's emergency relief directorate, which investigated the claim, said it found no trace of chemical warfare. The military was not available for further comment. \n Elsewhere in Syria, Israeli aircraft struck a machine gun-mounted vehicle inside the country Sunday, killing four Islamic State-affiliated militants on board after they opened fire on a military patrol on the Israeli side of the Golan Heights, according to the Israeli military. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Cinar Kiper in Istanbul contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Syrian army Aleppo advance displaces thousands"}

{"date": "November 27, 2016", "text": "HOUSTON >> The U.S. Supreme Court is set to examine whether the nation's busiest state for capital punishment is trying to put to death a convicted killer who's intellectually disabled, which would make him ineligible for execution under the court's current guidance. \n Lawyers for prisoner Bobby James Moore, 57, contend that the state's highest criminal court, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, ignored current medical standards and required use of outdated standards when it decided Moore isn't mentally disabled. That ruling removed a legal hurdle to Moore's execution for the shotgun slaying of a Houston grocery store clerk in 1980. \n The Texas court is a \"conspicuous outlier\" among state courts and \"defies both the Constitution and common sense,\" Clifford Sloan, Moore's lead lawyer, told the justices in written briefs submitted ahead of Tuesday's scheduled oral arguments. Such a \"head-in-the-sand approach \u2026 ignores advances in the medical community's understanding and assessment of intellectual disability over the past quarter century,\" he wrote. \n Moore's lawyers want his death sentence set aside, contending his punishment would violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment and the Supreme Court's 2002 ruling in a North Carolina case that prohibited execution of the mentally disabled. \n The Texas attorney general's office says the state \"fully complies\" with Supreme Court precedents. The state points to its use of 1992 clinical definitions for intellectual disability as cited by the high court in its 2002 decision. And the office says it has consulted and considered more recent standards. \n The question before the high court \"rests on a false premise,\" Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller said, arguing that Moore's claim of intellectual disability is refuted \"under any relevant standard.\" \n Two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a Florida law that barred any other evidence of intellectual disability if an inmate's IQ was over 70. Texas uses a three-pronged test to define intellectual disability: IQ scores, with 70 generally considered a threshold; an inmate's ability to interact with others and care for him or herself; and whether evidence of deficiencies in either of those areas occurred before age 18. \n The state says Moore had a troubled childhood with little supervision and scored 57, 77 and 78 on IQ tests before dropping out of school in the ninth grade. He'd been convicted four times of felonies by age 17 but never was diagnosed with an intellectual disability as a youth, the state argues. \n It describes him as living on the streets, playing pool for money and mowing lawns. During the fatal robbery of 72-year-old Houston supermarket clerk James McCarble, Moore wore a wig and fled to Louisiana afterward, and had represented himself in legal actions, showing the required intellectual capabilities, the state contends. \n Moore's lawyers argue the state \"cherry-picked\" specific higher IQ scores, and that at age 13 Moore had no basic understanding of the days of the week or seasons of the year, couldn't tell time and couldn't read or write or keep up in school. \n Since the Supreme Court allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976, Texas has carried out 537 executions, far more than any other state. Moore arrived on death row in July 1980, and only five of the state's some 250 condemned inmates have been there longer. \n In 1999, an appeals court threw out his death sentence, ruling that the legal help at his trial was deficient. At a new punishment hearing two years later, a Harris County jury again sentenced him to die. \n In an appeal of that verdict, the Court of Criminal Appeals returned the case to the trial court for a hearing, where the judge decided Moore was mentally disabled and ineligible for execution. But the appeals court rejected that recommendation, saying the trial judge had disregarded case law. Eight of the appeals court's nine members participated in the case, and two of them disagreed with the majority. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Death penalty, the mentally disabled at issue for justices"}

Hundreds of people have been camped north of the river for months to protest the pipeline. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sent tribal leaders a letter Friday, saying the land was being closed to the public on Dec. 5. \n MANDAN, N.D. >> Don't look for apologies from the North Dakota sheriff leading the response to the Dakota Access oil pipeline protests, especially for the recent \u2014 and, in some circles, controversial \u2014 action against demonstrators who he believes have become increasingly aggressive. \n \"We are just not going to allow people to become unlawful,\" said Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier, a veteran of the North Dakota Highway Patrol and National Guard who was elected to his first term as sheriff about two years ago. \"It's just not going to happen.\" \n More than 525 people from across the country have been arrested during months of protests over the four-state, $3.8 billion pipeline, all here in support of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe that's fighting the project because it believes it threatens drinking water and cultural sites on their nearby reservation. \n His department's job of policing the protesters \u2014 the vast majority who've been camping on federal land that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says it'll close in December for safety concerns \u2014 has cost the county more than $8 million, even with help from the state Highway Patrol and officers from various states. Their tactics, however, have drawn criticism from Standing Rock's tribal leader as well as protest organizers and celebrities. \n Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault said he and Kirchmeier have met many times and each meeting has been tense and unproductive. \"I don't think aggressive force is necessary and he thinks it's necessary,\" Archambault said. \n In the most recent clash between police and protesters, which was near the path of the pipeline and spanned Sunday night into Monday morning, officers used tear gas, rubber bullets and large water hoses in freezing weather. Organizers said at least 17 protesters were taken to the hospital, some for hypothermia and one for a serious arm injury, and one officer was injured. \n Archambault called the confrontation an act of terror against unarmed protesters that was sanctioned by Kirchmeier. \n \"His job is to protect and serve, not to inflict harm and hurt,\" Archambault said. \n But Kirchmeier, who has the backing of the state's Republican governor and attorney general, defended officers' actions. He and other authorities said officers were assaulted with rocks, bottles and burning logs. \n Kirchmeier, a 53-year-old married father, grew up in this county, which has a population of fewer than 30,000 people \u2014 about 15 residents per square mile. He retired from the North Dakota Highway Patrol as a captain after 29 years, and had served in the National Guard for four years. \n The protests are demanding: Kirchmeier hasn't had a day off since August, routinely working more than 12 hours a day. The 34 deputies in his department are pulling similar shifts, he said, even with help from more than 1,200 officers from North Dakota and nine other states. \n Some officers have been targeted online by protesters, Kirchmeier included. He said someone recently posted the location of his father's grave, which he took as an effort to intimidate. \n \"Social media has been very bad and it has turned out like law enforcement is building the pipeline,\" he said. \"I can't stop the pipeline. My job is to enforce the law.\" \n President Barack Obama raised the possibility of rerouting the pipeline earlier this month, and construction on the last remaining large chunk, which is on federal land near the reservation, was halted by the Corps for the time being. But Kelcy Warren, CEO of pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners, told The Associated Press the company won't do any rerouting. \n Kirchmeier, like many other of the state's elected officials, blame the Obama administration for not stepping in. \n \"The issue of the pipeline is not going to get solved with protesters and cops looking at each other,\" Kirchmeier said. \"This is bigger and takes way more political clout than what the county has to offer.\" \n Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said Kirchmeier is in \"an incredibly difficult position.\" \n \"He has the responsibility to allow people to lawfully exercise their First Amendment rights and he has the obligation to stop it when there is violence contrary to the law,\" Stenehjem said. \"And now there are a significant number or lawless people and the citizens are worried.\" \n Gov. Jack Dalrymple said Kirchmeier \"has done a remarkable job dealing with all the issues brought about by these protests. He has been totally professional in what is not a typical law enforcement challenge in North Dakota.\" \n With winter looming, the Corps has decided to close the land north of the Cannonball River where the Oceti Sakowin protest encampment have flourished on Dec. 5, also citing the confrontations between protesters and authorities, according to a letter Archambault said he received. \n \"To be clear, this means that no member of the general public, to include Dakota Access pipeline protesters, can be on these Corps lands,\" the letter provided by the tribe said. \n But protest organizers said Saturday that they don't intend to leave or stop their acts of civil disobedience. \n Kirchmeier said before the Corps' move that North Dakota residents who have grown tired \u2014 and increasingly afraid \u2014 of the protests are backing law enforcement. \n \"People don't want their livelihoods disrupted,\" he said. \"They are not taking this lightly.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Sheriff on pipeline protests: 'My job is to enforce the law'"}

But it also adds to the uncertainty ahead with the transition from an Obama to Trump administration. \n WASHINGTON >> Fidel Castro's passing removes what was long the single greatest psychological barrier to a warmer U.S.-Cuba relationship. But it also adds to the uncertainty ahead with the transition from an Obama to a Trump administration. \n \"A brutal dictator\" of a \"totalitarian island,\" declared President-elect Donald Trump, underscoring the historical trauma still separating the countries. \n A more restrained President Barack Obama, carefully promoting and working to preserve his own attempt to rebuild those ties, said history would assess Castro's impact and that the Cuban people could reflect \"with powerful emotions\" about how their longtime leader influenced their country. \n In death as in life, Castro has divided opinion: a revolutionary who stood up to American aggression or a ruthless dictator whose movement trampled human rights and democratic aspirations. \n President Raul Castro, Fidel's younger brother, is 85. Their Communist Party shows no signs of opening up greater political space despite agreeing with the United States to re-establish embassies and facilitate greater trade and investment. \n As Obama leaves office in January, his decision to engage rather than pressure Havana in the hopes of forging new bonds could quickly unravel. Trump has hardly championed the effort and Republican leaders in Congress fiercely opposed Obama's calls to end the 55-year-old U.S. trade embargo of the island. \n \"We know that this moment fills Cubans \u2014 in Cuba and in the United States \u2014 with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families and of the Cuban nation,\" Obama said. \n He offered neither condemnation nor praise for Castro, who outlasted invasion and assassination plots, and presided over the Cuban missile crisis, which took the world to the brink of nuclear war. \n \"History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him,\" Obama said, adding that U.S.-Cuban relations shouldn't be defined \"by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends.\" \n Trump didn't pass off his evaluation to the historians. \n \"Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Fidel Castro's legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.\" \n Trump expressed hope that Castro's death would mark a \"move away from the horrors\" toward a future where Cubans live in freedom. But he said nothing about Obama's project to reset ties, and even hailed the election support he received from veterans of the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion that was backed by the CIA. \n Such a statement probably will irritate Havana, coming after a two-year period of intense diplomatic discussions with Washington that have done more to improve relations between the countries than anything in the past 5 \u00bd decades. \n Castro's reign began when his improbable insurrection ousted the U.S.-backed strongman Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Only 32 at the time, Castro was the youngest leader in Latin America and inspired revolutionaries as far afield as Africa and Asia. \n But Castro's socialist Cuba was anything but an idyll, and the United States quickly became his fiercest opponent. \n Members of Batista's government went before summary courts, with at least 582 executed by firing squad in the first two years of Castro's rule. Independent newspapers were closed. Gays were herded into camps for \"re-education.\" Tens of thousands were held as political prisoners. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans fled. After the Soviet Union vanished, Cuba's economy collapsed. \n In Miami and other American cities, a powerful emigre community emerged that was bitterly opposed to any improvement in U.S. relations with Castro's government. For many years, their threat alone was enough to sink any attempts to bridge divides. \n The dynamic began changing a decade ago, as Castro stepped back from public life. His health ailing, he handed over power to brother Raul in 2008 and a period of limited economic reforms was ushered in. \n After Cuba's government released American prisoner Alan Gross and agreed to a spy swap with Washington in 2014, Obama and Raul Castro felt they finally had enough trust to embark on a journey of rapprochement. \n While some U.S. investment has opened up and travel rules for Americans are now greatly eased, the normalization has been limited because Obama could never get Republican lawmakers to end the vast restrictions tied up in the trade embargo. Triumphant alongside Trump in November, some GOP leaders have vowed to reverse Obama's effort. \n \"Now that Fidel Castro is dead, the cruelty and oppression of his regime should die with him,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement Saturday. \"Sadly, much work remains to secure the freedom of the Cuban people.\" \n Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who is pushing legislation to scrap the embargo, said in an interview that Castro's shadow \"loomed over all the government's decisions\" even though he had left power. She hoped Trump and Republican leaders would respond to Castro's death by at least not rolling back Obama's openings to Cuba and perhaps advancing them. \n During his campaign, Trump criticized Obama for striking a \"very weak agreement\" and threatened to reverse Obama's executive orders \"unless the Castro regime meets our demands.\" He never laid out those demands, and at other times hinted about being amenable to more U.S. investment in Cuba. \n As with much of his foreign policy, Trump never outlined clearly a set of policy objectives with Cuba. The ambiguity leaves much of the recent warming on uncertain ground. It's unclear if Castro's death, however powerful for castigators and champions, will dramatically sway Trump one way or the other. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Analysis: Much uncertainty ahead in U.S.-Cuba relationship"}

{"date": "November 27, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Breaking with tradition, Donald Trump will move into the White House after the inauguration while wife Melania and 10-year-old son Barron plan to remain in New York City until at least the end of the school year. \n WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. >> President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday it's \"sad\" Hillary Clinton is joining an effort to force recounts of votes from the Nov. 8 election in up to three crucial states. \n Trump tweeted part of Clinton's concession speech, when she told supporters they must accept that \"Donald Trump is going to be our president,\" and snippets from her debate remarks, when she assailed the Republican nominee for refusing to say in advance that he would accept the Election Day verdict. \n And it came on top of his saying it was a \"scam\" that Green Party nominee Jill Stein was revisiting the vote count in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Trump won Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and as of Wednesday, held a lead of almost 11,000 votes in Michigan, with the results awaiting state certification Monday. \n Clinton leads the national popular vote by close to 2 million votes, but Trump won 290 electoral votes to Clinton's 232, not counting Michigan. It takes 270 to win the presidency, and the three states in question could tip the electoral balance to Clinton in the remote event that all flipped to her in recounts. \n Wisconsin officials said Friday they were moving forward with the first presidential recount in state history. Clinton joined the effort Saturday, with her campaign attorney Marc Elias saying, \"We intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides.\" \n Elias said Clinton would take the same approach in Pennsylvania and Michigan if Stein were to follow through with recount requests in those states. \n Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway noted that the president-elect hadn't ruled out the possibility of pursuing a criminal investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state, even if Trump indicated he'd rather move past the issue. \n \"He's been incredibly gracious and magnanimous to Secretary Clinton at a time when, for whatever reason, her folks are saying they will join in a recount to try to somehow undo the 70-plus electoral votes that he beat her by,\" Conway said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \n Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Clinton rival during the Democratic primary turned ally during the general election, defended the recount effort, telling CNN that leaders in both parties commonly request them. \"No one expects there to be profound change, but there's nothing wrong with going through the process,\" he said. \n He also suggested he would support a change to the nation's electoral college system, which allowed Trump to win the presidency despite lagging in the popular vote. \n \"We have one candidate who got 2 million more votes than the other candidate and she is not going to be sworn in as president,\" Sander said. \"And I think on the surface that's a little bit weird.\" \n Trump had been paying little if any attention to the recount push by Stein, who has raised millions of dollars for the effort since drawing a mere 1 percent of the vote nationally. But Clinton's stance changed his tune. \n \"Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in,\" Trump tweeted on Sunday. \"Nothing will change.\" \n He quoted from her concession speech \u2014 \"We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead\" \u2014 and he concluded: \"So much time and money will be spent \u2013 same result! Sad.\" \n Trump, who repeatedly challenged the integrity of the U.S. election system before his win, earlier called the recount push \"a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded.\" \n Trump was expected to return to New York on Sunday after spending the Thanksgiving holiday weekend at his West Palm Beach estate. His transition team said the president-elect had scheduled a series of meetings Monday with prospective administration hires. \n Among the jobs Trump has still yet to fill: secretary of state. \n Internal division over the position again spilled out into the open on Sunday as Conway said she had personal concerns with the possibility of Mitt Romney serving as the nation's top diplomat. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker are among other prospects. \n Conway noted that Romney and his allies regularly attacked Trump during the campaign. \n \"I'm all for party unity, but I'm not sure we have to pay for that with the secretary of state position,\" she said. \n Trump's incoming chief of staff, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus, acknowledged that a Romney pick would represent \"a team of rivals concept.\" \n That possibility, Priebus told \"Fox News Sunday,\" should tell the public that Trump wants to \"put the best possible people together for all Americans, no matter who you are, what your religion \u2014 whatever your opinion is, he wants to move forward looking through the windshield and not the rearview mirror.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump calls it 'sad' that Clinton joining recount effort"}

{"date": "November 27, 2016", "text": "AP PHOTO/WILFREDO LEE \n Alexandra Villoch, president and publisher of the Miami Herald Media Company, hands out a special edition of the Miami Herald with the headline \"Castro Dead,\" in front of the Versailles Restaurant in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami as members of the Cuban community react to the death of Fidel Castro, Saturday, Nov. 26, 2016. Castro, who led a rebel army to improbable victory in Cuba, embraced Soviet-style communism and defied the power of 10 U.S. presidents during his half century rule, died at age 90. \n Miami \u00bb Wearing his \"Bay of Pigs Veteran\" shirt, 80-year-old Rafael Torre stood amid hundreds of Cuban-Americans celebrating the death of Fidel Castro and marveled that he remained in power for so long. \n Cuban exiles such as Torre tried numerous ways to dislodge Castro after he took control in 1959, including the failed 1961 CIA-backed invasion memorialized on his shirt. Now, like many others, Torre is hopeful for Cuba's future with the bearded revolutionary leader finally gone. \n \"We tried for more than 50 years but couldn't do it. Now he's dead, and maybe things can change,\" Torre said. \"It might take three or four years. Maybe the revolution will be on the streets in three or four months.\" \n Thousands of people took to the streets of Miami and nearby cities Saturday shortly after the early morning announcement of Castro's death at age 90, and kept the party going all day. They banged pots with spoons, honked car horns, waved Cuban and U.S. flags in the air and whooped in jubilation on Calle Ocho \u2014 as Little Havana's 8th Street is universally known. \n Police blocked off streets leading to Cafe Versailles, the quintessential Cuban-American hotspot where strong cafecitos \u2014 sweetened espresso \u2014 were as common as a harsh word about Castro, the nemesis of so many exiles for so long. Many said they recognize his death alone doesn't mean immediate democracy or freedom for the communist island. \n \"We need for the people of Cuba to have the freedom we have in the U.S., but this changes nothing. There won't be change until the people revolt,\" said Juan Cobas, 50, who came to the U.S. from Cuba at age 13. \n Others saw Fidel's death as a sign that a generation that has ruled Cuba for decades is passing from the world stage, many noting that his brother, current President Raul Castro, is 85. \n \"I'm feeling this is the beginning of the end,\" said Alex Pineiro, 32. \"Fidel was the architect of what's going on. It's a mix of emotions, I'm happy he's dead, but I'm celebrating hope.\" \n There were no reports of violence or any arrests during the demonstrations, Miami police spokeswoman Kenia Fallat said Saturday. Miami-Dade County officials said there were no plans to activate the emergency operations center \u2014 another sign of the more subdued reaction to Castro's death than might have previously been expected. \n \"They are celebrating but in a very peaceful way,\" Fallat said of the demonstrators. \n The U.S. Coast Guard was running regular patrols and not increasing staffing levels or taking other emergency steps, said Petty Officer Jonathan Lally. The Coast Guard has seen a sharp uptick recently in Cubans attempting to arrive in Florida by sea, with at least 7,411 Cubans attempting to migrate over the Florida Straits in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 compared with 4,473 in the same timeframe last year. \n After Castro took power, Cubans fled the island to Miami, Tampa, New Jersey and elsewhere. Some were loyalists of Fulgencio Batista, the president prior to Castro, while others left with the hope they would be able to return soon, after Castro was toppled. He never was. \n Many other exiles believed they would never be free under Castro and his communist regime. Thousands left behind their possessions, loved ones, and hard-earned educations and businesses, traveling to the U.S. by plane, boat or raft. Many Cubans died on the ocean trip to South Florida. Some had land and possessions taken by the Castro government. \n The ones that made it to Miami took a largely, and vehemently, anti-Castro stance. \n \"He should not be revered. He should be reviled,\" said U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican who was born in Cuba. \n Some people said the election of Donald Trump as president could lead to a tougher stance against the Havana government that might hasten change. \n \"I hope that Trump takes a hard line against the Castro regime,\" said Henry Marinello, 60, who left Cuba as a child in 1961, \n On New Year's Eve every year, Cubans in Miami utter a toast in Spanish as they hoist glasses of liquor: \"Next year in Cuba.\" But as the Cuban exiles aged, and as Castro outlived them, and as President Barack Obama eroded the embargo and younger Cubans returned to the island, the toast rang silent in many households. \n News of Castro's death was long anticipated and had been the subject of countless rumors over the decades, so that it became something of a running joke. This time, though, it was real. \n \"We're all celebrating, this is like a carnival,\" said 72-year-old Jay Fernandez, who came to Miami when he was 18 in 1961 after he was jailed twice by the Cuban government. He and his wife and another woman held up a bilingual sign he'd made four years ago when Castro first became ill. \"Satan, Fidel is now yours. Give him what he deserves. Don't let him rest in peace.\" \n ___ \n Lush reported from St. Petersburg, Florida, and Anderson from Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
