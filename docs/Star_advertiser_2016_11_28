The British Aerospace 146 short-haul plane, operated by a charter airline named LaMia, declared an emergency at 10 p.m. Monday local time (0300 GMT) because of an electrical failure. \n \"It's a tragedy of huge proportions,\" Medellin Mayor Federico Gutierrez told Blu Radio. \n The aircraft, which had departed from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, was transporting the first division Chapecoense soccer team from southern Brazil. The team was scheduled to play Wednesday in the first of a two-game Copa Sudamericana final against Atletico Nacional of Medellin. \n \"May God accompany our athletes, officials, journalists and other guests traveling with our delegation,\" the club said in a brief statement on its Facebook page. \n South America's soccer federation extended its condolences to the entire Chapecoense community and said its president, Luis Dominguez, was on his way to Medellin. All soccer activities were suspended until further notice, the organization said in a statement. \n Elkin Ospina, mayor of La Ceja, near where the crash took place, said the priority is searching for survivors and scores of rescuers working through the night had been heartened after pulling three passengers alive from the wreckage. \n Authorities and rescuers were immediately activated but an air force helicopter had to turn back because of low visibility. Heavy rainfall is complicating the nighttime search and authorities urged journalists to stay off the roads to facilitate the entry of ambulances and rescuers. \n Images broadcast on local television showed three male passengers arriving to a local hospital in ambulances on stretchers and covered in blankets connected to an IV. All were apparently alive and one of them was reportedly a Chapecoense defender named Alan Ruschel. \n The plane was carrying 72 passengers and nine crew members, aviation authorities said in a statement. Local radio said the same aircraft transported Argentina's national squad for a match earlier this month in Brazil, and previously had transported Venezuela's national team. \n A video published on the team's Facebook page showed the team readying for the flight earlier today in Sao Paulo's Guarulhos international airport. \n The team, from the small city of Chapeco, was in the middle of a fairy tale season. It joined Brazil's first division in 2014 for the first time since the 1970s and made it last week to the Copa Sudamericana finals \u2014 the equivalent of the UEFA Europa League tournament \u2014 after defeating Argentina's San Lorenzo squad. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Plane carrying soccer team from Brazil crashes in Colombia"}

{"date": "November 28, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / SEPT. 2001 \n The Agincourt Reef is located about 30 miles off the coast near the northern reaches of the 1,200-mile long Great Barrier Reef. Australian scientists say warming oceans have caused the biggest die-off of corals ever recorded on the Great Barrier Reef. \n CANBERRA, Australia >> Warming oceans this year have caused the largest die-off of corals ever recorded on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, scientists said Tuesday.  \n The worst-affected area is a 700-kilometer (400-mile) swath in the north of the World Heritage-listed 2,300-kilometer (1,400-mile) chain of reefs off Australia's northeast coast, said the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. \n The center, based at James Cook University in Queensland state, found during dive surveys in October and November that the swath north of Port Douglas had lost an average of 67 percent of its shallow-water corals in the past nine months. \n Farther south, over the vast central and southern regions that cover most of the reef, scientists found a much lower death toll. \n The central region lost 6 percent of bleached coral and the southern region only 1 percent. \n \"The mortality we've measured along the length of the Great Barrier Reef is incredibly patchy,\" the center's director, Terry Hughes, told reporters. \"There's very severe damage in the northern section of the reef.\" \n \"The good news is that south of Port Douglas, including the major tourist areas around Cairns and the Whitsundays (Whitsunday Islands), have had relatively low levels of mortality,\" he added. \n The governments of Australia and Queensland will update the UNESCO World Heritage Center this week on progress being made to protect and improve the reef, including their response to coral bleaching. \n Providing a status update to the World Heritage Committee was required as part of its decision in June last year not to list the reef as \"in danger.\" \n Federal Minister for the Environment and Energy Josh Frydenberg said Tuesday that the reef's coral cover had increased by 19 percent in recent years before it suffered a \"significant bleaching event\" this year, caused by the El Nino weather effect and climate change. \n \"What that shows is that the Great Barrier Reef is very resilient and quite strong,\" Frydenberg's office said in a statement. \n The governments plan to spend 2 billion Australian dollars ($1.5 billion) over the next decade on improving the reef's health. \n Hughes said the coral death rates in the north would likely make the task of keeping the reef off the \"in danger\" list much harder. \n \"In its ongoing dialogue with UNESCO, Australia has said the outstanding universal values of reef are in tact because of the pristine condition of the northern reef. That's simply no longer the case,\" Hughes said. \n Researcher Andrew Baird said the 2016 coral die-off was \"substantially worse\" than the previous worst-ever event in 1998. \n \"The proportion of reefs that were severely affected was much, much higher,\" Baird said, adding that he did not have precise figures immediately available. \n The 1998 event was restricted to in-shore reefs around the Queensland coastal city of Townsville, while the 2016 destruction affected a much larger area, he said. \n Scientists expect that the northern region will take at least 10 to 15 years to regain the lost corals. They are concerned that another bleaching event could interrupt that recovery. \n There have been three extreme mass bleaching events in 18 years on the reef. In each case, the areas that suffered the worst bleaching were where the water was hottest for the longest period of time. \n Reef tourism operator Craig Stephen did not expect the dead coral would diminish visitors' experience of one of Australia's biggest tourist drawcards. \n \"The patchiness of the bleaching means that we can still provide our customers with a world-class coral reef experience by taking them to reefs that are still in top condition,\" Stephen said in a statement. \n Graeme Kelleher, who headed the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for 16 years, said last week that Australians must not buy the \"political lie\" that they can have the reef as well as major coal mines nearby. \n \"We've lost 50 percent of the coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef in the last 30 years and the main cause of that is the burning of fossil fuel. I sincerely hope UNESCO rejects the claim that the government is doing enough,\" Kelleher said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Great Barrier Reef sees record coral deaths this year"}

President-elect Trump has picked Elaine Chao as Transportation secretary. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Elevators close on Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., as he arrives at Trump Tower, on Nov. 16, in New York. \n NEW YORK >> President-elect Donald Trump made two Cabinet selections today, choosing fierce Obamacare critic Georgia Rep. Tom Price to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, and Elaine Chao, who served in the Cabinet of George W. Bush, to serve as the secretary of the Department of Transportation. \n Trump announced his choice of Price, while the selection of Chao, the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, was confirmed by a person with knowledge of the decision but not authorized to speak publicly. \n Price is \"exceptionally qualified\" to lead an effort to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's health care law, Trump said in a statement. The president-elect's transition team did not immediately respond to questions about the congressman's past commitment to transform Medicare into a voucher-like system, a position at odds with Trump's repeated campaign promises not to cut the popular health care program that serves an estimated 57 million people. \n \"Chairman Price, a renowned physician, has earned a reputation for being a tireless problem solver and the go-to expert on health care policy, making him the ideal choice to serve in this capacity,\" Trump said. \n Chao led the Department of Labor for several years under Bush. \n The president-elect appeared to still be torn over his choice for secretary of state. He summoned former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney to New York for dinner Tuesday night to discuss the post for a second time. He was also meeting with Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who is getting new attention from Trump's team. On Monday, Trump spent an hour with retired Gen. David Petraeus, another contender. \n Trump's decision to consider Romney for the powerful Cabinet post has sparked a public backlash from some of his closest aides and allies. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway has warned that it would be a \"betrayal\" to Trump supporters if he selected Romney, who was a severe critic of the president-elect during the campaign. \n Even as he weighed crucial Cabinet decisions, Trump appeared distracted by outside issues \u2014 or eager to create distractions himself. He took to Twitter early Tuesday to declare that \"nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag.\" He warned that those who do should face \"perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!\" \n Trump offered no context for his message. The Supreme Court has ruled that flag burning is protected by the First Amendment. \n The president-elect spent the weekend tweeting his opposition to recount efforts in up to three states led by Green Party candidate Jill Stein and joined by Hillary Clinton's team. He also falsely claimed that millions of people had voted illegally in the presidential election and provided no evidence to back up the charge. \n Trump won praise from Republicans Tuesday for his pick of Price to serve as health and human services secretary. A six-term congressman and orthopedic surgeon, Price has been a leading critic of Obama's health care law. If confirmed by the Senate, he would be a leading figure in Republican efforts to repeal the measure. \n Incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Price \"has proven to be far out of the mainstream of what Americans want\" for programs that help seniors, women, families and those with disabilities. His nomination, Schumer said, is \"akin to asking the fox to guard the henhouse.\" \n Trump's team also announced Tuesday that Seema Verma has been chosen to be administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \n Jason Miller, a transition team spokesman, said at least one other Cabinet post would be announced in the afternoon. He did not elaborate. \n Transition aides said Trump was likely at least a few days away from a decision on secretary of state. Romney has support from Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is heading the transition effort. \n Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a loyal Trump ally, was initially seen as the leading contender to helm the State Department. But questions about his overseas business dealings, as well as his public campaigning for the job, have given Trump pause. \n Trump is now said to be considering Giuliani to head the Homeland Security Department, according to those close to the transition process. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump to nominate Price as health secretary; Chao to transportation"}

The order includes the encampment called Oceti Sakowin, or Seven Council Fires camp. \n The agency cited North Dakota's oncoming winter and increasingly contentious clashes between protesters and police. \n But in a statement issued late Sunday, the Corps said it \"has no plans for forcible removal.\" Anyone on land north of the river, including the main protest camp, after the deadline may be prosecuted for trespassing. \n Gov. Jack Dalrymple called the Corps' position \"very puzzling.\" \n \"When you put out a pronouncement that people must leave your land by a certain date, I think you take on a responsibility to somehow bring that about,\" Dalrymple said. \"Clearly the responsibility of clearing that land now lies primarily with the Corps.\" \n But later on Monday, Dalrymple issued his own \"mandatory evacuation\" for the camp \"to safeguard against harsh winter conditions.\" But the order didn't specify any action to be taken against protesters who don't comply, and state Emergency Services spokeswoman Cecily Fong later said no action would be taken to enforce it. \n The 1,172-mile pipeline is nearly complete except for a small section beneath a Missouri River reservoir near the encampment, which is about 50 miles south of Bismarck. \n Opponents, who call themselves \"water protectors,\" worry about potential effects on drinking water on the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and farther downstream on the Missouri River, as well as destruction of cultural artifacts, including burial sites. They also believe the land near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers is still rightfully owned by the Standing Rock Sioux under a nearly 150-year-old treaty. \n County and state officials have been seeking federal law enforcement help for months and were initially buoyed by the Corps' order for protesters to move off the land. The agency's later announcement that it would not forcibly evict any demonstrators dampened hopes that the issue would soon be resolved, Morton County Commission Chairman Cody Schulz said. \n \"It's useless for local and state law enforcement, and the order from the Corps is self-serving and amounts to them limiting their liability,\" Schulz said. \n The sheriff said state and local officials lack jurisdiction to remove the protesters. \n \"This is a federal problem and needs to be dealt with by them,\" Kirchmeier said. \n During a news conference Saturday at the camp, protest organizers said they will not leave or stop their acts of civil disobedience. \n Standing Rock Sioux tribal leader Dave Archambault did not immediately return telephone calls on Monday. \n North Dakota's notoriously brutal winters may help empty the camp of protesters, many of them who are from out of state, Kirchmeier said. \n \"That's what I'm hoping, or at least cut the number of them,\" he added. \n Much of the state, including the encampment, was getting hit with the first big winter storm of the year Monday, as heavy snow and strong winds pounded the area. \n The sheriff said snowplow crews were working to clear roads throughout the county, but about a mile of a state highway leading to the encampment was being left unplowed. \n \"Workers do not feel safe there,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Orders could have little effect on pipeline protest camp"}

Romney denounced Trump in scathing terms during the campaign, prompting Trump to call him a \"choker\" who \"walks like a penguin.\" \n The spectacle of close aides who speak frequently with Trump in private being so explicit about their personal opinions in public raised the possibility that Conway was acting at Trump's behest. \n People involved in the transition process said Trump's decision on his secretary of state did not appear to be imminent. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was initially seen as the favorite for the diplomatic post, but Trump is said to have grown irritated by questions about Giuliani's international business ties, as well as the mayor's public campaigning for the job. \n Even with major administration decisions looming, Trump seems preoccupied by the prospect of a recount. \n \"Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in,\" He tweeted Sunday. \"Nothing will change.\" \n He quoted from Clinton's concession speech \u2014 \"We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead\" \u2014 and he concluded: \"So much time and money will be spent \u2013 same result! Sad.\" \n On NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Conway said Stein, \"the Hillary people\" and others supporting recounts have to decide whether they are going to back a peaceful transition \"or if they're going to be a bunch of crybabies and sore losers about an election that they can't turn around.\" \n Clinton's lawyer said her team has been combing through the results since the election in search of anomalies that would suggest hacking by Russians or others and found \"no actionable evidence.\" But \"we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself,\" he said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Pace reported from Washington.

Joel Coronel, the Manila city police chief, said they were checking security cameras in the area and seeking information from at least two eyewitnesses. \n The trash bin where the device was found was about 20 meters (22 yards) from the embassy compound. \n Philippine troops, backed by bomber aircraft, have recently attacked the Maute militants, including an operation launched last Thursday based on intelligence reports that the group was continuing to make bombs after the Sept. 2 bombing in Davao city, the president's hometown, military spokesman Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla said. \n Military officials say that the militants, a loosely organized group that has more than 200 members, were initially affiliated with an Indonesian terror suspect but have lately used black flags and arm and head bands with Islamic State group symbols in a possible attempt to gain support from the Middle East-based group. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philippine police investigating Islamic State tie to bomb near U.S. embassy"}

Authorities identified Abdul Razak Ali Artan as the Somali-born Ohio State University student who plowed his car into a group of pedestrians on campus and then got out and began stabbing people with a knife Monday, Nov. 28, 2016, before he was shot to death by an officer. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Police respond to reports of an active shooter on campus at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS Police respond to reports of an active shooter on campus at Ohio State University today in Columbus, Ohio. \n COLUMBUS, Ohio >> A Somali-born Ohio State University student plowed his car into a group of pedestrians on campus and then got out and began stabbing people with a butcher knife Monday before he was shot to death by a police officer. Police said they were investigating whether it was a terrorist attack. \n Eleven people were hurt, one critically. \n The attacker was identified as Abdul Razak Ali Artan. He was born in Somalia and was a legal permanent U.S. resident, according to a U.S. official who wasn't authorized to discuss the case and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The FBI joined the investigation. \n The details emerged after a morning of conflicting reports and confusion, created in part by a series of tweets from the university warning there was an \"active shooter\" on campus and students should \"Run Hide Fight.\" The warning was prompted by what turned out to be police gunfire. \n Police vehicles and ambulances converged on the 60,000-student campus, and authorities blocked off roads. Students barricaded themselves inside offices and classrooms, piling chairs and desks in front of doors, before getting the all-clear an hour and a half later. \n Ohio State University police Chief Craig Stone said the assailant deliberately drove his small Honda over a curb outside an engineering classroom building and then began knifing people. A campus officer nearby because of a gas leak arrived on the scene and shot the driver in less than a minute, Stone said. \n Angshuman Kapil, a graduate student, was outside Watts Hall when the car barreled onto the sidewalk. \n \"It just hit everybody who was in front,\" he said. \"After that everybody was shouting, 'Run! Run! Run!'\" \n Student Martin Schneider said he heard the car's engine revving. \n \"I thought it was an accident initially until I saw the guy come out with a knife,\" Schneider said, adding the man didn't say anything when he got out. \n Most of the injured were hurt by the car, and at least two were stabbed. One had a fractured skull. \n Columbus police Chief Kim Jacobs, asked whether authorities were considering the possibility it was a terrorist act, said: \"I think we have to consider that it is.\" \n Republican Vice President-elect Mike Pence called the episode \"a tragic attack\" and said \"our prayers are with them all.\" \n U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the bloodshed \"bears all of the hallmarks of a terror attack carried out by someone who may have been self-radicalized.\" \n \"Here in the United States, our most immediate threat still comes from lone attackers that are not only capable of unleashing great harm but are also extremely difficult, and in some cases, virtually impossible to identify or interdict,\" he said. \n Ohio State's student newspaper, The Lantern, ran an interview in August with a student named Abdul Razak Artan, who identified himself as a Muslim and a third-year logistics management student who'd transferred from Columbus State in the fall. \n He said he was looking for a place to pray openly and worried how he would be received. \n \"I was kind of scared with everything going on in the media. I'm a Muslim, it's not what media portrays me to be,\" he told the newspaper. \"If people look at me, a Muslim praying, I don't know what they're going to think, what's going to happen. But I don't blame them. It's the media that put that picture in their heads.\" \n In recent months, federal law enforcement officials have raised concerns about online extremist propaganda encouraging knife and car attacks, easier to pull off than bombings. \n The Islamic State group has urged sympathizers online to carry out lone-wolf attacks in their home countries with whatever weapons are available to them. \n In September, a 20-year-old Somali-American stabbed 10 people at a St. Cloud, Minnesota, shopping mall before being shot to death by an off-duty officer. Authorities said he asked some of his victims if they were Muslim. In the past few years, London and other cities also have seen knife attacks blamed on extremists. \n Neighbors said Artan was always polite and attended daily prayer services at a mosque. \n Leaders of Muslim organizations and mosques in the Columbus area condemned Monday's attack while cautioning people against jumping to conclusions or blaming a religion or an ethnicity. \n \"It is particularly heartbreaking to see this random act of violence come to this community I hold so dear,\" said Ohio State graduate Nicole Ghazi, who is active in Islamic organizations. \n Surveillance photos showed Artan in the car by himself just before the attack, but investigators are looking into whether anyone else was involved, police said. \n The bloodshed came as students were returning to classes following the Thanksgiving break and Ohio State's football victory over rival Michigan, which brought more than 100,000 fans to campus on Saturday. \n \"There were several moments of chaos,\" said Rachel LeMaster, who works in the engineering college. \"We barricaded ourselves like we're supposed to since it was right outside our door and just hunkered down.\" \n LeMaster said she and others were eventually led outside the building and she saw a body on the ground. \n Classes were canceled for the rest of the day. \n The officer who killed the attacker was Alan Horujko, a member of the force for just under two years. Department of Public Safety Director Monica Moll said Horujko had done a \"fabulous job.\" \n The initial tweet from Ohio State emergency officials went out around 10 a.m. and said: \"Buckeye Alert: Active Shooter on campus. Run Hide Fight. Watts Hall. 19th and College.\" University President Michael Drake said the warning was issued after shots were heard on campus. \n \"Run, hide, fight\" is standard protocol for active-shooter situations. It means: Run away if possible; get out of view; or try to disrupt or incapacitate the shooter if your life is in imminent danger. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Terrorism suspected in car-and-knife attack at Ohio State"}

{"date": "November 28, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People watched a TV screen showing a live broadcast of South Korean President Park Geun-hye addressing to the nation at the Seoul Railway Station on Tuesday. \n SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA >> South Korean President Park Geun-hye said Tuesday that she will resign her office once parliament develops a plan for a safe transfer of power. The surprise announcement, which the opposition called a ploy to delay impeachment, comes amid prosecution claims that she colluded with a friend who wielded government power from the shadows. \n Hundreds of thousands of people have rallied in Seoul each Saturday for the last five weeks to demand that Park step down. \n Park would be the first South Korean leader to resign since the country's first president, Syngman Rhee, quit and then fled to Hawaii amid a popular uprising in 1960. The succeeding government was overthrown by a coup by Park's late father, the military dictator Park Chung-hee, whose rule also abruptly ended after he was assassinated by his spy chief in 1979. \n \"I will leave the matters about my fate, including the shortening of my presidential term, to be decided by the National Assembly,\" Park said Tuesday in a live address to the nation, referring to parliament. \"If the ruling and opposition parties discuss and come up with a plan to reduce the confusion in state affairs and ensure a safe transfer of governments, I will resign from the presidential position under that schedule and by processes stated in law.\" \n Opposition parties had been closing in on an impeachment motion against Park, and even her allies in the conservative ruling party have called for her to \"honorably\" step down rather than face impeachment. \n An impeachment motion vote has been planned for Friday. The country's two largest opposition parties were also planning on Tuesday to nominate a special prosecutor to independently investigate the scandal. \n The country's largest opposition party, the Minjoo Party, called Park's address Tuesday a ploy to avoid an impeachment vote and said the party would continue to push for impeachment as planned. \n At the heart of the scandal is Choi Soon-sil, Park's longtime friend and the daughter of a late cult leader who allegedly meddled in state affairs and pressured companies to donate millions of dollars to foundations controlled by her at the request of Park. \n Prosecutors have so far indicted Choi, two ex-presidential officials and a music video director known as a Choi associate for extortion, leakage of confidential documents and other charges. \n Park, who has immunity from prosecution while in office, has refused to meet with prosecutors. Her lawyer, Yoo Yeong-ha, has described prosecutors' accusations against Park as groundless. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "South Korean leader says she'll resign after lawmakers act"}

{"date": "November 28, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Donald Trump \n Atlanta \u00bb Donald Trump's disavowal this past week of white supremacists who have cheered his election as president hasn't quieted concerns about the movement's impact on his White House or whether more acts of hate will be carried out in his name. \n Members of the self-declared \"alt-right\" have exulted over the Nov. 8 results with public cries of \"Hail Trump!\" and reprises of the Nazi salute. The Ku Klux Klan plans to mark Trump's victory with a parade next month in North Carolina. Civil rights advocates have recoiled, citing an uptick in harassment and incidents of hate crimes affecting blacks, Jews, Muslims, Latinos, gays, lesbians and other minority groups since the vote. \n The president-elect has drawn repeated criticism for being slow to offer his condemnation of white supremacists. His strongest denunciation of the movement has not come voluntarily, only when asked, and he occasionally trafficked in retweets of racist social media posts during his campaign. \n Further, Trump has named Stephen Bannon, the conservative media provocateur who shaped the final months of Trump's campaign, as a White House chief strategist who will work steps from the Oval Office. Bannon's appointment has become as a flashpoint for both sides. \n Trump's detractors and his \"alt-right\" supporters broadly agree on one thing: It may not even matter what Trump himself believes, or how he defines his own ideology, because his campaign rhetoric has emboldened the white identity politics that will help define his administration. \"Alt-right\" is an offshoot of conservatism mixing racism, white nationalism and populism. \n \"Those groups clearly see something and hear something that causes them to believe he is one who sympathizes with their voice and their view. \u2026 Donald Trump has to take responsibility for that,\" said Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, a black Democrat. He was among 169 members of Congress who signed a letter opposing Bannon's White House appointment. \n White nationalist leader Richard Spencer said he believes Trump, Bannon and the \"alt-right\" are \"all riding in the same lane.\" Spencer explained that neither Trump nor Bannon is a movement \"identitarian,\" Spencer's preferred term for his racially driven politics. But Spencer said Trump's election validates Spencer's view that America must reject multiculturalism and \"political correctness\" in favor of its white, Christian European heritage. \n Spencer's group, the National Policy Institute, drew headlines for its recent gathering where some attendees mimicked the Nazi salute as they feted Trump. Spencer told The Associated Press the salutes were \"ironic exuberance\" that \"the mainstream media doesn't get.\" \n But at the Anti-Defamation League, which tracks incidents of anti-Semitism, Oren Segal said it is part of a disturbing postelection atmosphere tied to Trump's 17-month campaign. \n Before, Segal said, it wasn't surprising for the ADL to get calls about a swastika, the Nazi insignia, defacing public or private property. \"What's surprising now,\" he said, \"are the references to the campaign\" in the incidences. \"'Make American White Again' \u2026 'Go Trump' with the swastika,\" he said. \"That is unique.\" \n Trump was asked about the rash of incidents during a postelection interview on CBS' \"60 Minutes.\" Trump said he was \"saddened,\" and he looked into the camera and said, \"Stop it.\" But Trump has steadfastly defended his hiring of Bannon, who previously led Breitbart News and in July described it as a \"platform for the alt-right\" \u2014 just a month before he took the job running the Republican nominee's campaign. \n Jared Taylor, editor of the white supremacist magazine \"American Renaissance,\" said Trump bears some responsibility for his pitched rhetoric, which included describing Mexican immigrants as \"rapists\" at the outset of his campaign and proposing a ban on all Muslim immigrants. But Taylor said Trump is still unfairly maligned as a white supremacist and racist because he \"cares about Americans already here.\" \n But white supremacist imagery was a common sight at Trump rallies. Pepe the frog, a cartoon character appropriated by the white supremacist movement on social media, appeared on dozens of T-shirts and signs. The \"Make America Great Again\" motto was seen by some as a call back to the nation's simpler, whiter, past. While Trump's campaign never actively courted votes from the movement, it did recognize the long-term fears that some whites feel about immigration. \n Taylor insisted, \"There's nothing Ku Klux Klan about any of this.\" \n But, in fact, Trump drew Klan backing. \n As part of his prolific Twitter use, he has retweeted white nationalist accounts and a famous quote of Benito Mussolini, the 20th century fascist leader of Italy, saying \"It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.\" In February, Trump declined to repudiate former Klan leader David Duke during a CNN interview. Afterward, Trump blamed the move on a faulty earpiece, only to come back days later and offer an explicit condemnation. \n He has several times fallen back on the excuse of merely retweeting when asked about his controversial social media behavior. In February, he retweeted a message from the account of a neo-Nazi, which came shortly after he retweeted false crime statistics that dramatically overstated the number of whites killed by blacks. \n \"Bill, am I gonna check every statistic?\" he asked Fox News host Bill O'Reilly at the time. \"All it was is a retweet. It wasn't from me.\" \n While Trump is quick to blast his foes on Twitter \u2014 in recent days that includes The New York Times and the cast of the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" \u2014 he has yet to proactively condemn racist acts his win has inspired. His eldest son, Don Jr., has used Twitter to liken Syrian refugees to a poisoned bowl of Skittles candy, and he has posted images of Pepe. And Trump's rise to political celebrity came as he peddled the falsehood that the nation's first black president, Barack Obama, was born in Africa, not in the United States. \n In an interview last week with The New York Times, Trump did denounce the white supremacist movement when asked, saying \"I condemn them. I disavow, and I condemn.\" But he has yet to convene the traditional news conference held by a president-elect in the days after winning where he could potentially face more pointed questions about it. \n The ADL's Segal called Trump's answers when questioned an important step to \"allay any illusions\" white supremacists have about their place in a Trump administration. \n But Ben Jealous, a former national president of the NAACP, went a step further, saying Trump should \"pull a George Wallace.\" The segregationist Alabama governor ran for president on white identity politics but years later publicly apologized for his views. \n Trump \"shouldn't just disavow the worst behavior of others,\" Jealous said, \"but take accountability for the worst behavior he's engaged in himself.\" \n ___ \n Lemire reported from New York. \n ___ \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump still facing concerns about white supremacists"}
