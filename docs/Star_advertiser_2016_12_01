{"date": "December 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump shakes hands with retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis as he leaves Trump National Golf Club Bedminster clubhouse in Bedminster, N.J. Trump said at a rally on Dec. 1, that he will nominate Mattis as defense secretary. \n WASHINGTON >> Breaking once more from presidential custom, Donald Trump is turning to a military man to steer the U.S. military, choosing retired Gen. James Mattis, who will be the first career officer to lead the Pentagon since just after World War II. \n Mattis, 66, is a Marine Corps general who retired in 2013 after serving as commander of the U.S. Central Command, responsible for directing America's wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan. \n The president-elect, who has referred to Mattis by his nickname \"Mad Dog,\" made the announcement of his choice for defense secretary at a postelection victory rally Thursday night in Cincinnati. \n The selection raises questions about increased military influence in a job designed to ensure civilian control of the armed forces. Those traditional concerns revolve around whether a recently retired service member would rely more on military solutions to international problems rather than take a broader, more diplomatic approach. \n For Mattis to be confirmed, Congress would first have to approve legislation bypassing a law that bars retired military officers from becoming defense secretary within seven years of leaving active duty. \n Mattis has a reputation as a battle-hardened, tough-talking Marine who was entrusted with some of the most challenging commands in the U.S. military. In a tweet last month, Trump described him as \"A true General's General!\" \n Mattis also has talked tough on Middle East policy, and was blunt in his assessment in 2013 that the Obama administration's program of sanctions and diplomatic efforts to stop Iran from gaining nuclear weapons were not working. Tehran, he said, \"has a history of denial and deceit.\" \n He also warned of risks in setting up the no-fly zone over Libya in 2011. And he was vocal in his assessment that the U.S. needed to keep two Navy aircraft carriers in the Middle East to provide additional security and support for American military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan that dragged on in recent years. \n Mattis would be only the second retired general to serve as defense secretary, the first being George C. Marshall in 1950-51 during the Korean War. Marshall was a much different figure, having previously served as U.S. secretary of state and playing a key role in creating closer ties with Western Europe after World War II. \n The only previous exception to the law requiring a gap after military service was for Marshall. \n Although his record in combat and his credentials as a senior commander are widely admired, Mattis has little experience in the diplomatic aspects of the job of secretary of defense. \n Richard Fontaine, president of the Center for a New American Security, described him as a defense intellectual and as a military leader who distinguished himself in combat. \n \"He knows the Middle East, South Asia, NATO and other areas and has evinced both a nuanced approach to the wars we're in and an appreciation for the importance of allies,\" Fontaine said in an email exchange. \"If he were to get the nomination, I suspect that he could attract a number of very talented people to work with him.\" \n But Mattis hasn't been free of controversy. He was criticized for remarking in 2005 that he enjoyed shooting people. He also drew more recent scrutiny for his involvement with the embattled biotech company Theranos, where he serves on the board. \n Born in Pullman, Washington, Mattis enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1969, later earning a history degree from Central Washington University. He was commissioned as an officer in 1972. As a lieutenant colonel, he led an assault battalion into Kuwait during the first U.S. war with Iraq in 1991. \n As head of Central Command from 2010 until his retirement in 2013, he was in charge of both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, Mattis commanded the Marines who launched an early amphibious assault into Afghanistan and established a U.S. foothold in the Taliban heartland. \n As the first wave of Marines moved toward Kandahar, Mattis declared, \"The Marines have landed, and now we own a piece of Afghanistan.\" \n Two years later, he helped lead the invasion into Iraq in 2003 as the two-star commander of the 1st Marine Division. \n In 2005, he raised eyebrows when he told a San Diego forum that it was \"fun to shoot some people.\" \n According to a recording of his remarks, Mattis said, \"Actually, it's a lot of fun to fight. You know, it's a hell of a hoot. \u2026 It's fun to shoot some people. I'll be right up front with you, I like brawling.\" \n He added, \"You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil,\" Mattis continued. \"You know, guys like that ain't got no manhood left anyway. So it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.\" \n Mattis was counseled to choose his words more carefully. \n A year later, Mattis came under scrutiny during one of the more high-profile criminal investigations of the Iraq war, the shooting deaths of 24 Iraqis by Marines. \n The Iraqis, who included unarmed women and children, were killed by Marines in the town of Haditha after one of their comrades was killed by a roadside bomb. Eight Marines were charged in connection with the killings \u2014 four enlisted men were charged with unpremeditated murder, and four officers who weren't there at the time were accused of failures in investigating and reporting the deaths. \n As commander of the accused Marines' parent unit, the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, Mattis ultimately dismissed charges against most of the Marines. \n Separately, as a top Marine general, Mattis pushed for the military to adopt blood-testing technology developed by Theranos. \n As reported by The Washington Post , Mattis first met Theranos founder Elizabeth A. Holmes in 2011. A year later, according to emails obtained by the Post, Holmes used her connection to Mattis to pressure him to intervene after a Pentagon official raised concerns that the company was distributing its technology without approval by the Food and Drug Administration. \n The emails show within hours after Holmes asked Mattis for help, he forwarded her email to other military officials asking them, \"How do we overcome this new obstacle.\" \n Mattis joined the Theranos board the same year he retired. The company, which raised hundreds of millions of dollars on the promise of breakthrough blood-testing technology, was forced to invalidate two years of patients' test results after the reliability of its proprietary blood-testing machinery was questioned by internal and government whistleblowers and investigative reporting by The Wall Street Journal. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump to nominate retired Gen.

Investigators say the attackers were inspired by the Islamic State group. \n Police will hold a 14-mile memorial bicycle ride that will end near the site of the shooting. A brief memorial service also will be held there. \n San Bernardino County employees will hold a moment of silence at 10:58 a.m. to remember when the first 911 call was placed, said Felisa Cardona, a county spokeswoman. \n Most of those killed in the attack by county health inspector Syed Rizwan Farook, and Farook's Pakistani wife Tashfeen Malik, were Farook's colleagues. \n \"We just want to remember, honor and support each other,\" she said. \"It's going to be a difficult day for all of us.\" \n The city of San Bernardino will hold a public ceremony Friday evening. The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians will light up an iconic arrowhead landmark in the nearby foothills. \n While the city of San Bernardino has been grappling with a spike in homicides this year, community residents have worked hard to prevent a hate-filled backlash to the terror attack. Clergy have formed an interfaith alliance, victims' families have encouraged tolerance and Muslims residents undertook a campaign to educate neighbors about Islam. \n Since the attack, San Bernardino police Sgt. Emil Kokesh said he has also been reminded of the need to stay fit. Kokesh arrived at the scene of the onslaught minutes after the shooting and was there for more than a day, carrying out the victims. He said he was sore for two weeks, which prompted him to take up cycling to get in shape with some fellow officers. \n On Friday, they will ride to remember the victims. \n \"On that day, it pushed a lot of us to our limits \u2014 physically, mentally, and emotionally,\" he said. Now, Kokesh said he often reminds his fellow officers: \"you may work in an office, you may do investigations, and not do much field work anymore, but you are going to be the ones who respond to something like this, so stay fit, stay prepared.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "San Bernardino recalls terror attack with silence, speakers"}

{"date": "December 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Grandma Redfeather of the Sioux Native American tribe walks in the snow to get water at the Oceti Sakowin camp where people have gathered to protest the Dakota Access oil pipeline in Cannon Ball, N.D. \"It's for my people to live and so that the next seven generations can live also,\" said Redfeather of why she came to the camp. \"I think about my grandchildren and what it will be like for them.\" \n CANNON BALL, N.D. >> So far, the hundreds of protesters fighting the Dakota Access pipeline have shrugged off the heavy snow, icy winds and frigid temperatures that have swirled around their large encampment on the North Dakota grasslands. \n But if they defy next week's government deadline to abandon the camp, demonstrators know the real deep freeze lies ahead, when the full weight of the Great Plains winter descends on their community of nylon tents and teepees. Life-threatening wind chills and towering snow drifts could mean the greatest challenge is simple survival. \n \"I'm scared. I'm a California girl, you know?\" said Loretta Reddog of Placerville, California, a protester who said she arrived several months ago with her two dogs and has yet to adjust to the harsher climate. \n The government has ordered protesters to leave federal land by Monday, although it's not clear what, if anything, authorities will do to enforce that mandate. Demonstrators insist they will stay for as long as it takes to divert the $3.8 billion pipeline, which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe believes threatens sacred sites and a river that provides drinking water for millions of people. \n The pipeline is largely complete except for a short segment that is planned to pass beneath a Missouri River reservoir. The company doing the building says it is unwilling to reroute the project. \n For several months, the government permitted the gathering, allowing its population to swell. The Seven Council Fires camp began growing in August as it took in the overflow crowd from smaller protest sites nearby. It now covers a half square mile, with living quarters that include old school buses, fancy motorhomes and domelike yurts. Hale bales are piled around some teepees to keep out the wind. There's even a crude corral for horses. \n The number of inhabitants has ranged from several hundred to several thousand. It has been called the largest gathering of Native American tribes in a century. \n Increasingly, more permanent wooden structures are being erected, even though the Army Corps of Engineers considers them illegal on government property. The Standing Rock Sioux insist the land still belongs to their tribe under a nearly 150-year-old treaty. \n Nate Bison, a member of South Dakota's Cheyenne River Sioux, came to the camp after quitting his job in Las Vegas a week ago. He said he intends to stay indefinitely, a prospect that may cause him to lose his house in Nevada. \n \"But since I've lived in these conditions before, to me it's not all that bad,\" he said. \n Camp morale is high, he added, despite the onset of winter. \n \"Everybody I've talked to, you hear laughter and people just having a good time, enjoying the camaraderie and the support from each other,\" Bison said. \"And the love. People are taking the shirts off their own backs for other people. No one is left out that I've seen.\" \n On Thursday, the camp near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers was shrouded in snow, much of it compacted by foot and vehicle traffic. Temperatures hovered in the 20s. Next week's forecast calls for single digits and subzero wind chills. \n Camp dwellers are getting ready for the hardships of a long stay. Mountains of donated food and water are being stockpiled, as is firewood, much of which has come from outside of North Dakota, the least-forested state in the nation. A collection of Army surplus tents with heating stoves serve as kitchen, dining hall, medical clinic and a camp-run school. Many of the smaller tents have become tattered by the wind. \n Thane Maxwell, a 32-year-old Minneapolis native who has been living at the camp since July, said North Dakota's bitter cold will not deter protesters committed to fighting the pipeline, or \"black snake\" as they call it. \n Tribes from the Great Plains states are adept at surviving brutal winters, he said. Others from warmer climes are being taught how to endure the frostbite-inducing temperatures that are sure to come. \n \"A lot of these people have been living in this climate for hundreds of years,\" said Maxwell a member of Minnesota-based Honor the Earth Foundation. \"It's a skill set that can be learned. The danger is escalating from law enforcement, not the weather.\" \n Reddog said she has confidence in the camp community. \"Everybody's really stepping up and taking care of each other,\" she said. \n Maxwell put out a call on social media for more donations, seeking four-wheel drive trucks and foul-weather clothing. He also asked for gas masks and protective baseball and hockey gear to shield protesters from any future skirmishes with police. \n More than 525 people from across the country have been arrested since August. In a recent clash between police and protesters near the path of the pipeline, officers used tear gas, rubber bullets and large water hoses in sub-freezing temperatures. Organizers said at least 17 protesters were taken to the hospital, some for hypothermia and one for an arm injury. One officer was hurt. \n North Dakota has often conjured images of a wind-swept, treeless wasteland. The perception was so great that it led to a short-lived proposal to change the state's name by dropping \"North\" and leaving just \"Dakota,\" to dispel the image of inhospitable winter weather. \n Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier, who is heading the law enforcement effort around the pipeline, said he hopes the harsh conditions force people to leave the encampment, something the state and federal governments have so far been unable to do. \n In addition to the federal order, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple issued a \"mandatory evacuation\" for the camp \"to safeguard against harsh winter conditions.\" But he said Wednesday that the state has no intention of blocking food and supplies from coming into the camp. \n Doing so would be a \"huge mistake from a humanitarian viewpoint,\" the Republican said. \n The federal deadline probably will not have any immediate effect on the camp either. Soon after it was set, the Army Corps of Engineers explained that the agency had no plans to forcibly remove anyone, although violators could be charged with trespassing. \n Back at the camp, about 75 people lined up Thursday to draw propane for heating and cooking from a fuel truck. The driver, Rodney Grant, said it was his seventh trip in a week. The propane was free to campers. Grant said he did not know who was paying for it. \n Dani Jo McKing, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux, was among those in line. She and her husband have been sharing cold-weather tips with people who are not from North Dakota. She said people with out-of-state license plates, including California and Nevada, have been seen driving away from the camp. The cruel winter is bound to induce others to head home, she said. \n The cold weather has never bothered her. \n \"This is where I live. I'll stay until the end. This is God's country,\" she said. \n Summer Moore arrived last week from Paintsville, Kentucky, and quickly learned the power of the whipping North Dakota wind. When a snowstorm rolled in Monday, it ripped her tent to shreds. \n \"It wasn't that cold, but the wind was so bad it knocked me down three times,\" Moore said. \n She hitched a ride to the casino on the Standing Rock reservation and rode out the storm in a hotel room. \n A carpenter named Joel Maurer came from California last month. He's been building small shed-like bunkhouses that will sleep seven people each with room for a stove. \n \"I know things are going to get real here real quick,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Next test for pipeline protesters: the North Dakota winter"}

{"date": "December 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Tabulator Claudette Moll, right, from Farmington, looks over a ballot during a statewide presidential election recount Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, West Bend, Wis. \n LANSING, Mich. >> Michigan's elections board on Friday will consider President-elect Donald Trump's request to block a hand recount of all 4.8 million ballots cast in the state he won by about 10,700 votes over Hillary Clinton. \n Lawyers for the Trump campaign argued Thursday that Green Party nominee Jill Stein, a \"bottom-dwelling candidate,\" cannot seek the expensive, time-consuming recount because she was not \"aggrieved\" to the point where potential miscounting of votes could have cost her the election. She garnered just 1 percent in Michigan. \n They also said in their objection that Stein waited until the last minute to file her recount petition Wednesday, making it impossible to finish by a Dec. 13 deadline. \n Stein countered that Trump's \"cynical efforts to delay the recount and create unnecessary costs for taxpayers are shameful and outrageous.\" His objections suspended the planned Friday start of the recount until next week. \n A recount is already underway in Wisconsin, which Trump won by roughly 22,000 votes and where the first reporting of numbers was expected Friday. In Pennsylvania, a hearing was scheduled for Monday on Stein's push to secure a court-ordered statewide recount, a legal maneuver that has never been tried, according to one of the attorneys who filed it. \n Recounts were not expected to flip nearly enough votes to change the outcome in any of the states. \n The Wisconsin recount doesn't carry nearly the same drama as the Florida recount in 2000, when the outcome of the presidential race between Al Gore and George W. Bush hung in the balance. \n \"This is certainly not Bush v. Gore,\" said Mike Haas, Wisconsin's chief elections administrator. \n Even so, the campaigns for Trump, Clinton and Stein all had observers spread throughout the state to watch the process. \n The recount will have to move quickly. The federal deadline to certify the vote to avoid having the fate of Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes decided by Congress is Dec. 13. Even if that were to happen, the votes would almost certainly go to Trump, since Republicans control both chambers of Congress. \n Stein has argued, without evidence, that irregularities in the votes in all three states suggest that there could have been tampering with the vote, perhaps through a well-coordinated, highly complex cyberattack. \n \"Verifying the vote through this recount is the only way to confirm that every vote has been counted securely and accurately and is not compromised by machine or human error, or by tampering or hacking,\" Stein said. \n Stein's critics, including the Wisconsin Republican Party, contend that she is a little-known candidate who is merely trying to raise her profile while raising millions of dollars. \n The Wisconsin recount was estimated to cost about $3.9 million. Stein paid $973,250 for the requested recount in Michigan. Michigan's Republican secretary of state, Ruth Johnson, has said a recount could cost $5 million total. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Michigan board to hear Trump's challenge to recount effort"}

{"date": "December 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Funeral employees place white sheets with a Chapecoense soccer team logo on caskets containing the remains of team members, in Medellin, Colombia. \n MEDELLIN, Colombia >> Families are preparing to receive the bodies of the victims of this week's air tragedy in Colombia as experts develop a clearer picture of how things went so terribly wrong with a charter flight that slammed into a mountainside. \n Many of the 71 killed were players and coaches from a small-town Brazilian soccer team that was headed to the finals of one of South America's most prestigious tournaments after a fairy-tale season that had captivated their soccer-crazed nation. \n On Thursday, white sheets printed with the logo of the Chapocoense soccer club lay over row upon row of caskets at a Medellin funeral home. Most of the remains had been identified and were expected to be flown home Friday. \n Bolivian aviation officials announced they were indefinitely suspending the charter company that operated the flight after a recording of conversations between a pilot of the doomed flight and air traffic controllers, as well as the account of a surviving flight attendant, indicated the plane ran out of fuel. The jet, which took off from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, was flying at its maximum range when it crashed late Monday, killing all but six of the 77 people on board. \n In Brazil, grieving relatives of the dead spoke out in disbelief. \n Osmar Machado, whose son, Filipe, a defender on the Chapecoense team, died on his father's 66th birthday, questioned why the plane was transporting the team. \n \"Profit brings greed,\" Machado said, speaking in the team's hometown of Chapeco. \"This plane ended (the lives of) 71 people.\" \n Williams Brasiliano, uncle of midfielder Arthur Maia, said the crash could have been avoided if the team had chosen a commercial flight and not a charter. \n \"Look how complicated that flight was going to be even if it had arrived,\" Brasiliano said tearfully of the team's itinerary, which included a flight from Sao Paulo to Bolivia on a commercial airliner before the ill-fated flight to Medellin. \n \"I doubt that a bigger club would have done the same,\" he added. \n Chapecoense spokesman Andrei Copetti defended the decision, saying more than 30 teams had used the Bolivia-based company, LaMia airlines, including the national teams of Argentina and Bolivia. He added that the team itself had flown on its flights before. \n \"They had a good service then. It was the airline that got in touch with us because they have experience in doing these long flights in South America,\" he said. \n A recording of the flight's final minutes showed the pilot repeatedly requested permission to land because of \"fuel problems,\" although he never made a formal distress call. He was told another plane with mechanical problems had priority for the airport's single runway and was instructed to wait seven minutes. \n As the jetliner circled, the pilot grew more desperate. \"Complete electrical failure, without fuel,\" he said. By then the controller had gauged the seriousness of the situation and told the other plane to abandon its approach to make way for the charter jet. It was too late. \n The lack of an explosion upon impact also pointed to a rare case of fuel burnout as a cause of the crash of the British Aerospace 146 Avro RJ85. \n The air traffic controller said in an email sent to her colleagues and released to local media Thursday that she had done everything humanly and technically possible to save the plane. \n The Bolivian Civil Aviation Authority announced it had indefinitely halted all flights operated by LaMia and also was suspending some aviation officials during the investigation. \n British aviation authorities said the flight data and cockpit voice recorders recovered from the accident site were being taken to Britain for study. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press photographer Fernando Vergara reported this story in Medellin and AP writer Hannah Dreier reported from Caracas, Venezuela.

{"date": "December 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump smiles as he speaks during the first stop of his post-election tour. \n CINCINNATI >> Donald Trump returned to his campaign roots Thursday in his first major public appearance since Election Day, resembling the pugnacious, brawling campaigner more than the traditional president-to-be as he held court in front of thousands of adoring fans \u2014 and even announced a Cabinet pick from the stage. \n Trump's first stop on this \"Thank you\" tour to salute his supporters was in Ohio and, ever the showman, he made the surprise announcement that he will be offering the post of Defense Secretary to retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis. Trump said he was supposed to unveil that Monday, so he jokingly warned the Cincinnati crowd to \"not tell anyone.\" \n The raucous rallies during the Trump campaign road show often had the feel of a rock concert, and Thursday night in Cincinnati had all the hallmarks of a reunion tour: Trump took a veiled swipe at fellow Republicans. He remembered his general election foe by joking, \"We had fun fighting Hillary, didn't we?\" He boasted about size of his victory and repeatedly bashed the media. Protesters briefly interrupted the proceedings. And the crowd chanted \"Build the Wall\" and \"Lock Her Up.\" \n The president-elect had eased up on those campaign promises recently, suggesting the U.S.-Mexico border wall could be part-fence and indicating no willingness to pursue criminal charges against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. \n Perhaps befitting an encore presentation, the downtown arena that Trump packed in October \u2014 drawing a crowd that was one of the loudest of the campaign \u2014 was only about half-full Thursday night. But the thousands who were there cheered Trump as he declared to restore American to greatness, saying, \"Now is not the time to downsize our dreams.\" \n \"Never again will anyone's interests come before the interests of the American people. It's not going to happen,\" Trump thundered. \"The old rules no longer apply. Anything we want for our country is now possible.\" \n Trump did nothing to downplay expectations before he takes office, declaring that \"America will start winning again, big league.\" Much like he did during the stretch run of the campaign, he read from teleprompters, but he was bombastic as ever, spending more than a dozen minutes bragging about his victory before outlining his economic plan. \n He boasted about his wins in Midwest states that normally vote Democratic, declaring he didn't just \"break the blue wall, we shattered it.\" He veered off-script to make fun of a protester, saying she was being ejected from the arena so \"she could go back to Mommy.\" He repeated his recent threat that, despite Constitutional protections, \"if people burn the American flag, there should be consequences.\" And he repeated many of his signature campaign promises, including a pledge to \"construct a great wall at the border.\" \n And he stunned his own aides when he announced the Mattis pick from the stage. Mattis, nicknamed \"Mad Dog,\" is considered one of the foremost strategic thinkers of his generation but to gain confirmation as Pentagon chief, he would need Congress to waive a requirement that a defense secretary be a civilian for at least seven years before taking up the post. \n Mattis retired as chief of U.S. Central Command in 2013 after serving more than four decades in the Marine Corps. There is no sense of strong opposition to his nomination in Congress. \n Trump, who has long spoken of feeding off the energy of his raucous crowds, first floated the idea of a victory tour just days after winning the election but has instead prioritized filling Cabinet positions. He is also expected to hold rallies in Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina and Michigan in the coming weeks, though details have yet to be announced. His supporters were thrilled that he had hit the road again. \n \"That he wants to do this, to take time out of his schedule to fly out here and personally thank the people \u2026 shows what kind of man he is,\" said Josh Kanowitz, 43. \"He's one of us.\" \n But while Kanowitz largely praised Trump's initial moves as president-elect, he visibly recoiled at the suggestion that he might pick Mitt Romney as secretary of tate, saying the 2012 Republican presidential nominee was \"someone we should leave behind as we move forward.\" \n Others at the rally also expressed some hesitancy at Trump's picks, with a few suggesting that choosing former Goldman Sachs partner Steven Mnuchin as Treasury Secretary was not exactly fulfilling Trump's campaign promise to \"Drain the Swamp\" and eliminate corruption and elitism from Washington. \n But most were inclined to give the president-elect the benefit of the doubt. \n \"He's a businessman. He'll pick talented people to work for him and then keep them in line,\" said Jaime Bollmer, a 28-year-old teacher from Lockland, Ohio. \"He's a leader. That's what leaders do.\" \n The rally in Cincinnati was the second stop on a victory lap through the Midwest on Thursday, coming hours after Trump saluted workers, owners and himself at a Carrier plant in Indiana. There he declared that a deal to keep a local plant open instead of moving operations to Mexico was only the first of many business victories to come. \n Some questions remain about the extent of the victory at Carrier, which announced this week that it will keep an Indianapolis plant open. In February, the heating and air conditioning company said it would shut the plant and send jobs to Mexico, and video of angry workers being informed about the decision soon went viral. \n \"Companies are not going to leave the United States anymore without consequences. It's not going to happen. It's simply not going to happen,\" Trump said to workers at the Indianapolis plant. \n During the campaign, Trump had often pointed to the Indiana plant's moving plans as a result of poor Obama administration policies, and he pledged to revive U.S. manufacturing. Officials said this week that Carrier had agreed to keep some 800 union jobs at the plant. \n Seth Martin, a spokesman for Carrier, said Indiana offered the air conditioning and furnace manufacturer $7 million in tax incentives after negotiations with Trump's team to keep some jobs in the state. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's 'Thank you' tour gets off to raucous start"}

{"date": "December 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Defense Secretary Ash Carter testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington. The Obama administration is announcing its support for requiring women to register for the military draft. The administration has been deliberating for roughly a year about whether to back such a change to the Selective Service. \n WASHINGTON >> The Obama administration declared its support Thursday for requiring women to register for the military draft, a symbolic but significant shift that reflects the U.S. military's evolution from a male-dominated force to one seeking to incorporate women at all levels. \n President Barack Obama has been considering whether to adopt the position since last December, when Defense Secretary Ash Carter ordered the military to open all jobs to women, including the most arduous combat posts. Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House's National Security Council, said Obama believes women have \"proven their mettle,\" including in Afghanistan and Iraq. \n \"As old barriers for military service are being removed, the administration supports \u2014 as a logical next step \u2014 women registering for the Selective Service,\" Price said, using the formal name for the military draft. \n The White House emphasized that the administration remains committed to an all-volunteer military \u2014 meaning women, like men, wouldn't be forced to serve unless there were a national emergency like a major world war. Changing the policy would require an act of Congress, and there are no signs that lawmakers plan to move swiftly to alter the law. \n Obama, who will leave office in less than two months, has less leverage over Congress and the broader Washington agenda than he did earlier in his presidency. Like his embrace of gay marriage in 2012, Obama's announcement appeared aimed more at influencing the public debate about women in the military in the coming years than at forcing an immediate policy change. \n The Defense Department echoed Obama's position, first reported by USA Today. Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said that Carter believes the inclusion of women throughout the military's echelons has strengthened the military's might. \n \"He thinks it makes sense for women to register for Selective Service, just as men must,\" Cook said. \n Late last year, the Pentagon ordered all military jobs opened to women, including about 220,000 jobs previously restricted to men, including in special operations forces. Carter and other military leaders insisted that the military wouldn't lower the physical standards for those jobs to enable more women to qualify. \n Integrating women has not been fast or easy. Earlier this year the top Army and Marine Corps generals told senators it would take up to three years to fully integrate women into all combat jobs. The military services have started recruiting women for those jobs and making necessary changes to bathrooms and other facilities. But some of the services, such as the Marine Corps, have predicted or experienced challenges identifying large numbers of candidates who want to serve in combat and meet the physical requirements. \n Under current law, women can volunteer to serve in the military, but aren't required to register for the draft. All adult men must register within 30 days of their 18th birthday, and risk losing eligibility for student aid, job training and government jobs if they fail to comply. \n Signing up for the draft entails registering with the U.S. Selective Service, an independent agency aimed at ensuring a fair distribution of military duties if the president and Congress had to enact a draft. The U.S. hasn't had a military draft since 1973, during the Vietnam War era. \n The new posture from the Obama administration came at an unusual time, just two days after House and Senate negotiators agreed to strip a provision from the annual defense policy bill that would have required young women to register. \n The measure had roiled social conservatives, who decried it as another step toward the blurring of gender lines akin to allowing transgender people to use public lavatories and locker rooms. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, spoke for a number of Republicans when he described the provision as \"coercing America's daughters\" into draft registration. \n But proponents of including women in the draft pool viewed the requirement as a sensible step toward gender equality. They pointed to the Pentagon's decision last year to open all front-line combat jobs to women as removing any justification for gender restrictions on registration. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "White House announces support for women in military draft"}

Tulsi Gabard, planning to join a protest opposing the four-state, $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline. \n The North Dakota Veterans Coordinating Council has sent a letter to the \"Veterans Stand for Standing Rock\" group asking them not go to the southern part of the state where hundreds are camped out because it'll create more tension and increase the burden on law enforcement, council president Russ Stabler said today. \n The council doesn't an opinion about the pipeline, which is mostly complete aside from a portion on federal land under a Missouri River reservoir that's been held up, and supports anyone who wants to protest peacefully. But, he said, the demonstrations have not been conducted in \"the military manner in which our veterans behave.\" \n He believes the veterans coming to Standing Rock have been misinformed and should not be supporting a movement that has \"broken laws, destroyed property and attacked law enforcement.\" \n But, he said, \"They intend on coming anyhow.\" \n (The veterans opposed to the pipeline include Gabbard, a Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, who spoke on the House floor today to urge President Obama to block the pipeline. \n \"This weekend I'm joining thousands of veterans from across the country at Standing Rock to stand in solidarity with our Native American brothers and sisters. Together we call on President Obama to immediately halt the construction of this pipeline, respect the sacred lands of the Standing Rock Sioux, and respect their right to clean water.

Jack Dalrymple issued a mandatory evacuation of the camp, though both have said that protesters will not be forcibly removed. \n Police have made about 575 arrests since August during clashes along the pipeline route and in a couple North Dakota cities. Protesters have complained about excessive force by law enforcement, including the use of water hoses during last month's confrontation in 30-degree weather. Another protester suffered a serious arm injury during that altercation, although it's not clear what caused the blast. \n Stabler is especially upset that the vets' protest is slated to culminate on the anniversary of the attacks on Pearl Harbor. \n \"It is an insult to the remaining World War II veterans from North Dakota,\" said Stabler, whose group represents more than 55,000 North Dakota veterans who are members of the American Legion, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Veteran of Foreign Wars, and Vietnam Veterans of America. \n Also Thursday, the Morton County Sheriff's Department, which has been in charge of much of the law enforcement's response to protesters, released a video of a veteran who is critical of the Veterans Stand for Standing Rock. \n Raymond Morrell, a U.S. Marine veteran, wants to know why veterans who have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution would participate in what he considers an unlawful protest. \n \"Veterans within the state North Dakota, we really question that as to where their cause truly is,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press and Star-Advertiser staff", "title": "Veterans' group criticizes vets, including U.S. Rep.

{"date": "December 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this image made from video, Thailand's Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, listens to the invitation to ascend to the throne from National Legislative Assembly President Pornpetch Wichitcholchai, at the Grand Palace in Bangkok today. \n BANGKOK >> Thailand has a new king, with the country's crown prince formally taking the throne to succeed his much-revered late father, who reigned for 70 years. \n The new monarch, who received the title \"His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun,\" assumed his new position Thursday, according to an announcement broadcast on all TV channels. He will also be known as Rama X, the tenth king in the Chakri dynasty that was founded in 1782. \n A videotaped broadcast showed senior officials presenting the formal invitation to the prince to become king, and then his acceptance. It then showed the officials prostrate themselves at the feet of the new king, who was wearing a formal white uniform with decorations. \n Vajiralongkorn's father, Bhumibol Adulyadej, died on Oct. 13 at age 88 after many years of ill health. In 1972, Bhumibol designated Vajiralongkorn \u2014 his second child and only son \u2014 as his successor. \n \"I would like to accept in order to fulfill his majesty's wishes and for the benefit of all Thais,\" Vajiralongkorn said in the videotape. \n Vajiralongkorn, 64, was originally expected to assume the throne the day his father died, but in a surprise announcement, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said the prince asked for the succession to be put off so he would have time to mourn. \n Prayuth said Thursday night that because of tradition that the throne should not remain vacant, the new king's reign will be considered as beginning on the day Bhumibol died. \n \"His majesty the new king, the beloved son of the late king, will carry forward his leadership and legacy,\" he said. \n Thailand is a constitutional monarchy \u2014 although currently under military rule \u2014 but Bhumibol played an important role in stabilizing his country through a time of enormous change which saw neighboring monarchies collapse under the pressures of the Vietnam War. He was especially known for his energy in development activities, doing hands-on inspections in remote rural areas. He calmed the country through several political crises. \n Vajiralongkorn faces the challenges of a country that has become fractured over the past decade, as contending political forces engaged in bitter battles that sometimes turned violent, leaving a residue of bad feeling and shaking faith in the democratic system. \n The new king, with a less intense interest in state affairs and a reputation as a playboy, does not command the same level of respect as Bhumibol. He has gone through divorces with three women who have borne him seven children, and in recent years has spent much of his time residing in Germany. Although most Thais are devoted to the royal institution, it is hard to gauge how they feel privately about Vajiralongkorn because of harsh laws that mandate a prison term of three to 15 years for anyone found guilty of insulting the monarchy. \n Information about the succession has been tightly controlled, and international news broadcasts about Thailand have been blocked in recent days. \n The United States, whose diplomatic relations with Thailand date back more than 180 years, congratulated Vajiralongkorn on his ascension to the throne. State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters in Washington that Bhumibol had been a great friend of U.S. and it looked forward to deepening the relationship between the two countries going forward. \n The prince made his first public appearance in more than a week earlier Thursday, attending a religious ceremony honoring his late father. He was accompanied by his three sisters, two adult daughters and 11-year-old son. \n Shortly afterward, he granted an audience to National Legislative Assembly President Pornpetch Wichitcholchai, Prime Minister Prayuth, Supreme Court Chief Justice Veerapol Tungsuwan and former Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, who had been one of his father's closest advisers and served as regent in the period since Bhumibol's death. \n The Cabinet, proceeding according to a 1924 law on succession and the constitution, on Tuesday had forwarded to the National Legislative Assembly the late king's appointment of his son to succeed him. The assembly in turn acknowledged the appointment, and its president then issued an invitation to Vajiralongkorn to become king. \n Huge crowds have been paying respects to the late king's remains at the ceremonial Grand Palace. His remains will be cremated in an elaborate ceremony that may take place a year or more after his death. The official coronation of Vajiralongkorn will occur only after the cremation. Bhumibol's coronation was in 1950, four years after succeeding his brother King Ananda Mahidol, who died of gunshot wounds in unclear circumstances. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Crown prince formally becomes Thailand's new king"}

It was listed as part of Ige's original proclamation declaring homelessness an emergency in October 2015. \n Hawaii County Mayor Billy Kenoi has made reducing homelessness a priority and created a task force four years ago to get people off the streets. \n \"When you're down on your luck, it is comforting to know that there are people that care, and it is such a good feeling to know that we have this facility that will provide a clean and safe environment for some of our most vulnerable brothers and sisters,\" said Kona Councilman Dru Kanuha. \n The 23 units are re-purposed shipping containers and feature a kitchenette with a sink, microwave and refrigerator as well as a bathroom and space for a bed. Residents of Hale Kikaha will also have access to a laundry facility, storage area and medical services. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hawaii County opens new housing units to help homeless"}

{"date": "December 1, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures as he gives his annual state of the nation address in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia. \n MOSCOW >> President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that Russia hopes to normalize ties with the U.S. and join efforts in the fight against international terrorism. \n Speaking in a live state-of-the-nation address, Putin said that Russia is ready to take part in tackling global challenges if its interests are respected. \n \"We don't want confrontation with anyone,\" he said in a speech before officials and lawmakers in an ornate, white-marble Kremlin hall. \n \"Unlike our foreign colleagues who are seeing Russia as an enemy, we have never been looking for enemies, we need friends,\" Putin said. \"But we won't allow any infringement on our interests and neglect of them.\" \n Russia's relations with the West have plummeted to a post-Cold War low over the Ukrainian crisis and the war in Syria. During the U.S. election campaign, President Barack Obama's administration accused Russia of hacking American political sites and email accounts in an effort to interfere with the vote. The Kremlin has rejected the accusations. \n \"In the last few years. we have faced attempts of foreign pressure with all tools involved \u2014 from the myths about Russian aggression, (allegations) of meddling in elections to the hounding of our athletes,\" Putin said, referring to doping scandals. \n Putin said that Russia is looking forward to mending ties with the U.S. after President-elect Donald Trump takes office. \n \"We are ready for cooperation with the new American administration,\" he said. \"It's important to normalize and develop our bilateral ties on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. We share responsibility for ensuring global security and stability and strengthening the non-proliferation regime.\" \n Putin added that Moscow hopes to pool efforts with Washington in confronting international terrorism. \n \"Our servicemen in Syria are fulfilling that task,\" he said. \n Russia has conducted an air campaign in support of Syrian President Bashar Assad, helping his forces make significant gains, most recently in Aleppo, Syria's largest city before the war. \n In the speech that was mostly focused on economic and social issues, Putin said that the Russian economy is on the way to recovery, pointing at a growth in some sectors of industry and agriculture. He said agricultural exports this year will top $16 billion, exceeding weapons exports. \n The Russian economy contracted 3.7 percent in 2015 and the recession has continued this year under the combined blow of low oil prices and Western sanctions. \n Putin said the government should encourage growth by offering support to farmers and create incentives for small businesses. \n He noted that inflation, which stood at nearly 13 percent last year, is expected to slow down to 6 percent this year. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Putin hopes for better Russia-U.S. ties, anti-terror action"}

After failing to set off the bomb, which was made from an 81mm mortar round, the two decided to leave the explosive in a trash bin near the U.S. Embassy but again failed to set it off. \n They wanted to impress the Islamic State group and secure possible funding from the Middle East-based terrorist group, dela Rosa said. They also wanted to divert the military's focus from an offensive against fellow Muslim militants in the south, he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Suspects in bomb found near U.S. embassy wanted to impress Islamic State"}
