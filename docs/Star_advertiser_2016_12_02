Mauna Kea is nearly 14,000 feet above sea level. \n The weather service forecasts new accumulations of about a foot of snow Friday night through Saturday. An additional foot is possible Sunday. Temperatures are in the mid-20s to lower-30s. \n That's a significant amount of snowfall, but not uncommon for the summits, meteorologists say. \n Lyman said there has been 30 to 36 inches in recent winters. \n It's enough snow to shut down operations on Mauna Kea, Lyman said. The mountain's access road is expected to remain closed until next week, he said. \n The weather service doesn't keep track of what the record amounts of snowfall are on the summits. Heavy snow is often accompanied by wind, which create drifts that make it difficult to accurately measure snowfall, Lyman said. \n Abundant snow on Mauna Loa's 13,677-foot summit could be seen at sunset Thursday from parts of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, said park spokeswoman Jessica Ferracane. \n There was heavy rain in other parts of the state Friday, with a flash flood warning in effect for Oahu, Kauai and the Big Island. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hawaii summits could get more than 2 feet of snow"}

{"date": "December 2, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Loretta and Jim Dimond hold metal urns containing the ashes of Civil War veteran James Powers and his wife Irena Powers in Lake View Cemetery in Seattle, Wash. \n TACOMA, Wash. >> It's the kind of oversight that's hard to imagine.  \n Maybe the relatives of James and Irene Powers were just too busy to take care of the final arrangements for their loved ones, who died in 1921 and 1928, respectively. \n After all, the couple's son, the Rev. Jesse D.O. Powers, was a leading progressive clergyman in bustling Seattle back in the day, supporting the women's suffrage movement, among other causes, with prayer and speeches. \n \"In Seattle, no one spoke more frequently or convincingly than the Rev. J.D.O. Powers of the First Unitarian Church and Rev. Sidney Strong of Queen Anne Congregational Church,\" according the book, \"The Concise History of Women's Suffrage,\" which was published in 1978. \n Whatever the reason, urns containing the cremated remains of James and Irene Powers sat in \"community storage\" at a Seattle cemetery for decades until a Kent couple with a passion for the Civil War came across them this year. \n Seeing what they considered a wrong, Loretta and James Dimond decided to try to make it right. \n Now, James Powers, who served in the Union Army during that long-ago conflict, will get the military burial he rightfully deserves. His wife will be buried with him during a Dec. 10 memorial service at Tahoma National Cemetery near Kent. \n \"It is a significant event,\" James Dimond told The News Tribune (http://bit.ly/2gGngBi ) recently. \n The Dimonds are teaming with Robert Patrick of the Washington chapter of the Missing in America Project, which works to find, identify and inter the unburied remains of veterans. \n The three are planning a service with full military honors for James Powers, replete with gun salute, the playing of taps and other accoutrements. Members of local Civil War re-enactment groups plan to be on hand. \n \"We're going to support this the best we can,\" said Tom Yokes, director of Tahoma National Cemetery. \"It's important.\" \n Powers will become the second Civil War veteran buried at the cemetery, joining Medal of Honor winner 2nd Lt. Jesse T. Barrick, who lies at rest in Section 8 of the picturesque graveyard. Barrick also served in the Union Army. \n Originally buried in Pasco Cemetery, Barrick's remains were exhumed and then reburied with full military honors at Tahoma in 2000. \n That Powers will join him is due in large part to the curiosity of the Dimonds, who both have master's degrees in history and come from families with military backgrounds. \n For the past 22 years or so, they've dabbled in American history for fun, James Dimond said. The Civil War has been of special interest, he said. Their hobby has included searching for the remains of veterans lying in unmarked graves and obtaining proper headstones for them. \n \"We've worked from one end of the state to the other,\" James Dimond said. \"If we find veterans, we try to take care of them.\" \n But even they were surprised by their discovery at Lake View Cemetery, a picturesque graveyard on Seattle's Capitol Hill. \n George Nemeth, manager of Lake View, said that decades ago the cemetery became a repository for the city's unclaimed cremated remains. \n \"We have a number of cremated remains that over the years were stored here from various funeral homes,\" Nemeth said. \n The cemetery eventually accumulated nearly 1,700 such remains. Until recently, they were stored in a maintenance shop, but when the shop was renovated, Lake View workers cataloged the remains and moved them into empty crypts throughout the cemetery. \n \"It happens periodically that people will come claim them,\" Nemeth said. \n Last summer, Loretta Dimond paid a call to Lake View, looking for the remains of possible veterans. Two names on the cemetery's list of unclaimed remains, those of James and Irene Powers, caught her eye. \n The dates of their deaths, during the Roaring Twenties, coincided with a period of time that saw many Civil War veterans die. \n \"It seemed possible that Mr. Powers was a Civil War veteran,\" Jim Dimond said. \n The Dimonds' curiosities began to buzz, but there was work to do to establish whether Powers was a Civil War veteran and whether he qualified for a military burial. \n \"We had to make sure we had the right person,\" James Dimond said. \n A process of \"detective work\" ensued, he said, including trips to the National Archives offices in Seattle for copies of military pension payment receipts, the scouring of newspaper microfiche for obituaries and internet searches for information about Powers. \n Their conclusion: Powers was in fact a Civil War veteran and deserved a military funeral that recognized his service. \n The Dimonds then worked with Patrick to complete the bureaucratic process to have Powers verified as a veteran and win authorization to hold a military funeral for him at Tahoma. \n Powers, it turns out, was born in Michigan and worked as a farmer near Kalamazoo before enlisting in the Union Army in 1864 along with his future father-in-law, the Rev. Orlando Keyes. \n Keyes officiated at the wedding of his daughter, Irene, and Powers the day after their enlistment. The two men left Michigan a few days later with their unit, Company D of the 12th Michigan Infantry Regiment, according to online records and research by the Dimonds. \n Powers spent most of his enlistment in Arkansas, where he worked as a company clerk and medical assistant, James Dimond said. \n The 12th Michigan, which fought at Shiloh and Vicksburg in preceding years, mostly served more mundane duties in 1864-'65, including guarding railroads and other public property after the taking of Little Rock, according to Nation Park Service records. \n After the war, Powers returned to Michigan, where he embarked on a career in public service that included working as a teacher, school inspector, highway commissioner and state representative, records show. \n \"He was a literate and smart person,\" said James Dimond, adding that Powers went on to become an attorney. \n In 1920, James and Irene Powers moved to Seattle to be near their eldest son, the Rev. Powers, according to a July 1, 1921, obituary published in The Seattle Times. \n James Dimond said Powers, who then was in his late 70s, was not well when he moved west and died about a year after arriving. He was 78. \n James Dimond said he and his wife are thrilled to have played a role in identifying Powers as a Civil War veteran and in helping him receive an honorable burial after all these years. \n He admitted becoming emotional when he and Loretta Dimond got to hold the urns of Powers and his wife this summer. \n \"This guy fought to save the Union and end slavery,\" James Dimond said. \"It was highly moving.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Information from: The News Tribune, http://www.thenewstribune.com \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Couple's efforts secure forgotten Civil War veteran his due"}

He was still cooking in the family's Taipei restaurant kitchen just a few months ago. \n Peng first brought the sticky, sweet and spicy dish to New York about 40 years ago. \n It's now on Chinese restaurant menus across the United States, exploding in popularity after President Nixon visited China in 1972. The dish also reportedly became a favorite of famed statesman Henry Kissinger, who with Nixon helped open the communist country to the West, spotlighting its culture and food. \n But General Tso's chicken was never part of the Chinese culinary tradition. \n The chef created the dish in the 1950s in Taiwan, where he fled in 1949 with Chiang Kai-shek after the communists took over, said Chuck Peng, speaking from his home in Taipei. \n In Taiwan, the chef helped welcome the commander of the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet in the Pacific with a banquet that included the new culinary creation named after a 19th-century Chinese military leader from Peng's native Hunan Province. \n By the 1970s, he was in New York running a restaurant named after himself near the United Nations on Manhattan's East Side. Kissinger was a frequent guest, said Chuck Peng. \n \"General Tso's Chicken is so famous because of Henry Kissinger, because he was among the first to eat it, and he liked it, so others followed,\" said Peng. \n Americans quickly took to what is now a mound of deep-fried chunks of floured chicken, smothered in sweetness that usually includes soy sauce, sugar, ginger and other spices. \n In the dish's first incarnation, the chicken reportedly was not fried, and its unsweetened flavor came from garlic, soy sauce and chilis. \n The story of the delicacy is told in a 2014 documentary called \"The Search for General Tso,\" which traces the roots of Chinese food in America through the iconic dish. \n Chuck Peng runs the family's chain of 10 restaurants in Taiwan, all called Peng's. \n Until he was hospitalized a few months ago, his son said Peng was a daily presence at their flagship Taipei restaurant which opened after the chef left New York in 1983.

State prosecutors accuse her of helping a close confidante extort money and favors from large companies and manipulate state affairs. \n Police say the turnout in streets near the presidential office could be similar to what was the largest anti-Park protest last Saturday when they sized the crowd at 270,000.

Washington has pursued a so-called \"one China\" policy since 1979 when it shifted diplomatic recognition of China from the government in Taiwan to the communist government on the mainland. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying, File) \n NEW YORK >> President-elect Donald Trump spoke Friday with the president of Taiwan, a move that will be sure to anger China. \n It is highly unusual, probably unprecedented, for a U.S. president or president-elect to speak directly with a leader of Taiwan, a self-governing island the U.S. broke diplomatic ties with in 1979. \n Washington has pursued a so-called \"one China\" policy since 1979, when it shifted diplomatic recognition of China from the government in Taiwan to the communist government on the mainland. Under that policy, the U.S. recognizes Beijing as representing China but retains unofficial ties with Taiwan. \n A statement from Trump's transition team said he spoke with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who offered her congratulations. It was not clear who initiated the call. \n \"During the discussion, they noted the close economic, political, and security ties \u2026 between Taiwan and the United States. President-elect Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year,\" the statement said. \n A Taiwanese source with direct knowledge of the call confirmed it had taken place. The source requested anonymity to speak about it before an official statement was issued on it from Taipei. \n The White House learned of the conversation after it had taken place, said a senior Obama administration official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive diplomatic relations involved. \n China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n Friday's call is the most stark example yet of how Trump has flouted diplomatic conventions since he won the Nov. 8 election. He has apparently undertaken calls with foreign leaders without guidance customarily lent by the State Department, which oversees U.S. diplomacy. \n Over the decades, the status of Taiwan has been one of the most sensitive issues in U.S.-China relations. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory to be retaken by force, if necessary, if it seeks independence. It would regard any recognition of a Taiwanese leader as a head of state as unacceptable. \n Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland amid civil war in 1949. The U.S. policy acknowledges the Chinese view over sovereignty, but considers Taiwan's status as unsettled. \n Although the U.S. does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it has close unofficial ties. Taiwan's government has a representative office in Washington and other U.S. cities. The U.S. also has legal commitments to help Taiwan maintain the ability to defend itself. \n Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said Trump's conversation does not signal any change to long-standing U.S. policy on \"cross-strait\" issues. \n \"We remain firmly committed to our 'one China' policy,\" Price said. \"Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross-strait relations.\" \n Tsai was democratically elected in January and took office in May. The traditional independence-leaning policies of her party have strained relations with Beijing. \n Diplomatic protocol dictates that Taiwanese presidents can transit through the U.S. but not visit Washington. \n Douglas Paal, who served as head of the American Institute in Taiwan during the George W. Bush administration, said that to his knowledge the call was unprecedented. He said he expected Beijing to issue a verbal warning that there's no space to change the rules over Taiwan relations. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump speaks with Taiwan's president, risking China tensions"}

{"date": "December 2, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump raises his fist as he speaks during the first stop of his post-election tour, Thursday, Dec. 1, 2016, in Cincinnati. \n NEW YORK >> Donald Trump's skeptics hope the presidency will reveal a serious side of the brash businessman. His supporters want him to keep the freewheeling style that rattled Washington. \n In true Trump fashion, so far he's doing both. \n Trump has soothed some Republican establishment anxieties with many of his early Cabinet picks, including the respected retired Gen. James Mattis to lead the Pentagon and Georgia Rep. Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon tapped to head the Department of Health and Human Services. He's hinted that he's open to shifting some of his most controversial policies, including his rejection of climate change and support for torture. He's been full of praise for President Barack Obama and largely respectful of Hillary Clinton, his vanquished campaign rival. \n But Trump is also refusing to abandon the raucous, stream-of-consciousness rallies and Twitter tirades that defined his presidential campaign. He's continued to level false statements, claiming without evidence that millions of people voted illegally in the election. And he's infused the normally staid Cabinet selection process with reality television drama, inviting cameras into his dinner with Mitt Romney, a leading candidate for secretary of state, and announcing the secretary of defense pick in an arena, seemingly off the cuff. \n \"He was a very unconventional candidate,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said. \"He's going to be an unconventional president.\" \n Despite his tell-it-like-it-is reputation, Trump is fueled by a deep need to be liked, according to long-time associates. He often modulates his tone to his setting and frequently tries to curry favor with his audience by telling them what he thinks they want to hear. He often speaks in vague generalities, his policy plans short on details, and that allows supporters to read in what they wish. \n And sometimes he seems to move in contradictions, as when he made simultaneous appointments of Reince Priebus \u2014 a nod to the Washington establishment \u2014 and Stephen Bannon \u2014 a shot across the establishment's bow \u2014 to fill two key roles in his administration, giving opposing factions of his coalition something to cheer. \n People who meet with the president-elect personally talk about there being \"two Trumps\" \u2014 the self-promoting celebrity that's seen in public and the amiable and courteous grandfather who emerges in private. \n \"He's charming in person,\" said John Allison, the former CEO of BB&T, who recently met with Trump. \"He absolutely has a lot of personal charisma.\" \n Indeed, Trump has appeared to win over some of his toughest Republican critics since defeating Clinton. GOP lawmakers have praised all of his Cabinet nominees, some of whom hold more traditionally conservative views than Trump himself. Romney, who was one of Trump's fiercest critics during the campaign, emerged from their dinner this week with warm words for a man he'd only recently called a \"phony.\" \n \"He continues with a message of inclusion and bringing people together and his vision is something which obviously connected with the American people in a very powerful way,\" Romney said in a stunning turnabout for the 2012 GOP nominee. \n But Trump appears acutely aware that the enthusiastic supporters who propelled him to the White House are watching carefully to see if he'll back away from his pledges to shake up the political system. Supporters shouted their opposition to Romney being in the Cabinet Thursday as Trump stood on stage in Cincinnati for the kickoff of a \"thank you\" tour for voters. \n Trump gave them plenty else to cheer about, fully re-embracing his firebrand and raucous campaign persona. \n He took the stage full of swagger and as focused on score-settling as he was during the campaign. He spent more than 10 minutes bashing the press, recounting how the media doubted his chances of winning. \n \"These are very, very dishonest people,\" said Trump, one of several times during the night when he incited the crowd to jeer the press gathered in the pen at the back of the arena. \"Ok, I love this stuff. Should I go on with this just a little bit longer? I love it.\" Shifting to how he broke Clinton's so-called Midwest firewall, he said, \"We didn't break it, we shattered that sucker.

At the moment when shooters unleashed terror on San Bernardino a year ago, county employees remembered their fallen colleagues with a moment of silence late Friday morning. \n SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. >> At the moment when shooters unleashed terror on San Bernardino a year ago, county employees remembered their fallen colleagues in silence late Friday morning. \n A bell rang 14 times in memory of each person slain in the terror attack that also wounded 22 others at the Inland Regional Center. \n \"We will never forget that day or the victims of this senseless act of violence. We strive to move forward and search for the good that is in us all,\" said Lavinia Johnson, executive director of the center. \n During the ceremony outside the center, employees of nearby businesses who sheltered county workers during the chaos were thanked by Keith Nelson, the center's chairman. \n Among those attending was Zen Martinsen, 56, a clerical supervisor for the county. While she didn't know the victims, she said county employees are like family. \n \"This affects everybody and I think it's just really important that terrorism doesn't win,\" she said. \"We can't let it win.\" \n It was one of a series of events scheduled in the hardscrabble city of 216,000 people east of Los Angeles to mark the anniversary of the Dec. 2, 2015, attack by husband-and-wife assailants on a holiday luncheon for county health employees. Investigators say the attackers were inspired by the Islamic State group. \n Earlier, cyclists conducted a 14-mile bike ride \u2014 one mile for each person who was killed. \n Most of those killed in the attack by county health inspector Syed Rizwan Farook, and Farook's Pakistani wife Tashfeen Malik, were Farook's colleagues. \n The city of San Bernardino was to hold a public ceremony Friday evening, and the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians planned to light up an iconic arrowhead landmark in the nearby foothills. \n While the city of San Bernardino has been grappling with a spike in homicides this year, community residents have worked hard to prevent a hate-filled backlash to the terror attack. Clergy have formed an interfaith alliance, victims' families have encouraged tolerance and Muslims residents undertook a campaign to educate neighbors about Islam. \n Since the attack, San Bernardino police Sgt. Emil Kokesh said he has also been reminded of the need to stay fit. Kokesh arrived at the scene of the onslaught minutes after the shooting and was there for more than a day. He said he was sore for two weeks, which prompted him to take up cycling to get in shape with some fellow officers. \n That led to the memorial bike ride. \n \"On that day, it pushed a lot of us to our limits \u2014 physically, mentally, and emotionally,\" he said. Now, Kokesh said he often reminds his fellow officers: \"You may work in an office, you may do investigations, and not do much field work anymore, but you are going to be the ones who respond to something like this, so stay fit, stay prepared.\" \n The Inland Regional Center provides case management services for people with developmental disabilities, cerebral palsy, epilepsy and autism. The building where the attack occurred is still closed and is undergoing remodeling. It is expected to reopen in early 2017, and a memorial to the victims is planned, Kevin Urtz, the center's associate executive director said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "San Bernardino recalls terror attack with silence, speakers"}

She says it's the best way to stop the capture and killings of dolphins in Japan. \n \"These animals travel the ocean. That's what they explore daily. No tank will be big enough. No tank will ever be deep enough, ever be exciting enough,\" she said Friday in a Skype call from the small Japanese town of Taiji, whose dolphin hunt was documented in the 2009 Oscar-winning film \"The Cove.\" \n Williams, 19, is the latest celebrity joining the cause to save dolphins. Others include Brian May of Queen, Sting and Daryl Hannah. \n She hopes her influence, especially on social media, with 4 million followers on Instagram and 1.5 million on Twitter, will help the cause. \n Ric O'Barry, the dolphin trainer for the \"Flipper\" TV series, started the protests against the Taiji dolphin kill. He starred in \"The Cove,\" which depicts a pod of dolphins getting herded into an inlet and bludgeoned to death. \n The ones that are killed and sold for meat are left over from the main purpose of the hunt \u2014 selling the best-looking ones to aquariums and shows. \n The hunters in Taiji and their supporters have repeatedly defended the custom as tradition, although eating dolphins is extremely rare in Japan. The Japanese government also defends whaling as research. \n Williams, who is the global ambassador for O'Barry's Dolphin Project campaign, said that only a handful of Taiji fishermen are benefiting from the practice and many Japanese don't even know about Taiji. \n \"It's not an attack on Japan at all, or on Taiji, or the people of Taiji,\" she said. \"I want to say, honestly, hand on heart, that this is not an attack on anyone in specific.\" \n \"The Cove,\" which was not widely shown in Japan, went online Friday for free viewing limited to Japan, after the Dolphin Project rebought distribution rights. \n Williams said she went to the cove earlier in the day, but there was no slaughter. \n During her trip, her second time in Japan, she plans to go whale-watching in Mikura Islands, south of Tokyo, where whales are protected and dolphins are often seen swimming in the wild. \n \"It was something that just struck a chord in my heart. And I'm a firm believer that, if there is something that you really want to stand up and fight for, then you should. And with everyone doing their own little bit for what they believe in, hopefully together we can make the world a better place,\" she said of her wish to save dolphins. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Maisie Williams: Stop going to dolphin shows"}

But they later squabbled over when to do so after Park made a conditional offer to resign. \n Leaders of the three major opposition parties met and agreed to put an impeachment motion to a floor vote next Friday, according to a statement from the largest opposition Democratic Party. \n \"From now on, there won't be any cracks among the three opposition parties\" over Park's impeachment, the statement said. \n The opposition lacks enough lawmakers to pass Park's impeachment on its own and needs help from dissenters in Park's ruling party. \n A group of anti-Park lawmakers in the ruling party decided Friday to vote for her impeachment if she fails to announce by next Wednesday that she will step down voluntarily in April, according to the office of Hwang Young-cheul, one of the dissenters. They also want her to promise to help ensure a smooth power transfer to her successor, Hwang's office said. \n It was unclear how Park will react to the demands. She said Tuesday she would leave office if parliament comes up with a stable power transfer plan. Opposition lawmakers immediately lambasted the overture, saying it was a ploy to buy time and find ways to survive the scandal. \n The scandal, which has sparked massive street protests and plunged Park's approval rating to 4 percent, is centered around allegations that Park let her friend of 40 years, Choi Soon-sil, manipulate government affairs from the shadows and extort money from businesses. Choi, who has never had a government job, is a daughter of a late cult leader who served as Park's mentor. \n Prosecutors have indicted Choi and two of Park's former aides and accused Park of colluding in their criminal activities. Park denies the allegations, although she has acknowledged she received help from Choi in editing speeches and unspecified \"public relations\" issues. \n Park's single five-year term ends in early 2018.
