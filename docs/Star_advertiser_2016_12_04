{"date": "December 4, 2016", "text": "BEIJING >> With Donald Trump's latest tweets touching on highly sensitive issues, China must decide how to handle an incoming American president who relishes confrontation and whose online statements appear to foreshadow shifts in foreign policy. \n China awoke Monday to sharp criticism from Trump on Twitter, days after it responded to his telephone conversation with Taiwan's president by accusing the Taiwanese of playing a \"little trick\" on Trump. \n Trump wrote, \"Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete, heavily tax our products going into their country (the U.S. doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea? I don't think so!\" \n That was apparently prompted by China's response to Trump's Friday talk with Tsai Ing-wen, the first time an American president or president-elect had spoken to Taiwan's leader since the U.S. broke off formal diplomatic relations in 1979. \n The U.S. and Taiwan retain strong unofficial ties, and the U.S. sells weapons to the self-governing island. But American leaders have for decades avoided any official recognition in deference to China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory \u2014 to be captured by force if necessary. Trump's reference in another tweet to Tsai as \"the President of Taiwan\" was sure to inflame China, which considers any reference to Taiwan having a president as a grave insult. \n China's reaction was relatively low-key and seemed to offer Trump a face-saving way out of an apparent blunder by blaming the Taiwanese side. English-language commentaries then appeared in two state-run newspapers known to be used by China's ruling Communist Party leadership to send messages abroad. \n \"Trump might be looking for some opportunities by making waves,\" said the Global Times in a Monday editorial headlined, \"Talk to Trump, punish Tsai administration.\" \n \"However, he has zero diplomatic experience and is unaware of the repercussions of shaking up Sino-US relations,\" the newspaper said. \"It is certain that Trump doesn't want a showdown with China, because it is not his ambition, and neither was it included in his promise to the electorate. He puts out feelers to sound China out and chalk up some petty benefits.\" \n China's response was characteristically coded. But it now faces an incoming president who deals in outspoken tweets, not communiques. \n Trump used a platform banned by censors in mainland China to renew several of his criticisms during the U.S. presidential campaign. Some of his arguments aren't true. \n Taiwan's official Central News Agency, citing anonymous sources on Saturday, said that Edwin Feulner, founder of the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, was a \"crucial figure\" in setting up communication channels between the sides. \n Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Sunday that the phone call shouldn't necessarily be interpreted as a shift in U.S. policy. He shrugged off the attention to the incident as media hype. \n \"It was a courtesy call,\" Pence told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \n Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said Trump's conversation does not signal any change to long-standing U.S. policy on cross-strait issues \u2014 although some in Taiwan expressed hopes for strong U.S. support from the incoming administration. \n In terms of Trump's criticisms, Chinese imports are taxed at standard U.S. rates, while Washington has recently slapped painful punitive tariffs on Chinese steel, solar panels and other goods. \n And while China once kept a tight grip on the value of the yuan, also known as the renminbi, it now allows it to trade within a bandwidth 2 percent above or below a daily target set by the People's Bank of China. \n The yuan is currently trading at around a six-year low against the dollar. But economists now conclude that the currency is more or less properly valued in relation to the dollar and other foreign currencies. And with economic growth slowing considerably and more Chinese trying to move money out of the country, the government is now spending massively to hold up the yuan's value rather than depressing it as Trump and other critics accuse it of doing. It has also imposed strict controls on Chinese moving money out of the country. \n China has built up its military and constructed man-made islands in the South China Sea, and made sweeping territorial claims over almost the entire critical waterway. Those claims were broadly rejected in June by an international tribunal in The Hague. \n The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately comment to Trump's latest comments. \n Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at People's University in Beijing, predicted China would not lash out immediately, but calibrate its response over the next several months after Trump enters the White House. \n \"Trump's remarks will certainly raise the concerns of Chinese leaders,\" Shi said. \"But at the moment, they will be restrained and watch his moves closely.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Beijing faces decision on how to respond to Trump's tweets"}

The tests also can add to knowledge needed to take such autonomous driving onto public roads. \n Nissan executive Haruhiko Yoshimura said the automaker hoped to use the technology throughout the Oppama plant by 2019, and in overseas plants in the future. \n During a demonstration Monday, a Leaf car with no one inside scooted along the road, pulling a trailer with three other Leafs on it, stopped properly for other vehicles, and then veered into a parking lot. \n But one vehicle ran into trouble, refused to move and was not able to take part in the demonstration. \n Kazuhiro Doi, a Nissan vice president, acknowledged such glitches showed a challenge unique to the technology. \n \"If there are drivers, they can take action,\" he said. \"Mechanical operations are all there is in a driverless car.\" \n Nissan, which makes the March subcompact, Infiniti luxury models and the Leaf electric car, now has just two of the self-driving Leaf cars. \n For all the vehicles produced at the Oppama plant to be towed in a driverless way, five more such vehicles are needed, according to Nissan. \n People still had to get inside each of the towed vehicles to drive them to the proper wharf, but Nissan hopes that as self-driving technology advances cars will drive themselves into the ships, up the plank on their own. \n Driverless cars are still not allowed on regular public roads in Japan, although major automakers are all working on such technology. Driverless driving is legal within private facilities like Nissan's. \n In commercial products available in Japan, the vehicles, with some variation of autonomous driving, can stop on their own before a crash or stay inside the lane on their own for highway driving, although all must have drivers. \n Nissan, allied with Renault SA of France, has been carrying out tests with driverless towing since last year. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Cars without drivers scoot around Nissan plant, towing cars"}

{"date": "December 4, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Lauren Bruner, one of five remaining survivors from the USS Arizona during the Dec. 7, 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, recounts the experience at his home in La Mirada, Calif. Burns covered most of his body after Japanese planes bombed his ship. He spent seven months recovering in the hospital, and returned to fight in more battles. \n Lauren Bruner was getting ready for church in 1941 on his battleship, the USS Arizona, when the alarm sounded. \n The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had begun, and Bruner, then 21, scampered up five stories by ladder to the enormous anti-aircraft guns he was responsible for manning. \n But bullets hit his left leg and explosions set off by the Sunday morning bombardment rocked his ship before he could get to the weapons. The ship sank just nine minutes later. Bruner escaped, but suffered severe burns. \n This week Bruner, now 96, plans to visit a memorial over the Arizona's sunken wreckage and attend a remembrance ceremony at Pearl Harbor on the 75th anniversary of the Dec. 7, 1941, attack. \n Bruner has traveled from his Southern California home for the events many times, but doesn't know how long the Arizona's few remaining survivors will able to keep up the tradition. \n \"It's getting close to being the end pretty soon. There's only five of us left now,\" Bruner said. \n More than 2,300 servicemen died in the Japanese attack that plunged the United States into World War II. Nearly half of those killed were on the Arizona, most still entombed in the wreckage. \n The Navy and National Park Service expect several dozen attack survivors to attend the remembrance ceremony Wednesday on a pier overlooking the harbor. They, along with thousands of others, will observe a moment of silence at 7:55 a.m. \u2014 the same minute the Japanese planes hit their first target in the harbor. \n Back then, in 1941, Bruner didn't know who was attacking until the planes got close enough for him to see the red Rising Sun Japanese insignia on their sides. The aircraft shot at \"everything in sight,\" he said. Then an explosion tore through his battle station. \n \"That's where the flames blew right through and cooked me right there,\" Bruner said in a telephone interview from his home in La Mirada, California. \n With \"everything burning,\" Bruner tried to get off the ship as fast as he could. But the water in the harbor 80 feet below \u2014 infused with leaked oil \u2014 was on fire, too, so jumping wasn't an option. \n Bruner and a few fellow shipmates shouted to a sailor on the ship moored next to the Arizona to toss over some rope. The six of them tied the rope and carried themselves hand-over-hand across the 100-foot expanse to the USS Vestal. \n \"You're like a chicken getting barbecued,\" he said. All of them made it, becoming six of the 335 sailors and Marines on the Arizona to survive. Another 1,177 shipmates died. \n Doctors on the USS Solace hospital ship wanted to amputate most of Bruner's hands, leaving him with just his forefingers and thumbs, he said. Ultimately they peeled off his dead skin and let new skin grow in. They put him in a special bed with hoops that allowed sheets to be draped above him but not touch him. \n Navy documents recently uncovered by the genealogy and historical records company Ancestry show Bruner suffered burns on his face and the back of his neck, his right shoulder, right arm and forearm, fingers, hands, outer thighs and lower legs. \n The burns on his right arm were particularly severe and took longer to heal, according to the documents, which Ancestry has posted in a special section for Pearl Harbor survivors within its military records site Fold3.com. \n Bruner spent seven months recovering but returned to service, he said, because the Navy needed sailors to train new recruits to fight the war. He was on the USS Coghlan when it bombed Japanese positions on Attu Island in Alaska in 1943. His ship later took troops to the South Pacific and was near Guam when the war ended. \n He doesn't like to rehash many details from Dec. 7. He said he just \"grins and bears it\" to cope with the memories. \n \"There are parts of this whole thing that I can't talk about. If I do talk about it, I cannot sleep,\" he said. \n After the Navy, Bruner went to work for a former Marine's refrigeration business and spent 39 years with the company. He married twice, but outlived both wives. \n Bruner wants his ashes interred inside his old battleship after he dies, like many other Arizona survivors who have chosen to be buried with their shipmates. Bruner said he prefers this to lying in a sparsely visited cemetery. \n \"I think I've got the last spot,\" he said, expressing confidence he'll be the last of the survivors to go. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press Writer Christine Armario in Los Angeles contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "USS Arizona survivor heads to Pearl Harbor 75 years later"}

{"date": "December 4, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Joan Martin Rodby, left, and Emma Veary look at their fifth-grade class photo during a reunion in Makawao, Hawaii. \n In some ways, it could be any class photo from the 1940s. The sepia-toned image shows 30 fifth-graders \u2014 26 girls and four boys \u2014 at Thomas Jefferson Elementary School in Waikiki. Most are smiling, some look stern. A few have no shoes. \n Yet this picture is different in one striking way: Each child is holding a bag containing a gas mask, a sign of how war had suddenly broke apart the routines of their adolescence on Dec. 7, 1941. \n Three of the students, now in their mid-80s and all friends who have kept in touch over the years, reflected recently on the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor 75 years ago and the mark it left on their childhoods. \n Joan Martin Rodby remembered the carefree walks to school, and her family building an air raid shelter in their yard. Florence Seto, who is Japanese-American, recalled sharing ice cream with Rodby, and being worried that her family would be taken away. \n Emma Veary reminisced about her days singing, and her family covering the windows at night so Japanese pilots couldn't use the light of homes to guide them. \n On the morning of Dec. 7, a Sunday, Japanese bombers flew across Oahu and began their assault. Some children climbed onto the roofs of homes to see what was happening. The planes were so close to the ground in some cases that they could make out the Rising Sun insignia.  \n Soon, smoke rose over the water, about 10 miles from Veary's home near Waikiki. \n Veary, then 11, climbed atop a neighbor's house. Back then, Waikiki didn't have any high-rise hotels and condominiums to block the view, so she could see all the way to the naval base. Her parents yelled at her to get down as soon as they heard about the attack. \n Seto, who lived a few blocks away near homes belonging to Navy families, remembered a neighbor rushing out of her home, screaming about how the Japanese, using an epithet common at the time, had attacked Pearl Harbor. \n The young Seto ran home, and, using the same word, told her parents, both immigrants from Japan. \n \"That didn't go over too well,\" she said. \n The attack killed more than 2,300 people, nearly half of them on the battleship USS Arizona. More than 1,100 were injured. After the attack, President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered a speech before Congress, calling Dec. 7 a \"date which will live in infamy.\" The U.S. declared war against Japan. \n Veary, Seto and Rodby suddenly found themselves living in a war zone, as an ever-present worry about a Japanese invasion permeated life in their island home. \n About a month or two after the attack, Rodby and her classmates were issued gas masks. Rodby, who was 10 at the time, remembers being tested on how quickly she could don the mask. If an air raid siren went off, they had to be able to put the masks on in seconds.  \n The children put their gas masks around the backs of their chairs while in class. When playing outside, they kept them in a set spot so they could grab them right away. \n \"It was like an extra arm we had to have all the time,\" Rodby said. \n At home, her father, who worked at Honolulu Iron Works, built an air raid shelter in their yard. They didn't know how long the war would last or how long they would need it, so they stocked it with pillows, blankets, dishes and a kerosene lamp to make it comfortable. \n \"We would have food down there and artificial lighting and the more we needed the air raid shelters, the fancier they got inside. I mean, people would have beds and they put flooring in,\" she said. \n Her school had air raid trenches dug by parents and volunteers. They were covered with grass, tin or wood so any airplanes flying overhead wouldn't be able to spot them. \n Many of Rodby's war memories are happy ones, though. She recalls walking and skipping the four blocks or so from her home to the school, meeting friends along the way. They'd be a big group by the time they reached campus. \n Seto said the only scary part of the entire war was when military police, carrying guns with fixed bayonets, showed up at her house looking for her father.  \n Her neighbors, who served in the Navy, suspected he was hoarding food and reported him after he used his painting business truck to load up on Vienna sausage, Spam and rice for friends. \n Seto's immigrant parents had trouble communicating with the police. Her brothers explained what their father was doing and gave the police the names of families they were helping. The military police apologized and left, she said. \n The families who called the police were good friends of the Setos. Their children played with Seto and her siblings. \"They were just afraid. It was a scary time,\" she said. \n Government authorities detained 1,330 Japanese-Americans and Japanese nationals from Hawaii, particularly community leaders like Shinto priests and teachers. Seto said her father was investigated, but she believes he was spared because a business associate vouched for his trustworthiness. \n But a family friend, a restaurant owner, was deported. \"We didn't know any details except my mother and father would talk about it and then hush up when we would come close by,\" she said. \n Many of Seto's other memories were happy ones. She had the most fun helping out in the pineapple fields to fill in for men who left to serve in the military. \n \"Everyone did their part,\" she said. \n Soon after the attack began, Veary's father got a call to go to Pearl Harbor to help rescue sailors. He was a tug boat captain for a local shipping company. He didn't come back for more than a day.  \n Life under the threat of further Japanese attacks meant her family had to cover their windows to block any light from escaping at night. Wardens would patrol neighborhoods to make sure no light was visible through the windows. They would knock on the door of offending houses. \n But there were plenty of light-hearted moments, too. She practiced her singing, including in front of audiences \u2014 a talent that would later become her profession. During the holidays, Veary's brother and sister would bring servicemen they met on the bus home to eat food cooked by their mother and their neighbors. \n \"We weren't a well-to-do family, but whatever we had we liked to share,\" Veary said. \n Veary would occasionally hear from some of them, until a few years ago. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Children who lived through Pearl Harbor attack remember"}

Goldsmith found that Stein had \"shown the likelihood of irreparable harm\" if the count was delayed even by two days and rejected the state's arguments about the cost to taxpayers. \n Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by 10,704 votes, or two-tenths of a percentage point, in Michigan. Stein received about 1 percent of the vote. \n Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette, the Trump campaign and super PACs have filed separate lawsuits asking state courts to prevent the recount, arguing that Stein, as the fourth-place finisher, is not \"aggrieved\" because she has no chance of winning in a recount. \n The Green Party also wants recounts in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

But he said he wanted to ensure he didn't make the mistake that some other world leaders have done, and instead wanted to leave while he was on top of his game. \n Speaking in a shaking voice, Key said he had made personal sacrifices for the job and the role had taken a toll on his family. \n Key said his National Party caucus would meet Dec. 12 to decide on a new party leader and prime minister, and that he expected to formally submit his resignation to the Governor-General that same day. \n He said he would back his deputy Bill English to take over. English said he would likely decide in the next day or two if he would seek the role. \n The New Zealand dollar fell by nearly 1 percent on the news and was trading at $0.71 U.S. \n Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he'd sent Key a short message: \"Say it ain't so, bro.\" \n \"John Key is one of the most outstanding national leaders in the world today,\" Turnbull told reporters. \"He has done an extraordinary job for New Zealand.

He was elected to the nation's parliament in 2002 and enjoyed a quick rise, becoming leader of his center-right opposition party in 2006. He won his first general election and became prime minister in 2008. \n He won subsequent elections in 2011 and 2014 and retained unusually high popularity ratings. His party was a clear favorite to win the most votes at next year's election, at least until his announcement on Monday. \n Key said that steering the country of 4.7 million through the economic crisis of 2008 and on to improved fortunes was a proud accomplishment. \n \"Very few countries are in the financial position we are in,\" Key said. \"We're strong, we're in surplus, we're growing, we're creating jobs, we're doing well.\" \n New Zealand is enjoying relatively robust annual GDP growth of over 3 percent and the unemployment rate has fallen below 5 percent, thanks in part to growth in tourism and construction. \n Key also talked about the importance of standing beside the people of Christchurch after an earthquake in 2011 killed 185 people. \n \"Simply put, it has, for me, been the most remarkable, satisfying and exciting time of my life,\" he said. \"But despite the amazing career I have had in politics, I have never seen myself as a career politician.\" \n He said the role came with costs. \n \"For my wife Bronagh, there have been many nights and weekends spent alone,\" he said. \"My daughter Stephie and my son Max have transitioned from teenagers to young adults while coping with an extraordinary level of intrusion and pressure because of their father's job.\" \n He said he wasn't sure what life after politics would bring, other than he would probably take up positions on a couple of company boards and accept international speaking engagements.

Water and power were sometimes stolen from neighbors, who would get angry and shut them off. Once, a generator blew up, and residents quickly doused the flames, she said. \n Mack, a 58-year-old tech sales worker and jewelry maker, lived in the warehouse for four or five months about two years ago. On Friday night, fire ripped through the cluttered space during a dance party, killing at least 33 people. Oakland officials say the death toll is expected to rise. \n The building was crammed with rugs, old sofas and a garage-sale-like collection of pianos, paintings, turntables, statues and other items that quickly fed the flames. \n Mack recalled a jumble of extension cords and heavy musical equipment. \n \"That place was just a death trap,\" she said. \"I didn't think it was going to last this long before it went up or somebody shut it down.\" \n Mack found the rental in a Facebook ad and paid about $700 a month to live there, along with a security deposit of the same amount and a one-time contribution of about $700 to a fund meant to go toward improvements.

They did not respond to email messages from The Associated Press. \n Danielle Boudreaux, a 40-year-old hairdresser, said she became fast friends with the couple when they met eight years ago before a falling out about a year ago over conditions at the warehouse. \n Access to the second floor \u2014 where there was a room for concerts and a home for the couple and their children \u2014 was a rickety, homemade staircase, she said. \n \"Calling it a staircase gives you the idea that it was a set of stairs. It was not,\" Boudreaux said. \"It was random pieces of wood put together to create something that you could get up to the top floor on. But it was not what most people would consider a staircase. It was like a jimmy-rigged makeshift staircase. As soon as you stepped on it, it wobbled all over the place.\" \n Boudreaux said the couple was constantly trying to keep enough tenants to cover the warehouse rent, renting out recreational vehicles that were parked on the first floor as well as other living spaces, and charging for the parties that were held there. \n But Alastair Boone, a 22-year-old University of California, Berkeley student who went to the party Friday night with five friends, described what she called a stunning scene that included a larger-than-life wood carving of a Thai god or goddess, when she walked in around 11 p.m. \n \"It was obvious to me everyone who lives there cared about each other and were invested in a space they made a home,\" she said. \n Boudreaux said she had a falling out with Almena after telling Allison's parents and sister a year ago that the warehouse was a dangerous place for the couple's three children to live. \n \"I had told her parents explicitly that the warehouse conditions were not safe,\" Boudreaux said. \"Half the time they didn't even have running water, let alone heated water. They were using little electric heaters. There was cat (feces) everywhere.

Kerry in particular went out of his way this year, flying from Rome to Washington on Saturday attend the honors dinner before a scheduled trip to Berlin on Sunday. \n Obama \"has a very personal relationship with quite a number of artists,\" Rutter said. \"There is a sense from many of the artists that they are fond of him and respect him and appreciate him.

Among those in attendance: Kevin Spacey, Laurence Fishburne, Jeff Goldblum, comedian Stephen Colbert, and singers Garth Brooks and Bonnie Raitt. \n Obama said the Kennedy Center Honors is one of his favorite events each year. \"This year, I'm especially looking forward to seeing how Joe Walsh cleans up. Pretty good.\" \n The president said the arts are central to American life and help tell the story of who we are. \"We need song, and cinema, and paintings and performance to help us challenge our assumptions, to question the way things are and maybe inspire us to think how things might be.\" \n The Kennedy Center Honors are in their 39th year, a period that has included six presidents \u2014 three Republicans, three Democrats \u2014 and all have taken time to welcome the recipients. But the 2016 election was noteworthy for the way A-list performers lined up behind Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, while Trump had relatively few celebrity endorsements. \n \"We can't really anticipate or speculate how things are going to work\" under Trump, Rutter said. \"Each president has their own style and their own connection to the arts, but each of them have participated and been enthusiastic.\" \n Rutter, who has led the Kennedy Center for the past two years, said she's not aware of any performer turning down the honor for political reasons, and she doesn't expect that to happen in the future. \n \"Let's remember that this is the Kennedy Center Honors and that we are the nation's cultural center,\" she said. \"It's not technically the president that's bestowing the honor.

They wouldn't apply to foreign firms that ship goods to the U.S. \"Tariffs are one thing,\" Wolfers tweeted. \"Tariffs that attack only on U.S. firms are another altogether.\" \n Trump made the comments three days after he announced that appliance maker Carrier had agreed to reverse its decision to ship 800 jobs from an Indiana factory to Mexico. \n During the presidential campaign, he repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs \u2014 35 percent on Mexican imports, 45 percent on Chinese. Tariffs are meant to give homegrown companies a price edge by making their foreign competitors' products more expensive \u2014 and to punish foreign countries for unfair trade practices. \n Since Trump's election, his team has described tariffs as a potential tool to be used to pry concessions from America's trading partners. \"Tariffs are part of the negotiation,\" Wilbur Ross, an investment banker slated to become Trump's Commerce secretary, told CNBC last week. \n Tariffs could prove costly. They are imposed at the border, and importers would likely try to pass along as much of the cost as possible to their customers. \n A 45 percent tariff on Chinese-made goods could drive up U.S. retail prices on those goods by an average of about 10 percent, Capital Economics has calculated. Consumers would probably have to pay up because there are few alternatives to Chinese-made for many products. China, for instance, produces about 70 percent of the world's laptops and cellphones. \n Taxing foreign goods could also start a trade war. The Global Times, a Chinese newspaper, has already warned that China could retaliate by limiting sales of U.S. cars and iPhones and by ordering aircraft from Europe's Airbus instead of America's Boeing. \n In 2009, the Obama administration taxed Chinese tires to protect American tire makers from a surge in imports. Beijing retaliated with a tax of up to 105 percent on U.S. chicken parts. \n Researchers at the Peterson Institute found that the tire tariffs probably saved 1,200 jobs in the U.S. tire industry. But higher tire prices cost American consumers an extra $1.1 billion \u2014 more than $900,000 for every job saved. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump threatens payback for U.S. companies that move abroad"}

{"date": "December 4, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A unidentified man falls to the ground after speaking to authorities outside of a warehouse destroyed by a fire Saturday, Dec. 3, 2016, in Oakland, Calif. A deadly fire broke out during a rave at a converted warehouse in the San Francisco Bay Area. \n OAKLAND, Calif. >> Officials say the death toll has risen to 24 in a fire that ripped through a late-night dance party in a converted warehouse in Oakland, California, and they expect that number to climb as the search continues. \n Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt. Ray Kelly announced the new figure early Sunday. Only about 20 percent of the charred remains of the building have been searched. Oakland Battalion Fire Chief Melinda Drayton says fire crews worked through the night to clear debris from the gutted building. \n The search for bodies is expected to continue at least 48 hours. \n The building known as the \"Ghost Ship\" was an artist workspace and illegal home for a rotating cast of a dozen or more residents, those who lived there or visited often said. \n Former residents said it was also a death trap with few exits, a rickety makeshift staircase, piles of driftwood and a labyrinth of electrical cords. The ground floor had five recreational vehicles and other nooks used as living spaces that were rented out to tenants, while the upstairs had space for concerts like the deadly party that drew up to 100 people Friday night. \n With few lights, the place could be pitch black. One staircase led to a boarded up door. The water and electricity were stolen from neighbors and often didn't work. \n \"If you were not familiar with the building and the way that it was, if you were going there for a party, you wouldn't be aware of the maze that you have to go through to get out,\" said Danielle Boudreaux, a former friend of the couple who ran the warehouse. \n Boudreaux identified the operators of the collective as Derick Ion Almena and Micah Allison. She said she had a falling out with Almena when she persuaded Allison's parents and sister about a year ago that the warehouse was a dangerous place for the couple's three children to live. \n The couple charged tenants enough to cover the warehouse rent and used proceeds from parties to pay their own living expenses, Boudreaux said. \n On Saturday, the artist retreat had turned into a scene of horrors, the 4,000-square-foot structure to rubble. The building's roof had collapsed into the second floor, which in places fell to the bottom floor. Firefighters had to temporarily stop their search and rescue operations Saturday when they became too dangerous, taking time to shore up the structure, Oakland deputy fire chief Mark Hoffmann said. \n Oakland officials said they had opened an investigation just last month into the warehouse after repeated complaints from neighbors who said trash was piling up and people were illegally living in the building, which was zoned as a warehouse. \n Darin Ranelletti, of the Oakland Planning Department, said the city opened an investigation Nov. 13 and an investigator went to the premises on Nov. 17 but could not get inside. The city has not confirmed people were living inside. \n Shelley Mack said she lived there about two years ago, staying four or five months. She said she wasn't told the residence was illegal until after she moved in, when she was instructed to tell visitors it was a 24-hour workspace for artists. \n When outsiders or inspectors planned to visit, residents would scurry to hide clothes and bedding, Mack said. \n \"It's like a horror house. Just horrors in there,\" she said, referring to things such as no electricity, running water and freezing temperatures. \n Alastair Boone, 22, a University of California, Berkeley student arrived at the party with five friends around 11 p.m. and had just received a tour of the property and stepped outside before the fire broke out. \n \"In a couple of minutes there were flames coming out of the windows and black smoke was just billowing out of the house,\" she said. \n A man identified as Derick Ion posted a Facebook message early Saturday, saying \"Everything I worked so hard for is gone. Blessed that my children and Micah were at a hotel safe and sound.\" He drew rebukes online from others who said he was warned the building was unsafe. \n Almena did not immediately respond to emails sent to addresses affiliated with him. Phone numbers either rang continually or were disconnected. Authorities declined to talk about the manager when asked by reporters Saturday, saying they were focused on recovering the bodies and consoling the families. \n Online records listed the building's owner as Nar Siu Chor. The Associated Press could not locate a telephone number for her Saturday and efforts to reach her at other Oakland addresses associated with her were not successful. \n A website for the warehouse showed pictures of a Bohemian, loft-like interior made of wood and cluttered with rugs, old sofas and a garage-sale like collection of pianos, paintings, turntables, statues and other items. Advertisements touted various electronic music parties. Friday night's event featured musician Golden Donna's 100% Silk West Coast tour. \n It's unclear what sparked the fire, but officials said the clutter served as a tinderbox and there were no sprinklers inside. \n Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt. Ray Kelly said people either escaped from the building or died inside, where the only way down from the second story was via a stairwell constructed entirely of wooden pallets. \"It appears that either you got out or you got trapped inside.\" \n About 50 to 100 people were believed to have been at the party when the fire started around 11:30 p.m. Friday, officials said. \n \"We know there are bodies in there that we can't get to \u2014 that have been seen but not recovered,\" Kelly said. \n Monica Kat, a paralegal, feared four of her friends were dead. \n \"We were all checking in looking for them and they're still not accounted for and I can only think the worst at this point,\" she said. \n Dan Vega had been unable to find his 22-year-old brother or his brother's girlfriend. \n \"I just want to go over there. I have my work boots on. I'm ready to go,\" Dan Vega said. \n Oakland police urged those concerned about missing people to call the Alameda County Sheriff's Coroner's Bureau at 510-382-3000. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Jocelyn Gecker, Olga R.

Jack Dalrymple calling it a \"serious mistake\" that \"prolongs the dangerous situation\" of having several hundred protesters who are camped out on federal land during cold, wintry weather. U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer saying it's a \"very chilling signal\" for the future of infrastructure in the United States. \n The four-state, $3.8 billion project is largely complete except for the now-blocked segment underneath Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir. Assistant Secretary for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy said in a news release that her decision was based on the need to \"explore alternate routes\" for the pipeline's crossing. \n \"Although we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access, it's clear that there's more work to do,\" Darcy said. \"The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing.\" \n The company constructing the pipeline, Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners, had said it was unwilling to reroute the project. It and the Morton County Sheriff's Office, which has done much of the policing of the protests, didn't have immediate comment. \n U.S. Secretary for the Interior Sally Jewell said in a statement that the Corps' \"thoughtful approach \u2026 ensures that there will be an in-depth evaluation of alternative routes for the pipeline and a closer look at potential impacts.\" \n Standing Rock Sioux tribal chairman Dave Archambault didn't immediately respond to messages left seeking comment. \n The federal government has ordered people to leave the Oceti Sakowin, or Seven Council Fires, encampment on Army Corps of Engineers' land by Monday. But demonstrators say they're prepared to stay, and authorities say they won't forcibly remove them. \n Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the Department of Justice will \"continue to monitor the situation\" and stands \"ready to provide resources to help all those who can play a constructive role in easing tensions.\" \n \"The safety of everyone in the area \u2013 law enforcement officers, residents and protesters alike \u2013 continues to be our foremost concern,\" she added. \n Earlier Sunday, an organizer with Veterans Stand for Standing Rock said tribal elders had asked the military veterans not to have confrontations with law enforcement officials, adding the group is there to help out those who've dug in against the project. \n About 250 veterans gathered about a mile from the main camp for a meeting with organizer Wes Clark Jr., the son of former Democratic presidential candidate Gen. Wesley Clark. The group had said about 2,000 veterans were coming, but it wasn't clear how many actually arrived. \n \"We have been asked by the elders not to do direct action,\" Wes Clark Jr. said. He then talked about North Dakota authorities' decision to move away from a key bridge north of the encampment by 4 p.m. Sunday if demonstrators agree to certain conditions, saying the National Guard and law enforcement have armored vehicles and are armed. \n \"If we come forward, they will attack us,\" Clark said. Instead, he told the veterans, \"If you see someone who needs help, help them out.\" \n Authorities said they'll move from the north end of the Backwater Bridge if protesters stay south of it and come to the bridge only if there is a prearranged meeting. Authorities also asked protesters not to remove barriers on the bridge, which they have said was damaged in the late October conflict that led to several people being hurt, including a serious arm injury. \n \"The question was asked if we would consider pulling back from the Backwater Bridge,\" Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said in a Saturday news release after a conversation between law enforcement and the group's organizers, \"and the answer is yes! We want this to de-escalate.\" \n Protesters also are not supposed to walk, ride or fly drones north of the bridge, Laney said. Any violation will \"will result in their arrest,\" the statement said. \n The bridge blockade is something that Archambault has been asking to be removed, the Bismarck Tribune reports , and something he said he would to talk to Dalrymple about when they meet in person.

{"date": "December 4, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. President-elect Donald Trump spoke Friday, Dec. 2, with the president of Taiwan, a move that will be sure to anger China. It is highly unusual, probably unprecedented, for a U.S. president or president-elect to speak directly with a leader of Taiwan, a self-governing island the U.S. broke diplomatic ties with in 1979. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Friday, Dec. 2, 2016 photo released by Taiwan Presidential Office Saturday, Dec. 3, 2016, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump through a speaker phone in Taipei, Taiwan. \n BEIJING >> Was President-elect Donald Trump signaling a shift in U.S.-China relations when he referred to Taiwan's leader as \"president\" following a phone call this past week or was it an unintentional misstep? \n His phone conversation with Tsai Ing-wen was a breach of long-standing tradition that risks enmity from China, but a longtime China watcher says he can't yet be sure of the meaning. \n Douglas Paal, a former director of the American Institute in Taiwan, which unofficially represents U.S. interests in Taipei, said it was too soon to judge whether Trump was going to lead that shift, or if the incident was just a \"complicated accident.\" \n \"Beijing will watch closely to see which it is,\" said Paal, now vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"But until someone from Trump Tower explains further, it is unknowable.\" \n The U.S. shifted diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in 1979. But the governments in Washington and Taipei have maintained close unofficial ties and deep economic and defense relations. The U.S. is required by law to provide Taiwan with weapons to maintain its defense, and since 2009, the Obama administration has approved $14 billion in arms sales to Taiwan. \n Trump's conversation with Tsai drew an irritated, although understated, response from China, as Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Saturday that the contact was \"just a small trick by Taiwan\" that he believed would not change U.S. policy toward China, according to Hong Kong's Phoenix TV. \n \"The one-China policy is the cornerstone of the healthy development of China-U.S. relations and we hope this political foundation will not be interfered with or damaged,\" Wang was quoted as saying. Chinese officials said they lodged a complaint with the U.S. and reiterated a commitment to seeking \"reunification\" with the island, which they consider a renegade province. \n The call was the starkest example yet of how Trump has flouted diplomatic conventions since he won the Nov. 8 election. He has apparently undertaken calls with foreign leaders without guidance customarily given by the State Department, which oversees U.S. diplomacy. \n \"President-elect Trump is just shooting from the hip, trying to take phone calls of congratulatory messages from leaders around the world without consideration for the implications,\" said Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \n Vice President-elect Mike Pence said Sunday that the phone call shouldn't necessarily be interpreted as a shift in U.S. policy. He shrugged off the attention to the incident as media hype. \n \"It was a courtesy call,\" Pence told NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \n Over the decades, the status of Taiwan has been one of the most sensitive issues in U.S.-China relations. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory to be retaken by force, if necessary, if it seeks independence. It would regard any recognition of a Taiwanese leader as a head of state as unacceptable \n Taiwan split from the Chinese mainland in 1949. The U.S. policy acknowledges the Chinese view over sovereignty, but considers Taiwan's status as unsettled. \n Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said Trump's conversation does not signal any change to long-standing U.S. policy on cross-strait issues. Yet the phone conversation prompted mixed reactions. \n Yang Chih-kai, a 22-year-old university student in New Taipei City, said the call raised Taiwanese hopes for a stronger relationship with the United States. \n \"People will think that the U.S. will keep on helping Taiwan protect itself against China's threat,\" Yang said. \n Taiwanese newspapers ran banner headlines Sunday about the call, and two noted on their front pages Sunday that Trump referred to Tsai as \"the president of Taiwan,\" a formulation that would be a huge shift in American policy and infuriate China. \n The Taiwanese presidential office said Trump and Tsai discussed issues affecting Asia and the future of U.S. relations with Taiwan. \"The (Taiwanese) president is looking forward to strengthening bilateral interactions and contacts as well as setting up closer cooperative relations,\" the statement said. \n Tsai also told Trump that she hoped the U.S. would support Taiwan in its participation in international affairs, the office said, in an apparent reference to China's efforts to isolate Taiwan from global institutions such as the United Nations. \n Taiwan's presidential office spokesman, Alex Huang, said separately that Taiwan's relations with China and \"healthy\" Taiwan-U.S. relations can proceed in parallel. \"There is no conflict\" in that, he said. \n China's foreign ministry said Beijing lodged \"solemn representations\" with the U.S. over the call. \n \"It must be pointed out that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory,\" Geng Shuang, a ministry spokesman, said in a statement. \"The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing China.\" \n China is likely to be trying to identify whether this signals any intent on the part of Trump to alter long-standing U.S. policy toward Taiwan, Glaser said. \n \"They will hope that this is a misstep, but I think privately, they will definitely seek to educate this incoming president and ensure that he understands the sensitivity of Taiwan,\" she said. \n After the phone conversation Friday, Trump tweeted that Tsai \"CALLED ME.\" He also groused about the reaction to the call: \"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Lai reported from Taipei, Taiwan. Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire in New York, Matthew Pennington and Darlene Superville in Washington, and Nomaan Merchant and news researcher Henry Hou in Beijing contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Was Trump's Taiwan contact a policy shift or a misstep?"}

The organization focuses on people with physical, developmental and economic challenges. \n \"With every person our crew engages with, we get one step closer to growing a global movement of people who share a common passion of malama aina,\" said Kalepa Baybayan, navigator and captain for Hokulea's sail through Florida. \n \"Miami will be a critical break for our team as we create and engage in conversations with people who nurture and inspire stewardship for our Mother Earth,\" he said, according to a news release from the Polynesian Voyaging Society. \n Hokulea is moored at Shake-a-Leg Marina and will offer free tours of the Hawaiian voyaging canoe. \n Shake-a-Leg clients will have a chance to meet Hokulea's crew, learn about its mission and hear inspiring stories of its voyage. The nonprofit offers therapeutic sailing and water sports as well as environmental lessons, so its mission dovetails well with Hokulea's. \n Hokulea's crew will also meet with Florida schools and members of the Miccosukee and Seminole Nations. Representatives of those tribes welcomed Hokulea to Everglades National Park in March, before the canoe spent nine months sailing up and down the East Coast. \n Miami is the last stop on the 25th leg of Hokulea's worldwide journey, which began in Virginia where the vessel was in dry dock. It will re-provision in Miami and prepare for the next leg of its journey. \n In about three weeks, a new crew will sail Hokulea to Key West before heading back into the Caribbean and on to the Panama Canal. \n To follow the Malama Honua Worldwide Voyage, visit http://hokulea.com/track-the-voyage. \n ", "author": "By Star-Advertiser staff", "title": "Hokulea arrives in Miami"}
