They're targeting Republican lawmakers whose constituents may now be at risk of losing health insurance. \n The initial goal is to stop Congress from repealing the law without simultaneously passing a replacement for some 20 million people covered through subsidized private health insurance and expanded Medicaid. \n Called \"Protect Our Care,\" the group brings together organizations that helped pass the Affordable Care Act, also known as \"Obamacare.\" \n On the list are the NAACP, liberal advocacy groups like Families USA and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Service Employees International Union, which represents many health care workers, and the Center for American Progress, a think tank closely aligned with the Obama White House. \n Coordinating the group's activities will be Leslie Dach, a former Wal-Mart lobbyist who served as a top adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell in the Obama administration. \n \"Repeal and Delay is no better than repeal. American families deserve to know what will happen to them before Congress acts,\" the coalition said in a statement. \n Republicans, who are considering first voting on repeal and then passing a replacement later, say their goal is a smooth transition to a system that will provide access for all Americans with fewer government requirements. The effective date of the repeal legislation would be delayed by months or years to give lawmakers time to figure out a replacement. But after six years trying to undo President Barack Obama's signature law, Republicans have not reached consensus on what their replacement would look like. \n \"It is highly irresponsible to move forward with repeal alone,\" said Ron Pollack, head of Families USA, and an organizer of the coalition. \n A recent poll found that only about 1 in 4 people want President-elect Donald Trump to entirely repeal the health law. The post-election survey by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation underscored the nation's deep political divisions over health care. Thirty percent want to expand what the law does, 26 percent want it completely repealed, 19 percent say it should be implemented as is, and 17 percent say it should be scaled back. \n The poll found some skepticism about repealing the law first and replacing it later. Forty-two percent of those who want the law repealed said lawmakers should wait until they figure out the details of a replacement plan before doing so. \n A study earlier this week estimated up to 30 million people would be at risk of losing coverage, because a repeal-only approach could destabilize the entire health insurance market for people who don't have job-based coverage, not just those who buy their policies through HealthCare.gov. \n Republicans say there's no turning back for them. \n \"Obamacare isn't fixable,\" House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas said in a recent interview. But he added that Republicans want a replacement that provides affordable health care, and will allow an appropriate transition period. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New coalition will push back on repeal of Obama health law"}

He was best known for his albums honoring King David Kalakaua. \n Hawaiian music legend Palani Vaughan died Thursday at the age of 72. \n Vaughan, inducted into the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame in 2008, is best known for albums honoring King David Kalakaua. \n He formed the \"King's Own\" and began to study, compose, publish, record, and perform tributes to Kalakaua and Hawaii's monarchy, recording four albums in the 1970s and early 1980s in honor of Kalakaua. \n Producing the albums himself, Vaughan released the Ia 'Oe E Ka La series on his own label. The third was voted Best Traditional Album and Best Produced recording in 1978 for the Na Hoku Hanohano Awards; and the fourth volumn earned him Male Vocalist of the Year in 1981. \n Vaughan's family said in a written statement: \"Our Vaughan \u02bbOhana is grateful for everyone\u02bbs love and support and are focusing on spending time together. \n \"Beyond his accomplishments and the music he shared that the world could enjoy, he was our makuakane, the most loving grandfather, our Papalani, and a caregiver to his parents and so many. \n \"He loved his people, our ali\u02bbi, and these islands. He was steadfast and dignified to the last in land disputes, and for our l\u0101hui Hawai\u02bbi. \n \"He was a great teacher nurtured by great teachers, and touched so many with his music, his words, his spirit. He was selfless, ha\u02bbaha\u02bba, believed in prayer, loved and cared for our k\u016bpuna. He listened to their voices on the wind, shared their lessons, and ensured they will always be heard and carried on.\" \n Vaughan was easily recognizable, sporting a mustache and thick mutton chops a la Kalakaua most of his life. But in his early years as a performer, he was fresh-faced and clean-shaven. \n It was at the University of Hawaii that Vaughan and classmate Peter Moon planned to record an album together. \n In 1967, Don McDiarmid Jr. produced the \"Meet Palani Vaughan & The Sunday Manoa,\" with singer Vaughan and Sunday Manoa founding members Peter Moon and Cyril Pahinui on ukulele and slack key guitar, and Albert \"Baby\" Kalima Jr. on bass. \n Vaughan's first solo album, \"Hawaiian Love Songs,\" released in 1970, \"positioned him as the likely successor to the late Alfred Apaka as the romantic golden voice of Hawaii, Honolulu Star-Bulletin entertainment writer John Berger wrote in 2007 when the album was re-released. \n \"But Vaughan chose to put his personal commitment to honoring the legacy of King Kalakaua ahead of commercial success,\" Berger wrote.  \n The album was a collection of mostly popular hapa haole standards, and \"Vaughan does a wondrous job with all of them,\" Berger wrote, including \"My Little Grass Shack,\" as a laid-back ballad rather than an up-tempo hula number, and a Kaua I Ka Huahau'i,\" (\"Hawaiian War Chant), as a seductive Hawaii love song. \n Born May 27, 1944, Frank Palani Vaughan Jr. went on to become a central figure in the Hawaiian Renaissance. \n Vaughan's most important legacy as a songwriter and recording artist is his four-album series honoring Kalakua. The standard portrayal of Kalakaua in the 1960s and early 1970s had been of a carefree \"Merrie Monarch\" whose primary interests had been drinking and parties. Vaughan's albums corrected the politically driven misrepresentation of Kalakaua's character and documented his commitment to preserving and perpetuating traditional Hawaiian culture, embracing modern technology, and defending the Hawaiian people. \n Vaughan's commitment to publicizing Kalakaua's true legacy ended his own career as a mainstream showroom entertainer but it was a sacrifice he made willingly \u2014 and continued to make in the decades that followed. While the third and fourth \"Ia 'Oe E Ka La\" albums received Hoku Awards, he received the Hawai'i Academy of Recording Arts Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006. \n ", "author": "By Leila Fujimori lfujimori@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Hawaiian music legend Palani Vaughan dies"}

Authorities were searching Thursday, Dec. 8, 2016, for a small plane with four people on board missing in the narrow, mountainous valley believed to be part of the airplane's flight path. \n ANCHORAGE, Alaska >> Debris believed to be from a small plane carrying four people that's missing in Alaska was found Thursday in a lake near where the aircraft took off from, an official said. \n Searchers in a boat found the debris floating on Lake Clark, National Park Service spokesman John Quinley said, \n He said the items are believed to belong to the occupants of the Piper PA-28 Cherokee, which took off from Port Alsworth Wednesday. The community is situated on the banks of the 50-mile-long lake. \n In an interview with The Associated Press, Quinley didn't describe the type of debris, but he said no wreckage of the aircraft had been found. \n He said he had no new information on the status of the missing occupants. \n Crews early Friday were to resume their search of the site, situated in Lake Clark National Park and northeast of Port Alsworth. \n Quinley said the families of the missing have been notified. \n Earlier Thursday, Nate Sobie, manager of the True North Aviation flight school in Port Alsworth who rented the plane to the party, declined to identify those on board. Sobie said he has been assisting in the search. \n \"The one comment I would have is, just let me ask everyone for prayers at this time as we search for the missing people and that they can return safely home,\" he said. \n The plane left Port Alsworth about 10 a.m. Wednesday and was due around noon in Anchorage 170 miles to the northeast. \n Responders say the search has been hampered by fog and darkness at Lake Clark Pass, a narrow river valley believed to be part of the aircraft's flight path. \n The plane is owned by Glen Alsworth Sr. and his family, but it's on loan to the aviation business. Alsworth said the community of about 200 was named after his family, adding that his father homesteaded there in 1944. \n Responders also have not released the names of the people on board. \n Searchers found no indication of any emergency locator beacon being activated in the area, Alaska Air National Guard Staff Sgt. Edward Eagerton said. \n Night was falling when the search was launched late Wednesday with an HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter and two C-130 transport planes, he said. \n Beside the darkness, searchers ran into fog at Lake Clark Pass. \n \"Imagine you're flying in a valley between mountains that are covered in snow and then it's foggy,\" he said. \"Eventually, you lose the ability to know how close you are to things.

{"date": "December 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n South Korean President Park Geun-hye. Once called the \"Queen of Elections\" for her ability to pull off wins for her party, Park has been surrounded in the presidential Blue House in recent weeks by millions of South Koreans who have taken to the streets in protest. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> South Korean lawmakers on Friday voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye, a stunning and swift fall for the country's first female leader amid protests that drew millions into the streets in united fury. \n Once formal documents are handed over to the presidential Blue House later Friday, Park will be stripped of her power and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn will assume leadership until the country's Constitutional Court rules on whether Park must permanently step down. \n The court has up to 180 days to decide. Park will be formally removed from office if six of the court's nine justices support her impeachment, and the country would then hold a presidential election within 60 days. \n National Assembly speaker Chung Sye-kyun said the bill on Park's impeachment was passed by a vote of 236 for and 56 opposed, with 9 invalid votes and abstentions. That well surpassed the necessary two-thirds support in the 300-seat assembly. The opposition needed help from members of Park's party to get the needed votes, and it got it. \n Relatives of the victims from a 2014 ferry disaster that killed more than 300 and was blamed in part on government incompetence and corruption, who were in the parliament observing the vote, cheered and clapped after the outcome was announced. Most lawmakers left the hall quietly, though some could be seen taking selfies as they waited to vote. \n Once called the \"Queen of Elections\" for her ability to pull off wins for her party, Park has been surrounded in the presidential Blue House in recent weeks by millions of South Koreans who have taken to the streets in protest. They are furious over what prosecutors say was collusion by Park with a longtime friend to extort money from companies and to give that confidante extraordinary sway over government decisions. \n Her approval ratings had plunged to 4 percent, the lowest among South Korean leaders since democracy came in the late 1980s, and even elderly conservatives who once made up her political base have distanced themselves from her. An opinion survey released Thursday showed about 78 percent of respondents supported Park's impeachment. \n South Korean lawmakers last voted to impeach a president in 2004, when they accused late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun of minor election law violations and incompetence. The court restored Roh's powers about two months later, ruling that his wrongdoings weren't serious enough to justify his unseating. \n The chances of the court reinstating Park are considered low because her charges are much graver. However, some legal experts say the court might need more than a couple of months to decide. This is because Park's case is much more complicated than Roh's, and because her lawyers will likely press the court not to uphold the impeachment unless the suspicions against her are proven. \n Friday's vote was a remarkable fall for Park, the daughter of slain military dictator Park Chung-hee who convincingly beat her liberal opponent in 2012. Park's single, five-year term was originally set to end Feb. 24, 2018. \n The political turmoil around Park comes after years of frustration over a leadership style that inspired comparisons to her father's. Critics saw in Park an unwillingness to tolerate dissent as her government cracked down on press freedom, pushed to dissolve a leftist party and allowed aggressive police suppression of anti-government protests, which saw the death of an activist in 2016. \n She also was heavily criticized over her government's handling of the 2014 ferry sinking, a disaster partially blamed on official incompetence and corruption. \n Park has repeatedly apologized over the public anger caused by the latest scandal, but has denied any legal wrongdoings. She attempted to avoid impeachment last month by making a conditional offer to step down if parliament comes up with a stable power-transfer plan, but the overture was dismissed by opposition lawmakers as a stalling ploy. \n Talking with leaders of her conservative ruling party on Tuesday, Park said she would make \"every available effort\" to prepare for the court's impeachment review. \n In indicting Park's longtime friend, Choi Soon-sil, and two former presidential aides last month, state prosecutors said they believed the president was \"collusively involved\" in criminal activities by the suspects. Choi and the two former aides were accused of bullying large companies into providing tens of millions of dollars and favors to foundations and businesses Choi controlled, and enabling Choi to interfere with state affairs. \n Park's lawyer has called the accusations groundless and said she would only cooperate with an independent probe led by a special prosecutor. \n Park first met Choi in the 1970s, around the time Park was acting as first lady after her mother was killed during a 1974 assassination attempt on her father. Choi's father, a shadowy figure named Choi Tae-min who was a Buddhist monk, a religious cult leader and a Christian pastor at different times, emerged as Park's mentor. \n The Choi clan has long been suspected of building a fortune by using their connections with Park to extort companies and government organizations. Choi's ex-husband is also a former close aide of Park's. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "South Korean president is impeached in stunning fall"}

{"date": "December 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Ronald Bert Smith Jr.. Smith was pronounced dead at 11:05 p.m. after a lethal injection at the state prison in southwest Alabama. He heaved and coughed for 13 of the execution's 30 minutes, clenching his fists and raising his head early on. \n ATMORE, Ala. >> A man convicted of killing a convenience store clerk more than two decades ago in Alabama was put to death Thursday night, the state's second execution this year. \n Ronald Bert Smith Jr., 45, was pronounced dead at 11:05 p.m. after a lethal injection at the state prison in southwest Alabama. He heaved and coughed for 13 of the execution's 30 minutes, clenching his fists and raising his head early on. \n A prison guard performed two consciousness checks before administering the lethal drugs. During the first one, Smith moved his arm. \n U.S. Supreme Court justices twice paused the execution as Smith's attorneys argued for a delay, saying a judge shouldn't have been able to impose the death penalty when a jury recommended he receive life imprisonment. \n Four liberal justices said they would have halted the execution, but five were needed to do so. \n Smith was convicted of capital murder in the Nov. 8, 1994, shooting death of Huntsville store clerk Casey Wilson. A jury voted 7-5 to recommend a sentence of life imprisonment, but a judge overrode that recommendation and sentenced Smith to death. \n Wilson was pistol-whipped and then shot in the head during the robbery, court documents show. Surveillance video showed Smith entering the store and recovering spent shell casings from the bathroom where Wilson was shot, according to the record. \n Smith's attorneys had urged the nation's highest court to block the planned execution to review the judge's override. \n Smith's lawyers argued a January decision that struck down Florida's death penalty structure because it gave too much power to judges raises legal questions about Alabama's process. In Alabama, a jury can recommend a sentence of life without parole, but a judge can override that recommendation to impose a death sentence. Alabama is the only state that allows judicial override, they argued. \n \"Alabama is alone among the states in allowing a judge to sentence someone to death based on judicial fact finding contrary to a jury's verdict,\" attorneys for Smith wrote Wednesday. \n Lawyers for the state argued in a court filing Tuesday that the sentence was legally sound, and that it is appropriate for judges to make the sentencing decision. \n \"A juror's sentencing decision is likely to be the only decision about criminal punishment he or she will ever make, and it will come at the end of an emotionally draining trial, which will often be the first and only such trial a juror will have seen,\" lawyers for the state wrote. \n Judge Lynwood Smith, now a federal judge, sentenced Smith to death. He likened the killing to an execution, saying the store clerk was beaten into submission before being shot in the head in a crime that left an infant fatherless. In overriding the jury's recommendation, the judge also noted in court records that, unlike many other criminal court defendants, Ronald Smith came from a middle-class background that afforded him opportunities. \n In a clemency petition to Gov. Robert Bentley, Smith's lawyers said he was an Eagle Scout at 15 and was the son of a NASA contract employee whose life spiraled downward because of alcoholism and emotional scars from an abusive home environment. \n Smith had a final meal of fried chicken and french fries and was visited during the day by his parents and son. \n Alabama has been attempting to resume executions after a lull caused by a shortage of execution drugs and litigation over the drugs used. \n The state executed Christopher Eugene Brooks in January for the 1993 rape and beating death of a woman. It was the state's first execution since 2013. Judges stayed two other executions that had been scheduled this year. \n ", "author": "", "title": "Alabama executes man convicted of killing store clerk"}

{"date": "December 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence react to supporters during a rally. \n WASHINGTON >> Donald Trump's campaign spent about $94 million in its final push for the White House, according to new fundraising reports filed Thursday. \n The Republican continued his campaign-long trend of spending far less than Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Her campaign blew through almost $132 million in its closing weeks, according to reports filed Thursday with the Federal Election Commission. The latest reports cover Oct. 20 through Nov. 28. \n Over the course of the primary and general elections, the Trump campaign raised about $340 million. That included $66 million that the billionaire businessman contributed from his own pocket. The Clinton campaign, which maintained a longer and more concerted fundraising focus, brought in about $581 million. \n Brad Parscale, Trump's digital director who was empowered with spending decisions across the campaign, credited strategic last-minute investments with helping propel the political newcomer to victory. \n Specifically, he told The Associated Press, the campaign and Republican Party spent about $5 million in get-out-the-vote digital advertising targeted in the final few days to Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida. That proved critical; some of those states were won by razor-thin margins. \n \"You think, what if we hadn't spent that?\" Parscale said. \"We might not have won.\" \n Another investment that he said paid dividends was $7 million to air a two-minute \"closing\" television commercial. \"Our movement is about replacing the failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American people,\" he said as images from his rallies rolled across the screen. \n The final FEC report showed the extent of the Trump advertising splurge. The campaign spent nearly $39 million on last-minute TV ads and another $29 million on digital advertising and consulting work done by Parscale's firm. \n Clinton's campaign placed a far greater emphasis than Trump on television advertising, a more traditional way of reaching swaths of voters. She spent $72 million on TV ads and about $16 million on internet ads in the final weeks. \n The former secretary of state also spent more than $12 million on travel \u2014 about double what Trump spent. Clinton, who not only had a money advantage over Trump but a staffing edge, spent more than $4 million on a nearly 900-strong payroll. \n Still, Clinton's top campaign aides have acknowledged in post-election appearances that it didn't always spend money in the right places. \n Her campaign manager Robby Mook said at a gathering of political strategists and journalists last week at Harvard University that he regretted not putting more staff in Michigan. When the state certified its results \u2014 20 days after the election\u2014 Trump had won by just under 11,000 votes. \n Outside groups that spent money on the presidential election also filed reports Thursday. \n Trump got help from the super political action committees Future 45, Make America Number 1 and Rebuilding America Now. \n Future 45 and a partner nonprofit that does not disclose donors spent late in the campaign but became Trump's biggest outside investors. Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, together gave $10 million to Future 45 in the final weeks of the campaign, the new reports show. \n Former wrestling executive Linda McMahon, who Trump named this week as head of the Small Business Administration, gave $1 million to the group in October. She'd earlier given $6 million to Rebuilding America Now. \n Make America Number 1 benefited from a $1 million donation by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, now an executive on the Trump transition team. \n On Clinton's side, Priorities USA \u2014 which raised and spent more than any super PAC in history \u2014 landed $16 million in the final weeks of the campaign. That brought its total haul to about $192 million. \n Some of the group's final seven-figure contributions came from its most loyal donors: media mogul Haim Saban and investors James Simons and Donald Sussman. \n The 2016 election is over \u2014 but the fundraising continues. \n The president-elect has raised millions of dollars since Nov. 8. That money is coming in mostly through purchased merchandise such as hats and ornaments and is paying for Trump's \"thank you\" tour, which took him to Ohio and Iowa on Thursday. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Julie Bykowicz and Chad Day on Twitter: https://twitter.com/bykowicz and https://twitter.com/ChadSDay \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Right to the end, Trump campaign spent less than Clinton's"}

{"date": "December 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Astronaut John Glenn piloted the \"Friendship 7\" Mercury spacecraft, as seen in a Feb. 20, 1962 photo, during his historic flight as the first American to orbit the Earth. Glenn has died at 95. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Mercury astronaut John Glenn, and his wife, Annie, rode in the back of an open car with Vice-President Johnson during a Feb. 1962 parade in Glenn's honor in Washington. Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, died today, at the age of 95. \n WASHINGTON >> John Glenn, whose 1962 flight as the first U.S. astronaut to orbit the Earth made him an all-American hero and propelled him to a long career in the U.S. Senate, died Thursday. The last survivor of the original Mercury 7 astronauts was 95. \n Glenn died at the James Cancer Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, where he was hospitalized for more than a week, said Hank Wilson, communications director for the John Glenn School of Public Affairs. \n John Herschel Glenn Jr. had two major career paths that often intersected: flying and politics, and he soared in both of them. \n Before he gained fame orbiting the world, he was a fighter pilot in two wars, and as a test pilot, he set a transcontinental speed record. He later served 24 years in the Senate from Ohio. A rare setback was a failed 1984 run for the Democratic presidential nomination. \n His long political career enabled him to return to space in the shuttle Discovery at age 77 in 1998, a cosmic victory lap that he relished and turned into a teachable moment about growing old. He holds the record for the oldest person in space. \n More than anything, Glenn was the ultimate and uniquely American space hero: a combat veteran with an easy smile, a strong marriage of 70 years and nerves of steel. Schools, a space center and the Columbus airport were named after him. So were children. \n The Soviet Union leaped ahead in space exploration by putting the Sputnik 1 satellite in orbit in 1957, and then launched the first man in space, cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, in a 108-minute orbital flight on April 12, 1961. After two suborbital flights by Alan Shepard Jr. and Gus Grissom, it was up to Glenn to be the first American to orbit the Earth. \n \"Godspeed, John Glenn,\" fellow astronaut Scott Carpenter radioed just before Glenn thundered off a Cape Canaveral launch pad, now a National Historic Landmark, to a place America had never been. At the time of that Feb. 20, 1962, flight, Glenn was 40 years old. \n With the all-business phrase, \"Roger, the clock is operating, we're underway,\" Glenn radioed to Earth as he started his 4 hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds in space. Years later, he explained he said that because he didn't feel like he had lifted off and it was the only way he knew he had launched. \n During the flight, Glenn uttered a phrase that he would repeat frequently throughout life: \"Zero G, and I feel fine.\" \n \"It still seems so vivid to me,\" Glenn said in a 2012 interview with The Associated Press on the 50th anniversary of the flight. \"I still can sort of pseudo feel some of those same sensations I had back in those days during launch and all.\" \n Glenn said he was often asked if he was afraid, and he replied, \"If you are talking about fear that overcomes what you are supposed to do, no. You've trained very hard for those flights.\" \n Glenn's ride in the cramped Friendship 7 capsule had its scary moments, however. Sensors showed his heat shield was loose after three orbits, and Mission Control worried he might burn up during re-entry when temperatures reached 3,000 degrees. But the heat shield held. \n Even before then, Glenn flew in dangerous skies. He was a fighter pilot in World War II and Korea who flew low, got his plane riddled with bullets, flew with baseball great Ted Williams and earned macho nicknames during 149 combat missions. And as a test pilot he broke aviation records. \n The green-eyed, telegenic Marine even won $25,000 on the game show \"Name That Tune\" with a 10-year-old partner. And that was before April 6, 1959, when his life changed by being selected as one of the Mercury 7 astronauts and instantly started attracting more than his share of the spotlight. \n Glenn in later years regaled crowds with stories of NASA's testing of would-be astronauts, from psychological tests \u2014 come with 20 answers to the open-ended question \"I am\" \u2014 to surviving spinning that pushed 16 times normal gravity against his body, popping blood vessels. \n But it wasn't nearly as bad as coming to Cape Canaveral to see the first unmanned rocket test. \n \"We're watching this thing go up and up and up \u2026 and all at once it blew up right over us, and that was our introduction to the Atlas,\" Glenn said in 2011. \"We looked at each other and wanted to have a meeting with the engineers in the morning.\" \n In 1959, Glenn wrote in Life magazine: \"Space travel is at the frontier of my profession. It is going to be accomplished, and I want to be in on it. There is also an element of simple duty involved. I am convinced that I have something to give this project.\" \n That sense of duty was instilled at an early age. Glenn was born July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, and grew up in New Concord, Ohio, with the nickname \"Bud.\" He joined the town band as a trumpeter at age 10 and accompanied his father one Memorial Day in an echoing version of \"Taps.\" In his 1999 memoir, Glenn wrote \"that feeling sums up my childhood. It formed my beliefs and my sense of responsibility. Everything that came after that just came naturally.\" \n His love of flight was lifelong; John Glenn Sr. spoke of the many summer evenings he arrived home to find his son running around the yard with outstretched arms, pretending he was piloting a plane. Last June, at a ceremony renaming the Columbus airport for him, Glenn recalled imploring his parents to take him to that airport to look at planes whenever they passed through the city: \"It was something I was fascinated with.\" He piloted his own private plane until age 90. \n Glenn's goal of becoming a commercial pilot was changed by World War II. He left Muskingum College to join the Naval Air Corps and soon after, the Marines. \n He became a successful fighter pilot who ran 59 hazardous missions, often as a volunteer or as the requested backup of assigned pilots. A war later, in Korea, he earned the nickname \"MiG-Mad Marine\" (or \"Old Magnet A \u2014 ,\" which he sometimes paraphrased as \"Old Magnet Tail.\") \n \"I was the one who went in low and got them,\" Glenn said, explaining that he often landed with huge holes in the side of his aircraft because he didn't like to shoot from high altitudes. \n Glenn's public life began when he broke the transcontinental airspeed record, bursting from Los Angeles to New York City in three hours, 23 minutes and 8 seconds. With his Crusader averaging 725 mph, the 1957 flight proved the jet could endure stress when pushed to maximum speeds over long distances. \n In New York, he got a hero's welcome \u2014 his first tickertape parade. He got another after his flight on Friendship 7. \n That mission also introduced Glenn to politics. He addressed a joint session of Congress, and dined at the White House. He became friends with President Kennedy and ally and friend of his brother Robert. The Kennedys urged him to enter politics, and after a difficult few starts he did. \n Glenn spent 24 years in the U.S. Senate, representing Ohio longer than any other senator in the state's history. He announced his impending retirement in 1997, 35 years to the day after he became the first American in orbit, saying, \"There is still no cure for the common birthday.\" \n Glenn returned to space in a long-awaited second flight in 1998 aboard the space shuttle Discovery. He got to move around aboard the shuttle for far longer \u2014 nine days compared with just under five hours in 1962 \u2014 as well as sleep and experiment with bubbles in weightlessness. \n In a news conference from space, Glenn said, \"To look out at this kind of creation out here and not believe in God is to me impossible.\" \n NASA tailored a series of geriatric-reaction experiments to create a scientific purpose for Glenn's mission, but there was more to it than that: a revival of the excitement of the earliest days of the space race, a public relations bonanza and the gift of a lifetime. \n \"America owed John Glenn a second flight,\" NASA Administrator Dan Goldin said. \n Glenn would later write that when he mentioned the idea of going back into space to his wife, Annie, she responded: \"Over my dead body.\" \n Glenn and his crewmates flew 3.6 million miles, compared with 75,000 miles aboard Friendship 7. \n Shortly before he ran for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination, a new generation was introduced to astronaut Glenn with the film adaptation of Tom Wolfe's book \"The Right Stuff.\" He was portrayed as the ultimate straight arrow amid a group of hard-partying astronauts. \n Glenn said in 2011: \"I don't think any of us cared for the movie 'The Right Stuff'; I know I didn't.\" \n Glenn was unable to capitalize on the publicity, though, and his poorly organized campaign was short-lived. He dropped out of the race with his campaign $2.5 million in the red \u2014 a debt that lingered even after he retired from the Senate in 1999. \n He later joked that except for going into debt, humiliating his family and gaining 16 pounds, running for president was a good experience. \n Glenn generally steered clear of campaigns after that, saying he didn't want to mix politics with his second space flight. He sat out the Senate race to succeed him \u2014 he was hundreds of miles above Earth on Election Day \u2014 and largely was quiet in the 2000 presidential race. \n He first ran for the Senate in 1964 but left the race when he suffered a concussion after slipping in the bathroom and hitting his head on the tub. \n He tried again in 1970 but was defeated in the primary by Howard Metzenbaum, who later lost the general election to Robert Taft Jr. It was the start of a complex relationship with Metzenbaum, whom he later joined in the Senate. \n For the next four years, Glenn devoted his attention to business and investments that made him a multimillionaire. He had joined the board of Royal Crown Cola after the aborted 1964 campaign and was president of Royal Crown International from 1967 to 1969. In the early 1970s, he remained with Royal Crown and invested in a chain of Holiday Inns. \n In 1974, Glenn ran against Metzenbaum in what turned into a bitter primary and won the election. He eventually made peace with Metzenbaum, who won election to the Senate in 1976. \n Glenn set a record in 1980 by winning re-election with a 1.6 million vote margin. \n He became an expert on nuclear weaponry and was the Senate's most dogged advocate of nonproliferation. He was the leading supporter of the B-1 bomber when many in Congress doubted the need for it. As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, he turned a microscope on waste and fraud in the federal bureaucracy. \n Glenn said the lowest point of his life was 1990, when he and four other senators came under scrutiny for their connections to Charles Keating, the notorious financier who eventually served prison time for his role in the costly savings and loan failure of the 1980s. The Senate Ethics Committee cleared Glenn of serious wrongdoing but said he \"exercised poor judgment.\" \n The episode was the only brush with scandal in his long public career and didn't diminish his popularity in Ohio. \n Glenn joked that the only astronaut he was envious of was his fellow Ohioan: Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon. \n \"I've been very fortunate to have a lot of great experiences in my life and I'm thankful for them,\" he said in 2012. \n In 1943, Glenn married his childhood sweetheart, Anna Margaret Castor. They met when they were toddlers, and when she had mumps as a teenager, he came to her house, cut a hole in her bedroom window screen, and passed her a radio to keep her company, a friend recounted. \n \"I don't remember the first time I told Annie I loved her, or the first time she told me,\" Glenn would write in his memoir. \"It was just something we both knew.\" He bought her a diamond engagement ring in 1942 for $125. It's never been replaced. \n They had two children, Carolyn and John David. \n He and his wife, Annie, split their later years between Washington and Columbus. Both served as trustees at their alma mater, Muskingum College. Glenn spent time promoting the John Glenn School of Public Affairs at Ohio State University, which also houses an archive of his private papers and photographs. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "John Glenn, the 1st American to orbit Earth, has died at 95"}

{"date": "December 8, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A room inside a funeral home in Saginaw, Mich., as seen on Jan. 25. According to a study by the government released today, life expectancy in the United States has fallen for the first time in more than 20 years. \n NEW YORK \u00bb A decades-long trend of rising life expectancy in the U.S. could be ending: It declined last year and it is no better than it was four years ago. \n In most of the years since World War II, life expectancy in the U.S. has inched up, thanks to medical advances, public health campaigns and better nutrition and education. \n But last year it slipped, an exceedingly rare event in a year that did not include a major disease outbreak. Other one-year declines occurred in 1993, when the nation was in the throes of the AIDS epidemic, and 1980, the result of an especially nasty flu season. \n In 2015, rates for 8 of the 10 leading causes of death rose. Even more troubling to health experts: the U.S. seems to be settling into a trend of no improvement at all. \n \"With four years, you're starting to see some indication of something a little more ominous,\" said S. Jay Olshansky, a University of Illinois-Chicago public health researcher. \n An American born in 2015 is expected to live 78 years and 9\u00bd months, on average, according to preliminary data released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An American born in 2014 could expect to live about month longer, and even an American born in 2012 would have been expected to live slightly longer. In 1950, life expectancy was just over 68 years. \n The United States ranks below dozens of other high-income countries in life expectancy, according to the World Bank. It is highest in Japan, at nearly 84 years. \n The CDC report is based mainly on 2015 death certificates. There were more than 2.7 million deaths, or about 86,000 more than the previous year. The increase in raw numbers partly reflects the nation's growing and aging population. \n It was led by an unusual upturn in the death rate from the nation's leading killer, heart disease. Death rates also increased for chronic lower lung disease, accidental injuries, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, kidney disease and suicide. \n The only clear drop was in cancer, the nation's No. 2 killer. \n Experts aren't sure what's behind the stall. Some, like Olshansky, suspect obesity, an underlying factor in some of the largest causes of death, particularly heart disease. \n But there's also the impact of rising drug overdoses and suicides, he noted. \"There are a lot of things happening at the same time,\" he said. \n Some years the CDC later revises its life expectancy estimate after doing additional analysis, including for its 2014 estimate. \n Average life expectancy declined for men, falling by more than two months, to 76 years and 3 \u00bd months in 2015. It fell by about one month for women, to 81 years and 2 \u00bd months, the CDC said. \n Death rates increased for black men, white men, white women, and slightly for Hispanic men and women. But they did not change for black women. \n The new CDC report did not offer a geographic breakdown of 2015 deaths, or analysis of death based on education or income. But other research has shown death rates are rising sharply for poorer people \u2014 particularly white people \u2014 in rural areas but not wealthier and more highly educated and people on the coasts. \n \"The troubling trends are most pronounced for the people who are the most disadvantaged,\" said Jennifer Karas Montez, a Syracuse University researcher who studies adult death patterns. \n \"But if we don't know why life expectancy is decreasing for some groups, we can't be confident that it won't start declining for others,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. life expectancy falls as many kinds of death increase"}
