Trees and power lines had fallen, causing thousands of customers, mostly in Multnomah County, to lose power, according to Portland General Electric. \n Portland Fire & Rescue tweeted Friday night that preliminary numbers show the department responded to 378 emergencies between midnight Friday and 7:30 p.m. Authorities say 65 of those calls were power-related and 59 were falls on ice. \n The National Weather Service also issued an ice storm warning and winter storm warning for much of the Columbia River Gorge through the early morning hours on Saturday and said travel in that area would be extremely difficult. \n In Washington, transportation officials temporarily closed the eastbound lanes of Interstate 90 Friday near Cle Elum after multiple crashes and spin-outs. \n A winter storm warning was issued through Saturday afternoon for that area encompassing Southeast Washington and Northeast Oregon with sleet and freezing rain to mix with light snow expected. \n The warning includes Interstate 90 and U.S. Highway 12 along Snoqualmie Pass and White Pass. \n On Thursday evening, Portland's transit service said two light rail lines were disrupted because of ice on overhead power wires. At least one line of bus service was canceled, and others traveled with chains on snow routes. Cars crept along roads and some spun out as they tried to navigate curves. \n Freezing rain also hit Vancouver, Washington, Thursday and over 3 inches of snow fell at the state Capitol in Olympia by Thursday evening. \n Many school districts canceled classes before the first flurries fell. \n Joey Moffenbeier, 12, went sledding with some friends on a hill at the high school in Lake Oswego, a Portland suburb. \n \"We've been waiting all day for the snow and it finally started, so we decided to come out,\" he said. \"We've been getting some good rides in but we need a little bit more to make it really good.\" \n Some children, unaccustomed to snow, weren't wearing gloves and had only sweatshirts on in temperatures that dipped below freezing \u2014 but they didn't let that stop the fun. \n A group of older boys played soccer on a school's field. They were joined by some friends and the soccer snow match turned into a snowball fight. \n \"We're just out here having fun. It's so uncommon for us to have snow here,\" Colin Hardy, 15, said. \"The snow day got called early, too, so we were all ready for a day off.\" \n Portland city government also closed, as did federal court, the zoo and state offices in several counties. \n National Weather Service meteorologist Matthew Cullen said as much as 10 inches of snow could fall in the Gorge, particularly from Cascade Locks toward Hood River. \n Wintry weather also swept through Central Oregon. \n In Bend, snow fell steadily and ducks swam among ice floes in the Deschutes River. \n The Columbian reported that two people were injured when trees fell into houses \u2014 one in Vancouver and another in Camas. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n AP reporters Andrew Selsky contributed to this story from Bend and Lisa Baumann and Phuong Le from Seattle.

{"date": "December 9, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky spoke on Capitol in Washington on Thursday. \n WASHINGTON >> With less than hour to spare, the Senate late today backed legislation averting a government shutdown as coal-state Democrats retreated on long-term health care benefits for retired miners but promised a renewed fight for the working class next year. \n The vote was 63-36 and sent the stop-gap spending bill to President Barack Obama for his signature ahead of a midnight deadline. \n It came hours after Democrats dropped threats to block the measure in hopes of using the shutdown deadline to try to win a one-year respite for 16,500 miners facing the loss of health care benefits at year's end. Instead, the legislation provides benefits at a cost of $45 million for four months. \n Democrats evoked President-elect Donald Trump, a working class hero in coal country, in pressing for more benefits. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a potential member of the Trump Cabinet, led the fight of coal-state Democrats. \n But House Republicans were unrelenting \u2014 and had already vacated the Capitol for a three-week holiday \u2014 forcing Democrats to concede. Manchin acknowledged Friday night that he did not have the votes to block the bill, but said \"the fight will continue\" next year. \n \"I'm born into a family of coal miners. If I'm not going to stand up for them, who is?\" he asked reporters. \n Manchin was meeting with Trump on Monday. \n The fight gave Democrats, who suffered devastating election losses a month ago at the hands of working-class voters, a chance to cast themselves and not the GOP as the champion of the common man. Manchin was joined by other coal-state Democrats who face re-election in 2018 in states Donald Trump won last month, including Pennsylvania and Ohio. \n \"We're just getting warmed up,\" said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., vowing a fight next year. \"These miners and their families kept their promise, put their lives at risk. \u2026 It's not too difficult for a senator or House member to keep a promise.\" \n The dispute over health benefits and a separate fight over controversial legislation to shift more of California's scarce water resources to inland farmers were the final battles of a two-year session marked by constant quarreling. It was capped by a burst of productivity on legislation to authorize hundreds of water projects, repair Flint, Michigan's lead-tainted water system, and keep the government running through April. \n Congress will take a break before reconvening on Jan. 3 to get a swift start on repealing key elements of the Affordable Care Act and confirming Trump's Cabinet. \n The underlying funding bill would keep the government running through April 28 to buy time for the incoming Trump administration and Congress to wrap up more than $1 trillion in unfinished agency budget work. It also provides war funding, disaster aid for Louisiana and other states, and an expedited process for considering Trump's nominee for defense secretary, retired Gen. James Mattis. \n The trucking lobby won permanent relief from recent Transportation Department rules mandating more rest and overnight breaks for long-haul drivers, though the White House and Main Street Republicans were denied in a bid to revive the Export-Import Bank's ability to approve export financing deals exceeding $10 million. \n The miners' issue had history. Seventy years ago, President Harry S. Truman guaranteed a lifetime of health and pension benefits for retired miners to avert a strike. \n Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the four-month extension was better than nothing. McConnell himself represents thousands of miners in the struggling coal industry and said he tried to get a longer solution in talks with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \n \"Would I have preferred that provision to be more generous? Of course I would have,\" the Republican said in a speech on the Senate floor. \n The House had left town on Thursday, creating a dynamic in which the Senate had little choice but to adopt the stopgap measure. Both the funding measure and a water projects bill passed there by sweeping bipartisan votes. \n Democratic opponents of the popular water projects bill, led by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., assailed provisions to divert more water to corporate farmers. A vote to overcome a filibuster of that measure, which would also clear the way for long-delayed funding of $170 million to help Flint, Michigan, to fix its lead-tainted water system, was to follow action on the stopgap spending bill. \n Democrats griped that GOP negotiators on the water bill dumped a permanent \"Buy America\" provision requiring U.S.-produced steel be used in water projects. But that effort lost steam Friday. \n The spending bill also would provide $7 million to reimburse the New York Police Department for the cost of security around Trump Tower in Manhattan, far less than the $35 million the city requested. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this story. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Shutdown averted, Senate backs stop-gap spending bill"}

{"date": "December 9, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n On Friday, Dec. 9, 2016, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Giuliani has removed his name from consideration for a cabinet position in the Trump administration. \n WASHINGTON >> Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani formally withdrew from consideration for a post in President-elect Donald Trump's administration Friday, putting an end to his ill-fated bid to lead the State Department. \n Giuliani's prospects to serve as secretary of state had already dimmed, in part because of questions about his overseas business ties. Trump is now seriously considering Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for the post, with Mitt Romney still in the mix. \n The deliberations have divided Trump's senior advisers, with some bluntly warning in public that tapping Romney would anger the president-elect's loyal supporters. Trump himself has sent mixed messages about Romney in recent days, according to people who have spoken with him, suggesting in some conversations that Romney isn't getting the job and saying in others that he is still in contention. \n The president-elect is said to be intrigued by the prospect of filling the diplomatic post with an international businessman. Tillerson has led Exxon since 2006, a period when record high oil prices and record corporate profits helped make it the most valuable public company in the world. He rose to prominence through the company's Russian energy business and was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship last year. \n Giuliani, a loyal Trump supporter throughout the presidential race, quickly emerged as a top contender for secretary of state. But his financial ties, as well as his public campaigning for the job, are said to have given Trump pause. \n The former mayor said he removed himself from consideration on Nov. 29. \n \"The whole thing was becoming kind of very confusing and very difficult for the president-elect,\" Giuliani said on Fox News. \"My desire to be in the Cabinet was great, but not that great.\" \n After leaving the government, Giuliani advised foreign political figures and worked for lobbying and security firms whose clients have had complicated relationships with the U.S. government. While not personally involved in lobbying, Giuliani spent years at firms that represented governments and multinational companies. He also made speeches demanding the State Department remove an Iranian opposition group from a U.S. terror blacklist. \n In a statement Friday, Trump said Giuliani would have been an \"outstanding member of the Cabinet in several roles.\" Incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who is seen inside the transition team as favoring Romney, said the former mayor was vetted for possible conflicts and \"passed with flying colors.\" \n Kellyanne Conway, Trump's senior adviser, said Giuliani's decision to remove himself from consideration was a \"mutual decision\" with the president-elect. Conway has been an outspoken critic of Romney, publicly warning Trump that his supporters would feel betrayed if he tapped the 2012 Republican nominee for the prominent and powerful Cabinet post. \n Romney had blasted Trump as a \"fraud\" who was playing the American public \"for suckers.\" But he emerged from a private dinner with Trump last week \u2014 their second meeting since the election \u2014 full of praise for the president-elect. \n Still, Trump moved to expand his pool of contenders following that meeting. He met this week with Tillerson in New York this week and has also had discussions with Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. \n Some Trump advisers had hoped Giuliani would be interested in being nominated for Homeland Security secretary, where they believed his financial ties would not be as much of a concern. But Giuliani made clear he was only interested in the diplomatic post. \n Friday's announcement means several of Trump's most ardent campaign supporters will not be joining his administration. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has said he doesn't plan to have a formal role. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was initially seen as a contender for a few posts, but is expected to be left empty-handed. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Giuliani removes himself from State Department consideration"}

Obama has ordered intelligence officials to conduct a broad review on the election-season hacking that rattled the presidential campaign and raised new concerns about foreign meddling in U.S. elections, a White House official said today. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb President Barack Obama has ordered intelligence officials to conduct a broad review of election-season cyberattacks, including the email hacks that rattled the presidential campaign and raised fresh concerns about Russia's meddling in U.S. elections, the White House said today. \n The review, led by intelligence agencies, will be a \"deep dive\" into a possible pattern of increased \"malicious cyber activity\" timed to the campaign season, White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. The review will look at the tactics, targets, key actors and the U.S. government's response to the recent email hacks, as well as incidents reported in past elections, he said. \n The president ordered up the report earlier this week and asked that it be completed before he leaves office next month, Schultz said. \n \"The president wanted this done under his watch because he takes it very seriously,\" he said. \"We are committed to ensuring the integrity of our elections.\" \n U.S. intelligence officials accused Russia of hacking into Democratic officials' email accounts in an attempt to interfere with the presidential campaign. The Kremlin rejected the accusations. \n In the months leading up to the election, email accounts of Democratic Party officials and a top Hillary Clinton campaign aide were breached, emails leaked and embarrassing and private emails posted online. Many Democrats believe the hackings benefited Republican Donald Trump's bid. Trump has downplayed the possibility that Russia was involved. \n Schultz said the president sought the probe as a way of improving U.S. defense against cyberattacks and was not intending to question the legitimacy of Trump's victory. \n \"This is not an effort to challenge the outcome of the election,\" Schultz said. \n Obama's move comes as Democratic lawmakers have been pushing Obama to declassify more information about Russia's role, fearing that Trump, who has promised a warmer relationship with Moscow, may not prioritize the issue. \n Given Trump's statements, \"there is an added urgency to the need for a thorough review before President Obama leaves office next month,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee. If the administration doesn't respond \"forcefully\" to such actions, \"we can expect to see a lot more of this in the near future,\" he said. \n The White House said it would make portions of the report public and would brief lawmakers and relevant state officials on the findings. \n It emphasized the report would not focus solely on Russian operations or hacks involving Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and Democratic National Committee accounts. Schultz stressed officials would be reviewing incidents going back to the 2008 presidential campaign, when the campaigns of Sen. John McCain and Obama were breached by hackers. \n Intelligence officials have said Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney were targets of Chinese cyberattacks four years later. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama orders review of election-season hacking"}

Trump repeatedly vilified the prestigious Wall Street bank on the campaign trail, yet with the selection of Cohn, he has now chosen three of its alumni to key positions in his upcoming administration. \n Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, and Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist and senior counselor, also worked at Goldman Sachs. \n The National Economic Council helps to coordinate domestic and global issues, providing economic policy advice to the president and monitoring how the White House's agenda is implemented across the government. \n If Cohn accepts the nomination, he will also be the third Goldman executive to run the NEC. Robert Rubin was the NEC director under Bill Clinton, and Stephen Friedman had the job during George W. Bush's administration. \n The two people informed of the decision spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the expected move. \n Raised in Ohio, Cohn took a more circuitous path to Goldman. \n He graduated jobless from American University in Washington, D.C., and moved back into his parents' home, according to a speech he gave at his alma mater. Cohn quickly found work at U.S. Steel to appease his father, only to pivot to a Wall Street job within a few months that eventually led him to Goldman in 1990. \n During the campaign, Trump repeatedly attacked his rivals over their Goldman ties. \n He criticized GOP primary opponent Ted Cruz for taking loans from the bank, where Cruz's wife worked, to help pay for his Texas Senate race in 2012. And he chided Clinton for accepting large speaking fees from Goldman and for not publicly sharing what she had told the bankers. \n \"I know the guys at Goldman Sachs,\" Trump said at a South Carolina rally in February, when he was locked in a fierce battle with Cruz. \"They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.\" \n Trump even featured video of Goldman chief executive Lloyd Blankfein in a campaign ad with the voiceover, \"Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors.\" \n But Trump appears to have since changed his tune. \n In a Dec. 9 speech in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump said, \"I want people that made a fortune.

Sainovski said in the town of Kirakira on the island, the quake damaged a hospital, a church and other buildings including the World Vision office. She said 20 people were evacuated from a hospital. \n She said the quake had caused some power failures throughout the country. \n Micha Maghe, World Vision's water sanitation and health project coordinator in Kirakira, said the quake had been terrifying. \n \"When I got outside I could hear children crying, people shouting,\" she said in a statement. \"We assembled at a school and I saw people moving towards high ground. \u2026 People just panicked and were frightened.\" \n Sainovski said there continued to be a number of aftershocks and power cuts. \n Tsunami warnings for several Pacific islands, including Hawaii, were canceled Friday after authorities determined the earthquake didn't pose a broad tsunami threat. \n The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit about 120 miles southeast of Honiara and about 68 kilometers (42 miles) from Kirakira. \n The epicenter was relatively deep at 30 miles below the surface.

In 2010, he published a book called \"Job Creation: How it Really Works and Why Government Doesn't Understand It.\" \n \"Andy will fight to make American workers safer and more prosperous by enforcing fair occupational safety standards and ensuring workers receive the benefits they deserve, and he will save small businesses from the crushing burdens of unnecessary regulations that are stunting job growth and suppressing wages,\" President-elect Trump said in a statement. \n Puzder, in the same statement, said he was honored \"to help President-elect Trump restore America's global economic leadership.\" \n The Californian was one of Trump's earliest campaign financiers, serving as a co-chairman of his California finance team and organizing fundraisers well before most major donors got on board with the eventual Republican nominee. Together with his wife, Puzder contributed $150,000 in late May to Trump's campaign and Republican Party partners, fundraising records show. \n As one of Trump's most outspoken defenders, Puzder frequently appeared on cable news and Twitter to talk up the benefits of having a business leader in the White House. \n A week after Trump's election, Puzder said he agreed with Trump's aim to ease business regulations. \n \"We've reached the point where overregulation is doing meaningful damage to our businesses,\" he said last month at the Restaurant Finance & Development Conference in Las Vegas, citing high labor costs, increased health care costs and \"political and social\" policies as hindrances. \n Union leaders decried Puzder as a secretary who would look out for millionaires \u2014 but not workers. \n AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement that Puzder's \"business record is defined by fighting against working people.\" \n Incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said there's reason to be skeptical about Puzder. \n \"Turning the Labor Department over to someone who opposes an increase in the minimum wage, opposes the overtime rule that would raise middle class wages, and whose businesses have repeatedly violated labor laws might be the surest sign yet that the next cabinet will be looking out for the billionaires and special interests, instead of America's working class,\" Schumer said in a statement. \n Trump's selection won praise from the National Retail Federation, however. \n \"Andrew Puzder is someone with the real-world experience to understand workforce issues and how jobs are created,\" said David French, NRF's senior vice president for government relations. \n Trump's recent appointments have reflected his desire to turn to business leaders \u2014 who also were campaign donors. Trump tapped former WWE chief executive and top campaign contributor Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration. He also selected his campaign's national finance chairman Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and hedge fund investor, as Treasury secretary. \n Puzder visited with Trump several times since the election, including a meeting Wednesday afternoon at Trump Tower. \n He has long been a reliable GOP donor. He was a major financier for 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney and has remained close to him. At Romney's annual donor summit in June, Puzder was one of just a few attendees who aggressively promoted Trump to the dozens who were more squeamish about their party's new star. \n He told The Associated Press at the Republican National Convention in late July that he enjoyed the challenge of raising money for Trump, saying he often sought common ground with reluctant GOP donors by talking up Trump's children. \n \"If he's such an evil villain,\" Puzder said he would tell would-be donors, \"how do you explain the kids?\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump picks fast food executive Andrew Puzder for Labor"}

Carter on Friday, Dec. 9, made an unannounced visit to Afghanistan to consult with military commanders and deliver a pre-holiday pep talk to U.S. troops. \n KABUL, Afghanistan >> Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Friday that the United States will stick with Afghanistan for years to come. \n \"America is and will remain committed to a sovereign and secure Afghanistan,\" Carter said in a joint appearance with President Ashraf Ghani during his final visit to the country as head of the Pentagon. \n It is Carter's last planned trip to Afghanistan before handing off his Defense Department responsibilities to his designated successor, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis. \n The U.S. has about 10,000 troops in Afghanistan to train and advise Afghan security forces combatting a resilient Taliban insurgency. U.S. special operations forces are hunting down al-Qaida and Islamic State militants. \n Carter's visit comes amid concerns that despite improvements in Afghan government defenses, Taliban forces are gaining leverage and are continuing to use neighboring Pakistan as a sanctuary. By U.S. estimates, the Afghan government controls slightly less than two-thirds of the country's population. \n The Taliban holds sway over about 10 percent, and the remainder of the population is \"contested.\" \n U.S. commanders have praised Afghan soldiers for taking the lead in battles against the less-well equipped Taliban, but they have been suffering heavy casualties across the country. \n Prior to Carter's arrival, his press secretary, Peter Cook, said Carter wants to get a full rundown on operations. \"In his meetings with senior Afghan officials, the secretary will discuss the growing capabilities and resilience demonstrated by Afghan security forces in recent months,\" Cook said. \"He will also discuss ongoing efforts to continue building Afghan combat capacity including aviation.\" \n President Barack Obama had planned to reduce U.S. troop numbers to about 1,000 by the time he left office in January, but he scrapped that approach in the face of Taliban gains. \n The U.S. military has been in Afghanistan since it led an invasion force in October 2001 to overthrow the Taliban regime. The U.S. has suffered more than 2,200 deaths in Afghanistan, including more than 1,800 killed in action, since the war began. \n President-elect Donald Trump has not said how he will approach the Afghanistan problem but has denounced what he calls U.S. nation-building projects. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Defense Secretary Carter makes surprise visit to Afghanistan"}

{"date": "December 9, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Mourners carry the casket of Karina Vetrano from St. Helen's Church following her funeral in the Howard Beach section of the Queens borough of New York. With a DNA profile, but no name to match it in the search for her killer, prosecutors are now seeking permission to try an emerging approach: using the DNA to search for the killer's relatives. \n NEW YORK >>With a DNA profile but no suspect to match in the strangling of a woman who went for a run and met a killer, authorities are looking to an emerging approach: using the DNA to look for the killer's relatives. \n The technique, known as familial DNA searching, has made inroads in some U.S. states and other countries in the last decade, leading to both high-profile arrests and civil-liberties qualms. \n Now, New York state officials plan to discuss Friday whether to introduce it, after a request from prosecutors and police yearning for a lead in the case of 30-year-old runner Karina Vetrano. \n Authorities see the technique as a powerful, precise investigative tool. And to Vetrano's family, the case for the search is clear. \n \"Our only goal in life is to find out who did this to our daughter,\" said her mother, Cathy Vetrano. \"So if there's any method available to do that, we want it done.\" \n But critics view the technique as a DNA dragnet that can single out otherwise law-abiding people for scrutiny due to family ties. \n \"A policy that implicates New Yorkers in a criminal investigation solely because they are related to someone with DNA in the state's databank is a miscarriage of justice,\" said Donna Lieberman, the New York Civil Liberties Union's executive director. \n Ten states, including California, Texas and Florida, conduct familial DNA testing. Ohio just Monday announced its first effort yielded an arrest in the kidnapping and rape a 6-year-old girl and the attempted abduction of a 10-year-old girl. \n But at least two jurisdictions, Maryland and the District of Columbia, have prohibited the practice. \n Authorities have long worked to identify suspects by matching crime scene evidence to convicted offenders' DNA. Familial DNA testing goes further, seeking people similar enough to be closely related to whoever left the crime scene DNA. \n Investigators can then explore whether such people have family members who fits as suspects. If so, they need other evidence, possibly a match to a suspect's own DNA, to bring charges. \n Familial DNA famously led to an arrest in Los Angeles' \"Grim Sleeper\" serial killings, which spanned from 1985 to 2007. Lonnie Franklin Jr. was convicted and sentenced to death this year. \n After Vetrano's beaten body was found Aug. 2 in a marshy park in her quiet Queens neighborhood, investigators developed a DNA profile of the probable attacker from material under Vetrano's fingernails and on her neck and phone, but it didn't match anyone in law enforcement DNA databases. \n Meanwhile, police chased 85 tips, interviewed runners, looked for clues in Vetrano's personal life and examined surveillance video and even panhandling reports from areas nearby. \n \"This tragic murder has been exhaustively investigated using every tool currently available,\" Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said Thursday in asking the state Commission on Forensic Science to authorize familial searching. \n Commissioners intend to discuss the topic at a meeting Friday. It's not clear when or what they'll decide, but spokeswoman Janine Kava said Thursday they'll continue working to provide law enforcement with \"cutting-edge tools\" to solve crimes \"without compromising individual protections.\" \n Concerns about familial DNA searching hit home for New Orleans filmmaker Michael Usry in 2014, when police showed up with a warrant to get his DNA as a possible suspect in a 1996 killing in Idaho. \n A crime scene DNA sample was similar to that of Usry's father, who'd voluntarily given it for a nonprofit genealogy project; police had gotten the data from a website that acquired it. The baffled filmmaker spent a month worrying what would happen before further testing cleared him. \n \"It was a very weird situation,\" he said earlier this year. \n Cases like his trouble the technique's critics. So does the idea of training an investigative lens on offenders in law enforcement databases in order to scrutinize relations with clean records. \n \"We don't subject some people to disparate treatment because of taint of blood,\" says Erin Murphy, a New York University law professor who has studied the issue. \"It's a violation of some of our foundational principles.\" \n Supporters say familial DNA investigations can be structured to pursue only strong leads and do it discreetly. California, for instance, strives to investigate them without letting on to the potential suspects or their family members. \n \"The idea that we're rousting relatives, innocent people, it's a fabrication,\" says Rockne Harmon, a retired California prosecutor and prominent voice for familial DNA searching. \n Cathy Vetrano has her own assessment. \n \"If any person who thinks it's unfair was in this situation,\" she says, \"I think they would be feeling differently.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "NYC runner's killing puts a DNA technique under a microscope"}
