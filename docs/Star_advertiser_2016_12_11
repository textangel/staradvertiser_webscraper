{"date": "December 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson delivered remarks, in March 2015, on the release of a report by the National Petroleum Council on oil drilling in the Arctic, in Washington. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump spoke with members of the military during an Army-Navy NCAA college football game, Saturday, in Baltimore \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Donald Trump today called a recent CIA assessment of Russian hacking \"ridiculous\" and says he's not interested in getting daily intelligence briefings \u2014 an unprecedented public dismissal by a president-elect of the nation's massive and sophisticated intelligence apparatus. \n Trump's remarks come as key congressional Republicans joined Democrats in demanding a bipartisan investigation into the Kremlin's activities and questioned consideration of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson \u2014 who has close business ties with Moscow \u2014 as head of the State Department. \n Asked whether he's rejecting valuable intelligence on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Trump was defiant. \n \"I get it when I need it,\" he said of the top-secret briefings sessions, adding that he's leaving it up to the briefers to decide when a development represents a \"change\" big enough to notify him. \n \"I'm, like, a smart person. I don't have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years,\" Trump said. \n The CIA has concluded with \"high confidence\" that Russia sought to influence the U.S. election on behalf of Trump. The finding alarmed lawmakers, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain who said today he planned to put Sen. Lindsay Graham, a staunch Trump critic, in charge of investigating the claim. \n McCain also has questions about Tillerson's business relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, although it's not clear Tillerson will be nominated. This afternoon, Tillerson had still not been formally offered the job, according to a person with knowledge of the process who spoke on condition of anonymity. \n Exxon steadily expanded its Russian business on Tillerson's watch even as its rivals faced expropriation and regulatory obstacles. In 2013, Putin bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson. \n \"Maybe those ties are strictly commercial and got to do with his business in the oil business. Fine,\" McCain told CBS \"Face the Nation.\" And \"we'll give him a fair hearing. But is it a matter of concern? Certainly it should be a matter of concern.\" \n McCain wasn't alone in raising questions about whether there would be enough blowback to sink a Tillerson nomination. \n \"Being a 'friend of Vladimir' is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryOfState,\" tweeted Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump's former campaign rival and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \n Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Bob Casey said the developments \"raise serious questions about whether the incoming administration will adequately stand up to Russia's aggression.\" \n Trump said Tillerson's relationship with Moscow was a selling point. \n \"A great advantage is he knows many of the players, and he knows them well. He does massive deals in Russia. He does massive deals for the company,\" Trump told \"Fox News\" in an interview broadcast today. He called Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker impressive, and said former bitter rival Mitt Romney is still in the mix. \n \"These are all very different types of people,\" he said. \"But when you ask me about Rex, I mean, he's a world-class player. There's no question about it.\" \n Later today, he Trump tweeted: \"Whether I choose him or not for 'State'- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!\" \n Separately, Trump also rejected the CIA's conclusion that Russia tried to interfere with the presidential election and blamed \"very embarrassed\" Democrats for the public release of the assessment. The Washington Post first reported the CIA finding on Friday. \n \"It's ridiculous,\" Trump said of the CIA's assessment. \n He added, however, that he doesn't necessarily oppose President Barack Obama's order for a review of campaign-season hacking. \"If you're gonna to do that, I think you should not just say 'Russia.' You should say other countries also, and maybe other individuals.\" The White House has said the probe would focus on any breaches by other countries, and past elections. \n Trump's incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus shrugged off allegations that Russia helped Trump win. \n He said: \"The Russians didn't tell Clinton to ignore Wisconsin and Michigan,\" two states she was expected to win that went instead for Trump. \n \"She lost the election because her ideas were bad. She didn't fit the electorate. She ignored states that she shouldn't have and Donald Trump was the change agent,\" Priebus said on ABC's \"This Week.\" Trump's win, he added, \"had nothing to do with the Russians.\" \n Turning to business matters, Trump said he is leaving his worldwide enterprise to his executives and children, vowing, that he will \"have nothing to do with management.\" He's expected to discuss the arrangement at a news conference on Thursday. \n He also said he is \"studying\" the Paris climate agreement to reduce carbon emissions. But he doesn't want the agreement to put the U.S. \"at a competitive disadvantage with other countries.\" \n Trump also departed from Republican orthodoxy by vowing to heavily tax companies that leave the U.S. and then try to sell products here \"like we're a bunch of jerks.\" \n \"That's the dumb market,\" he said. \"I'm a big free trader, but it has to be fair.\" \n Associated Press writers contributing to this report include Ken Thomas in New York, and Julie Pace, Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar and Anne Flaherty in Washington. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump rejects intel, lawmakers vow probe of Russia hacking"}

{"date": "December 11, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n French soldiers shot a canon toward Islamic State militant positions from a coalition forces military base in Qayara, Iraq on Saturday. \n QAYARA AIR BASE, Iraq \u00bb Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition forces have killed or gravely wounded more than 2,000 Islamic State fighters in the battle for Mosul since October, the top U.S. commander in Iraq said today. \n Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend told reporters there are still an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 IS fighters defending Mosul. He applauded the efforts of Iraqi security forces, who began their offensive on Oct. 17 in what has been billed a decisive phase of the anti-IS fight. \n \"By our calculations, we think we have killed or badly wounded over 2,000,\" Townsend said at a joint news conference with U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter at Qayara air base. \n Iraqi security forces have been slowed in their nearly two-month-old offensive against IS, which has occupied Mosul for more than two years. US officials have declined to say how many Iraqi government troops have been killed in the Mosul fight. \n Recapturing the city, Iraq's second-largest, is crucial to the Iraqis' hopes of restoring their sovereignty, although political stability will likely remain a challenge afterward. \n Iraqi forces have only won back a handful of eastern Mosul neighborhoods since launching the offensive in mid-October. They came under mortar fire today as they worked to clear villages along the Tigris River to the south, part of operations to secure supply lines for a campaign that is likely to stretch into the coming year. \n Townsend disputed any suggestion that the Islamic State has managed to fight the Iraqi government forces to a standstill in Mosul. \n After citing the estimated 2,000 IS casualties, he added, \"I don't think that suggests anything about a stalemate. This is a major urban area. Any army on the planet, including the United States Army, would be challenged by this fight.\" \n \"The Iraqi army has come back from near-defeat two years ago, and now they are attacking this major city,\" Townsend said. \"I don't think there is anything in there about a stalemate.\" Mosul is about 250 miles from Baghdad. \n Townsend said U.S. intelligence estimated before the Mosul campaign kicked off that IS had 3,500 to 6,000 fighters in the city. He said the current estimate is 3,000 to 5,000. \n Pentagon chief Carter made an unannounced visit today to the Qayara base, flying in from Baghdad after meeting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and sharing lunch with American troops. It was Carter's first visit to Qayara since it began operating as an Iraqi staging base in October. \n Carter toured the air base, greeting soldiers and offering holiday wishes. He assured them the Mosul campaign is on track. \n \"Everything is going according to the plan of a year ago,\" Carter said. \n On Saturday in Bahrain, Carter announced he is sending another 200 troops to Syria to train and advise local fighters combatting IS. There are already 300 U.S. troops authorized for the Syria effort, and some 5,000 in Iraq. \n Carter told an international security conference in Bahrain that the battle for Mosul and for the Syrian city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the extremists' self-described caliphate, would be crucial for defeating the group, which has claimed attacks worldwide. \n \"The seizure of these two cities is necessary to\u2026put ISIL on an irreversible path to a lasting defeat,\" he said, using another acronym for IS. \n He did not predict how long it might take for Iraqi forces to prevail in Mosul, but he sounded a note of optimism. \n \"This is a complex mission that will take time to accomplish, but I am confident that ISIL's days in Mosul are numbered,\" he said in Bahrain. \n Carter's tenure as defense secretary will end in January if his designated successor \u2014 retired Marine Gen. James Mattis \u2014 is confirmed by the Senate as expected. As his days in office count down, Carter is making the case for keeping U.S. forces in Iraq even after the Islamic State group is dislodged from Mosul. \n \"Beyond security, there will still be towns to rebuild, services to re-establish, and communities to restore,\" he said. The extremists, he predicted, will attempt to survive by reinventing themselves \"in some other shape or form\" after they lose their grip on Iraq and Syria. \n In Baghdad, six separate bombings targeting mostly streets and markets frequented by civilians killed 12 and wounded more than 30 people today, according to Iraqi police and hospital officials. IS claimed responsibility for one of the attacks in southern Baghdad in a statement posted by the group's Amaq news agency. All Iraqi officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to brief the press. \n Left unaddressed by Carter during his visit to Iraq was a possible change in course under President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office next month. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Manu Brabo in Ganus, Iraq and Maamoun Youssef in Cairo contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "2,000 IS fighters killed or gravely wounded in Mosul, U.S. commander says"}
