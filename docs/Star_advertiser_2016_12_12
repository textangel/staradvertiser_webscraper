{"date": "December 12, 2016", "text": "PORTLAND, Ore. >> The U.S. government will push forward with conspiracy charges against the remaining seven people who helped take over a national wildlife refuge in Oregon, just months after the stunning acquittal of the first group of defendants. \n Prosecutors, who faced a Monday deadline to indicate their next move, said they also would proceed with firearms charges against six of the defendants and planned to add lesser counts that could include trespassing or destruction of property. \n That would give jurors the option of a less serious conviction that wasn't available in the earlier case. \n Monday's filing in U.S. District Court in Portland indicates that the government is not backing down despite the Oct. 27 acquittal of the occupation's leaders, brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy, and five others. \n Both groups faced the same charges: felony conspiracy to impede federal officers from doing their job and possession of a firearm in a federal facility. \n But prosecutors appear to be padding their luck with the misdemeanor counts. Those plans make sense, legal experts said, particularly in light of how the first jury saw the case. \n \"I think one of the difficulties of this case always was that the actual felony charges didn't exactly fit what the government theory was and, in an odd way, the misdemeanor charges might,\" said Laurie Levenson, a law professor and former federal prosecutor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. \n \"It gives the jury more options and room to compromise \u2014 and it still sets them up for a conviction,\" she said. \n Those charges also would allow the government to seize any property used in the crimes if the defendants are convicted, said Tung Yin, a criminal law professor at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland. The provision is more commonly used in drug cases to go after property purchased with drug proceeds, he said. \n In this case, the property could include guns, personal vehicles and other belongings the defendants used during the takeover, said Andrew M. Kohlmetz, lawyer for defendant Jason Patrick. \n The government also asked for a 60-day delay for the trial, which was to begin in February, a request opposed by all the defense attorneys, Kohlmetz said. \n The heavily armed occupiers seized the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge on Jan. 2 to protest the imprisonment of two Oregon ranchers convicted for setting fires on public land and demand the federal government turn over public lands to local control. \n The Bundys and other key figures were arrested in a Jan. 26 traffic stop outside the refuge that ended with police fatally shooting Robert \"LaVoy\" Finicum, an occupation spokesman. Most occupiers left after his death, but four holdouts remained until Feb. 11, when they surrendered following a lengthy negotiation. \n Federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case against the first seven defendants, finishing with a display of more than 30 guns seized after the standoff. \n During trial, Ammon Bundy testified that the plan was to take ownership of the refuge by occupying it for a period of time and then turn it over to local officials to use as they saw fit. \n He also said the occupiers carried guns because they would have been arrested immediately otherwise and to protect themselves against possible government attack. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Prosecutors push ahead with trial for last Oregon occupiers"}

{"date": "December 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky spoke during a news conference on Capitol Hill today. \n WASHINGTON >> Congress' top Republicans today endorsed investigations into the CIA's belief that Russia meddled in last month's election to help Donald Trump win, suggesting potential battles ahead with the incoming commander in chief over Moscow and U.S. intelligence. \n \"The Russians are not our friends,\" declared Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as GOP leaders steered toward a path contrasting starkly with the president-elect's belittling dismissal of the spy agency's assessment and his past praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n The Senate's intelligence panel, led by Richard Burr, R-N.C., will conduct a bipartisan inquiry, according to McConnell, who also expressed support for a related probe by the Armed Services Committee, chaired by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Though declining to say whether he believes Russia tried tilting the election toward Trump, McConnell said, \"I hope that those who are going to be in positions of responsibility in the new administration share my view\" about Moscow. \n Shortly afterward, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., released a statement backing an investigation the House Intelligence Committee has already started on cyber threats posed by foreign countries and extremist groups. He called any Russian intervention \"especially problematic because under President Putin, Russia has been an aggressor that consistently undermines American interests.\" \n Underscoring the possible collisions ahead between Trump and the men leading his party in Congress, McConnell and Ryan struck tones markedly more confrontational toward Russia than he has. \n Trump on Sunday called the CIA's contention \"ridiculous\" and blamed the disclosures concerning its assessment on Democrats who he said were embarrassed over losing last month's election. \n The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., released a letter Monday to National Intelligence Director James Clapper complaining that recent reports of the CIA's conclusion clashed with Clapper's prior statement that he lacked \"good insight\" about the connection between Russian hacking of Democratic campaign documents and their release by WikiLeaks. Nunes requested a briefing on the subject for this week. \n The GOP leaders expressed their views after a weekend in which Trump also said he would not need daily intelligence briefings, a staple of presidents' days for decades and a flouting of a convention common for presidential transitions. \n Meanwhile, Trump continued his cavalcade of meetings in his Trump Tower offices in New York on Monday with potential appointees for his new administration and other leading GOP, congressional and corporate figures. Among them was Carly Fiorina, who unsuccessfully vied with Trump this year for their party's nomination. \n Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO, was there to discuss national security issues and is seen by some Trump advisers as a candidate to be director of national intelligence, overseeing the government's 17 intelligence agencies. She chaired an external CIA advisory board under President George W. Bush but has not worked for the federal government. \n Fiorina said her conversation with Trump included \"hacking, whether it's Chinese hacking or purported Russian hacking.\" \n Others meeting with Trump included moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, No. 3 House GOP leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, another GOP presidential contender whom Trump defeated. \n The campaign chairman for defeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton urged the Obama administration Monday to reveal what it knows about any Russian efforts to help Trump win. John Podesta, whose emails were stolen and posted online, said the administration \"owes it to the American people\" to release details of the intrusions, which included the hacking of Democratic Party files. \n Podesta said the Clinton campaigns also supports a call by 10 of the 538 members of the Electoral College for Clapper to provide information that intelligence agencies have gathered on the subject. \n All 10 are unlikely to vote for Trump when the Electoral College meets next Monday. Nine are Democrats, and Texas Republican Chris Suprun has said he won't vote for Trump. \n Other Democrats calling for congressional investigations of Russia's role in the elections include House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. \n \"There must be no equivocation or ignoring the seriousness of the intelligence community's conclusion about Russia's actions,\" she said. \n McConnell said he has \"the highest confidence\" in U.S. intelligence agencies and said it \"defies belief\" that Senate Republicans would be reluctant to scrutinize Russian tactics. He recounted Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, said Baltic nation leaders are nervous about Moscow and pointedly praised NATO, the alliance that Trump criticized repeatedly during his campaign. \n \"I think we ought to approach all of these issues on the assumption that the Russians do not wish us well,\" McConnell said. \n In a nod to the Trump assertion about Democrats' motives, Ryan said the congressional inquiries \"should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election.\" \n As expected, Trump's transition team formally announced he would name Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn, 56, to head the White House National Economic Council. The council provides policy advice to the president. \n Trump's team also said he'd picked Gen. John Kelly to head the Department of Homeland Security. Kelly is a former commander of U.S. Southern Command. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Top GOP leaders back congressional probes of Russia hacking"}

{"date": "December 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump spoke in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Dec. 9. \n WASHINGTON >> The Latest on President-elect Donald Trump (all times EST): \n 7:40 p.m  \n President-elect Donald Trump says he'll announce his pick for secretary of state Tuesday morning. \n Trump revealed his plans Monday night on Twitter. His search for the country's top diplomat has stretched out in a highly public fashion for weeks. \n Trump has been considering former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, once a vocal Trump critic; Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who leads the Foreign Relations Committee; and Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, who met twice with Trump during the past week. \n In an interview with \"Fox News Sunday,\" Trump pointed to Tillerson's deep relations with Moscow as a selling point. As Exxon Mobil's head, Tillerson maintained close ties with Russia and was awarded by President Vladimir Putin with the Order of Friendship, an honor for foreign citizens. \n 7:30 p.m.  \n A federal judge has rejected an attempt to suspend a Colorado law requiring the state's nine electors to vote for the state winner of the presidential election. \n The move delivers a severe setback to a longshot plan by a handful of electors to deny Donald Trump the presidency. Hillary Clinton won Colorado, but some of the state's Democratic electors hoped to join with Republican ones elsewhere to choose another Republican rather than Trump. \n Two of the Colorado electors sued to suspend the state law that requires them to vote for the state winner. They argued it violates their First Amendment rights. \n An attorney for Trump filed papers contending the litigation would undermine the electoral college. \n 6:40 p.m.  \n Donald Trump is postponing this week's planned news conference on the future of his business empire until next month because he wants to ensure that \"proper protocols are put in place.\" \n Sean Spicer, a Trump transition team spokesman, says the legal team needs more time to work out the plan for the Trump Organization. In an interview over the weekend, the president-elect said he would not participate in management nor would he \"do deals\" for his international company, but instead would leave management to his children and company executives. \n Trump had said on Twitter last month that he would hold a \"major news conference\" Dec. 15 to discuss how the company would move forward once he takes office in January. \n But Spicer said in an email Monday, \"With so many iconic properties and successful entities, moving the announcement to January ensures the legal team has ample time to ensure the proper protocols are put in place so his sole focus will remain on the country and achieving his ambitious agenda with the help of the world-class cabinet he has built.\" \n Trump takes office Jan. 20. \n 6:20 p.m.  \n President-elect Donald Trump is postponing until next month a planned announcement on the future of his business empire. \n Trump had said on Twitter that he would discuss his business Thursday. But Trump spokesman Sean Spicer and spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in emails Monday that the event has been rescheduled for January. They did not provide details. \n Trump briefly addressed business conflicts in an interview that aired Sunday on Fox News. He said he would not manage the Trump Organization but left open retaining his ownership stake. He said his children and company executives would run the international business while he is in the White House. \n 5 p.m.  \n Future first lady Melania Trump has attended a hearing in a courthouse in Maryland as part of legal proceedings in a defamation suit. \n Trump lawyer Charles J. Harder says in a statement that Trump attended the 24-minute hearing Monday morning in Montgomery County, Maryland, circuit court. Trump filed the suit in September, alleging that a Maryland blogger and the Daily Mail Online falsely accused her of being involved with an escort agency during her modeling career. \n Harder says Trump was not required to attending the scheduling conference, but did so to show her commitment to the case. \n The Washington Post reports that lawyers for the Daily Mail Online and blogger Webster Tarpley were present. \n 3:05 p.m.  \n President-elect Donald Trump has formally tapped Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn for a top White House economic post. \n Cohn will serve as director of the National Economic Council, heading a department with a key role in policymaking. The post does not require Senate confirmation. \n In a statement, Trump says Cohn will \"put his talents as a highly successful businessman to work for the American people.\" \n Trump was critical of Goldman Sachs during the presidential campaign and lambasted Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for giving paid speeches to the Wall Street giant. But he's now chosen three people with ties to the bank for his administration, including Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, and Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist and senior counselor. \n 2:40 p.m.  \n The White House is shooting down the notion floated by one of President-elect Donald Trump's potential State Department picks that the Obama administration may have framed Russia with false hacking allegations. \n Former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton said over the weekend that the cyber interference in the election might have been a \"false flag\" and left open the possibility it was done by the Obama administration. A false flag is an operation designed to look like it was perpetrated by someone else. \n White House spokesman Josh Earnest says he can rule out that possibility. He says a \"wide range of irresponsible conspiracy theorists\" have floated the theory. \n Bolton has been on Trump's list of potential candidates for secretary of state. Trump's transition team says Bolton is also being considered for another State Department role. \n 1:50 p.m.  \n The White House says the U.S. relationship with Taiwan should not be used as a bargaining chip to increase leverage with China over trade and other issues. \n Over the weekend, President-elect Donald Trump told \"Fox News Sunday\" that he wouldn't feel \"bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.\" \n White House spokesman Josh Earnest says that adhering to a policy of one China has allowed for a close trading partner in Taiwan and a \"constructive relationship\" with China. \n Earnest says efforts to curb global warming and prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon could not have occurred without China's help. \n Earnest says progress benefiting the American people and the Chinese is \"much more difficult if tensions are heightened around our one-China policy.\" \n 1:42 p.m.  \n Hillary Clinton's campaign is backing an effort by members of the Electoral College to request an intelligence briefing on foreign interference in the presidential election. \n Top political aide John Podesta says electors have \"a solemn responsibility under the Constitution\" and should have their questions answered. \n Her campaign is also calling on the Obama administration to declassify information around Russia's role in the election. \n Weekend reports found that some in the intelligence community believe Russia released hacked emails to aide President-elect Donald Trump. A bipartisan group in the Senate is calling for an investigation. \n 1:40 p.m.  \n The White House says it supports an investigation by Congress into the role that Russia played in last month's president election. \n GOP leaders in both chambers say that committees will be looking into cyber threats, even as President-elect Donald Trump has said the recent CIA assertion that Russian hacking had sought to help his candidacy was \"ridiculous.\" \n White House spokesman Josh Earnest says that one of the goals of an intelligence review ordered by President Barack Obama is to compile information that can be presented to Congress. \n Earnest says the congressional review \"is certainly warranted when you consider the stakes and the consequences.\" \n Earnest is also praising intelligence officials, saying the men and women in the intelligence community are \"patriots\" and that the president has benefited enormously from their expertise. \n 1:18 p.m.  \n House Speaker Paul Ryan says the House Intelligence Committee will look into cyber threats such as hacking by Russia of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. \n But the Wisconsin Republican says any investigation \"should not cast doubt on the clear and decisive outcome of this election.\" He also chided those who would exploit the work of the U.S. intelligence community for \"partisan purposes.\" \n Ryan said that Russian interference into the election is \"especially problematic\" since President Vladimir Putin's Russia is an aggressor that undermines U.S. interests. \n Ryan's statement came after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also called for a continuing probe into charges that the Russian government hacked into the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta's email account. \n 12:15 p.m.  \n Former technology executive Carly Fiorina says she has discussed foreign policy and hacking threats with President-elect Donald Trump. \n Fiorina met with her former rival for the GOP presidential nomination Monday in Trump Tower. She said they discussed \"China as probably our most important adversary\" and hacking, \"whether it's Chinese hacking or purported Russian hacking.\" \n Fiorina said Trump has a ripe opportunity to \"literally reset things\" and said he is getting \"fantastic people in his administration.\" She did not respond to questions about whether she is up for a role in his Cabinet. \n During the Republican primary, Fiorina won applause from women on both sides of the aisle when she pushed back on Trump after he suggested her face is unattractive. \n 12:04 p.m.  \n A senior Lockheed Martin official is defending the price tag of the F-35 stealth fighter and said he is ready to answer any questions Donald Trump may have regarding the price tag. \n Jeff Babione, executive vice president and general manager of the F-35 program. said it is the most affordable plane of its kind. \n He spoke Monday after Trump tweeted he'll cut the costs of the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program after he takes office. \n Babione is in Israel as it prepares to receive the first two next-generation F-35 fighter jets. \n 11:48 a.m.  \n A handful of members of the Electoral College are demanding an intelligence briefing on whether the government is investigating links between Trump's campaign and Russia. \n Ten electors released an \"open letter\" to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper requesting information about ongoing investigations on ties between Trump and any Russian government interference in the election. One is a rogue Republican who says he won't vote for president-elect Donald Trump. \n The letter released on the social media site Medium was written by Christine Pelosi, the daughter of top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi of California. Also signing the letter is Chris Suprun, a Texas Republican who says he won't vote for Trump, citing a Federalist paper by Alexander Hamilton that says electors must determine that the president is qualified and independent from foreign influence. \n 11:40 a.m.  \n Donald Trump has spoken with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. \n A statement from Rajoy's office said the prime minister congratulated Trump personally for winning the U.S. election. Rajoy had previously only sent a telegram, shortly after the vote. \n They talked about strengthening bilateral relations and touched on international issues, especially the partnership in fighting jihadism. They also spoke about the consequences of Brexit and the global economic situation. \n Trump's transition team gave no readout on the call. \n 10:05 a.m.  \n Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has strongly condemned any foreign meddling to influence the U.S. election. McConnell spoke to reporters Monday, a day after President-elect Donald Trump said the recent CIA assertion that Russian hacking had sought to help his candidacy was \"ridiculous.\" \n McConnell says that the \"Russians are not our friends\" and condemned Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other \"U.S. political organizations.\" \n The Kentucky Republican says the Senate Intelligence Committee will investigate. He made his remarks as Trump continues to downplay the CIA's confidential assessment that the Russian government hacked into the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta's email account. \n 8:55 a.m.  \n Donald Trump says he'll reduce the costs of the Pentagon's most expensive weapons program \u2014 Lockheed Martin's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter \u2014 after he takes office. \n The president-elect tweeted Monday that the \"F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.\" \n The tweet comes the same day Defense Secretary Ash Carter visited Israel as it prepared to receive the first two next-generation F-35 fighter jets intended to help preserve the country's military edge in the volatile Mideast. \n The F-35 program has an estimated cost of nearly $400 billion. Israel is among a small number of allies to get the plane. \n 8:40 a.m.  \n President-elect Donald Trump is trying to cast new doubt on the CIA's conclusion that Russia tried to interfere in the U.S. presidential election. \n He's tweeting Monday that \"it's very hard to determine who was doing the hacking.\" He adds that if his campaign had lost the election and \"we tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!\" \n That there was hacking in 2016 and previous elections is not in dispute, nor is it a newly-discussed revelation. There's broad agreement from President Barack Obama and lawmakers of both parties on investigations into which countries were responsible, including, but not limited to, Russia. \n Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, who joined Senate Democrats Sunday to call for an immediate bipartisan investigation, said Monday on \"CBS This Morning\" that probes are essential because hacking could be a new form of warfare. \n 7:30 a.m.  \n A top adviser to Donald Trump says the CEO of Exxon Mobil is an attractive candidate for secretary of state in part because he's done business deals with Russia. \n Kellyanne Conway told two television network morning shows Monday that Rex Tillerson has long and appropriate ties with top Russian officials. She says, \"It's not like Vladimir Putin and Rex Tillerson are pounding down vodka at the local bar. They're not intimate friends, but they deal with each other through business interests.\" \n Trump has said that Tillerson's relationships in Russia are part of his appeal as a finalist for secretary of state. Democrats and some Republicans in the Senate have said those ties are a concern. Those comments have raised questions about whether Tillerson can be confirmed. \n Trump has said he expects to make public his choice for the high-profile Cabinet post later this week. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump to name secretary of state pick Tuesday"}

{"date": "December 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Ilann Maazel, lead counsel for the Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein campaign, spoke with members of the media, Dec. 5, outside the federal courthouse in Philadelphia. \n Presidential election recount efforts came to an end today in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, with both states certifying Republican Donald Trump as the winner in contests that helped put him over the top in the Electoral College stakes. \n Trump's victory in Wisconsin was reaffirmed following a statewide vote recount that showed him defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton by more than 22,000 votes. Meanwhile, a federal judge issued a stinging rejection of a Green Party-backed request to recount paper ballots in Pennsylvania's presidential election and scan some counties' election systems for signs of hacking. \n Green Party candidate Jill Stein successfully requested and paid for the Wisconsin recount while her attempts for similar statewide recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan were blocked by the courts. \n Stein got only about 1 percent of the vote in each of the three states that Trump narrowly won over Clinton. Stein argued, without evidence, that voting machines in all three states were susceptible to hacking. All three states were crucial to Trump's victory, having last voted for a Republican for president in the 1980s. \n The numbers barely budged in Wisconsin after nearly 3 million votes were recounted. Trump, a billionaire New York real estate mogul, picked up 162 votes and still won by more than 22,000 votes. The final results changed just 0.06 percent. \n In Pennsylvania, state officials certified the results of the election in the hours following the decision by U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond. \n Trump beat Clinton in the state by about 44,000 votes out of 6 million cast, or less than 1 percent, according to the final tally after weeks of counting provisional and overseas ballots. Green Party voters had petitioned some counties to do partial recounts, affecting few votes, county officials said. \n Diamond said there were at least six grounds that required him to reject the Green Party's lawsuit, which had been opposed by Trump, the Pennsylvania Republican Party and the Pennsylvania attorney general's office. \n Suspicion of a hacked Pennsylvania election \"borders on the irrational\" while granting the Green Party's recount bid could \"ensure that no Pennsylvania vote counts\" given Tuesday's federal deadline to certify the vote for the Electoral College, wrote Diamond, an appointee of Republican former President George W. Bush. \n \"Most importantly, there is no credible evidence that any 'hack' occurred, and compelling evidence that Pennsylvania's voting system was not in any way compromised,\" Diamond wrote. \n He said the lawsuit suffered from a lack of standing, potentially the lack of federal jurisdiction and an \"unexplained, highly prejudicial\" wait before filing last week's lawsuit, four weeks after the Nov. 8 election. \n The decision was the Green Party's latest roadblock in Pennsylvania after hitting numerous walls in county and state courts. Green Party-backed lawyers argue it was possible that computer hackers changed the election outcome and that Pennsylvania's heavy use of paperless machines makes it a prime target. Stein also contended Pennsylvania has erected unconstitutional barriers to voters seeking a recount. \n A lawyer for the Green Party members said today they were disappointed and unable to immediately say whether they would appeal. \n \"But one thing is clear,\" said the lawyer, Ilann Maazel. \"The Pennsylvania election system is not fair to voters and voters don't know if their votes counted, and that's a very large problem.\" \n A federal judge halted Michigan's recount last week after three days.

{"date": "December 12, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., spoke during a Dec. 1 news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Majority Whip Sen. John Cornyn, of Texas, spoke to the media after the Republican policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington on Dec. 6. Republicans are eagerly planning initial votes next month on dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law. \n WASHINGTON \u00bb Republicans are eagerly planning initial votes next month on dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law, a cherished GOP goal. But many worry that while Congress tries to replace it, the party will face ever-angrier voters, spooked health insurers and the possibility of tumbling off a political cliff. \n Republicans have said they first want to vote to unwind as much of the health care law as they can, though it wouldn't take effect for perhaps three years. That's to give them and new President Donald Trump time to write legislation constructing a new health care system \u2014 a technically and politically daunting task that has frustrated GOP attempts for unity for years. \n Underscoring the GOP's many decisions ahead, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters today that the phase-in period \"is yet to be determined.\" He said Republicans \"will work expeditiously to come up with a better proposal than current law.\" \n Many congressional Republicans worry they'd be vulnerable during the transition period between a repeal vote and actually replacing Obama's law with a new system. Twenty million people now covered would face uncertainty about their future benefits, while unsettled health insurers might quickly start boosting premiums or stop selling policies in some areas to protect themselves. \n In both cases, public wrath could be aimed at the party controlling the White House and Capitol \u2014 the GOP. \n \"It's going to be a difficult challenge to pass a replacement\" for Obama's law and make sure some people don't lose coverage, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said. Health insurers will need time to adjust to a new system and if Congress waits until the last minute to enact a new law, \"It's not going to work,\" she said. \n A related fear: Congress and Trump enact legislation dismantling Obama's law but as the clock ticks down to its expiration, the GOP remains divided over replacing it. The political imperative for Republicans to pass something would be overwhelming but with Congress being Congress, there are no guarantees. \n \"When you set up a cliff, you can go over it,\" Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., said. \n Many Republicans insist that won't happen. They view setting an end date on Obama's law as a way to force congressional action on replacing it without hurting consumers. \n \"There needs to be a reasonable transition period so people don't have the rug pulled out from under them,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters last week. \n But in one of many questions dividing Republicans, they differ over what a reasonable transition period means. \n No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, said there will likely be a three-year gap between Congress' votes to repeal Obama's law and when that would actually kick in. \n \"We're not going to let anybody fall through the cracks,\" Cornyn said. \n Other Republicans, particularly in the House, worry that three years is too long to leave voters, insurers and health care providers in suspense. Eager to prevent a drawn-out effort to pass new health care legislation from spinning into a damaging issue for the 2018 campaigns, many want the process to take a year or less. \n \"I hope it's not years with no replacement,\" said Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, who next year will head the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP's political organization. \"Quality matters more than speed, but speed can't be ignored. You don't want the American people to feel too uncomfortable for too long.\" \n Republicans have yet to decide what their replacement will look like. \n Though details are scant, Trump and Ryan have proposed tax breaks to help people pay insurance premiums. Both want to eliminate Obama's mandate that most individuals get coverage and most employers cover workers, but that could be replaced with a requirement that people maintain \"continuous\" coverage or face higher premiums. \n Democrats, who enacted Obama's law in 2010 over solid GOP opposition, have signaled they won't help Republicans demolish it. \n \"Bring it on,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., next year's minority leader, said of GOP repeal efforts. \"They have nothing to put in its place.\" \n Ryan and McConnell say the GOP-controlled Congress plans to pass a procedural measure in January that will let Republicans push repeal legislation through the Senate later with just a simple majority. \n That's important because with the Senate GOP holding a 52-48 majority next year, Democrats would otherwise be able to block a repeal bill unless it gets 60 votes. \n The early procedural vote could also signal that the GOP is intent on repealing Obama's law, while saving the more difficult details for later. \n They are still deciding what that part of the process will look like \u2014 and what their replacement will be. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "After health-care repeal vote, some in GOP fear a cliff"}

The number dwindled to about 10 and Kobayashi said he was eventually the only one left living. \n Many of the Japanese military men died from complications of gunshot wounds and other injuries, explained Kobayashi. He managed to stay alive by eating wild papayas and stealing food from houses he could walk to secretly, and he said the residents began leaving bananas and other food outside for him. \n \"They knew (I) was out there,\" he said through an interpreter. \n Kobayashi had planned to kayak to the cave Monday and go inside with his daughter and granddaughter, but rain and a rough sea prevented the plan. Instead, Kobayashi visited the shoreline closest to the cave, near the University of Guam Marine Laboratory. He was joined by family members and some Guam residents with Japanese ancestry. \n The former aircraft mechanic explained that he thought often of his parents, especially his mother and her homemade mochi, while struggling to survive in the cave. He said through interpreters that he decided that he would honor his mom first rather than the country's emperor if he survived the ordeal. \n Kobayashi said the U.S. soldiers who eventually captured him were nice, providing him with a tasty meal and immediately providing medical care for his gangrenous gunshot wound. \n He said he hopes to come back to the cave again if his health permits it. He also expressed opposition to war, saying that \"it's not good.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Japanese man revisits Guam cave where he hid in World War II"}

American law, however, requires the U.S. to ensure that Taiwan has the means to defend itself and to treat all threats to the island as matters of serious concern. \n China split from Taiwan amid civil war in 1949 and continues to regard the island as a breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland, by force if necessary. \n Geng's comments are the strongest public condemnation China has made of Trump's criticisms of current American policy toward Taiwan. \n Beijing was already angered by Trump's Dec. 2 phone call with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, the first time an American president or president-elect has publicly spoken to a Taiwanese leader in nearly four decades. China considers any reference to a separate Taiwanese head of state to be a grave insult. \n Trump followed the call with two tweets accusing China of manipulating its currency, unfairly taxing American imports and provoking tensions in the South China Sea. \n Over the weekend, he told \"Fox News Sunday\" that he wouldn't feel \"bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.\" \n Trump said his call with Tsai was \"very nice\" and strictly meant to congratulate him on his winning the presidential election. \n \"Why should some other nation be able to say I can't take a call?\" he said. \"I think it actually would've been very disrespectful, to be honest with you, not taking it.\" \n Hours after the interview aired, China's Communist Party-controlled Global Times published a Chinese-language editorial headlined: \"Trump, please listen clearly: 'One China' cannot be traded.\" \n \"China needs to launch a resolute struggle with him,\" the editorial said. \"Only after he's hit some obstacles and truly understands that China and the rest of the world are not to be bullied will he gain some perception.\" \n \"Many people might be surprised at how the new U.S. leader is truly a 'businessman' through-and-through,\" the paper said, referring to Trump's suggestion of using the one-China policy as a bargaining chip. \"But in the field of diplomacy, he is as ignorant as a child.\" \n The Global Times, which is published by the party mouthpiece People's Daily, often runs commentaries that target nationalistic sentiment with provocative language. \n Chinese officials have been more restrained so far. They may be still trying to learn how to make their positions clear to Trump without feeding a vicious cycle of insults and heightened tensions, said Dali Yang, a political science professor at the University of Chicago. \n However, Trump's suggestion that he could negotiate on Taiwan likely went too far for China, Yang said. \n \"He expected for China to bargain again for the one-China position, perhaps by giving up something on trade or something of that nature,\" Yang said. \"This is actually the foundation of the U.S.-China relationship, rather than something to be bargained over.\" \n Associated Press researchers Yu Bing and Liu Zheng contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "China says Trump's Taiwan comments cause 'serious concern'"}
