Steele suggested that Cosby's lawyers were publicizing them in an attempt to intimidate the women. \n McMonagle said many of the women had already gone public with their allegations. \n \"These are witnesses in a trial. They are not children,\" he argued. \n O'Neill ultimately ruled Cosby's lawyers could identify 11 of the women by name since they'd already told their stories publicly. He said two of the women have remained out of the spotlight and shouldn't be identified in court. \n Later, Steele blew up at the defense over the positioning of a projection screen, saying Cosby's lawyers had it placed so the women's names would be seen by dozens of reporters in the courtroom gallery. He again accused the defense of witness intimidation. \n McMonagle said courtroom staff positioned the screen, but he agreed to remove accusers' names from a planned presentation. \n O'Neill said he'd be forced to call in sheriff's deputies if the lawyers couldn't conduct themselves properly. \n The case began a decade ago when Temple University employee Andrea Constand filed a police complaint against Cosby, her friend and mentor, over an encounter at his home. A prosecutor at the time declined to file charges. \n But authorities reopened the case last year after scores of women raised similar accusations and after Cosby's damaging deposition testimony from Constand's lawsuit became public. The trial judge last week said the deposition was fair game at trial, arming prosecutors with Cosby's testimony about his affairs with young women, his use of quaaludes as a seduction tool and his version of the sexual encounter with Constand the night in question. \n Cosby's lawyers had hoped to question the women in person, but O'Neill rejected the idea. \n Some of the women had ongoing friendships or romantic relationships with Cosby \u2014 known as America's Dad for his top-rated family sitcom, \"The Cosby Show,\" which ran from 1984 to 1992 \u2014 while others knew him for only a few days after meeting him on a plane or at a casino. Some, like Constand, took pills knowingly \u2014 she thought it was an herbal drug; he later said it was Benadryl \u2014 while others believe he slipped something stronger in their drinks. \n McMonagle has petitioned to ask each accuser as many as 80 questions. The defense has also questioned the women's motivation, noting many are clients of celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred, who has suggested Cosby should put up a $100 million settlement fund for potential sexual assault and defamation claims. \n Allred told The Associated Press last week that her clients have a duty to testify if the court wants to hear from them. She called the defense's dismissal of their accounts \"out of context or just plain wrong.\" \n O'Neill must walk a fine line in weighing their testimony, given a 2015 state Supreme Court ruling that threw out a Roman Catholic Church official's child-endangerment conviction because the Philadelphia trial judge let too many priest-abuse victims testify about the alleged church cover-up. \n Cosby greeted security officers with a joke before today's hearing, quipping, \"Don't tase me, bro,\" as they wanded him on his way into court. \n The AP doesn't typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they have come forward publicly, as Constand has done. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lawyers clash over use of accusers' names at Cosby hearing"}

Girls! Girls!\" \n STAR-ADVERTISER \n Tom Moffatt at his Ala Moana office, on April 26, amongst memorabilia from local concerts, which he promoted. \n Tom Moffatt \u2014 radio disc jockey, concert promoter and one of the most influential figures in the Hawaii entertainment industry \u2014 died Monday. He was 85. \n Longtime associate Barb Saito, operations manager and vice president of Tom Moffatt Productions, confirmed that Moffatt died Monday night at home after several months of declining health. She described the 35 years she worked with him as \"an amazing ride.\" \n Born Dec. 30, 1930, in Detroit, Moffatt disliked city life and spent most of his teen years working on farms and going to school in small towns outside the Motor City. He came to Hawaii in 1950, enrolled in the University of Hawaii, gravitating toward a career in radio. \n Moffatt was playing jazz on KIKI when he started getting requests for a unknown artist named Elvis Presley. With the station's permission, Moffatt became the first \"rock 'n' roll\" disk jockey in Hawaii and one of the pioneers of modern Top 40 radio. \n Moffatt developed the format with Hawaii-born Ron Jacobs at KHVH, KPOA and finally at KPOI \u2014 possibly the first time that a station's call letters formed a pronounceable word. Moffatt, Jacobs and other deejays became the \"Poi Boys,\" and captivated Hawaii audiences with a seemingly endless series of contests, special events, staged \"feuds\" between Moffatt and Jacobs, and the \"Marathon of Hits\" \u2014 an annual countdown of the most popular songs in Hawaii as voted on by KPOI listeners. KPOI dominated the Hawaii radio market throughout the 1960s. \n Moffatt got involved in concert promotion in the 1950s as an outgrowth of his work in radio. He presented musical revues of the hit artists of the day with the \"Show of Stars\" concerts and then helped open the Honolulu International Center (now the Neal S. Blaisdell Center) with the first in a series of \"Million Dollar Parties.\" In the decades that followed Moffatt presented almost every big name in the music business at least once \u2014 among his biggest productions were mega-concerts by Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson and the Eagles in Aloha Stadium. He also brokered reunion concerts by Cecilio & Kapono, Kalapana and Hui Ohana when conventional wisdom held that the members of the those acts would never work together again. \n Moffatt's involvement in the Hawaii record industry started in the late 1950s. He became a major figure in the Hawaii record industry in the 1970s and 1980s as the head of two labels \u2014 Paradise and Bluewater \u2014 that released Hoku Hanohano Award-winning recordings by Keola & Kapono Beamer, Andy Bumatai, Loyal Garner, the Aliis, the Kasuals, Rap Reiplinger, The Krush, Hui Ohana and Ledward Kaapana. \n Early in his career \u2014 while he was still in his 20s, and for reasons now long forgotten \u2014 Moffatt's teenage fans began calling him \"Uncle Tom\" and dubbed his radio studio as \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" Moffatt said in 2016 that only one person had ever seemed to take offense at the nickname \u2014 an African-American entertainer who arrived from the mainland and wanted to know \"Who this 'Uncle Tom' guy is.\" Prominent kamaaina members of Hawaii's African-American community have said that although a disc jockey's use of the name \"Uncle Tom\" could be problematic elsewhere in the country they found nothing offensive in Moffatt being known as \"Uncle Tom\" in Hawaii. \n Moffatt continued to be active as a concert promoter and radio personality well into his 80s. He returned to radio in the 2000s hosting a Saturday morning program on Kool Gold 107.9 where he entertained listeners with stories about events from the 1950s to present and played songs from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s \u2014 in some cases song that had only been hits in Hawaii. \n Moffatt is survived by his wife, Esther \"Sweetie\" Kealoha Cablay Moffatt, son Troy Moffatt, his brother Norman Moffatt and sister Alice Moffatt. \n Funeral plans are pending. \n ", "author": "By John Berger jberger@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Concert promoter Tom Moffatt, 85, dies"}

Then he walked off, again without talking with reporters. \n He ignored a shouted question about whether he still wants to abolish the Energy Department. \n Perry had his first interview at Trump Tower on Nov. 21, stoking rumors that Trump might find a spot in his administration for a man who, during the GOP primaries, called him a \"cancer on conservatism.\" Perry threw his support to Sen. Ted Cruz, a fellow Texan, as the field narrowed, but eventually came around and served as an enthusiastic campaign surrogate for Trump. \n On Saturday, Perry and Trump met again at the Army-Navy football game. \n Perry was Texas' longest serving governor. He left office in early 2015. \n On his first trek to Trump Tower, last month, speculation raged that Trump was eyeing him for a number of cabinet spots including Defense, Agriculture and Veterans Affairs. Perry was state agriculture commissioner before he became lieutenant governor, and he's an Air Force veteran. Trump aides said afterward that they had discussed homeland and border security and immigration policy, along with military issues and the fight against ISIS. \n Trump ended up picking retired Marine Gen. James Mattis for Pentagon chief. \n Much of the Energy Department's efforts in recent years have been focused on nuclear energy and handling and disposal of fissile material. \n Obama's energy chiefs have been top-rate scientists. The current secretary, Ernest Moniz, who helped negotiate the Iran nuclear deal, is a nuclear physicist who taught at MIT. He succeeded Nobel Prize winner Steven Chu, a Stanford University physicist who previously directed the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. \n ", "author": "By Tribune News Service", "title": "Rick Perry picked to lead Energy Department in Trump Cabinet"}

{"date": "December 13, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson shook hands at a June 2012 signing ceremony of an agreement between state-controlled Russian oil company Rosneft and ExxonMobil at the Black Sea port of Tuapse, southern Russia. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson delivered remarks, in March 2015, on the release of a report by the National Petroleum Council on oil drilling in the Arctic, in Washington. President-elect Donald Trump selected Tillerson to lead the State Department on Tuesday. \n NEW YORK >> President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday he has picked ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state, calling him \"among the most accomplished business leaders and international deal makers in the world.\" \n But Tillerson has close ties to Russia and President Vladimir Putin, which is certain to draw scrutiny and fuel a potential Senate confirmation fight. Leading Republicans have already expressed anxieties as they contend with intelligence assessments saying Russia interfered with the U.S. presidential election to help Trump. \n Trump says he sees Tillerson's ties with Moscow as a selling point, along with his \"vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments.\" \n \"Rex Tillerson's career is the embodiment of the American dream. Through hard work, dedication and smart deal making, Rex rose through the ranks to become CEO of ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest and most respected companies,\" the billionaire real estate mogul said in a pre-dawn news release from Trump Tower in New York. \n Tillerson \"knows how to manage a global enterprise, which is crucial to running a successful State Department,\" Trump said. \n In an accompanying statement, Tillerson said he was \"honored\" by his selection and shares Trump's \"vision for restoring the credibility of the United States' foreign relations and advancing our country's national security.\" \n Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that will hold confirmation hearings in January, called Tillerson \"a very impressive individual\" with \"an extraordinary working knowledge of the world.\" Corker, who had been considered for the secretary of state job, said Trump called him Monday to inform him of the pick. \n Reince Priebus, Trump's incoming chief of staff, said Tuesday that Tillerson was chosen because he is \"a diplomat that happens to be able to drill oil.\" Tillerson has \"had to maintain relationships across the world in many places that aren't the easiest places to have relationships,\" Priebus said on MSNBC. \n \"The good Lord didn't put oil in all freedom-loving democracies across the world and yet Rex Tillerson was able to make this work. Donald Trump and Rex Tillerson, they hit it off and they have a similar vision of how to get things done,\" Priebus said. \n For weeks, Trump has teased out the secretary of state decision process publicly, often exposing rifts in his organization. Besides Corker, he also considered former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, a one-time vocal Trump critic. Romney wrote on Facebook Monday that it \"was an honor to have been considered\" for the job. \n Trump's unconventional Cabinet vetting procedures are in keeping with his presidential style thus far, unconcerned with tradition or business as usual. In recent weeks, he's attacked CIA intelligence, spoken to the leader of Taiwan \u2014 irritating China \u2014 and has continued his late-night Twitter tirades. \n Beijing is looking forward to working with the new secretary of state \"to push forward greater progress of the bilateral relationship on a new starting point,\" China's foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said Tuesday. \n In Washington, a congressional investigation is in the works over a CIA assessment that Russia interfered in the November election on his behalf, a conclusion Trump has called \"ridiculous.\" \n The issue is raising red flags among lawmakers concerned about the sanctity of the U.S. voting system and potentially straining relations at the start of Trump's administration. \n On Twitter Monday, Trump pushed back, saying: \"Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!\" \n Putin, meanwhile, said he was ready to meet with Trump \"at any moment.\" \n In the transcript of his interview with journalists which was released Tuesday in Moscow, Putin said \"it's widely known that the elected president of the United States has publicly called for the normalization of the Russian-American relationship. We cannot but support this.\" Putin added that he thought a meeting with Trump would be more likely after Trump's January inauguration. \n \"We understand it will not be a simple task considering the extent of degradation of the Russian-American relationship,\" he said. \"But we are prepared to do our bit.\" \n If confirmed, Tillerson would face immediate challenges in Syria, where a civil war rages on, and in China, given Trump's recent suggestions that he could take a more aggressive approach to dealing with Beijing. \n A native of Wichita Falls, Texas, Tillerson came to ExxonMobil Corp. as a production engineer straight out of the University of Texas at Austin in 1975 and never left. Groomed for an executive position, Tillerson came up in the rough-and-tumble world of oil production, holding posts in the company's central United States, Yemen and Russian operations. \n Early in the company's efforts to gain access to the Russian market, Tillerson cut a deal with state-owned Rosneft. The neglected post-Soviet company didn't have a tremendous amount to offer, but Exxon partnered with it \"to be on the same side of the table,\" Tillerson said, according to \"Private Empire,\" an investigative history of Exxon by Steve Coll. \n Associated Press writers Laurie Kellman in Washington and Alex Sanz in Atlanta contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Donald Trump picks Rex Tillerson to lead State Department"}

{"date": "December 13, 2016", "text": "Portland, Ore. >> The U.S. government will push forward with conspiracy charges against the remaining seven people who helped take over a national wildlife refuge in Oregon, just weeks after the stunning acquittal of the first group of defendants. \n Prosecutors said they also would proceed with firearms charges against six of the defendants and planned to add lesser counts that could include trespassing or destruction of property. \n That would give jurors the option of a less serious conviction that wasn't available in the earlier case. \n Monday's filing in U.S. District Court in Portland indicates that the government is not backing down despite the Oct. 27 acquittal of the occupation's leaders, brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy, and five others. \n Both groups faced the same charges: felony conspiracy to impede federal officers from doing their job and possession of a firearm in a federal facility. \n But prosecutors appear to be padding their luck with the misdemeanor counts. Those plans make sense, legal experts said, particularly in light of how the first jury saw the case. \n \"I think one of the difficulties of this case always was that the actual felony charges didn't exactly fit what the government theory was and, in an odd way, the misdemeanor charges might,\" said Laurie Levenson, a law professor and former federal prosecutor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. \n \"It gives the jury more options and room to compromise \u2014 and it still sets them up for a conviction,\" she said. \n Those charges also would allow the government to seize any property used in the crimes if the defendants are convicted, said Tung Yin, a criminal law professor at Lewis & Clark Law School in Portland. The provision is more commonly used in drug cases to go after property purchased with drug proceeds, he said. \n In this case, the property could include guns, personal vehicles and other belongings the defendants used during the takeover, said Andrew M. Kohlmetz, lawyer for defendant Jason Patrick. \n The government also asked for a 60-day delay for the trial, which was to begin in February, a request opposed by all the defense attorneys, Kohlmetz said. \n The heavily armed occupiers seized the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge on Jan. 2 to protest the imprisonment of two Oregon ranchers convicted for setting fires on public land and demand the federal government turn over public lands to local control. \n The Bundys and other key figures were arrested in a Jan. 26 traffic stop outside the refuge that ended with police fatally shooting Robert \"LaVoy\" Finicum, an occupation spokesman. Most occupiers left after his death, but four holdouts remained until Feb. 11, when they surrendered following a lengthy negotiation. \n Federal prosecutors took two weeks to present their case against the first seven defendants, finishing with a display of more than 30 guns seized after the standoff. \n During trial, Ammon Bundy testified that the plan was to take ownership of the refuge by occupying it for a period of time and then turn it over to local officials to use as they saw fit. \n He also said the occupiers carried guns because they would have been arrested immediately otherwise and to protect themselves against possible government attack. \n ___ \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Prosecutors push ahead with trial for last Oregon occupiers"}

That would lead to an election to pick her successor. \n If that happens, then the anti-Park lawmakers could try to establish a new political party involving outgoing U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and some liberal opposition politicians. Ban has not said if he would run for president, but opinion polls put him in second place behind Moon Jae-in, a former leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, to replace Park. \n The scandal resolves around allegations that Park allowed her friend of 40 years, Choi Soon-sil, to manipulate government affairs and extort money from businesses. Choi and several top presidential and government officials have been indicted over their alleged roles with the scandal. Park has avoided prosecutors' questioning because she has immunity from prosecution while in office. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Park's impeachment could split South Korea's ruling party"}
