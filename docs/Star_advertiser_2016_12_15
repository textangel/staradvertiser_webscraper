{"date": "December 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n White House press secretary Josh Earnest speaks during the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 15, 2016. Earnest answered questions about Russian hacking, healthcare and other topics. \n WASHINGTON >> President Barack Obama is promising that the U.S. will retaliate against Russia for its suspected meddling in America's election process, an accusation the Kremlin has vehemently denied. \n Amid calls on both sides of the political aisle on Capitol Hill for a full-bore congressional investigation, including assertions President Vladimir Putin was personally involved, Obama said in an interview that anytime a foreign government tries to interfere in U.S. elections, the nation must take action \"at a time and place of our own choosing \u2014 and we will.\" \n \"Some of it may be explicit and publicized, some of it may not be,\" he told NPR News Thursday. \"But Mr. Putin is well aware of my feelings about this, because I spoke to him directly about it.\" \n White House officials said it was \"fact\" that Russian hacking helped Donald Trump's campaign against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Administration officials on Thursday also assailed Trump himself, saying he must have known of Russia's interference. \n No proof was offered for any of the accusations, the latest to unsettle America's uneasy transition from eight years under Obama to a new Republican administration led by Trump. The claims of Russian meddling in the election also have heightened already debilitating tensions between Washington and Moscow over Syria, Ukraine and a host of other disagreements. \n \"Only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities,\" presidential spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters assembled in the White House briefing room, repeating the words from an October U.S. intelligence assessment. \n Obama's deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, connected the dots further, saying it was Putin who was responsible for the Russian government's actions. \n \"I don't think things happen in the Russian government of this consequence without Vladimir Putin knowing about it,\" he told MSNBC. \n The explosive accusation paints Putin, the leader of perhaps America's greatest geopolitical foe, as having directly undermined U.S. democracy. U.S. officials have not contended, however, that Trump would have been defeated by Clinton on Nov. 8 if not for Russia's assistance. Nor has there has been any indication of tampering with the vote-counting. \n The Kremlin rejected the claim of Putin's involvement, with Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissing it as \"laughable nonsense.\" \n There has been no specific, persuasive evidence shared publicly about the extent of Putin's role or knowledge of the hackings. That lack of proof undercuts Democrats' strategy to portray Putin's involvement as irrefutable evidence of a directed Russian government plot to undermine America's democratic system. \n The dispute over Russia's role is fueling an increasingly public spat between Obama's White House and Trump's team that is threatening to spoil the delicate truce that Obama and Trump have forged since Election Day to smooth the billionaire businessman's move to the White House in little over a month. \n Although the president and president-elect have mostly avoided criticizing each other publicly since Trump's win, their aides have been more openly antagonistic. Obama, however, did take a direct swipe at Trump in an interview on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" earlier this week, noting that Trump at one point in the campaign had publicly encouraged Moscow to find and release information on Clinton. \n Kellyanne Conway, Trump's senior transition adviser, said it was \"breathtaking\" and irresponsible that the White House had suggested Trump knew Russia was interfering to help his campaign. \n That led Earnest to unload from the White House, arguing that Trump, who has dismissed the CIA's assessment of Russian interference, should spend less time attacking the intelligence community and more time supporting the investigation that Obama has ordered. \n Earnest said it was \"obvious\" Trump knew what Russia was doing during the campaign, pointing out that Trump had encouraged Moscow during a news conference to find Clinton's missing emails, repeating the assertion Obama made in \"The Daily Show\" appearance. \n Trump has said he was joking. \n \"I don't think anybody at the White House thinks it's funny that an adversary of the United States engaged in malicious cyber activity to destabilize our democracy,\" Earnest said. \"That's not a joke.\" \n U.S. intelligence officials have linked the hacking to Russia's intelligence agency and its military intelligence division. Moscow has denied all accusations that it orchestrated the hacking of email accounts of Democratic Party officials and Clinton's campaign chief, John Podesta, and then leaked them to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. \n Trump and his supporters insist the Democrats' outrage about Russia is really an attempt to undermine the validity of his election victory. \n Still, Democrats pounced on the latest suggestions of Putin being connected to the daily drip of emails during the presidential race from some of Clinton's closest advisers. \n Putin was \"clearly involved,\" said outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. \n \"Having been the former head of the KGB, does that surprise you?\" Reid said. \"And does it surprise anybody today when he denied it?\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama vows retaliation for suspected Russian hacking"}

Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump's choice for National Security Advisor, waits for an elevator at Trump Tower, Monday, Dec. 12, 2016, in New York. \n WASHINGTON >> The retired Army general chosen by Donald Trump to be national security adviser was investigated for inappropriately sharing classified information with foreign military officers while he was serving as an intelligence commander in Afghanistan. \n Army documents that were made public Wednesday by the Washington Post and obtained by The Associated Press concluded that while some intelligence was wrongly shared by Michael Flynn, it was \"not done knowingly.\" \n No action was taken against Flynn, who was a major general serving as the deputy chief of staff for intelligence in the Afghanistan war when the investigation was done in 2009-2010. \n The investigation, which had been classified as secret, found no evidence of misconduct or damage to national security. Instead, the commander of U.S. Central Command at the time concluded that there were efforts to \"properly cleanse\" the information provided to foreign officers, suggesting there was \"keen attention to mission accomplishment in a coalition, combat environment.\" \n The documents do not detail what information Flynn shared, or with whom. But they underscore the complexities involved when dealing with classified intelligence. And they come in the wake of a heated election campaign during which Flynn and Trump blasted Democrat Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state, saying she created a national security risk. \n The FBI concluded that Clinton passed on three email chains with information that had classified markings in the body of the emails; the State Department contended two of those chains held unclassified material. Clinton has argued that she didn't understand that material marked with a \"c\" that passed through her personal communications system meant it was confidential. \n Flynn routinely lashed out at Clinton in public comments during the campaign, at one point saying she \"should not have a security clearance,\" because of her use of the private server. \"She doesn't take any accountability for herself, and she put our country at risk,\" he said. \n Flynn has extensive experience with classified information, including his stint as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, from 2012 to 2014. \n He served as director of intelligence for the Joint Task Force in Afghanistan until July 2002, commanded the 111th Military Intelligence Brigade from June 2002 to June 2004, and was director of intelligence for Joint Special Operations Command from July 2004 to June 2007. He then served as director of intelligence at U.S. Central Command until July 2008. \n The Post and others had previously reported about the investigation. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's pick for national security adviser investigated for intelligence breach"}

Storms are expected to sweep through Northern California Thursday bring rain to the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley and snow in the Sierra Nevada. \n LOS ANGELES >> A California storm has moved on from the soggy north to the desperately dry south, which has seen hardly a drop in recent weeks. \n Flash flood watches and warnings were issued for areas up and down the state, especially those where brushfires had denuded hillsides and mountain slopes. \n That included the Central Coast, where torrential rains fell in the area around Hearst Castle late Thursday. A nearby mountain spot where a huge wildfire burned in summer had received three inches of rain, and it was falling at more than a half-inch per hour. \n The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood warning for the burn area, saying debris flows were a strong possibility. \n Most of the Los Angeles area was soaked by a heavy burst of rain Thursday night that is expected to continue into Friday. \n In Hollywood, hundreds of people were pelted by rain for hours as they stood outside trying to get into a rare Metallica concert at a small venue, the Henry Fonda Theater. \n In Lancaster, north of Los Angeles, people out in the rain and wind were happy for the wintry holiday vibe. \n \"Just all of the sudden a little storm is kicking in,\" Kara McDonald told KTTV-TV as she shopped in an elf hat. \"We can sit around the fire and drink some hot chocolate.\" \n The storm caused worry in some spots like burn areas, where fire station were handing out sandbags. \n \"We're concerned about mudslides and flooding,\" Los Angeles fire spokeswoman Margaret Stewart said. \n Get out quickly if \"things go bad,\" she urged residents of foothill and burned areas. \"Don't take the risk of being trapped in a mudslide.\" \n Earlier Thursday, the San Francisco Bay Area was hit with one of its heaviest storms in an already wet season, with a small town in the North Bay receiving nearly 7 inches of rain in 24 hours. \n More than 100 flights in and out of San Francisco International Airport were cancelled and about 360 were delayed for minutes to hours because of weather concerns, said Brian Horne, airport duty manager. \n Venado, a remote former lumber town west of Healdsburg, was hit the hardest as the storm moved from the North Bay into San Francisco and the Central Coast. \n Some creeks in those counties were over flood stages. \n San Francisco recorded more than an inch of rain in 24 hours, with areas further north seeing 2 to 4 inches and 5 to nearly 7 inches recorded in some areas of the Sierra Nevadas, along with at least one wind gust of over 100 mph. \n In Healdsburg in Sonoma County, antique dealer Greg Sheldon said driving conditions were difficult there. \n \"Some of our streets are flooded here.

{"date": "December 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announces a lawsuit against Volkswagen in New York. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> A federal judge on Friday planned to hear whether Volkswagen, U.S. regulators and attorneys for vehicle owners had reached a deal for the remaining 80,000 cars caught up in the company's emissions cheating scandal. \n U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco was set to get an update about the settlement talks. At issue is what to do with about 80,000 3-liter cars that spewed excess pollution after being programmed to cheat on emissions tests. \n Volkswagen attorney Robert Giuffra has said the company believes it can recall and fix the 3-liter vehicles without affecting their performance. \n The German automaker previously reached a deal for the other 475,000 polluting vehicles in the scandal. That settlement gives owners the option to have Volkswagen buy back their vehicles regardless of condition for the full trade-in price on Sept. 18, 2015, when the scandal broke, or pay for repairs. \n Regulators have not approved any fixes. Either way, Volkswagen also will pay owners $5,100 to $10,000 each, depending on the age of the car and whether the owner had it prior to Sept. 18 of last year. \n Volkswagen has agreed to spend up to $10 billion compensating consumers. \n The settlement also includes $2.7 billion for unspecified environmental mitigation and $2 billion to promote zero-emissions vehicles. \n The global scandal erupted last year when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Volkswagen had fitted many of its cars with software to fool emissions tests. Car owners and the U.S. Department of Justice sued. \n The software recognized when the cars were being tested on a treadmill and turned on pollution controls. The controls were turned off when the cars returned to the road. The EPA alleged the scheme let the cars spew up to 40 times the allowable limit of nitrogen oxide, which can cause respiratory problems in humans. \n The scandal has damaged Volkswagen's reputation and hurt its sales. The company has reached a separate $1.2 billion deal with its U.S. dealers and is still facing potentially billions more in fines and penalties and possible criminal charges. \n The judge previously postponed a Nov. 30 hearing about the 3-liter vehicles after former FBI Director Robert Mueller said additional time might lead to a resolution.

{"date": "December 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Mindy Vincent, who estimates she's handed out 3,200 syringes to heroin addicts, distributes syringes along Rio Grande St. in downtown Salt Lake City. \n SALT LAKE CITY >> As the temperature dipped below freezing, Mindy Vincent locked her Ford Escape and trudged down Rio Grande, her arms overflowing with supplies. \n She flashed a welcoming smile to the groups of people huddled together on the sidewalk, her bright red sweatshirt standing out against the night. \n \"How was your day?\" she said to no one in particular. \"Need clean (syringes)?\" \n Vincent's questions were met with wary stares. Until a red-headed woman, her thin frame hunched over against the cold, broke the silence. \n \"They're free?\" asked the woman, about 30. \n \"Absolutely!\" Vincent exclaimed, her hands already red and chapped from the cold. \n That was only Vincent's second day handing out clean syringes as part of the state's new syringe-exchange program, but she already had a system: Sign people up \u2014 with little identifying information \u2014 dispose of their dirty syringes and hand them a bag of supplies that includes clean needles, condoms and cotton balls. \n So thrilled, in fact, that she quit her job at First Step House so she would have more time to dedicate to the cause. \n This summer, she started Life Changes Counseling \u2014 a small Heber City center specializing in addiction therapy \u2014 giving her flexibility to run the Utah Harm Reduction Coalition. \n She founded the coalition to focus on operating the syringe-exchange program, as well as provide education, services and advocacy. \n \"It's about helping people right where they're at,\" Vincent said. \n Studies have shown that these programs can help curb the risk of infections, such as HIV, and experts say they help connect intravenous drug users to services when they are ready to quit. \n Exchange programs \"provide people with that point of contact so when they are ready for treatment, they can access it more easily, and (the programs) do, in the long run, reduce HIV and hepatitis C transmission,\" said Heather Bush, the Utah Department of Health's viral hepatitis and syringe-exchange coordinator. \n It's a situation Vincent understands all too well: she was a meth addict until nearly 10 years ago, losing custody of her son several times while bouncing in and out of the criminal justice system. \n And as she handed out supplies, she shared those experiences with people uncertain of her intentions. \n \"How did you know to bring all this stuff?\" a man asked Vincent as she dumped 30 syringes into a brown paper bag. \n \"I was a drug addict,\" she said. \"But 17 years was long enough.\" \n The state's syringe-exchange law requires the department to enroll agencies that participate in the program. As of last week, only Vincent's two agencies \u2014 the counseling center and the coalition \u2014 had enrolled since early November. \n The problem, largely, is funding. Lawmakers established the program without allocating any money toward it. That means anyone who wants to operate one has to generate the funds to support it. \n Once Vincent's coalition receives nonprofit status, she will start accepting donations. But until then, she's dumping her own money \u2014 more than $5,000 so far \u2014 into the cause. \n Because of that, the coalition will be doing mobile outreach only a few times a week. \n But she said she hopes to have a storefront in the downtown area sometime next year. \n \"This is such a need,\" Vincent said. \"I know I'm fighting the good fight.\" \n And the people crowding around her on Rio Grande, lining up to get new syringes, were evidence of that. \n \"You guys are awesome,\" shouted a blond woman buried under a pile of blankets, her brown bag of syringes clutched tightly in her hands. \"Thank you.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ex-drug addict starts coalition to hand out clean syringes"}

{"date": "December 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Gordon Davis places a hand on a memorial cross for his stepdaughter, Lynette Daley, on Ten Mile Beach near Yamba, Australia. \n YAMBA, Australia >> The life was long drained from Lynette Daley by the time the cops rolled up to the lonely beach where her naked body lay. \n Her skin was cold, her lips were blue, and her blood was everywhere. It was between her legs and in a large clot by her feet. It was inside the four-wheel drive parked nearby and on the remains of the recently burned mattress partly hidden in the sand. And it was on the jeans worn by one of the two men who were with Lynette when she died. \n It had been, the pair said, a wild night. \n A coroner would later find Lynette bled to death from a sex act she was subjected to while so deeply intoxicated, she could not have consented. A forensic pathologist dubbed her injuries more severe than those which occur in even precipitous childbirth. \n Yet for five years, despite the urgings of the coroner and police, prosecutors refused to try the men charged with her death. It was not until June, amid enormous pressure from an outraged public, that they at last agreed to bring the case to court. \n Prosecutors have never publicly explained their reluctance to take the case, but Lynette's parents believe the reason is both painful and obvious: Their daughter was Aboriginal. The two men accused in her death are white. \n \"If it was two Indigenous people who'd done it to a white girl,\" her stepfather Gordon Davis says bluntly, \"they'd be in jail.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Whether racial prejudice played a role in Lynette's case depends on who you ask. Some suggest there may have been a problem with the evidence that gave prosecutors pause. Others say that, as a poor mother of seven battling alcoholism, the 33-year-old may not have been viewed by prosecutors as an \"ideal\" victim. \n Whatever the truth, the horror of Lynette's death has shaken a nation long uncomfortable talking about race, especially when it comes to the suffering of Australia's original inhabitants. The denial runs so deep that anthropologist W.E.H. Stanner once dubbed it \"the Great Australian Silence.\" \n When the British claimed Australia in the 1700s, they did so by declaring it \"terra nullius\" \u2014 owned by no one \u2014 ignoring the fact that Aboriginal people had lived there for at least 50,000 years. Forced off the land by colonists and exposed to new diseases, the Indigenous population shrank drastically. \n Today, Aboriginal people make up just 3 percent of the population of 24 million. And by almost any measure \u2014 from health to wealth, employment to imprisonment \u2014 they lag far behind everyone else. \n \"The shame of this country is the treatment of Aboriginal people,\" says former New South Wales state lawmaker Jan Barham. \"Lynette's case \u2014 it's an example of that cultural ignorance or denial that we don't value equally the lives and the treatment of an Aboriginal person.\" \n Lynette started out so strong, her parents remember. Until the boys she loved broke her. \n She grew up along the Clarence River, which winds through the forests and sugar cane plantations of northern New South Wales on Australia's east coast. Kangaroos and cattle graze on the lush fields and farms that dot the region. \n The Daleys are well-known throughout the Clarence Valley, where Indigenous people make up less than 6 percent of the population. The communities here are tiny and the residents' lives intertwined. It's the kind of place where you can pull into a random farm a half-hour drive from the Daleys' home and the farmer not only knows about Lynette, but knew her personally, from the time she was a baby. Small town, he explains with a smile. \n Lynette and her twin brother were born in the riverside town of Maclean, the middle of five children. Their mother, Thelma, eventually split with their father and married Gordon. \n He adored Lynette, a cheeky tomboy who preferred the nickname Norma and loved animals, particularly eagles for the freedom they exuded. She adopted the eagle as her totem, or spiritual emblem. \n When it came to boys, she was fiercely competitive; she threw stones farther than them, climbed trees higher. Thelma daydreamed her athletic daughter might one day be an Olympian. \n Her family sometimes called her Knocky, because nothing could knock her down. One day while picking lemons, two dogs attacked her, tearing into her leg and prompting a trip to the hospital. Undaunted, she returned to the lemon tree the next day. \n Gordon smiles at the memory now, of the days before it all went wrong, before his tough little girl grew into a tough-to-handle teen who fell in with a bad crowd. Before she picked up her first drink, picked up the drugs, descended into a grim spiral of alcoholism and abuse they were powerless to stop. \n By 16, she was pregnant with her first child. Several of her children were fathered by men her family says controlled her, beat her, left her body covered in a constant constellation of bruises. \n She went to the police a few times, her parents say, but they rarely intervened. She tried to fight back, but she was outmatched. \n \"They broke her spirit in the end,\" Gordon says. \"She never had a chance.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Gordon watches with weary eyes as his granddaughter, Alana, dances around their living room. \n He and Thelma are always watching her, watching her sisters, because they are terrified of what will happen if they don't. They know the girls are also vulnerable to abuse. \n \"I know what's on the cards, what happened to Lynette,\" he says. \n There is no shortage of distressing data. Indigenous women and girls are about 35 times more likely to be hospitalized due to family violence than their counterparts. Indigenous women are two to four times more likely to be sexually assaulted. Indigenous mothers are nearly 18 times more likely to be victims of homicide. \n Yet few cases of violence are ever reported, and far fewer make it to court. Part of that is due to a deep distrust of authorities that dates back to European settlement. \n The distrust grew worse during Australia's notorious \"Stolen Generations\" era, which only ended in the 1970s. For decades, the government forcibly removed Aboriginal children of mixed race from their families, arguing that integrating them into white society was more humane. Many were relegated to institutions where they were abused and neglected. \n Countless studies suggest Aboriginal Australians are right to remain wary of the justice system. They make up more than a quarter of the prison population, and rates are rising. Legal experts also say cases involving Indigenous victims often are dropped before trial. \n Consider the infamous disappearance of three Aboriginal children from the New South Wales town of Bowraville between 1990 and 1991. Two were found dead; the third remains missing. The prime suspect, a white man, was tried for two killings and acquitted of both. \n The families said police initially suggested the youngsters had just \"gone walkabout\" \u2014 a term referring to the journey that Aboriginal adolescents traditionally made into the wilderness. In August, a quarter-century after the children were killed, the state police commissioner finally apologized to the families for how the case was handled. \n It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that few Indigenous women turn to authorities for help. \n \"These women should be protected \u2026 and they should have the support of the legal system. It's quite the opposite,\" says lawyer Thalia Anthony, an expert in Aboriginal legal issues with the University of Technology Sydney. \"With Lynette, she's someone who the legal system can easily forget.\" \n The courts did intervene when it came to Lynette's children, awarding custody to Thelma and Gordon after it became clear she could not care for them. She loved them and visited often, her parents say, but knew they were safer with their grandparents. \n No one knows exactly when Adrian Attwater and Paul Maris entered Lynette's orbit, though given the tight community, they likely crossed paths over the years. Gordon remembers seeing the men at the pub where Lynette used to drink. Attwater told police he and Lynette were dating, though her family doesn't believe it. \n By 33, Lynette was homeless. One January day in 2011, she showed up at Gordon and Thelma's house, sick from the alcohol, sick of it all. She spent a couple of days there, drying out. Gordon thought maybe she'd finally hit bottom. \n And then, he says, either Maris or Attwater called her. \n Lynette told her father they were going fishing. She left some money for her children, then said goodbye. \n \"I love you, mum,\" she told Thelma, and walked out the door. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n The only way to reach Ten Mile Beach by car is via a dusty road through the forest or in a four-wheel drive along the beach from the village of Iluka, which lies to the south. \n It is the definition of desolate. The wind has carved the shrub-shrouded dunes into steep cliffs that tower above the golden sands. Beyond the bluffs is a national park, where a dense canopy of trees stretches inland for miles. \n The trio arrived here for Australia Day, a national holiday that had drawn a handful of campers to the coast. The state coroner compiled a detailed summary of what happened next, based on the statements of Attwater and Maris and testimony from witnesses, police, paramedics and others: \n They had all been drinking when they parked in the dunes. Lynette was particularly far gone \u2014 an autopsy later showed her blood alcohol level was between 0.30 and 0.35 percent, high enough to leave her severely incapacitated. \n At some point, Attwater told police, he and Lynette began to engage in what he described as a consensual sex act in which he inserted his fist inside her. Asked to demonstrate what Attwater did next, Maris \u2014 who performed another sex act on her simultaneously \u2014 moved his fist back and forth in a vigorous punching motion. Later, Attwater changed his account: he had used only four fingers, he said, and moved them gently. \n Whatever the specifics, the act proved deadly. \n The men told police they stopped when they saw blood. Their stories diverge on what happened next. But just before dawn, Maris set fire to the blood-soaked mattress from the back of the truck, along with Lynette's blood-stained bra. \n At 6 a.m., Maris called paramedics and said they had all been drinking and Lynette had stopped breathing. It took the ambulance about an hour to reach the remote site. By then, Lynette was dead. \n The men told paramedics that Attwater had had \"wild sex\" with Lynette. Attwater said Lynette later collapsed in his arms as they walked toward the ocean. \n When the police arrived, they saw that Maris' truck was parked directly above a pile of charred material. When questioned, Maris said he had burned the mattress because it smelled bad, and Lynette's bra because he didn't think she would want it. \n Around 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the south, Thelma and Gordon were driving home from a day of shopping with one of Lynette's daughters, Talaraha, when their phone rang. It was Lynette's sister, Pauline. Lynette, she said, was dead. \n Thelma started screaming. Gordon went numb. He didn't want to believe the girl he had spent years trying to save was gone. \n A few months later, police charged Attwater with manslaughter, and Maris with accessory after the fact. \n Gordon and Thelma were relieved. This was their chance at justice, they thought, the beginning of their agony's end. \n It wasn't. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Months passed with no word on whether the men would be prosecuted. Gordon and Thelma grew anxious. Then one day in 2012, attorneys from the state prosecutor's office invited them to a meeting. Gordon brought along his friend Greg Wheadon, a former state police officer, for support. \n What the prosecutors said left them stunned: They were dropping the charges. \n The prosecutors said they couldn't prove the men intended to hurt Lynette, Wheadon says. The explanation was baffling: A charge of manslaughter does not require proof of intent. \n When the family's pleas proved fruitless, state coroner Michael Barnes agreed in 2014 to hold an inquest, a court-like proceeding convened after unusual deaths. \n His findings were unequivocal: Lynette died of blood loss caused by blunt force genital tract trauma \u2014 injuries undoubtedly inflicted, Barnes wrote, by Attwater. \n The coroner concluded that Lynette had been so intoxicated she couldn't have meaningfully consented to sex, that she would have been in severe pain, and that Maris and Attwater conspired to burn the mattress and bra out of fear they could be used as evidence. \n \"The court expresses its contempt and disgust,\" Barnes wrote, \"for the callous disregard for her welfare shown by her supposed friends.\" \n Barnes determined that there was a reasonable prospect of securing a conviction. So he referred the case back to the prosecutors. \n Shortly before Christmas last year, the lead detective in the case, Grahame Burke, came by the Daleys' house. They could tell from the expression on his face that something was wrong. \n At the dining room table, he confirmed their fears: The head prosecutor was declining to press charges. Again. \n Thelma and Gordon could not understand it. The prosecutor said there wasn't enough evidence. But the coroner had made everything sound so clear-cut. Didn't their daughter's life mean anything? \n \"Indigenous people have got no chance,\" Gordon says today. \"Not with the justice system here.\" \n Wheadon has reached the same conclusion. \n \"From what I could see \u2014 my 20 years police service \u2014 it was the worst case of discrimination I've ever seen in my life,\" he says. \n \"She deserved more than that.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n The Daleys were running out of hope. And then the Australian media jumped on the case. \n Headlines blaring \"VILE\" and \"No Justice for Tragic Norma\" followed, a reference to Lynette's nickname. A #JusticeForNorma campaign launched on social media. An online petition demanding the head prosecutor justify his actions gathered tens of thousands of signatures. Protesters rallied outside the office of a local politician. In a Facebook comment liked more than 1,000 times, one woman summed up the mood of many: \"Today I am appalled to be Australian.\" \n There was particular anger among Aboriginal rights advocates, if little shock. Many saw what happened to Lynette both before and after her death as achingly familiar. \n \"It's unfortunately behavior that we've learned to live with and we shouldn't have to live with,\" says Rachael Cavanagh, who runs a Clarence Valley support group for Indigenous victims of domestic violence. \"My great-grandmother was beaten to death by her partner and there was no trial, there was no charge, there was nothing \u2014 because she was an Aboriginal woman.\" \n Skeptics dismissed the idea that bigotry was involved. Some blamed Lynette's death on alcohol and called for prohibition in Indigenous communities (alcohol is already banned in certain Aboriginal settlements \u2014 a divisive issue in itself.) \n State prosecutors declined to comment. But Nicholas Cowdery, the former state Director of Public Prosecutions, rejects the argument that bias played a role. While he did not work on Lynette's case, he says the prosecutor's office has guidelines that ban consideration of a person's race when deciding whether to move forward with a prosecution. He also dismisses the suggestion that Lynette may have been seen as an \"imperfect victim\" who would fail to move a jury. \n \"A life is a life,\" he said by e-mail. \n With pressure mounting, prosecutors agreed to review the case. Finally, in June, the head prosecutor delivered the news the Daleys had waited five years for: He would prosecute Attwater and Maris. \n Attwater faces a charge of manslaughter, and Maris accessory after the fact. Both also face charges of aggravated sexual assault. They have pleaded not guilty and their lawyers have declined to comment. \n A few weeks after the prosecutor's announcement, Australia's public broadcaster released footage of Aboriginal teens being tear-gassed, stripped naked, shackled and thrown around by guards at a youth detention center in the country's Northern Territory, where 97 percent of juvenile inmates are Indigenous. The video triggered a national uproar. The prime minister ordered a Royal Commission \u2014 Australia's highest form of inquiry \u2014 to investigate the scandal, including whether racism played a role. \n In a tearful speech to the University of New South Wales, prominent Indigenous journalist Stan Grant implored Australians to reckon with their nation's painful past. \"More than ever,\" he said, \"we need this mirror into our soul.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Thelma arrived at the courthouse for Maris and Attwater's bail hearing on Aug. 2 clutching a trio of red, yellow and black balloons, the colors of the Aboriginal flag. Together, they read \"Justice for Norma.\" \n The family watched, seething in silence, as the judge granted both Attwater and Maris bail and ordered a ban on publishing the men's home addresses, for their protection. \n It was more than the family could bear. As Attwater left the courthouse, their rage erupted. They surrounded him, hurled insults. Lynette's sister, Tina, grabbed him. \n \"What did you do to my sister?\" she shouted into his stunned face. \"WHY?\" \n Overwhelmed, she collapsed to the pavement. Paramedics rushed her to the hospital. \n Thelma wailed in grief. Her whole body felt tight. Gordon drove her to the hospital, too, fearing she was going into cardiac arrest. Doctors told the women they had suffered anxiety attacks. \n Weeks later, Thelma sits at her dining room table clutching a cup of tea and struggling to make sense of it all. \n \"You still keep on thinking to that time \u2014 why, why, why?\" she says softly. \"There's no answer yet. There's none.\" \n The trial is scheduled to begin in July. Yet with the passage of time, some experts believe it will be a tough case to prove. \n The future is a frightening unknown. Thelma and Gordon are in their 60s now, and Lynette's youngest child, Alana, is only 9. They worry they won't be around to protect her and her siblings much longer. And they ache thinking of all the children have missed. \n When the need to be near Lynette grows strong, the family travels to the beach where she drew her last breath. Every time they do, they say, Lynette comes to them in the form of an eagle. \n One recent afternoon on the beach, Alana races ahead, hunting for the spot in the dunes where the family placed a cross for her mother. Suddenly, she stops. Her eyes are shining. \n \"There she is!\" she cries, pointing at the sky, where an eagle has appeared. Minutes later, they spot Lynette's cross. \n Gordon rests his hand on the memorial. \n \"We just wait for the justice to prevail,\" he says. \"And then she can rest in peace.\" \n As they head off down the beach, the eagle glides over them once more. Then it turns and disappears into the dunes. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Aboriginal woman's slaying exposes Australia's racial divide"}

A sticking point: Japan says they should be operated under a special legal status that does not raise sovereignty issues. Russia, which governs the islands, wants them to be run under its law. \n Japanese media reports say Japan and Russia may ink a broader economic cooperation agreement Friday that the two sides have been negotiating for several months. \n For Putin, the summit meeting marks his first official visit to a G-7 country since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. \n Abe invited Putin even though the G-7 nations, including Japan, still have sanctions on Russia. \n Abe said the two leaders talked for three hours Thursday, spending about half of the time on the dispute over the southern Kuril islands seized by the former Soviet Union in the closing days of World War II, and a peace treaty.

{"date": "December 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio talked about the findings from a five-year investigation into the authenticity of President Barack Obama's birth certificate during a press conference today, in Phoenix. \n PHOENIX >> Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona has fixated on the authenticity of President Barack Obama's birth certificate for more than five years, going so far as to send a deputy and member of his volunteer posse to Hawaii to question officials. \n He earned plaudits from Donald Trump and became one of the nation's leading voices on the debunked controversy over Obama's birthplace. Arpaio closed his yearslong investigation Thursday, ending a chapter that critics denounced as a shameless ploy to raise money from his right-wing base. \n The news conference from the media-savvy sheriff came three weeks before the end of his 24 years as metro Phoenix's top law enforcer and five weeks before Obama leaves office. He complained to a crowd of about 75 supporters that his claims about the document weren't taken seriously. \n \"We and anyone else who dared to question the document have been maligned, falsely labeled and grossly criticized,\" Arpaio said, refusing to take questions from reporters. \n The sheriff took up the \"birther\" mantle as he faced some of his worst legal troubles, including a racial profiling case that discredited his patrols targeting immigrants and a grand jury inquiry into his failed investigations of local political enemies. \n He refused to back away from the investigation three months ago when Trump, an Arpaio ally, relented on his claim that Obama wasn't born in the U.S. \n Maricopa County Supervisor Steve Gallardo, a longtime Arpaio critic, said the investigation was a publicity stunt to raise the sheriff's national political profile and bring in campaign dollars. \n \"He was trying to throw meat to his base, and that's exactly what he did,\" Gallardo said. \"He threw red meat.\" \n Arpaio was not the only Arizona politician to plunge into the erroneous effort. \n The Arizona Legislature passed a bill in 2011 that would have required Obama and other presidential candidates to prove they were U.S. citizens before their names could appear on the ballot. It was vetoed by the GOP governor. \n Several Electoral College members even questioned Obama's eligibility to serve as president as they cast their votes for Republican Mitt Romney four years ago. \n Arpaio has said he launched the probe after nearly 250 people connected to an Arizona tea-party group requested it. He pressed forward despite aides warning he would be ridiculed. \n In the 2014 documentary \"The Joe Show,\" Arpaio was seen brushing aside his publicist's prediction that he would be viewed as a clown. The sheriff said the investigation would help his fundraising efforts. \n \"It may look nuts, but you know what, it's going to be pretty good,\" Arpaio said. \n The sheriff won praise several months later in a tweet from Trump: \"Congratulations to @RealSheriffJoe on his successful Cold Case Posse investigation which claims @BarackObama's 'birth certificate' is fake.\" \n Arpaio farmed out the investigation to volunteers on his posse, which is funded through donations, in anticipation of criticism he was throwing away taxpayer money. \n In 2012, he said the investigation revealed that there was probable cause to believe Obama's long-form birth certificate was a computer-generated forgery and that the selective service card completed by Obama in 1980 was likely a fraud. \n The facts say otherwise. Hawaii officials repeatedly confirmed Obama's citizenship, and the courts rebuffed a series of lawsuits. \n Arpaio insisted he wasn't investigating whether Obama was a U.S. citizen but examining an allegation that the document was fraudulent. But critics say it was a calculated swipe at the identity and legitimacy of the nation's first African-American president. \n Though Arpaio promised no taxpayer money would be spent on the investigation, the sheriff sent a deputy to Hawaii to accompany the posse's top investigator. The leader of the posse said it tried to pay back $9,600 for the costs of the deputy's travel and time, but officials declined to accept the money. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Sheriff Joe Arpaio closes probe of Obama birth certificate"}

{"date": "December 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Facebook is taking new measures to curb the spread of fake news on its huge and influential social network, focusing on the \"worst of the worst\" offenders and partnering with outside fact-checkers to sort honest news reports from made-up stories that play to people's passions and preconceived notions. \n NEW YORK >> Facebook is taking new measures to curb the spread of fake news on its huge and influential social network. It will focus on the \"worst of the worst\" offenders and partner with outside fact-checkers and news organizations to sort honest news reports from made-up stories that play to people's passions and preconceived notions. \n The social network will make it easier for users to report fake news when they see it, which they'll be able to do in two steps, not three. If enough people report a story as fake, Facebook will pass it to third-party fact-checking organizations that are part of the nonprofit Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network. \n Five fact-checking and news organizations are working with Facebook on this: ABC News, The Associated Press, FactCheck.org, Politifact and Snopes. Facebook says this group is likely to expand. \n Stories that flunk the fact check won't be removed from Facebook. But they'll be publicly flagged as \"disputed,\" which will force them to appear lower down in people's news feed. Users can click on a link to learn why that is. And if people decide they want to share the story with friends anyway, they can \u2014 but they'll get another warning. \n WHY FAKE NEWS MATTERS \n \"We do believe that we have an obligation to combat the spread of fake news,\" said John Hegeman, vice president of product management on news feed, in an interview. But he added that Facebook also takes its role to provide people an open platform seriously, and that it is not the company's place to decide what is true or false. \n Fake news stories touch on a broad range of subjects, from unproven cancer cures to celebrity hoaxes and backyard Bigfoot sightings. But fake political stories have drawn outsized attention because of the possibility that they influenced public perceptions and could have swayed the U.S. presidential election. \n There have been dangerous real-world consequences. A fake story about a child sex ring at a Washington, D.C., pizza joint prompted a man to fire an assault rifle inside the restaurant. \n By partnering with respected outside organizations and flagging, rather than removing, fake stories, Facebook is sidestepping some of the biggest concerns experts had raised about it exercising its considerable power in this area. For instance, some worried that Facebook might act as a censor \u2014 and not a skillful one, either, being an engineer-led company with little experience making complex media ethics decisions. \n \"They definitely don't have the expertise,\" said Robyn Caplan, researcher at Data & Society, a nonprofit research institute funded in part by Microsoft and the National Science Foundation. In an interview before Facebook's announcement, she urged the company to \"engage media professionals and organizations that are working on these issues.\" \n FACEBOOK AND FAKE NEWS \n Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that fake news constitutes less than 1 percent of what's on Facebook , but critics say that's wildly misleading. For a site with nearly 2 billion users tapping out posts by the millisecond, even 1 percent is a huge number, especially since the total includes everything that's posted on Facebook \u2014 photos, videos and daily updates in addition to news articles. \n In a study released Thursday, the Pew Research Center found that nearly a quarter of Americans say they have shared a made-up news story, either knowingly or unknowingly. Forty-five percent said that the government, politicians and elected officials bear responsibility for preventing made-up stories from gaining attention. Forty-two percent put this responsibility on social networking sites and search engines, and a similar percentage on the public itself. \n Fake news stories can be quicker to go viral than news stories from traditional sources. That's because they were created for sharing \u2014 they are clickable, often inflammatory and pander to emotional responses. Mike Caufield, director of blended and networked learning at Washington State University Vancouver, tracked whether real or fake news is more likely to be shared on Facebook. \n He compared a made-up story from a fake outlet with articles in local newspapers. The fake story, headlined \"FBI Agent Suspected In Hillary Leaks Found Dead In Apparent Murder-Suicide\" from the nonexistent Denver Guardian, was shared 1,000 times more than material from the real newspapers. \n \"To put this in perspective, if you combined the top stories from the Boston Globe, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, and LA Times, they still had only 5% the viewership of an article from a fake news,\" he wrote in a blog post . \n Facebook is emphasizing that it's only going after the most egregious fake news creators and sites, the \"the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain,\" wrote Adam Mosseri , vice president of product for Facebook's news feed, in a blog post Thursday. \n FOLLOW THE MONEY \n The social network's first public step toward fixing the fake-news problem since the election was a statement barring fake-news sites from using its lucrative ad network. But it wasn't much more than rhetorical. Facebook's policies already blocked sites that spread misleading information from its ad network, an automated system that places ads on sites across the internet. \n Now, Facebook says it has also eliminated the ability for spammers to masquerade as real news organizations by spoofing domains. And it says it's weighing a crackdown on publishers of fake news as well. \n Depriving scammers of money could be effective. \n \"Google and Facebook are the single two biggest engines for monetization,\" said Susan Bidel, a senior analyst at Forrester Research focusing on digital publishers. \"I don't think you are ever going to completely eradicate it. But it could get down to a manageable level.\" \n Facebook will not allow publishers to promote any story flagged as disputed. If this works, users should not see fake news stories in Facebook advertisements. \n ROBOTS VS. FALSEHOOD \n Facebook's main approach to problems has been to tackle them with studying its vast troves of user data, with algorithms that can be more effective at things than humans, and to favor engineers over editors. Data rules all else at the Menlo Park, California, company. \n Beyond the human fact-checkers, Facebook is also using its algorithms to de-emphasize fake news stories. For example, if people are significantly less likely to share an article after they have read it, it's a \"really good sign that the article was misleading or not informative in some way,\" Hegeman said \u2014 sort of like when you try a cereal sample at the grocery store, then decide not to buy it. \n Fake news stories won't disappear from Facebook, not the way child porn and spam and various illegal stuff does. That is not Facebook's goal. \n \"We believe providing more context can help people decide for themselves what to trust and what to share,\" Mosseri wrote. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Facebook gets serious about fighting fake news"}

{"date": "December 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Prosecutors who wanted to show that Roof was a cruel, angry racist simply used his own words at his death penalty trial on charges he killed nine black people in June 2015 at a Charleston church. Roof's two-hour videotaped confession less than a day after the shooting and a handwritten journal found in his car when he was arrested were introduced into evidence Friday, Dec. 9, 2016. \n Dylann Roof was convicted Thursday in the chilling attack on nine black church members who were shot to death last year during a Bible study, affirming the prosecution's portrayal of a young white man who hoped the slayings would start a race war or bring back segregation. \n Instead, the single biggest change to emerge from the June 17, 2015, slayings that shocked the nation was the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina Statehouse, where it had flown for 50 years over the Capitol or on the grounds. Roof appeared with the flag in several photos in a racist manifesto. \n In his confession to the FBI, the gunman said he carried out the killings after researching \"black on white crime\" on the internet. He said he chose a church because that setting posed little danger to him. \n Roof just stared ahead \u2014 much as he did the entire trial \u2014 as the verdict was read. \n Jurors will reconvene early next month to hear more testimony and decide whether Roof gets the death penalty or life in prison. \n In closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathan Williams mocked Roof for calling himself brave in his hate-filled journal and during his confession, saying the real bravery came from the victims who tried to stop him as he fired 77 bullets at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church. \n \"Those people couldn't see the hatred in his heart any more than they could see the .45-caliber handgun and the eight magazines concealed around his waist,\" Williams said. \n Defense lawyer David Bruck conceded Roof committed the slayings, but he asked jurors to look into his head and see what caused him to become so full of hatred, calling him a suicidal loner who never grasped the gravity of what he did. \n The defense put up no witnesses during the seven-day trial. They tried to present evidence about his mental state, but the judge ruled that it did not have anything to do with Roof's guilt or innocence. \n Roof was just imitating what he saw on the internet and believed he had to give his life to \"a fight to the death between white people and black people that only he\" could see and act on, Bruck said. \n Williams' 50-minute closing argument filled the court with tension. At times, the prosecutor raised his voice, saying Roof was a cold, calculated killer. Some family members of victims dabbed their eyes with tissues, and jurors appeared emotional when Williams, after apologizing to them, showed crime scene photos of each person killed alongside a small picture of them while alive. \n Those pictures included the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, 41, Emanuel AME's pastor and a state senator; Myra Thompson, 59, who taught Bible study that night \u2014 the same night she was licensed to preach; Cynthia Hurd, 54, a librarian who stayed to support Thompson; Depayne Middleton-Doctor, 49, who friends said sang like an angel and was also license to preach the day of the shootings; Daniel \"Dapper Dan\" Simmons, 74, nicknamed for his shiny shoes and fine hats; Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45, a high school track coach heavily involved in the church's youth programs; Ethel Lance, 70, the church sexton who kept the bathrooms and building immaculately clean; Susie Jackson, 87, who sang in the choir and sent generations through the church; and Tywanza Sanders, 26, Jackson's nephew and an aspiring poet who wanted to work with children. \n The prosecutor said the good of all those faithful churchgoers prevailed over Roof's hatred. \n \"This defendant chose to take their lives. He chose to break their bodies. But he does not get to choose who they were,\" Williams said. \n In a lengthy recording played earlier at trial, Roof told FBI agents he picked Mother Emanuel because of its historic significance in the black community. The church is the oldest in the South and one of its founders Denmark Vesey led a failed 1822 slave rebellion that drove the church underground. \n Roof, who was convicted of all 33 counts, including federal hate crimes and obstruction of religion, said he had felt compelled to act because of the way blacks treated whites and said the shootings were \"minuscule\" in comparison. \n The prosecutor recounted other evidence, like how Roof sat in the church parking lot for 28 minutes in his car, likely loading the 88 bullets \u2014 a number embraced symbolically by white supremacists \u2014 into eight magazines. Roof was handed a Bible and worksheet as he sat in the prayer service for nearly 45 minutes before opening fire when the worshippers closed their eyes for the final prayer. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Jurors convict Dylann Roof on all counts in church slayings"}

{"date": "December 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Russian President Vladimir Putin is seen in Nagato, western Japan, Thursday. The Obama administration suggested today that Putin personally authorized the hacking of Democratic officials' email accounts in the run-up to the presidential election, which intelligence agencies believe was designed to help Donald Trump prevail. \n WASHINGTON >> The Obama administration suggested today that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally authorized the hacking of Democratic officials' email accounts in the run-up to the presidential election and said it was \"fact\" that hacking had helped President-elect Donald Trump's campaign. The White House also leveled an astounding attack on Trump himself, saying he must have known of Russia's interference. \n No proof was offered for any of the accusations, the latest to unsettle America's uneasy transition from eight years under Democratic President Barack Obama to a new Republican administration led by Trump. The claims of Russian meddling in the election also have heightened already debilitating tensions between Washington and Moscow over Syria, Ukraine and a host of other disagreements. \n After an NBC News report quoted U.S. intelligence officials pointing the finger specifically at Putin, White House press secretary Josh Earnest pointed to an October assessment of the U.S. intelligence community saying that \"only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.\" \n Earnest said the reference to \"senior-most officials\" wasn't supposed to be subtle. \"It's pretty obvious,\" he told reporters. \n The explosive accusation paints the leader of perhaps the nation's greatest geopolitical foe as having directly undermined U.S. democracy. No U.S. officials have claimed, however, that Trump would have been defeated by Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 if not for Russia's assistance. Nor has there has been any indication of tampering with the vote-counting. \n The Kremlin flatly rejected the claim of Putin's involvement, with Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov today dismissing it as \"laughable nonsense.\" \n The White House today also was harshly critical of Trump, who has dismissed the allegations of Russian interference as the partisan anger of Democrats over losing the election. Trump's criticism has opened up a deep rift between the intelligence community and its incoming commander in chief. \n It is \"obvious\" that Trump knew of Russia's behavior during the campaign, Earnest said, also disputing Trump's claim that he was joking when he encouraged Russia to find emails that Clinton had deleted from her private email server. \n No one in the White House, Congress or the intelligence community found it \"funny\" that a U.S. adversary was trying to \"destabilize our democracy,\" he said. \n U.S. intelligence officials have linked the hacking to Russia's intelligence agency and its military intelligence division. Moscow has denied all accusations that it orchestrated the hacking of email accounts of Democratic Party officials and Clinton's campaign chief, John Podesta, and then leaked them to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. \n Democrats pounced on the latest suggestions of Putin being connected to the daily drip of emails during the presidential race from some of Clinton's closest advisers. \n Putin was \"clearly involved,\" said outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. \n \"Having been the former head of the KGB, does that surprise you?\" Reid said. \"And does it surprise anybody today when he denied it?\" \n On Wednesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the senior Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said it is hard to think that Putin didn't know about the operation. She called suggestions that he was aware of the hacking \"very credible.\" \n There has been no specific, persuasive evidence shared publicly about the extent of Putin's role or knowledge of the hackings. That lack of proof undercuts Democrats' strategy to portray Putin's involvement as irrefutable evidence of a directed Russian government plot to undermine America's democratic system. \n But Democrats theorize that no such wide-scale espionage operation could have been launched without Putin's approval. \n The NBC report said that the evidence is \"nearly incontrovertible,\" and that the intelligence comes from \"diplomatic sources and spies working for U.S. allies.\" It didn't identify the countries involved or how they might have such sensitive information from Putin's inner sanctum. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "White House suggests Putin was involved in U.S. hacking"}

Tulsi Gabbard introduced companion bills, pushing for the much-deserved recognition of Filipino soldiers. \n Gabbard said: \"These loyal and courageous soldiers, suffered, fought, with many giving up their lives alongside their American counterparts throughout the war.\" \n \"Though less than 18,000 of our Filipino WWII veterans are still alive today, this recognition is a testament to each and every one of our Filipino WWII veterans who earned and deserve their place amongst our greatest generation,\" she said in the release. \n Obama signed the bill into law Wednesday before he is scheduled to depart for Honolulu Friday for his last Hawaii holiday vacation as president. \n The congressional gold medal is the nation's highest civilian award by Congress, recognizing more than 260,000 Filipino and Filipino-American soldiers who fought alongside the U.S. in WWII. \n They were promised U.S. citizenship and health and pension benefits but Congress revoked that promise in 1946. Over the past decades, Hawaii's congressional leaders have been pushing to restore benefits for Filipino veterans. \n Today, there are fewer than 10 surviving Filipinos of the war in Hawaii, all who are in their 90s. \n In the news release, retired Maj. Gen. Antonio Taguba, a 1968 Leilehua High School graduate who heads the Filipino Veterans Recognition and Education Project, said, \"After enduring 75 years of injustice and humiliation, our Filipino World War II veterans regained their honor and dignity when Congress passed the Congressional Gold Medal Award \u2014 a historic bill President Obama signed into law today. \n \"With deep gratitude, our nation has now come to fully recognize the service and sacrifice of our brave heroes who fought valiantly under the American flag,\" he added. \n ", "author": "By Rosemarie Bernardo rbernardo@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Obama signs law that honors Filipino WWII veterans"}

{"date": "December 15, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Rex Teter, a member of the Electoral College, posed at his home in Pasadena, Texas on Tuesday. The sharp divisions left by last month's presidential election have cast more attention than usual on the Electoral College. \n WASHINGTON >> Hounded to abandon Donald Trump, Republican electors appear to be in no mood for an insurrection in the presidential campaign's last voting ritual. This most untraditional of elections is on course to produce a traditional outcome Monday \u2014 an Electoral College ticket to the White House for the president-elect. \n Whether they like Trump or not, and some surely don't, scores of the Republicans chosen to cast votes in the state-capital meetings told AP they feel bound by history, duty, party loyalty or the law to rubber-stamp their state's results and make him president. Appeals numbering in the tens of thousands \u2014 drowning inboxes, ringing cell phones, stuffing home and office mailboxes with actual handwritten letters \u2014 have not swayed them. \n The Associated Press tried to reach all 538 electors and interviewed more than 330 of them, finding widespread Democratic aggravation with the electoral process but little expectation that the hustle of anti-Trump maneuvering can derail him. For that to happen, Republican-appointed electors would have to stage an unprecedented defection and Democrats would need to buck tradition, too, by peeling away from Hillary Clinton and swinging behind a consensus candidate in sufficient numbers. \n Still, people going to the typically ho-hum electoral gatherings have been drawn into the rough and tumble of campaign-season politics. Republicans are being beseeched to revolt in a torrent of lobbying, centered on the argument that Clinton won the popular vote and Trump is unsuited to the presidency. Most of it is falling on deaf ears, but it has also led to some acquaintances being made across the great political divide. \n \"Let me give you the total as of right now: 48,324 emails about my role as an elector,\" said Brian Westrate, a small-business owner and GOP district chairman in Fall Creek, Wisconsin. \"I have a Twitter debate with a former porn star from California asking me to change my vote. It's been fascinating.\" \n Similarly deluged, Republican elector Hector Maldonado, a Missouri National Guardsman, has taken the time to console one correspondent, a single mother and Air Force veteran who is beside herself with worry about what a Trump presidency will mean. \n \"Everything's going to be OK,\" he said he told her. \"I know you're scared, but don't worry. Everything's going to be OK. And I know that it will be.\" \n Maldonado, a Mexican immigrant and medical-equipment seller in Sullivan, backed Ted Cruz in the primaries but will cast his vote for Trump with conviction. \"I took an oath once to become a U.S. citizen,\" he said, \"and on Aug. 14, 1995, that was the first oath that I've taken to support the U.S. Constitution. A year later I took the oath again, to support the duties of being an officer in the U.S. Army. This was the third oath that I've taken to execute what I promised to do.\" \n Even a leader of the anti-Trump effort, Bret Chiafalo of Everett, Washington, calls it a \"losing bet\" \u2014 but one he says the republic's founders would want him to make. \"I believe that Donald Trump is a unique danger to our country and the Founding Fathers put the Electoral College in place to, among other things, stop that from happening,\" said Chiafalo, 38, an Xbox network engineer who backed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries. \n It takes 270 electoral votes to make a president. Despite losing the national popular vote, Trump won enough states to total 306 electoral votes. He would need to see three dozen fall away for him to lose his majority. Only one Republican elector told AP he won't vote for Trump. \n Over the sweep of history, so-called faithless electors \u2014 those who vote for someone other than their state's popular-vote winner \u2014 have been exceptionally rare. \n Nashville attorney Tom Lawless, who chose Marco Rubio in the primaries, described his vow to cast his electoral vote for Trump in blunt terms. \"Hell will freeze and we will be skating on the lava before I change,\" he said. \"He won the state and I've pledged and gave my word that that's what I would do. And I won't break it.\" \n Nor will Jim Skaggs, 78, a developer from Bowling Green, Kentucky, despite deep concern about Trump. \"His personality worries me,\" Skaggs said. \"He is not open-minded.\" Skaggs knew Trump's father through the construction business, met the son in his 20s, and \"I wasn't impressed.\" \n \"I hope he is far better than I think he is,\" Skaggs said. Even so, \"I fully intend to vote for Donald Trump,\" he said. \"I think it's a duty.\" \n State law and practices vary for electors, but even in states where electors don't take an oath to vote a certain way or don't face legal ramifications for stepping out of line, the heavy expectation is for them to ratify the results. As much as they don't want Trump in office, some Democrats are as reluctant as Republicans to go rogue. \n \"We lost the election,\" said John Padilla of Albuquerque, New Mexico, a Democratic ward chairman. \"That's how elections are and you shake hands with your opponent and you get on with what you have to do and support your candidate.\" \n Yet Democratic electors, stung by losing an election to a Republican who trails Clinton by more than 2.6 million votes nationwide, spoke strongly in the interviews in favor of overhauling or throwing out the electoral system. Republican electors generally supported it, reasoning that it provides a counterweight to political dominance by coastal states with huge (and largely Democratic) populations, like California and New York. \n Chiafalo is a co-founder of the Hamilton Electors, a group formed to steer other electors from both parties to a third candidate. \"We've stated from Day 1 this is a long shot, this is a Hail Mary,\" he said. \n But if the effort fails, it won't be from lack of trying. Most of the pleas to reject Trump are coordinated, automated, professionally generated and, for those reasons, none too persuasive. \n \"We got a stack of letters from idiots,\" said Republican elector Edward Robson, 86, a Phoenix, Arizona, homebuilder. \n Fellow elector Carole Joyce, 72, a state committeewoman in Phoenix and retired public health nurse, was more charitable. \n \"They've caused me great distress on my computer, that's for sure,\" she said. \"I average anywhere from a thousand to 3,000 emails a day. And I'm getting inundated in my regular mailbox out front \u2014 anywhere from 17 to 35 letters a day coming from Washington state, Oregon, all around the country. Hand-written, some of them five or six pages long, quoting me the Federalist Papers, the Constitution, asking me again out of desperation not to vote for Donald Trump. \n \"And that's their right,\" she said. \"I've had nothing threatening, I'm happy to say. The election is over, they need to move on.\" \n Associated Press writers who contributed: Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin; Summer Ballentine in Jefferson City, Missouri; Erik Schelzig in Nashville, Tennessee; Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Bob Christie in Phoenix, Arizona; and Michael Biesecker, Emily Swanson and Monika Mathur in Washington.  \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "The electoral voters speak, and they're not out for a revolt"}

Despite continued sanctions on Russia, Abe is eager to make progress on a 70-year-old territorial dispute that has kept their countries from signing a peace treaty formally ending World War II. \n NAGATO, Japan >> Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin spent much of their first round of talks at a hot springs resort in western Japan on Thursday discussing a territorial dispute that has divided their countries for 70 years. \n For Putin, the summit meeting in Nagato city marks his first official visit to a G-7 country since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. \n Abe invited Putin even though the G-7 nations, including Japan, still have sanctions on Russia. The talks will move to Tokyo on Friday. \n Abe said the two leaders talked for three hours, spending about half of the time on the dispute over four islands seized by the former Soviet Union in the closing days of World War II, and a peace treaty officially ending the two countries' wartime hostilities. A major breakthrough is seen as unlikely. \n The disagreement over the four southern Kuril islands, which Japan calls the Northern Territories, has kept the two countries from signing a peace agreement. \n \"We had in-depth discussions on a peace treaty,\" Abe told reporters. \n He said the two leaders also discussed possible joint economic projects on the disputed islands. Abe hopes such economic cooperation will bolster ties and help solve the territorial dispute if they are operated under a special legal status that does not raise sovereignty issues. Russia, however, wants them to be run under its law. \n Putin expressed concern about the deployment of U.S. missile defense systems in Japan, calling them an overreaction to North Korea's missile program, Japanese media reported. Abe assured him that they are limited to self-defense and do not pose a threat to neighboring countries, while stressing the importance of discussing defense issues amid growing security concerns in the region, they said. \n To that end, the two leaders agreed to resume \"2+2\" talks among the countries' foreign and defense ministers, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. Lavrov, who is accompanying Putin, attended the first and last \"2+2\" meeting three years ago. \n Abe did not say if there was any progress on the territorial issue. The two leaders will release a joint statement after the end of the talks Friday, he said. \n In brief remarks before the meeting, Abe told Putin that the hot spring waters of Nagato are famous for relieving fatigue. \n \"I can guarantee you that the hot springs here would fully remove fatigue from our summit talks,\" he said. \n Putin replied, \"Better not to get too tired.\" He also credited Abe's efforts for \"a certain movement in the development of Russian-Japanese ties.\" \n James Brown, a Japan-Russia expert at Temple University's Japan campus in Tokyo, said the meeting was \"an extraordinary development. I think Prime Minister Abe is being really quite bold in announcing this new approach to relations with Russia, especially coming at such a difficult time in relations between Russia and the West.\" \n The meeting started after 6 p.m., more than two hours behind schedule, because Putin's plane landed late. Putin has a reputation for late arrivals. He kept Pope Francis waiting at the Vatican for one hour and 20 minutes in 2015. Earlier this month, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida waited for two hours when he visited the Kremlin. \n Thursday's delay was because of \"scheduling issues\" including ones related to Syria, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, without elaborating. \n Abe, who flew from Tokyo to Nagato in the morning, used the time to visit the grave of his father, Shintaro Abe. As foreign minister, the elder Abe strove for a resolution of the territorial dispute in the 1980s. \n Japan says the Soviet Union took the islands illegally, expelling 17,000 Japanese to nearby Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's four main islands. Russia governs the islands and the Russians who now live there. \n Putin told Japanese journalists earlier this week that progress hinges on Japan's flexibility to compromise, and that he doesn't mind the status quo. \"We think that we have no territorial problems. It's Japan that thinks that is has a territorial problem with Russia,\" he said. \n But Russia wants to attract Japanese investment, particularly to its far east. Japan hopes that stronger ties through joint economic projects will help resolve the thorny territorial issue over time. \n Associated Press writer Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow and videojournalist Kaori Hitomi in Tokyo contributed to this story. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Putin, Abe hold talks on Japan-Russia territorial dispute"}
