{"date": "December 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl arrives for a pretrial hearing at Fort Bragg, N.C. Bergdahl is due back in court for a pretrial hearing on accusations that he endangered fellow service members by walking off his post in Afghanistan in 2009. \n FORT BRAGG, N.C. >> Prosecutors were rebuffed from harnessing the most contentious issue surrounding the court martial of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl when a judge ruled out any evidence that soldiers were wounded while searching for him. \n The judge, Army Col. Jeffery Nance, decided Friday to disallow any such evidence because, he said, the risk is too great that it military jurors would act on emotion rather than logic, creating an unfair bias against the defendant. \n Nance wrote that there's \"ample\" other evidence supporting the argument that Bergdahl's comrades undertook dangerous search missions in Afghanistan that brought them into contact with the enemy. \n \"However, the government may not put on evidence of actual injuries suffered by any service members in conducting operations to recover the accused,\" he wrote. \n Bergdahl is charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy; the latter could put him in prison for life. Bergdahl has said he walked off his post in 2009 to alert higher-ups to what he felt were problems with his unit. \n Questions about whether soldiers were injured or killed searching for Bergdahl have long surrounded the case. President-elect Donald Trump is among the critics who repeated claims that lives were lost. \n However, a general who investigated Bergdahl's disappearance has testified that he found no evidence that service members died searching for him. \n Prosecutors have focused on soldiers wounded during a firefight involving a half-dozen U.S. service members embedded with 50 members of the Afghan National Army, about a week after Bergdahl left his post. An officer involved in that mission has testified that its sole purpose was to find him. \n The group was attacked near a town in Afghanistan on July 8, 2009. U.S. Army National Guard Sgt. 1st Class Mark Allen was shot in the head, and prosecutors say he uses a wheelchair and is unable to communicate. Another soldier had hand injuries because of a rocket-propelled grenade. \n But Nance wrote that \"the accused is not charged with causing anyone's injury or death. He is charged with endangering the command. While there are similarities in those consequences, they are distinct.\" \n His ruling described his concern that jurors would be unfairly prejudiced by the injuries. \n \"The accused is not to be convicted because, while searching for him, his comrades were horrifically injured. Even (perhaps especially) hardened combat veterans of many deployments who might sit on this panel would be hard pressed not to be affected by the horrific injuries to SFC Allen, in particular,\" he wrote. \"Since the danger can be avoided, I deem it should be.\" \n Prosecutors have argued that the injuries are the strongest evidence that Bergdahl endangered his comrades by triggering dangerous search missions. \n One of the prosecutors, Army Maj. Justin Oshana, told the judge Friday that military jurors, compared to civilians, are \"much less likely to be susceptible to unfair prejudice.\" \n But defense attorney Army Maj. Oren Gleich said many factors \u2014 some having little or nothing to do with Bergdahl \u2014 coalesced in the mission that left the men wounded. The defense has presented evidence that the mission was shoddily planned, even by the standards of the missing-soldier alert Bergdahl caused. \n \"You have to factor in all the intervening causes as to what created a dangerous situation,\" Gleich said. \n Bergdahl, who was swiftly captured after walking off his post and held captive for five years by the Taliban and its allies, hasn't decided whether to have a trial by jury or judge alone. \n The Obama administration's decision in May 2014 to exchange five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for Bergdahl's freedom prompted criticism from Republicans who accused Obama of jeopardizing the nation's safety. But the Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously supported the exchange to uphold their commitment to never will leave anyone behind on the battlefield. \n Bergdahl, who's from Hailey, Idaho, has asked Obama to pardon him before leaving office. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Judge bars Bergdahl prosecutors from using wounds at trial"}

{"date": "December 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People bow to portraits of the late leaders, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, at the Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang, North Korea. \n TOKYO >> It's been five years since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un took power following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, whose demise was observed at monuments and on city center plazas across the nation Saturday. Here's a look at five ways the country that has now been ruled by three generations of Kim \u2014 starting with grandfather Kim Il Sung \u2014 has changed since the ascension of its 30-something \"respected marshal.\" \n THE MAN HIMSELF \n Kim Jong Un is in some ways a lot more like his charismatic and gregarious, albeit brutal and megalomaniacal, grandfather than Kim Jong Il. He has gone out of his way to milk that resemblance, right down to adopting his trademark haircut from a seemingly bygone era. While his father almost never spoke in public, Kim Jong Un has done so on any number of occasions, including a four-hour address at his ruling party's congress in May. On the flip side, one of his most important moves to consolidate power \u2014 the execution of his powerful uncle and the purges that ensued \u2014 demonstrated both his personal independence and his willingness to employ the same kind of oppressive tools that were the hallmarks of both his father and grandfather. And, despite a short-lived friendship with former NBA bad boy Dennis Rodman, he has yet to travel abroad or meet a foreign head of state. \n NUKES, MISSILES AND ROCKETS \n Turning North Korea into a nuclear power wasn't Kim Jong Un's idea \u2014 it almost certainly originated with Kim Il Sung himself \u2014 but it's defined his first five years. Of the five nuclear tests North Korea has conducted, three have been under his watch and two, including its most powerful to date and its first of what Pyongyang claims was an H-bomb, were this year. Kim Jong Un's North Korea has been sprinting to the finish line of a viable nuclear arsenal and the advanced missile technology needed to attack South Korea, Japan and the 50,000 U.S. troops it hosts, the key U.S. military outpost of Guam and the U.S. mainland itself. At the same time, and some argue for largely the same reasons, the North under Kim has also joined the space race, putting satellites into orbit and aiming to reach the moon within the next decade. \n SHIFTING PRIORITIES \n North Korea's main motto under Kim Jong Il was \"Military First.\" Under Kim Jong Un, the focus is now on building more and better nukes and bolstering the national economy, in large part through developing science and technology. To suit his goals, Kim has shifted more power to the ruling party and to his Cabinet and put the nation on collective overtime with repeated \"loyalty campaigns.\" It remains to be seen how sustainable his two-pronged nukes-and-butter policy will be in the face of international sanctions and internal, systemic weaknesses. So far, it has been at least workable. The North is already a de-facto nuclear state and its economy, though fragile and no doubt underperforming, is showing small but persistent growth. \n FOSTERING MARKETS AND ENTREPRENUREURS \n Probably more out of pragmatic necessity than anything else, Kim Jong Un has allowed capitalist-style markets and entrepreneurialism to expand, invigorating the domestic economy and creating new revenue streams for the government, which profits by either taking a cut or by directly supporting such enterprises. Changes in farming policy that let individuals personally benefit from bigger harvests have boosted agricultural output. The relatively affluent capital of Pyongyang \u2014 home to the North's most fortunate \u2014 has seen a significant increase in everything from taxis to coffee shops and streets stalls. But the rise of the \"cash masters,\" an empowered middle class more open to capitalist ideals, or just more determined to acquire material wealth, could prove to be a problem for Kim down the road. \n KEEPING THE MASSES ENTERTAINED \n Kim Jong Un has on several occasions vowed to make North Korea a \"more civilized\" nation. His signature development projects include an equestrian center and sprawling water park in Pyongyang and a luxury ski resort near the port city of Wonsan on the east coast. He has tried to give his regime something of a softer face through the all-female Moranbong Band, which sings its odes to him in a decidedly pop, and vaguely titillating, manner. Kim also generated a major national sensation by ordering a Disney-quality update to the \"Boy General\" anime series originally commissioned by his father. On another major front, Kim has made a big shift toward sports \u2014 vowing North Korea will become a major international sports power \u2014 presumably as a means of bolstering health and national pride and providing the masses with a relatively innocuous diversion from their daily lives. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "5 ways North Korea has changed in 5 years under Kim Jong Un"}

{"date": "December 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n H-E-B employees remove bottles of water from a crate to hand out to customers Thursday morning, Dec. 15, 2016, in Corpus Christi, Texas. \n DALLAS >> A chemical leak from an asphalt plant that led Corpus Christi officials to warn residents this week not to drink the water was apparently reported a week earlier, according to an email from a state environmental official that was obtained Friday. \n The internal email sent Wednesday by Susan Clewis, a regional director for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, contained an incident report that described the leak as a \"backflow incident from a chemical tank impacting the public water system.\" It was reported Dec. 7 at a plant run by Ergon Asphalt and Emulsions. \n The email doesn't say who initially reported the leak on Dec. 7 or to whom. It says the state environmental agency was notified around 3 p.m. on Wednesday. City officials notified the public that evening. \n \"Obviously we are concerned about that initial report, that this may have been known for seven days and it may have been going on for that long. And why did it take so long for TCEQ to get notified?\" asked Luis Moreno, chief of staff for state Sen. Juan Hinojosa, whose district includes Corpus Christi. \"Those are all things that I think are starting to be figured out right now.\" \n Dan McQueen, the mayor of the Gulf Coast city of about 300,000 people, has said local officials also only learned of the leak on Wednesday. \n Neither Clewis nor city officials responded to requests for comment on Friday, when many schools remained closed for a second day. \n The TCEQ report indicates that a combination of Indulin AA-86 and hydrochloric acid leaked into the water supply. \n Indulin is an asphalt emulsifying agent that's corrosive and can burn the eyes, skin and respiratory tract if a person comes into contact with concentrated amounts. The amber liquid is considered a hazardous material by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and could cause damage to internal organs. \n \"You don't expect to see it in water,\" said Terry Clawson, a spokesman with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. \n Up to 24 gallons of it may have seeped into a pipeline carrying water, allowing it to move to other areas of the city, Kim Womack, a spokeswoman for the city, said Thursday. \n Ergon has said in a statement that it has been in contact with the TCEQ and was \"working cooperatively to provide all information to ensure state officials can remedy the situation as quickly as possible.\" Bill Miller, a company spokesman, declined to explain Friday how a hazardous chemical may have entered the water supply. \n State and city officials have referred to a \"backflow problem\" at the plant, and Womack said inspectors didn't find a device in place that prevents contaminated water from flowing backward into a potable water supply. Ergon, though, has argued that the plant does have a prevention device, Womack said. \n Miller said Ergon Inc. is leasing the property for manufacturing purposes. The privately held Flowood, Mississippi-based conglomerate's Corpus Christi subsidiary makes paving and pavement preservation products. The 62-year-old company also has refining, trucking and real estate businesses. \n State and federal environmental records list no problems at the plant over the past five years. Nationwide, the Environmental Protection Agency reports no current \"significant violations\" at Ergon facilities but shows seven receiving fines since 2010, the highest $17,200 paid by a Vicksburg, Mississippi, refinery. \n A Texas Commission on Environmental Quality record lists an emergency response at the site on March 24 as having been closed. Clawson, the agency spokesman, said he had no details. \n Meanwhile, city officials on Friday continued to ease restrictions on the use of tap water while workers flushed water pipes to make sure any remnants of the chemical are removed. \n Limited use of water is allowed in some neighborhoods. Water can be used for showering and washing clothes, but not yet for drinking. They warn that young children and those with weakened immune systems should avoid bathing so as not to accidentally swallow the water. \n Officials said Thursday that residents in some parts of the city can consume water however they wish, but there were still sections Friday where authorities urged no use at all. \n In additional to shuttering schools, the leak also continued to disrupt commerce. Officials said plenty of bottled water has been donated to help residents. \n City officials have said that no one has turned up at area hospitals with symptoms that might indicate they were sickened or burned by the chemical. A city councilman, Michael Hunter, told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times that it was unlikely the leaked chemical was concentrated enough to do harm, but that every precaution must be taken. \n The incident is the latest in a string of water scares for Corpus Christi. In May, the city issued its third boil-water advisory in a year as a precaution after nitrogen-rich runoff from rain flowed into the water system, resulting in low chlorine disinfectant levels in the water supply. \n Boil-water notices were issued last year because of elevated levels of E. coli and another for low chlorine levels, the Caller-Times previously reported. The notices mirrored two others that were issued in 2007. \n City crews have worked to reconfigure some water mains to ensure that water keeps circulating and to prevent bacteria growth. But an overarching concern is an old water system where more than half of 225 miles of cast-iron pipe needs to be upgraded. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Report: Chemical leak reported week before public was warned"}

{"date": "December 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n New York real estate heir Robert Durst smiles as he is transported from Orleans Parish Criminal District Court to the Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment on murder charges in New Orleans. \n LOS ANGELES >> New York real estate heir Robert Durst knew he was suspected in the Los Angeles killing of his best friend, but he never fled when he had the chance because years had passed and he didn't think police would come after him, according to court documents released Friday. \n Durst was asked why he didn't split after documentary filmmakers confronted him in 2012 with a letter anonymously sent to police in 2000 tipping them to the location of Susan Berman's body that matched handwriting on a letter he had sent her years before. \n \"You saw the envelopes. How come you didn't \u2026 leave then?\" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney John Lewin asked. \"It's mind-boggling to me.\" \n \"I guess inertia,\" Durst replied. \"I just didn't really, really, really think that I was gonna end up arrested.\" \n The comment was one of several that hinted at his involvement in three suspected killings chronicled in the documentary \"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,\" but Durst stopped short of confessing to any of them. The documents detail his interrogation by Los Angeles prosecutors while he was in custody in New Orleans after his arrest March 15 last year on a charge of murder in Berman's death. \n Durst acknowledged he was in the process of fleeing when he was arrested. He was found in a hotel with a false Texas ID, stacks of $100 bills, bags of marijuana, a .38-caliber revolver, a map folded to show Louisiana and Cuba, and a flesh-toned latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair. \n \"I was the worst fugitive the world has ever met,\" he said. \n His arrest came the day the final installment of the six-part series aired on HBO. After being confronted with the two identical-looking envelopes, the documentary ended with Durst going into a bathroom where his live microphone captured him muttering to himself: \"There it is. You're caught! What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\" \n Durst, 73, told Lewin that he took meth during his interviews with the filmmakers and had smoked pot every day of his life. \n The series traced the mysterious disappearance of his wife, Kathleen Durst, in New York in 1982, his acquittal on murder charges in the 2001 dismemberment killing of a neighbor Galveston, Texas, and the killing of Berman in Los Angeles as she was about to speak with prosecutors investigating his wife's suspected slaying. \n When asked why he cooperated with the makers of \"The Jinx,\" Durst said he felt filmmaker Andrew Jarecki had been sympathetic toward him in a feature-length film, \"All Good Things,\" about his wife's disappearance. He gave Jarecki and his partner, Marc Smerling, two lengthy interviews and provided access to boxes of documents so they would get the full picture of his life. \n \"I wanted them to see the whole thing,\" Durst said. \"That they would see me as an acceptable human being, as opposed to all this other stuff.\" \n The 110-page transcript of his interrogation was included to bolster a motion filed by prosecutors asking a judge to appoint a \"special master\" to sort through the boxes of seized documents to separate material that might be protected by lawyer-client confidentiality. \n Defense attorneys would not comment. But the motion filed by prosecutors said the defense claims the interview with Durst after his arrest was improper, his statements were not voluntary and prosecutors knew he had lawyers and should not have interviewed him. \n Throughout the interrogation, Lewin complimented Durst, telling him he was brilliant and the most interesting suspect he'd ever investigated. He prodded and coaxed and constantly pushed for a confession. \n \"I know that when you killed Susan, that was not something you wanted to do,\" Lewin said. \n \"Um, I'm gonna stay away from killing Susan,\" Durst replied. \n Toward the end of the interview, Durst negotiated with Lewin on what he could get in exchange for providing more information, though he acknowledged at his advanced age and poor health there wasn't much the prosecutor could offer. \n He'd been told that his missing wife's mother, Ann McCormack, was 101 years old and he said he would like to do something for her family. \n \"I think what you wanted to hear \u2014 to make Ann McCormack happy \u2014 is \u2026 'What did you do with Kathie?' And I think you want me to go through details of, of Susan. \u2026 Now, what would I ask for?\" \n Lewin said he had no control over where Durst would be imprisoned, but he gave his word he would recommend a better place. \n \"I'm hoping that there's a part of you in there that is saying, 'You know what? I can't undo what I've done in the past. But I can try to \u2014 I don't have many years left.' Will you at least think about that?\" \n Durst said he would. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Robert Durst interrogation: 'worst fugitive' in the world"}

{"date": "December 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama waved as they boarded Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base today. The Obama family is headed to Hawaii. \n WASHINGTON >> President Barack Obama put Russia's Vladimir Putin on notice today that the U.S. could use offensive cyber muscle to retaliate for interference in the U.S. presidential election, his strongest suggestion to date that Putin had been well aware of campaign email hacking. \n \"Whatever they do to us, we can potentially do to them,\" Obama declared. \n Caught in the middle of a post-election controversy over Russian hacking, Obama strongly defended his administration's response, including his refusal before the voting to ascribe motive to the meddling or to discuss now what effect it might have had. U.S. intelligence assessments say it was aimed at least in part on helping Donald Trump defeat Hillary Clinton, and some Democrats say it may well have tipped the results in his favor. \n Though Obama avoided criticizing President-elect Trump by name, he called out Republicans who he said fail even now to acknowledge the seriousness of Russia's involvement in U.S. elections. \n Obama expressed bewilderment about GOP lawmakers and voters who now say they approve of Putin, and he said unless that changes the U.S. will be vulnerable to foreign influence. \n \"Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave,\" Obama said as he closed out the year at a White House news conference. Afterward he left for the family's annual vacation in Hawaii. \n Obama declined to state explicitly that Putin knew about the email hacking that roiled the presidential race, but he left no doubt who he felt was responsible. He said that \"not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin\" and repeated a U.S. intelligence assessment \"that this happened at the highest levels of the Russian government.\" \n Obama said he confronted Putin in September, telling the former KGB chief to \"cut it out.\" That was one month before the U.S. publicly pointed the finger at Russia. Suggesting his directive to Putin had been effective, Obama said the U.S. \"did not see further tampering\" after that date. \n The president has promised a \"proportional\" yet unspecified response to the hacking of the Democratic Party and Clinton's campaign chairman. Emails stolen during the campaign were released in the final weeks by WikiLeaks. CIA Director John Brennan said in a message today to employees that the FBI agrees with the CIA's conclusion that Russia's goal was to help Trump win. \n Trump has dismissed the CIA's assessment and talk about Russian hacking as \"ridiculous,\" while arguing both Democrats and the CIA are trying to undermine the legitimacy of his victory. He made no mention of the hacking \u2014 or of Obama \u2014 during the latest stop on his \"thank you\" tour in Orlando, Florida, Friday night. \n Clinton has even more directly cited Russian interference. She said Thursday night, \"Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyberattacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me.\" \n The Senate intelligence committee said today that it will conduct a bipartisan investigation and hold hearings about what led the intelligence agencies' finding. \"The committee will follow the intelligence wherever it leads,\" said chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. \n At the same time, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., chairman of the House intelligence committee, complained that his committee's oversight into the hacking has been stymied because the intelligence agencies have not provided information to the committee. \n Obama said he'd leave it to political pundits to debate the question of whether the hacking swayed the election outcome. He did, however, chide the media for that he called an \"obsession\" with the emails that were made public during the election's final stretch. \n He said his reticence to detail publicly the U.S. response to Russia reflected a need to retaliate \"in a thoughtful, methodical way.\" \n \"The idea that somehow public shaming is gonna be effective, I think doesn't read the thought process in Russia very well,\" Obama said. \n Accusations of Russian election interference have heightened the already tense relationship between Washington and Moscow. Separately, Obama has blamed Russia for standing in the way of international efforts to stop the civil war in Syria, where government forces have beaten back rebels in Aleppo. \n Obama said he feels \"responsible\" for some of the suffering in Syria, but he defended his decision to avoid significant military action there. He said that while military options short of invasion were tempting, it was \"impossible to do this on the cheap.\" \n Still, he pinned the bulk of the blame on Russia, as well as Iran, for propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad. \n \"This blood and these atrocities are on their hands,\" he said. \n Meanwhile, the president rejected any notion that the dispute over hacking was disrupting efforts to smoothly transfer power to Trump. Despite fiercely criticizing each other during the election, Obama and Trump have spoken multiple times since the campaign ended. \n \"He has listened,\" Obama said of Trump. \"I can't say he will end up implementing. But the conversations themselves have been cordial.\" \n The president did weigh in on Trump's decision to speak with the leader of Taiwan, a recent phone call that broke decades of U.S. diplomatic protocol. Obama advised Trump to \"think it through\" before making changes in the One-China policy, in which the U.S. recognizes Taiwan as part of China. \n In a moment of self-reflection, Obama acknowledged he had not been able to transfer his own popularity and electoral success to other Democrats. His party is now reeling from the White House loss and failure to win back either the House or Senate. \n \"It is not something that I've been able to transfer to candidates in midterms or build a sustaining organization around,\" Obama said. \"That's something I would have liked to have done more of, but it's kind of hard to do when you're dealing with a whole bunch of issues here in the White House.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama warns Putin before departing for Hawaii"}

The president said he had warned Putin there would be serious consequences it he did not \"cut it out,\" through Obama did not specify the extent or timing of any U.S. retaliation. \n Obama also expressed bewilderment over Republican lawmakers and voters alike who now say they approve of Putin, declaring, \"Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave.\" \n Democrat Hillary Clinton has even more directly cited Russian interference. She said Thursday night, \"Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyberattacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against me.\" \n Obama did not publicly support that theory Friday. He did, however, chide the media for that he called an \"obsession\" with the flood of hacked Democratic emails that were made public during the election's final stretch. \n U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump have heightened the already tense relationship between Washington and Moscow. Separately, Obama has blamed Russia for standing in the way of international efforts to stop the civil war in Syria, where government forces have beaten back rebels in their stronghold of Aleppo. \n Obama said he feels \"responsible\" for some of the suffering in Syria, but he defended his decision to avoid significant military action there. He said that while military options short of invasion were tempting, it was \"impossible to do this on the cheap.\" \n Still, he pinned the bulk of the blame on Russia, as well as Iran, for propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad. \n \"This blood and these atrocities are on their hands,\" he said as he addressed reporters from the White House briefing room shortly before leaving on his annual Christmas vacation to Hawaii. The news conference lasted about an hour and a half, longer than usual. \n The president is ending his eighth year in office with his own popularity on the rise, though Trump's election is expected to unwind many of Obama's policies. He's leaving his successor a stronger economy than he inherited, but also the intractable conflict in Syria and troubling issue of whether Russia was meddling in the U.S. election to back Trump. \n U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded with \"high confidence\" that Russia interfered in the election on Trump's behalf. The president-elect has disputed that conclusion, setting up a potential confrontation with lawmakers in both parties. \n The president rejected any notion that the dispute over the origin of the hacking was disrupting efforts to smoothly transfer power to Trump. Despite fiercely criticizing each other during the election, Obama and Trump have spoken multiple times since the campaign ended. \n \"He has listened,\" Obama said of Trump. \"I can't say he will end up implementing. But the conversations themselves have been cordial.\" \n Trump's election has upended the Democratic Party, which expected to not only win the White House but also carry the Senate. Instead, the party finds itself out of power on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. \n In a moment of self-reflection, Obama acknowledged that he had not been able to transfer his own popularity and electoral success to other sin his party. \n \"It is not something that I've been able to transfer to candidates in midterms or build a sustaining organization around,\" Obama said. \"That's something I would have liked to have done more of but it's kind of hard to do when you're dealing with a whole bunch of issues here in the White House.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama urges Trump to take foreign election impact seriously"}

Friedman said he looked forward to carrying out his duties from \"the U.S. embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem,\" even though the embassy is in Tel Aviv. \n Like some of his predecessors, Trump has vowed to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, a politically charged act that would anger Palestinians who want east Jerusalem as part of their sovereign territory. The move would also distance the U.S. from most of the international community, including its closest allies in Western Europe and the Arab world. \n The president-elect said Friedman would \"maintain the special relationship\" between the U.S. and Israel. \n But the announcement sparked anger from liberal Jewish groups. Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, called nominating Friedman \"reckless,\" citing his support for settlements and his questioning of a two-state solution with the Palestinians. \n The statement doesn't detail how Friedman could work in Jerusalem. However, Trump advisers have insisted in recent days that the president-elect will follow through on his call for moving the embassy. \n \"He has made that promise,\" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters Thursday. \"I can guarantee you, just generally, he's a man who is going to accomplish many things very quickly.\" \n One option Trump allies have discussed would involve Friedman, if confirmed by the Senate, working out of an existing U.S. consulate in Jerusalem. According to a person who has discussed the plan with Trump advisers, the administration would essentially deem the facility the American embassy by virtue of the ambassador working there. \n It's unclear how far those discussions have gotten or whether Trump himself has been briefed on the proposal. Trump's transition team did not respond to questions about the matter. \n Both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush promised to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, but backed away from the idea once in office. \n Virtually all embassies to Israel are located in or around Tel Aviv. \n Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move that is not internationally recognized. It claims the entire city as its capital. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem, home to key Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites, as the capital of their future state. \n Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat told The Associated Press this week that he has been in touch with Trump's staff about the embassy issue. Barkat said his conversations have led him to believe that Trump is serious about making the move. \n Meanwhile, a top Jewish settler leader said having Friedman in the post will provide settlers with \"a welcome ear to hear what we want to say and a direct line to the American president.\" \n Friedman has previously suggested that Trump would support Israel annexing parts of the West Bank, anathema to longstanding American policy. Friedman has also served as president of American Friends of Bet El Institutions, which provides support for that settlement. \n Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy of the Yesha Council, said Friedman has a \"deep love for all of the land and people of Israel, including those in Judea and Samaria\" \u2014 using the West Bank's biblical names \u2014 and would offer a welcome change to decades of American envoys who viewed the settlements as an obstacle to peace. \n Revivi noted that Beit El is a small settlement on the outside of the major blocs in the Israeli consensus, and said Friedman's support for it was indicative of his overall support for the settler enterprise. \n American ambassadors to Israel have traditionally avoided even visiting settlements. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump taps Israel envoy, eyes moving embassy to Jerusalem"}

{"date": "December 16, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, shakes hands with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during a joint press conference in Tokyo, Japan, Friday, Dec. 16, 2016. Russia and Japan agreed Friday to hold talks on joint economic development on four islands at the center of a territorial dispute between the countries. \n TOKYO >> Russia and Japan agreed Friday to hold talks on joint economic development of four islands at the center of a decades-old territorial dispute between the countries. \n It was a small step forward that fell far short of breaking the stalemate in a dispute that has prevented Russia and Japan from signing a peace treaty formally ending their World War II hostilities. \n Joint development \"would help foster trust toward a peace treaty,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe after two days of meetings in Japan. \n Asked about developments in Syria, Putin said he and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are working to launch a new round of peace talks in Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan. \n For Putin, the summit meeting was his first official visit to a G-7 country since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Abe, eager for progress on the territorial issue, invited Putin even though Japan and the other G-7 nations still have sanctions on Russia. \n The dispute centers on four southern Kuril islands, which Japan calls the Northern Territories. The former Soviet Union took the islands in the closing days of World War II, expelling 17,000 Japanese to nearby Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's four main islands. \n Abe said Friday that he has his own idea of what is right for the islands, as does Putin. \n \"If we just insist on our own justice, we can never resolve the problem,\" he said. \"We must make an effort to open a new future in Japan-Russia relations for the new generation.\" \n Putin said he did not know how the dispute could be resolved, but that the islands should be seen not as a point of contention but \"a place that brings Japan and Russia together.\" \n Former island resident Koichi Iwata, 87, told Japanese public broadcaster NHK that change won't come easily. \n \"We are different people. We lost the war, and we feel that we were taken advantage of,\" he said. \"But there is hope. They say win-win, which means that it is good for both peoples, right?\" \n In a statement, Japan and Russia said they will explore joint projects in fisheries, tourism, health and environment on the disputed islands, though details are yet to be worked out. \n An agreement on joint economic development is far from a given because of the dispute over sovereignty. Similar ideas in the past have failed because of that. Russia says any development should be governed by Russian laws, while Japan is pushing for a special framework that in Abe's words would not \"infringe on the sovereignty positions of either side.\" \n \"It's a huge problem,\" said James Brown, a Japan-Russia expert at Temple University's Japan campus in Tokyo. \"There is every chance it will never happen.\" \n The two countries also exchanged a number of broader economic, cultural, science and sports cooperation agreements. \n Russia wants to attract Japanese investment, and Japan hopes that stronger ties through joint economic projects will help resolve the thorny territorial issue over time. \n Putin said Japanese involvement will be crucial to development of Russia's far east. \n \"Russia and Japan haven't had very much economic cooperation,\" Putin said earlier Friday. \"It is necessary to expand the potential of our economic ties.\" \n The talks began Thursday evening at a hot springs resort in western Japan. On Friday, Putin arrived about 45 minutes late in Tokyo because of a mechanical problem with his presidential aircraft. He used a backup plane, according to Japanese media. \n After the news conference, Abe and Putin spoke at a Japan-Russia business forum and visited a judo center before Putin's departure. Putin is well-known for practicing judo. \n Putin refuted suggestions that he is using the territorial issue to wrest economic cooperation from Japan with no intention of making any concessions on the dispute. \n \"I believe, from a long-term prospect, that we could achieve a historic resolution,\" he said. \n Abe said he and Putin also agreed to start discussing ways for former Japanese residents of the islands to visit their hometowns freely. Up until now, they have been allowed to go to the islands only under special arrangements. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Japan, Russia agree on economic ties; stalemate on territory"}
