President-elect Donald J. Trump today picked Viola as secretary of the Army. \n PALM BEACH, Fla. >> President-elect Donald Trump today tapped another billionaire businessman for an administration job, naming Army veteran and fellow New Yorker Vincent Viola to be his secretary of the Army. \n Trump had meetings planned with a group of businessmen and former U.S. government officials as he sought to fill other posts, including that of U.S. trade representative. He met with Robert Lighthizer, a former deputy U.S. trade representative in the Reagan administration, an official said. \n Viola, Trump's choice to be the civilian head of the Army, is a West Point graduate who joins a list of former military men already chosen for the Cabinet. Trump's picks for defense secretary, homeland security secretary, national security adviser and deputy national security adviser are retired military. \n In a written statement, Trump praised Viola, the son of Italian immigrants, as \"living proof of the American dream\" and someone who has a lengthy history of engagement with national security issues. \n Viola grew up in Brooklyn, the first member of his family to attend college. He was trained as an Airborne Ranger infantry officer and served in the 101st Airborne Division. A lawyer, he started multiple businesses and bought the Florida Panthers hockey team for $250 million in 2013. \n Trump announced his choice for Army secretary from Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach, Florida, estate where he was spending the holidays with his family and working on the transition. It came as electors in all 50 states were meeting to formally elect him president, paving his way to take office on Jan. 20. \n Viola would join a circle of wealthy businessmen Trump has chosen for the administration, including fast food executive Andy Puzder to lead the Labor Department, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for Commerce, financier Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary and Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn as his top economic adviser. \n More open posts remain. Trump was also meeting today with Thad Allen, the retired Coast Guard commandant who oversaw the federal response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. \n R.

Peebles is also founder, chairman and CEO of Peebles Corp., a real estate development and investment company. \n J.

{"date": "December 19, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this screen grab taken from video, emergency services attend the scene, after an attack by a truck at a Christmas market, in Berlin today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Police guarded a Christmas market after a truck ran into the crowded Christmas market in Berlin, Germany today. \n BERLIN >> A truck rammed into a crowded Christmas market in central Berlin on Monday evening, killing 12 people and injuring nearly 50 as it smashed through tables and wooden stands. Police said a suspect believed to be the driver was arrested nearby and a passenger died as paramedics were treating him. \n The popular Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church was filled with a mix of tourists and locals when the large Scania truck hurtled into it. Germany's top security official said initial evidence pointed to an intentional act, and the White House condemned \"what appears to have been a terrorist attack.\" \n Police said early Tuesday that 48 people were in hospitals, some of them with serious injuries. \n Mike Fox, visiting from Birmingham, England, told The Associated Press that the truck missed him by about three meters (yards). Fox said he helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands. \n \"You do what you can to help who you can, really. It happened so fast that there was nothing we could do to stop it \u2014 if we'd tried to stop it we would have been crushed,\" Fox said. \n The truck, which was loaded with steel beams, came to a halt on a sidewalk on one side of the market. It had just rammed a large stand called \"Fascination Christmas,\" tearing off one side and knocking down a large Christmas tree. The three-meter tree lay in the street, red and gold ornamental balls still attached to its limbs and a golden star at the top. \n The crash came less than a month after the U.S. State Department called for caution in markets and other public places across Europe, saying extremist groups including Islamic State and al-Qaida were focusing \"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events.\" \n The Islamic State group and al-Qaida have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack crowds. On July 14, a truck plowed into Bastille Day revelers in the southern French city of Nice, killing 86 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. \n Following that attack there were calls to block off and better protect high-profile public gatherings. There were no barriers around the Christmas market on Monday. \n After the attack, dozens of ambulances lined the streets waiting to evacuate people, and heavily armed police patrolled. Authorities on Twitter urged people to stay away from the area, saying they need to keep the streets clear for rescue vehicles. \n Among the dead was a passenger in the truck, who succumbed as paramedics treated him, Berlin police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said. Police said later that the man was a Polish national, but didn't give further details of who he was or what happened to him. \n A suspect believed to be the driver was picked up about 2 kilometers (1\u00bd miles) away, near the Victory Column monument. He was being interrogated, Wenzel said. The truck was registered in Poland, and police said it was believed to be stolen from a building site there. They didn't give a specific location. \n The Polish owner of the truck said he feared the vehicle, driven by his cousin, may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. \"They must have done something to my driver,\" he told TVN24. \n Federal prosecutors, who handle terrorism cases, took over the investigation, according to German Justice Minister Heiko Maas. In Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the United States was in contact with German officials and ready to help in the investigation and response. \n U.S. President-elect Donald Trump blamed Islamist terrorists, though it was unclear what that assessment was based on. He said Islamic extremists must be \"eradicated from the face of the earth\" and pledged to carry out that mission with all \"freedom-loving partners.\" \n But German officials said it was too early to call the crash intentional. \n \"I don't want to use the word 'attack' yet at the moment, although a lot speaks for it,\" Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told ARD television. \"There is a psychological effect in the whole country of the choice of words here, and we want to be very, very cautious and operate close to the actual investigation results, not with speculation.\" \n Even so, some politicians were pointing fingers. Marcus Pretzell, a prominent member of the anti-migration Alternative for Germany party, lashed out at the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying on Twitter: \"When will the German state of law strike back? When will this cursed hypocrisy finally stop? These are Merkel's dead! #Nice #Berlin.\" \n Germany has not experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by the Islamic State group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach, both in the southern state of Bavaria. Both attackers were killed. \n Those attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, helped stoke tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Truck rams into German Christmas market, killing 12 people"}

{"date": "December 19, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n North Carolina legislators will repeal the contentious HB2 law that limited protections for LGBT people and led to an economic backlash, the state's incoming governor, Roy, said Monday, Dec. 19. \n RALEIGH, N.C. >> North Carolina leaders struck a deal today to kill the state law widely derided as the \"bathroom bill,\" after it tarnished the state's reputation, cost it scores of jobs and contributed to the Republican governor's narrow loss. \n Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper announced today that legislators will hold a special session to repeal the law known as HB2 that limits protections for LGBT people. HB2 requires transgender people to use restrooms corresponding with the sex on their birth certificate in many public buildings and excludes sexual orientation and gender identity from antidiscrimination protections. \n Undoing the law would be a step toward mending political divisions that remain raw well after Election Day. Just last week, lawmakers called a special session to strip Cooper of some authority before he takes office next month. \n The state's Republican leaders confirmed they're open to repealing the measure, but in a sign of lingering acrimony, they accused Cooper of taking too much credit for winning their cooperation. \n The passage of HB2 in March thrust North Carolina into a national debate on transgender rights and harmed the state economically. The state missed out on new jobs as companies declined to expand in the state, while cancellations of concerts and conventions exacted a toll. And in a huge symbolic blow to the basketball-crazy state, the NCAA and ACC relocated events. \n Today's surprising events began in the morning when the Charlotte City Council voted to undo a local nondiscrimination law enacted in early 2016. That ordinance, Republicans legislators say, challenged social norms and spurred them to pass HB2. \n \"Senate Leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore assured me that as a result of Charlotte's vote, a special session will be called for Tuesday to repeal HB2 in full,\" Cooper said in a statement, adding: \"I hope they will keep their word to me.\" \n Outgoing Republican Gov. Pat McCrory confirmed he would call lawmakers back to the Capitol in the final days of his term \u2014 but also accused Democrats of using the issue for political gain. \n \"This sudden reversal with little notice after the gubernatorial election sadly proves this entire issue originated by the political left was all about politics and winning the governor's race at the expense of Charlotte and our entire state,\" said McCrory, a former Charlotte mayor. \n Berger and Moore issued a joint statement saying they will take up a repeal if McCrory calls them into session, but accused Cooper of taking too much credit in his announcement. \n They said Cooper and Charlotte's mayor \"proved what we said was the case all along: their efforts to force men into women's bathrooms and shower facilities was a political stunt to drive out-of-state money into the governor's race.\" \n Republicans have defended the bathroom provisions as providing privacy and safety by keeping men out of women's restrooms. Opponents call it discriminatory. \n The law was also seen as a referendum on McCrory, who became its national face. He lost by about 10,000 votes while fellow Republicans U.S. Sen. Richard Burr and President-elect Donald Trump comfortably won the state. McCrory was the first sitting North Carolina governor elected to a four-year term to lose re-election. \n After its vote today, the Charlotte City Council said it remains committed to protecting rights but that it was willing to work with the state to \"restore our collective reputation.\" \n \"The Charlotte City Council recognizes the ongoing negative economic impact resulting from the passage of the City's Non-Discrimination Ordinance and the State's House Bill 2,\" the statement said. \n The council's move is contingent on North Carolina fully repealing HB2 by Dec. 31. \n Republicans have said the Charlotte ordinance had to go first before they would consider getting rid of HB2. \n A repeal of the state law could also end protracted legal challenges by the federal Justice Department and transgender residents. Much of that litigation has been delayed while the U.S. Supreme Court hears a separate Virginia case on transgender restroom access. \n LGBT advocates were cautiously optimistic that the General Assembly would follow through with any repeal, but they also said antidiscrimination protection is an issue more important than politics. \n \"LGBT rights aren't a bargaining chip. Charlotte shouldn't have had to repeal its ordinance in exchange for HB2 to be repealed,\" Simone Bell, the Southern Regional Director for Lambda Legal, said in a statement. \"LGBT people in North Carolina still need protection from discrimination.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Gov-elect: End near for North Carolina's 'bathroom bill'"}

Police later killed the assailant. \n Ambassador Andrei Karlov, 62, was several minutes into a speech at the embassy-sponsored exhibition in Ankara when a man identified by Turkey's interior minister as Mevlut Mert Altintas fired at least eight shots, according to the AP photographer in the audience. \n \"Don't forget Aleppo, don't forget Syria!\" the gunman shouted in Turkish, referring to the Syrian city where Russian bombardments have helped drive rebels from areas they had occupied for years during the war. \n He also shouted \"Allahu akbar,\" the Arabic phrase for \"God is great\" and continued in Arabic: \"We are the descendants of those who supported the Prophet Muhammad, for jihad.\" \n Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said Altintas, who was born in 1994, had been an officer with Ankara's riot police squad for more than two years. Soylu did not give a motive for the attack. \n The gunman approached Karlov as he lay on the ground and shot him at least one more time at close range, according to the AP photographer. The attacker also smashed several of the framed photos hung for the exhibition. There was panic as people ran for cover. Three other people were wounded in the attack, Turkey's NTV television said. \n After shooting the ambassador, the gunman climbed to the second floor of the same building and a 15-minute shootout with police ensued before he was killed, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reported. \n The attack comes a day before a meeting of Russian, Turkish and Iranian foreign and defense ministers in Moscow to discuss Syria. Russia and Iran have backed Syrian President Bashar Assad throughout the nearly six-year conflict, while Turkey has supported Assad's foes. \n \"It's a tragic day in the history of our country and Russian diplomacy,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in televised comments. \n \"Ambassador Karlov has made a lot of personal contributions to the development of ties with Turkey. He has done a lot to overcome a crisis in bilateral relations,\" she said. \"He was a man who put his heart and his soul into his job. It's a terrible loss for us and also the world.\" \n Karlov joined the diplomatic service in 1976. He served as Russia's ambassador to Pyongyang in 2001-2006, and later worked as the chief of the Foreign Ministry's consular department. He had served as the ambassador to Turkey since 2013. \n U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said U.S. officials were aware of reports about the shooting. \n \"We condemn this act of violence, whatever its source,\" Kirby said. \n The United Nations also condemned the attack. \n \"There can be no justification for an attack on an ambassador \u2026 and we very much hope that the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. \n Melih Gokcek, the mayor for Ankara, told reporters outside the exhibition center that the \"heinous\" attack aimed to disrupt newly-re-established relations between Turkey and Russia. \n Relations between Russia and Turkey were badly strained by the downing of a Russian warplanes at the Syrian border in November 2015, but Turkey's apology earlier this year helped overcome the rift.

The Islamic State group fighting in Syria and Iraq has also been blamed for attacks in Turkey, a NATO member and a partner in the U.S.-led campaign against the group. \n Additionally, Turkish security forces and courts remain preoccupied with purging state institutions of the supporters of an exiled Islamist cleric whom the government accuses of staging a failed coup attempt in July. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Gunman kills Russian ambassador to Turkey at photo exhibit"}

She had risked a year of imprisonment and a fine. \n The guilty verdict, even without punishment, tarnishes Lagarde's impressive career as one of the most powerful women in world finance. It raised immediate doubts about whether the IMF's first female managing director will be able to continue in that job she has held since 2011. \n The Washington-based IMF said after today's verdict that its executive board would meet soon \"to consider the most recent developments.\" \n The case revolves around a 403 million-euro ($425 million) arbitration deal given to tycoon Bernard Tapie in 2008 over the botched sale of sportswear maker Adidas in the 1990s. The amount prompted indignation in France. \n Civil courts have since quashed the unusually generous award, declared the arbitration process and deal fraudulent and ordered Tapie to pay the money back. \n In deciding not to sentence Lagarde, the court noted that the award to Tapie has since been annulled, sparing damage to the public purse. It also noted by way of explaining the lack of a sentence that Lagarde was caught up at the time in the storm of financial crisis that engulfed the global economy. \n The court also said that Lagarde's \"personality and national and international reputation\" counted in her favor. \n The Court of Justice of the Republic, made up of three judges and 12 parliamentarians, tries cases concerning ministers for alleged crimes while in office. \n Lagarde, not present for the verdict, maintained her innocence through the weeklong trial. The prosecutor had asked for an acquittal in the case, which began in 2011. \n Christopher Baker, one of Lagarde's lawyers, wouldn't speculate on any potential effect of the verdict on Lagarde's high flying career. A lawyer herself, she served as French finance minister from 2007 to 2011, when she took her job as head of the IMF. \n \"There is no sentence, which means there's no record of this,\" he told The Associated Press. \"The result of this last five years is nothing, which leaves us in kind of a complicated and strange situation.\" \n The special court acquitted Lagarde of negligence in her original decision to put the Tapie case to arbitration. But it found her guilty in a subsequent decision not to contest the amount of the arbitration award. \n The court's presiding judge, in reading the verdict, said Lagarde should have asked her aides and others for more information about the \"shocking arbitration award\" that included a tax-free payment of 45 million euros in damages to Tapie which the court described as fraudulent. \n Investigating judges had alleged that Lagarde committed a series of serious errors in the award to Tapie. \n The amount \u2014 awarded to end years of legal wrangling with Tapie over the sale in the 1990s of his majority stake in sportswear giant Adidas \u2014 prompted indignation in France. It also raised questions about whether Tapie benefited from his political connections, including with then-President Nicolas Sarkozy, Lagarde's boss when she was his finance minister. \n The legal battle between Tapie and Credit Lyonnais over the public bank's sale of his Adidas stake was still unresolved when Lagarde took over at the Finance Ministry in 2007. The first woman in that job, she oversaw France's finances as the global economy plunged into its worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. \n Lagarde ordered that the dispute be settled through a private arbitration panel, instead of regular courts \u2014 against the advice of her own services. The decision led to the massive payout to Tapie from public funds. \n Soon after the award, investigators suspected the whole process was rigged in favor of the magnate. \n In 2013, Tapie, his lawyer, one of the arbitrators and Lagarde's chief of staff at the ministry, Stephane Richard, now the CEO of the telecom company Orange, were charged with gang-related fraud. Lagarde's Paris home was searched by police. However, that case is separate from Lagarde's legal woes. \n Tapie was handed another charge of misappropriation of funds. However, in 2015, a court quashed the arbitration deal, and then ordered Tapie to pay the money back. Last June, the top French court ruled the arbitration was fraudulent. \n The IMF's board supported Lagarde throughout the French legal proceedings against her. They began the month after her appointment in July 2011. She took over at the IMF from another French citizen, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned the post amid sexual assault allegations. \n Elaine Ganley contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "IMF chief guilty of negligence in French case dating to 2008"}

{"date": "December 19, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump spoke during a Dec. 15 rally at the Giant Center in Hershey, Pa. Trump's closest advisers see Democrats' complaints that Moscow hacked their private emails this election season as a case of sour grapes. \n WASHINGTON >> Sour grapes. That's how Donald Trump's closest advisers see Democrats' complaints that Moscow hacked their private emails this election season in a bid to sow discord among their supporters and sway the election toward Republicans. \n The pushback comes ahead of the Electoral College vote, which was expected to make official Trump's election win and pave his way to take office on Jan. 20. \n \"Let's assume it's true,\" Reince Priebus, Trump's incoming chief of staff, said Sunday of Russian interference in the election. \"There's no evidence that shows that the outcome of the election was changed because of a couple dozen John Podesta emails that were out there.\" \n The number of leaked emails by Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, was actually closer to tens of thousands. And it'd be difficult to prove exactly what influenced voters. \n But Democrats said it was a personal attack and a threat to democracy. \n \"The emails were weaponized,\" said Donna Brazile, interim chair of the Democratic National Committee. \"The release of stolen, hacked emails caused a lot of confusion and of course it disrupted our daily campaign life.\" \n Foreign policy experts say part of Russia's calculation was likely a desire for payback for years of U.S. criticism of its own elections and to paint America as a flawed champion of democracy \u2014 potentially weakening it on the world stage. \n \"I would characterize it as a thinly disguised, covert operation intended to discredit the American election and to basically allow the Russians to communicate to the rest of the world that our elections are corrupt, incompetent, rigged, whatever \u2014 and therefore no more honest than anybody else's in the world including theirs,\" said Robert Gates, who was defense secretary under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. \n Gates, who is no longer in government but has met privately with Trump, said he couldn't confirm that Russia was trying to help Trump win. \n But \"I think it clearly was aimed at discrediting our elections and I think it was aimed certainly at weakening Mrs. Clinton,\" he said. \n Trump's transition team and loyalists on Capitol Hill weren't buying it \u2014 at least not on the eve of today's Electoral College vote. \n \"Where's the evidence?\" asked Kellyanne Conway, another close Trump adviser. \n On Obama's vow to retaliate against the Russians for hacking, Conway said: \"It seems like the president is under pressure from Team Hillary, who can't accept the election results.\" \n Trump himself weighed in Sunday evening, tweeting, \"If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names!\" \n Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said an unclassified intelligence review could be released within the next two or three weeks. \n As president-elect, Trump would have access to high-level intelligence on the cyberattacks, although it's unclear what he's been told. Trump has previously called the intelligence finding of Russian involvement \"ridiculous.\" On Sunday, Conway said she wasn't privy to the same intelligence briefings as the president-elect and couldn't say what he knows. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump aides: Democrats' complaints are sour grapes"}

{"date": "December 19, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Protesters demonstrated ahead of Pennsylvania's 58th Electoral College at the state Capitol in Harrisburg, Pa. today. The demonstrators were waving signs and chanting in freezing temperatures this morning as delegates began arriving at the state Capitol to cast the state's electoral votes for president. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this image from video, Electoral College elector Brian Fairbrother looks through mail he has received in Shelby Township, Mich. on Tuesday. Electors are gathering in every state Monday to formally elect Donald Trump president even as anti-Trump forces try one last time to deny him the White House. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Rex Teter, a member of the Electoral College, held two days of delivered mail at his home in Pasadena, Texas on Tuesday. \n WASHINGTON >> There were many protesters but few faithless electors as Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote today \u2014 ensuring that the billionaire will become America's 45th president. \n An effort by anti-Trump forces to persuade Republican electors to abandon the president-elect came to practically nothing and the process unfolded largely according to its traditions. Trump's polarizing victory Nov. 8 and the fact Democrat Hillary Clinton had won the national popular vote had stirred an intense lobbying effort, but to no avail. \n Even one of Trump's fiercest Republican rivals, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, said it was time to get behind the president-elect. \n \"We want unity, we want love,\" Kasich said as Ohio's electors voted to back Trump at a statehouse ceremony. Kasich refused to endorse or even vote for Trump in the election. \n With several states still voting, Trump had 304 votes and Clinton had 169. It takes 270 Electoral College votes to win the presidency. Texas put Trump over the top, despite two Republican electors casting protest votes. \n Befitting an election filled with acrimony, thousands of protesters converged on state capitols across the country today, urging Republican electors to abandon their party's winning candidate. \n More than 200 demonstrators braved freezing temperatures at Pennsylvania's capitol, chanting, \"No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!\" and \"No treason, no Trump!\" \n In Madison, Wisconsin, protesters shouted, cried and sang \"Silent Night.\" In Augusta, Maine, they banged on drums and held signs that said, \"Don't let Putin Pick Our President,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n Despite the noise outside state Capitols, inside, the voting went pretty much as planned. \n In Nashville, Tennessee, one audience member tried to read out some Scripture before the ballots were cast, but was told he could not speak. \n \"We certainly appreciate the Scripture,\" State Election Coordinator Mark Goins said from the podium. \"The answer is no.\" \n With all Republican states reporting, Trump only lost the two electors in Texas. Clinton lost four electors in Washington state \u2014 three voted for former Secretary of State Colin Powell and one voted for Native American tribal leader Faith Spotted Eagle. \n Several Democratic electors in other states tried to vote for protest candidates but they either changed their votes to Clinton or were replaced. \n The Electoral College has 538 members, with the number allocated to each state based on how many representatives it has in the House plus one for each senator. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress. \n Republican electors were deluged with emails, phone calls and letters urging them not to support Trump. Many of the emails are part of coordinated campaigns. \n In Atlanta, Gov. Nathan Deal empathized with GOP electors. \n \"I, too, regret that you have been the subject of harassment by those who perhaps are not as dedicated to the proposition of what this body is supposed to do as they are agitated by the fact that the people didn't do what they wanted them to do,\" Deal told the state's 16 electors, who all voted for Trump. \n In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, elector Charlie Buckels reached out to Trump's opponents after the New York businessman got all of the state's eight votes. \n \"For those of you who wished it had gone another way, I thank you for being here,\" said Buckels, the state GOP finance chairman. \"I thank you for your passion for our country.\" \n There is no constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote for the candidate who won their state \u2014 though some states require their electors to vote for the winning candidate. \n Those laws, however, are rarely tested. More than 99 percent of electors through U.S. history have voted for the candidate who won their state. Of those who refused, none has ever been prosecuted, according to the National Archives. \n Some Democrats have argued that the Electoral College is undemocratic because it gives more weight to less populated states. That is how Clinton, who got more than 2.8 million more votes nationwide, lost the election to Trump. \n Some have also tried to dissuade Trump voters by arguing that he is unsuited to the job. Others cite the CIA's assessment that Russia engaged in computer hacking to sway the election in favor of the Republican. \n \"When the founders of our country created (the Electoral College) 200-plus years ago, they didn't have confidence in the average white man who had property, because that's who got to vote,\" said Shawn Terris, a Democratic elector from Ventura, California. \"It just seems so undemocratic to me that people other than the voters get to choose who leads the country.\" \n A joint session of Congress is scheduled for Jan. 6 to certify the results of the Electoral College vote, with Vice President Joe Biden presiding as president of the Senate. Once the result is certified, the winner \u2014 almost certainly Trump \u2014 will be sworn in on Jan. 20. \n Associated Press writers Julie Carr Smyth in Columbus, Ohio, Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Scott Bauer in Madison, Wisconsin, Erik Schelzig and Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, Kathleen Floody and Alex Sanz in Atlanta, Melinda Deslatte in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Marina Villeneuve reported from Augusta, Maine, and Juliet A.
