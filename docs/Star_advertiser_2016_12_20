Another man, who was arrested in the neighborhood, had led police to the house used by the militants. \n \"Every year, Christmas and New Year's events are the target of terrorists to carry out amaliyah,\" Rikwanto told a press conference, using an Arabic term that's a byword for suicide bombing in militant circles. \n Rikwanto, who uses one name, said police believe those involved in the plot are linked to several militants arrested Dec. 10 on the outskirts of Jakarta who were planning a suicide bomb attack on a guard-changing ceremony at the presidential palace the next day. \n Police have said that foiled plot, in which a woman was to be the suicide bomber, was orchestrated by Bahrun Naim, an Indonesian with the Islamic State group in Syria.

KOJIMA / AUG. 17 \n Since 2010, homelessness in Hawaii has grown 36 percent and veteran homelessness increased 33 percent. \n Hawaii is receiving $11.5 million in federal grants to combat homelessness as the number of homeless people continues to rise, but the state missed out on a grant for permanent housing that could have brought in another $450,000. \n The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced today the money Hawaii would receive for shelters and programs was up slightly from last year. \n \"I would have loved to have seen us be awarded that permanent supportive housing project\u2026Unfortunately it didn't happen for our community this time around,\" said Jen Stasch, director of Partners in Care, a coalition of service providers, government agencies and others that work on homelessness issues in Hawaii. \"We're moving in the right direction to see more federal dollars come into our community, but we absolutely could use more.\" \n Four Hawaii programs that received funding in 2015 were not awarded grant money in 2016, but two didn't apply for money this time because the programs weren't focused on permanent housing, which the federal government is prioritizing with its awards, Stasch said. \n The programs that applied for money but didn't get it were Gregory House, a Honolulu shelter that serves residents with HIV and AIDS, and a program serving veterans in Barbers Point. A new program helping veterans find permanent housing got money, Stasch said. \n On the plus side, the 2016 grants direct more money to programs that work to provide permanent housing Oahu's leeward coast, where many homeless individuals and families live. \n \"It's a matter of bridging what we know with what we practice and making sure communities have the support to move toward best practices, things like permanent supportive housing, rapid rehousing, and investing less in interventions that maintain people in their homelessness,\" such as shelters and transitional housing, said HUD spokesman Ed Cabrera. \n Also, the Institute for Human Services was granted nearly $317,000 for a new program focusing on re-housing homeless youth. \n \"That will allow them to pull unaccompanied youth \u2014 and unaccompanied parenting youth \u2014 off the streets and give them the case management they need and get them connected to permanent housing,\" Stasch said. \n Homelessness has been declining nationwide, but not in Hawaii.

{"date": "December 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A Christmas tree in front of the Brandenburg Gate which was illuminated in the colors of the German flag in Berlin today. \n BERLIN >> The Islamic State group claimed responsibility today for a truck attack on a crowded Berlin Christmas market that German authorities said came right out of the extremist group's playbook, inflicting mass casualties on a soft target fraught with symbolic meaning.  \n The Monday night attack on the popular market by the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in the heart of former West Berlin left 12 dead and 48 injured \u2014 the first mass casualty attack by Islamic extremists carried out on German soil. German security forces were still hunting for the perpetrator after releasing a man from custody for lack of evidence. \n The claim of responsibility carried on the Islamic State group's Amaq news agency described the man seen fleeing from the truck as \"a soldier of the Islamic State\" who \"carried out the attack in response to calls for targeting citizens of the Crusader coalition.\" \n Germany is not involved in anti-IS combat operations, but has Tornado jets and a refueling plane stationed in Turkey in support of the coalition fighting militants in Syria, as well as a frigate protecting a French aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, among other assets. \n The claim of responsibility came not long after German prosecutors said they had released a man picked up near the scene of the attack, initially suspected of driving the truck. \n The man, a Pakistani citizen who came to Germany last year, was taken into custody based on a description from witnesses of a suspect who jumped out of the truck and fled after the attack. \n Even before his release, officials had expressed doubt the man was behind the attack. \n \"We may still have a dangerous criminal out there,\" warned Berlin police chief Klaus Kandt, whose office urged people to be \"particularly vigilant\" and report \"suspicious movement\" using a special hotline. \n Though Germany had not seen any successful mass-casualty Islamic extremist attacks until Monday, attempts and recent attacks in neighboring France and Belgium had made many feel it was inevitable. \n \"We've all been prepared that something like this could happen, so we were not surprised,\" said economics student Maximilian Much. \n The 24-year-old Berliner said the attack hit home because he'd often visited the Christmas market with his girlfriend, but that he wouldn't let himself be led by emotion. \n \"I'm not going to change my life style now,\" he said. \"The chances that I get killed in a car or bike accident are bigger.\" \n Germany's top prosecutor, Peter Frank, told reporters the attack on the popular market was reminiscent of July's deadly truck rampage in Nice and appeared to follow instructions published by the Islamic State group. \n \"There is also the prominent and symbolic target of a Christmas market, and the modus operandi that mirrors at least past calls by jihadi terror organizations,\" Frank said. \n In Washington, State Department spokesman John Kirby said the attack \"bears the hallmarks of previous terror attacks,\" but said U.S. officials didn't have enough information to back up the IS claim of responsibility. \"There is no direct evidence of a tie or a link to a terrorist organization,\" he said. \n The man arrested near the scene denied any involvement in the attack. Under German law, prosecutors have until the end of a calendar day following an arrest to seek a formal arrest warrant keeping a suspect in custody. \n Prosecutors said they decided to release him after turning up no forensic evidence proving he was in the truck's cab during the rampage, and no witnesses who were able to follow him from the scene to where he was picked up. \n Among the injured was Inaki Ellakuria, who underwent surgery Tuesday for a broken tibia and fibula on his left leg. He said he knew immediately it was no accident. \n \"It came fast, too fast to be driving off the road accidentally,\" the 21-year-old student from Spain tweeted only minutes after the attack. \"It has swept me and ran over both of my legs.\" \n Juan Jose Ellakuria told the Associated Press his son also suffered broken bones in his right ankle and instep, as well as damage to his hip. \n \"He's come out of surgery and he's making good progress,\" Ellakuria said. \n Frank, the German prosecutor, said there were still a lot of unanswered questions. \n \"We don't know for sure whether it was one or several perpetrators,\" he said. \"We don't know for sure whether he, or they, had support. These investigations aren't concluded yet.\" \n Witnesses saw only one man flee from the truck after it hurtled through the market for 60 to 80 meters (200 to 260 feet) before coming to a stop near the 19th-century church, which was badly damaged in World War II bombing but left standing as a memorial to the destruction of the war. \n The head of the Federal Criminal Police Office said authorities had yet to find a pistol that is believed to have been used to kill the Polish truck driver who was supposed to be delivering the steel beams the truck was carrying. \n The Polish owner of the truck, Ariel Zurawski, said he last spoke with the driver, his cousin, around noon on Monday and he told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload Tuesday morning. \n \"They must have done something to my driver,\" he told TVN24. \n Flags flew at half-staff on government buildings across the country Tuesday, and in Berlin the national and city flags were projected onto the Brandenburg Gate in tribute to the victims. \n Authorities said that in addition to the Polish truck driver, six of the people killed were German but the others have not yet been identified. \n Germans have been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers last summer were claimed by the Islamic State group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 were wounded in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach, both in the southern state of Bavaria. Both attackers were killed. \n Those attacks and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, contributed to tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants. \n Far-right groups and a nationalist party seized on Monday night's attack, blaming Chancellor Angela Merkel for what happened. \n \"Under the cloak of helping people Merkel has completely surrendered our domestic security,\" wrote Frauke Petry, the co-chairwoman of the Alternative for Germany party. \n The attack also raised concerns of a possible backlash. \n \"No question, the atmosphere in this country will change and become more tense,\" said Tarik Elsayed, the 22-year-old German-born son of Egyptian parents. \n \"Of course, as an Arab I will get more hostile looks, it will get only worse now.\" \n But Tarek Elmasoudi, an Egyptian asylum-seeker, said he wasn't afraid of repercussions. \"The Germans are very nice and I want to stay here.\" \n Already under pressure for the huge influx of migrants, Merkel addressed head-on the possibility that an asylum-seeker was responsible for the carnage. \n \"I know that it would be particularly hard for us all to bear if it were confirmed that a person committed this act who asked for protection and asylum in Germany,\" she said in a nationally televised statement. \n \"This would be particularly sickening for the many, many Germans who work to help refugees every day and for the many people who really need our help and are making an effort to integrate in our country.\" \n \"Twelve people who were still among us yesterday, who were looking forward to Christmas, who had plans for the holidays, aren't among us anymore,\" she said. \"A gruesome and ultimately incomprehensible act has robbed them of their lives.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Islamic State claims Berlin Christmas market attack"}

{"date": "December 20, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Firefighters and rescue workers walked through the scorched ground of the open-air San Pablito fireworks market today. \n TULTEPEC, Mexico >> The San Pablito fireworks market was especially well stocked for the holidays and bustling with hundreds of shoppers when a powerful chain-reaction explosion ripped through its stalls, killing at least 31 people and leaving dozens more badly burned. \n The third such blast to ravage the market on the northern outskirts of Mexico's capital since 2005 sent up a towering plume of smoke that was lit up by a staccato of bangs and flashes of light. Once the smoke cleared, the open-air bazaar was reduced to a stark expanse of ash, rubble and the charred metal of fireworks stands, casting a pall over the country's Christmas season. \n Mexico State health officials said about 60 people were hospitalized for injuries from Tuesday's explosion, including for severe burns, in some cases over 90 percent of their bodies. Today, 47 people remained hospitalized, among them, ten children. Authorities have not yet said what may have caused the explosions which took place in Mexico State, which rings the capital. \n Mexico State chief prosecutor Alejandro Gomez said today the death toll rose to 31, after several people died at local hospitals. Gomez said some of the dead were so badly burned that neither their age nor their gender could be immediately determined. He said the toll could rise because 11 people were listed as missing and some body parts were found at the scene. \n A list of the nine bodies identified so far showed one of the dead included a 3-month-old baby boy and a 12-year-old girl. Gomez said a total of seven male minors were among the dead. \n Survivor Crescencia Francisco Garcia said she was in the middle of the grid of stalls when the thunderous explosions began. She froze, reflexively looked up at the sky and then took off running through the smoke once she realized everyone was doing so. As she ran she saw people with burns and cuts, and lots of blood. \n \"Everything was catching fire. Everything was exploding,\" Francisco said. \"The stones were flying, pieces of brick, everything was flying.\" \n Mexico State Gov. Eruviel Avila vowed that \"we are going to identify who is responsible.\" \n Sirens wailed and a heavy scent of gunpowder lingered in the air well after the thunderous explosions at the market, which were widely seen in a dramatic video. The smoking, burned out shells of vehicles ringed the perimeter, and first responders and local residents wearing blue masks over their mouths combed through the ash and debris. Firefighters hosed down still-smoldering hotspots. \n Tultepec Mayor Armando Portuguez Fuentes said the market was especially well stocked because demand for noisy firecrackers and rockets soars this time of year. \n \"We are obviously in the high season,\" Portuguez said. \"There was more product than usual because we are a few days away from Christmas, a few days away from New Year's, and those are the days when the products made here are consumed the most.\" \n Cesar Ornelas of Atizapan de Zaragoza was only 10 minutes into shopping with his son and his father when he heard the first explosions. He tried to run, but something knocked him to the ground from behind. He tried several times to get up, unsuccessfully, and ultimately his 15-year-old son Francisco had to drag him out. \n \"We didn't look back,\" said Ornelas, who suffered light burns and a large bruise over his left kidney. His white tank top had a fist-size burn on the chest. \"We heard how the explosion was kind of going off bit by bit.\" \n Nearly four hours later, he and Francisco limped gingerly out of the market area. Francisco said paramedics told him his leg was likely fractured by flying debris. Ornelas said his 67-year-old father, Ernesto, had run in a different direction and sought refuge in a nearby home. All the father's clothing was burned, and his face and arm were bloodied. An ambulance had spirited him to a hospital, but Ornelas wasn't sure where it was or how serious his injuries were. \n \"My condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in this accident and my wishes for a quick recovery for the injured,\" President Enrique Pena Nieto said via Twitter. \n A similar fire engulfed the San Pablito Market in 2005, touching off a chain of explosions that leveled hundreds of stalls just ahead of Mexico's Independence Day. A year later, a similar accident at the same market also destroyed hundreds of stands. \n In an editorial today, the newspaper El Universal called it \"the traditional tragedy,' noting \"our country's fascination with fireworks has caused, among other things, a long series of accidents with terrible results.\" \n Portuguez, the Tultepec mayor, said the manufacture and sale of fireworks is a key part of the local economy. He added that it is regulated by law and under the \"constant supervision\" of the Defense Department, which oversees firearms and explosives. \n \"This is part of the activity of our town. It is what gives us identity,\" Portuguez said. \"We know it is high-risk, we regret this greatly, but unfortunately many people's livelihoods depend on this activity.\" \n Deadly fireworks explosions have occurred with some regularity in Mexico: In 2002, a blast at a market in the Gulf coast city of Veracruz killed 29; in 1999, 63 people died when an explosion of illegally stored fireworks destroyed part of the city of Celaya; and in 1988, a fireworks blast in Mexico City's La Merced market killed at least 68. \n Associated Press writer Christopher Sherman reported from Tultepec, Mexico. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Deadly Mexico fireworks blast hits market packed for holidays"}

President Barack Obama today designated the bulk of U.S.-owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing. \n President Barack Obama today designated the bulk of U.S.-owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing. \n The move helps put some finishing touches on Obama's environmental legacy while also testing President-elect Donald Trump's promise to unleash the nation's untapped energy reserves. \n The White House announced the actions in conjunction with the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which also placed a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in its Arctic waters, subject to periodic review. \n Obama is making use of an arcane provision in a 1953 law to ban offshore leases in the waters permanently. The statute says that \"the president of the United States may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf.\" \n Environmental groups hope the ban, despite relying on executive powers, will be difficult for future presidents to reverse. The White House said it's confident the president's directive will withstand legal challenge and said the language of the statute provides no authority for subsequent presidents to \"unwithdraw\" waters from future lease sales. \n The Atlantic waters placed off limits to new oil and gas leasing are 31 canyons stretching off the coast of New England south to Virginia. \n The administration cited environmental concerns to justify the moratorium. The president also issued a statement noting the minimal level of fuel production occurring in the Arctic. Obama said just 0.1 percent of offshore crude production came from the Arctic in 2015, and at current oil prices, significant production would not occur in future decades. \n \"That's why looking forward, we must continue to focus on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond this one sector,\" Obama said. \n Still, industry officials objected to Obama's proclamation, calling it \"last minute political rhetoric.\" \n \"Instead of building on our nation's position as a global energy leader, today's unilateral mandate could put America back on a path of energy dependence for decades to come,\" said Dan Naatz of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. \n In issuing a permanent ban, Obama appears to be trying to tie the hands of his successor. Trump has vowed a domestic energy revolution and is filling his Cabinet with nominees deeply opposed to Obama's environmental and climate change actions. \n Environmental groups were calling for a permanent ban even before the presidential election, but Trump's victory has provided greater urgency for them and for businesses that rely on tourism and fishing. Trump has said he intends to use all available fuel reserves for energy self-sufficiency \u2014 and that it's time to open up offshore drilling. \n This decision will help protect existing lucrative coastal tourism and fishing businesses from offshore drilling, which promises smaller, short-lived returns and threatens coastal livelihoods,\" said Jacqueline Savitz, a senior vice president at the advocacy group, Oceana. \"The people of the Atlantic coast refused to allow their way of life to be compromised and we commend their hard work making their voices heard in Washington.\" \n Associated Press writers Josh Lederman in Washington and Jason Dearen in Gainesville, Florida, contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama bans future oil leases in much of Arctic, Atlantic"}

The man had entered Germany on Dec. 31 last year and arrived in Berlin in February. \n Berlin police chief Klaus Kandt said today it wasn't clear whether the man detained was really the driver. \n \"We haven't been able to confirm it yet,\" he told reporters. \n Berlin police urged people to remain \"particularly vigilant\" and to report \"suspicious movement\" to a special hotline. \n In a statement widely broadcast on German television, Merkel described herself as \"shocked, shaken and deeply saddened.\" \n \"There is still a lot that we don't know about this act with sufficient certainty,\" she said. \"But we must, as things stand, assume it was a terrorist attack.\" \n Merkel, who has been criticized for allowing in large numbers of migrants, addressed head-on the possibility that an asylum-seeker was responsible. \n \"I know that it would be particularly hard for us all to bear if it were confirmed that a person committed this act who asked for protection and asylum in Germany,\" Merkel said. \"This would be particularly sickening for the many, many Germans who work to help refugees every day and for the many people who really need our help and are making an effort to integrate in our country.\" \n Authorities arrested a man about 2 kilometers (1\u00bd miles) from the crash site on suspicion of having been at the wheel of the truck. Footage showed the suspect, his head covered in a white sheet, being pushed into a police car shortly after the attack. Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper reported that the man was known to police for minor crimes. \n A spokesman for Berlin's office for refugee affairs said police conducted a large-scale search overnight at a large shelter for asylum-seekers at the city's now-defunct Tempelhof airport. Four men in their late 20s were questioned but nobody was arrested, Sascha Langenbach told The Associated Press. \n Among the dead was a man in the truck, who succumbed as paramedics treated him, Berlin police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said. Police said later that the man was a Polish national, but didn't give further details of who he was or what happened to him. \n The Polish owner of the truck said he feared it may have been hijacked. Ariel Zurawski said he last spoke with the driver, his cousin, around noon, and the driver told him he was in Berlin and scheduled to unload this morning. \"They must have done something to my driver,\" he told TVN24. \n Germany has not so far experienced any mass-casualty attacks by Islamic extremists, but has been increasingly wary since two attacks by asylum-seekers in the summer that were claimed by the Islamic State group. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach, both in the southern state of Bavaria. Both attackers were killed. \n Those attacks, and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period, contributed to tensions in Germany over the arrival last year of 890,000 migrants. \n De Maiziere said that as far as officials know, the Islamic State group has not claimed responsibility for Monday's attack in Berlin. \n Far-right groups and a nationalist party seized on it, blaming Merkel for what had happened. \n \"Under the cloak of helping people Merkel has completely surrendered our domestic security,\" Frauke Petry, the co-chairwoman of the Alternative for Germany party, wrote. \n Manfred Weber, a member of Merkel's conservative bloc and leader of the European Parliament's biggest political grouping, cautioned against sweeping verdicts but said it was important to ensure that extremists didn't enter the country. \n The German government said Merkel spoke today with President Barack Obama, who expressed his condolences. In Washington, White House National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the United States was ready to help in the investigation and response. \n U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Islamic extremists must be \"eradicated from the face of the earth\" and pledged to carry out that mission with all \"freedom-loving partners.\" \n The attack came less than a month after the U.S. State Department warned that extremist groups including Islamic State and al-Qaida were focusing \"on the upcoming holiday season and associated events\" in Europe. \n The Islamic State group and al-Qaida have both called on followers to use trucks in particular to attack crowds. On July 14, a truck plowed into Bastille Day revelers in the southern French city of Nice, killing 86 people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was carried out by a Tunisian living in France. \n Merkel said Monday's attack would not cause Germany to live in fear. \n \"Even if it's difficult at this hour we will find the strength to live life the way we want to live it in Germany. Free, together and openly,\" she said. \n Associated Press writers David Rising and Geir Moulson in Berlin and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police uncertain they have right suspect in Berlin attack"}

Thick, gray smog fell over Beijing on Tuesday, choking China's capital in a haze that spurred authorities to cancel flights and close some highways in emergency measures to cut down on air pollution. \n BEIJING >> Thick, gray smog fell over Beijing on Tuesday, choking China's capital in a haze that spurred authorities to cancel flights and close some highways in emergency measures to cut down on air pollution. \n Beijing and much of industrial northern China are in the midst of a \"red alert,\" the highest level in China's four-tiered pollution warning system. The alert has affected 460 million people, according to Greenpeace East Asia, which calculated that about 200 million people were living in areas that had experienced levels of air pollution more than 10 times above the guideline set by the World Health Organization. \n Members of the public closely watch levels of PM2.5, particles measuring 2.5 microns across that are easily inhaled and damage lung tissue. The World Health Organization designates the safe level for the tiny, poisonous particles at 25 micrograms per cubic meter. On Tuesday morning, the PM2.5 reading in Beijing climbed above 300. In many northern Chinese cities, the reading has exceeded 500 micrograms per cubic meter. \n State media reported that 169 flights have been canceled at Beijing Capital International Airport, where visibility fell at one point to 300 meters (984 feet). Sections of Beijing's sixth ring road, the outermost highway encircling the city of more than 20 million people, were shut down in a bid to keep cars off the roads. \n Authorities have even removed charcoal grills from restaurants and banned spray painting in parts of the city, state media reported. \n Adding to a sense of crisis, local news in recent days reported that hospitals were encountering a boom in cases of children with respiratory problems and preparing teams of doctors to handle the surge of pollution-related cases. Photos showed waiting rooms crowded with parents carrying youngsters wearing face masks. \n Outside the Capital Pediatrics Institute on Tuesday, parents voiced frustration about the toxic air for throat infections and the flu. \n \"He is coughing and breathing short, and always feeling sputum in his throat,\" said Du Renxin, an IT worker, who was with his 2-year-old, who has had to make monthly visits to the doctor. \n China has long faced some of the worst air pollution in the world, blamed on its reliance of coal for energy and factory production, as well as a surplus of older, less efficient cars on its roads. Beijing and other cities have tried to improve air quality by switching power plants from coal to natural gas and rolling out fleets of electric buses and taxis. \n But despite its public commitment to reduce carbon emissions, China remains the world's largest producer and consumer of coal, with plans to build new factories and increase production. Government officials, facing rising energy prices earlier this year, lifted caps on production days for many mines. \n Since the red alert went into effect, more than 700 companies stopped production in Beijing and traffic police were restricting drivers by monitoring their license plate numbers. Dozens of cities closed schools and took other emergency measures. \n \"The smog has serious repercussions on the lungs and the respiratory system, and it also influences the health of future generations, so under a red alert, it is safer to stay at home rather than go to school,\" Li Jingren, a 15-year-old high school student in Beijing, said Monday. \n In nearby Tianjin, authorities canceled 350 flights and closed all highways in the municipality. Public transportation services were increased as restrictions on cars were imposed. \n Authorities in the northern province of Hebei, which surrounds Beijing, ordered coal and cement plants to temporarily shut down or reduce production. \n The alert is expected to end Wednesday. \n ___ \n Associated Press researcher Liu Zheng contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Smog chokes Chinese cities, grounding flights, closing roads"}
