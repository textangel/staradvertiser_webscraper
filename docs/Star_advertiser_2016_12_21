{"date": "December 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n State Sen. Jay Chaudhuri, D-Wake, spoke on the senate floor during a special session of the North Carolina General Assembly called to consider repeal of NC HB2 today. \n RALEIGH, N.C. >> Amid deepening acrimony, a supposedly bipartisan deal to kill the North Carolina law known as the \"bathroom bill\" fell apart tonight, ensuring the likelihood that global corporations and national sports events will continue to stay away from the state.  \n The law limits protections for LGBT people and was best known for a provision that requires transgender people to use public restrooms corresponding to the gender on their birth certificates. It was passed earlier this year after Charlotte officials approved a sweeping anti-discrimination ordinance. \n The repeal compromise touted by both Democratic Gov.-elect Roy Cooper and GOP Gov. Pat McCrory called for Charlotte to do away with its ordinance. In exchange, lawmakers would undo the LGBT law. \n But both sides balked: GOP lawmakers cried foul when Charlotte leaders initially left part of the city's ordinance in place. And when a Senate bill called for a six-month ban on cities passing similar ordinances, Democrats said Republicans were going back on their promise. The moratorium was modified to last until a month after legislators finished their annual session in 2017, which would likely mean August or later. \n \"This wasn't the deal,\" said Sen. Jeff Jackson, a Charlotte Democrat. \"This bill breaks this deal. Charlotte would have not repealed its ordinance if this was the deal.\" \n The troubles in reaching a resolution exposed the intense distrust within the legislature that has only intensified over the years, especially since Republicans took over control of state government in 2013. Cooper's victory was greeted last week by Republicans acting in a special session to strip away several powers. \n \"This has been a long and ultimately frustrating day,\" Senate leader Phil Berger told reporters after the session ended. \n He blamed Cooper for sinking the deal. Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Dan Blue criticized McCrory for calling the special session a few days before Christmas when there didn't seem to be an agreement. \n Social conservatives were thrilled with the preservation of HB2. North Carolina Values Coalition executive director Tami Fitzgerald praised lawmakers \"who stood up for what is right and represented the will of voters by stopping the move to cower and cave-in to the City of Charlotte and the Human Rights Campaign.\" \n Social conservative groups said HB2 provides privacy and protection for children using restrooms and locker rooms. \n Lawmakers have worked \"hard to protect our families, and women and children from the risk that might be imposed by these lunatic ordinances that the lunatic left in Charlotte and other places want to enact,\" said Republican Sen. Buck Newton, who championed HB2 when it was passed in March and supported it ever since. \n The U.S. Justice Department and others contend the threat of sexual predators posing as transgender persons to enter a bathroom is practically nonexistent. \n \"This was a counterproductive exercise in reaffirming to the rest of the country that North Carolina wants to remain mired in this divisive dispute,\" said Simone Bell, Southern regional director at Lambda Legal, a gay-rights group. \n HB2 has been blasted by gay-rights groups and resulted in conventions, jobs and sporting events like the NBA All-Star Game shunning North Carolina. Corporate critics of the law included Deutsche Bank and Paypal, which both backed out of projects that would have brought hundreds of jobs to the state. \n The law was also seen as a referendum on McCrory, who became its national face. He lost by about 10,000 votes to Cooper. Meanwhile, fellow Republicans U.S. Sen. Richard Burr and President-elect Donald Trump comfortably won the state. \n McCrory was the first sitting North Carolina governor elected to a four-year term to lose re-election. \n Repealing the state law could also have ended protracted legal challenges by the federal Justice Department and transgender residents. Much of that litigation has been delayed while the U.S. Supreme Court hears a separate Virginia case on transgender restroom access. \n Cooper said earlier this week that Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore had assured him that Charlotte's vote to repeal its ordinance would lead to a full repeal. He had lobbied Charlotte's city council to gut its local nondiscrimination ordinance. \n \"The legislature had a chance to do the right thing for North Carolina, and they failed,\" he said Wednesday night. \"This was our best chance. It cannot be our last chance.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "In bitter divide, repeal of North Carolina LGBT law fails"}

In San Francisco, motorcycle and mounted horse units were patrolling in high-traffic shopping areas. \n Frieder Frotscher, who owns a stand that sells German steins, has made the trip to the Chicago market from Sachsen, Germany, for the past 21 years. He said he never considered closing after what happened Monday. \n \"I see all the increased security,\" he said. \"If we don't come that means we would have reached the decision that they (terrorists) want.\" \n In New York, a Columbus Circle vendor said he wasn't thinking about the attack in Berlin. \n \"If something happens like that it could happen anywhere,\" said Armand Altan, 40. \"We are open. There is no X-ray cameras or security checking everybody. Someone could walk inside with the vest or with the backpack, you don't know. So if we think like this, we shouldn't go outside from the home.\" \n Big cities have been fortifying sidewalks since the Sept. 11 attacks, installing bollards and concrete planters designed to prevent vehicles from driving into pedestrians or the side of a building. Parts of Times Square and a two-block stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House have been closed to traffic for years, partly as a precaution against car bombs. \n Other cities added new measures against truck attacks after a man drove a rented, refrigerated truck weighing about 20 tons into a crowd in Nice, France in July, killing 86 people. \n Law enforcement in Los Angeles, for example, has been placing rows of two to three cars or other large equipment in front of large event entrances, including two massive parades this year in West Hollywood, said Scott Edson, chief of the special operations division of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. \n At the upcoming Rose Parade, a nationally televised annual event that attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators, Edson said law enforcement will be using such methods to keep people safe. \n In addition to barriers, police officers will be posted a couple of blocks away from the parade to keep an eye out for any trucks that look out of place, he said. \n \"Nice was the final straw that made us realize that's another piece of protection we're going to have to put in place at major events,\" Edson said, adding that he thinks it's only a matter of time before someone carries out such an attack in the U.S. \"It becomes successful and the bad guys start thinking about it and start looking at how they can do it.\" \n A recent posting in an English-language Islamic State magazine called this year's Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade \"an excellent target\" for a truck attack. That caused enough concern that police used dozens of sand-filled dump trucks to block streets along the parade route. \n The NYPD program involving outreach to trucking companies was ramped up after the Nice attack. \n Since then, the NYPD has reached out to about 140 rental companies and seven truck driving schools in the city, giving them the phone numbers of detectives and encouraging them to use them, said Lt. Lucas Miller, who runs the Intelligence Division program. \n The NYPD has received several calls from truck rental operations since the Berlin attack, Lucas said Wednesday. The companies were checking in, not offering tips, \"but that's just the kind of communication and interaction we want,\" he said. \n Jake Jacoby, president of the Truck Renting and Leasing Association in Alexandria, Virginia, said his group has worked with the Transportation Security Administration and other federal agencies to combat terror. \n The group has distributed a brochure to its members about what should raise suspicions with renters. They include attempting to use cash rather than a credit card and inquiring whether a truck can be modified to carry heavier loads or go faster. \n Anybody walking in without a reservation should also get extra scrutiny and possibly be turned away, Jacoby said. The group even suggests asking customers how they plan to use a truck, he said. \n \"If they have trouble answering that question, that's a red flag,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Berlin attack prompts high security in U.S. cities for holiday"}

{"date": "December 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The HealthCare.gov website, where people can buy health insurance, is displayed on a laptop screen in Washington. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Health and Human Service (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell spoke during a news conference at the HHS in Washington on Oct. 19. The Obama administration said 6.4 million people have signed up so far this year for subsidized private insurance coverage through HealthCare.gov. \n Despite rising premiums, dwindling insurers, and the Republican vow to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law, about 400,000 more people signed up through Monday than for a comparable period in 2015, the Department of Health and Human Services Department said. \n \"Today's enrollment numbers confirm that doomsday predictions about the marketplace are not bearing out,\" said HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell. \n Still, it's too early for supporters of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, to say \"I told you so.\" It's unclear if the administration will meet its target of 13.8 million sign-ups. \n That's partly because the share of new customers is down when compared with current consumers re-upping for another year. \n New customers are 32 percent of the total this year versus 40 percent around the same time last year. Administration officials said they're going to focus on getting more new customers between now and the end of open enrollment Jan. 31. \n Other vital signs for HealthCare.gov were encouraging. \n \"There are zero signs that the ACA's marketplaces are in danger of imminent collapse,\" said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, who has followed the health care law from its inception. \n That carries an implicit warning for President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, who have promised to move quickly to repeal the law. That repeal would be followed by a GOP-inspired replacement. Although immediate changes affecting 2017 are unlikely, the whole process could take several years, creating uncertainty for people with coverage. \n As if on cue, Democratic governors today fired off a letter to GOP congressional leaders, calling the repeal plan \"nothing more than a Washington, D.C., bait-and-switch\" that would leave millions uninsured and shift to states an estimated $69 billion over a decade in uncompensated care costs. \n The statistics released today are for 39 states served by the federal online insurance marketplace. Numbers from states running their own markets have not been fully tallied, and will be added later, raising the total. Toward the end of this month, several million current customers who are being re-enrolled automatically will be added to the count. \n Some of the biggest sign-up numbers so far are coming from states Trump won in the presidential election, including Florida (1.3 million); Texas (776,000); North Carolina (369,000); Georgia (352,000), and Pennsylvania (291,000). Vice president-elect Mike Pence's home state of Indiana had 119,000 residents enrolled. \n Premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan in HealthCare.gov states are going up an average of 25 percent next year, driven by lower-than-expected enrollment and higher medical costs. At the same time, about one-third of U.S. counties will have only one marketplace insurer next year because some major commercial carriers have left the market, and many nonprofit insurance co-ops created by the law have collapsed. \n The impact of premium increases has been softened by the law's subsidies, which are designed to rise if the cost of insurance goes up. \n A study last week from the nonpartisan Center for Health and Economy found that the average monthly subsidy will increase by $76, or 26 percent, from $291 currently to $367 in 2017. \n But that means taxpayers will fork over nearly $10 billion more. The study estimated that the cost of premium subsidies will increase by $9.8 billion next year, rising from $32.8 billion currently to $42.6 billion. \n Even if the law's rising subsidies are working to keep customers in the market, independent analyst Caroline Pearson of the consulting firm Avalere Health said the apparent slow-down in new consumers should concern the administration. \n \"At this time, enrollment appears to be slightly behind the pace needed to reach the administration's goal of signing up 13.8 million people,\" she said. \"However, if more people who are currently in the market renew their coverage, then that goal could still be achieved.\" \n HealthCare.gov's advertising in the closing weeks of open enrollment will be aimed at attracting new customers, said HHS Secretary Burwell. In addition, the IRS will be sending people who paid fines for being uninsured a not-too-subtle nudge, reminding them that they can avoid higher penalties for 2017 by signing up now. \n Republicans plan to repeal \"Obamacare\" early next year, but it could take up to several years to replace it. During the interlude, party leaders have promised an orderly transition to a new system. It's unclear what that would involve, but presumably some of the law's popular provisions \u2014 such as subsidies and protection for those with pre-existing medical conditions \u2014 would be kept in place. \n The 2010 health overhaul added coverage for about 20 million people through a combination of subsidized private health insurance and a state option to expand Medicaid. Several Republican states adopted the Medicaid expansion, including Indiana under Pence. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'Obamacare' holding its own: 6.4M signed up so far"}

{"date": "December 21, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Debris still lay on the crime scene in Berlin, Germany, today, two days after a truck ran into a crowded Christmas market and killed several people. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Tunisian national Anis Amri, who is wanted by German police for an alleged involvement in the Berlin Christmas market attack. Several people died when a truck ran into a crowded Christmas market on Dec. 19. \n BERLIN >> Germany today launched a Europe-wide manhunt for a \"violent and armed\" Tunisian man with ties to Islamic extremists who has used at least six different names and three different nationalities, saying he is a suspect in the Berlin Christmas market attack. \n German authorities had considered him a possible terror threat months before the attack, put him under covert surveillance for six months this year and tried to deport him after his asylum application was rejected this summer. \n Authorities issued a notice to other European countries overnight seeking the arrest of 24-year-old Anis Amri, but initially held off on going public so as not to jeopardize the manhunt. After German media published photos of him and a partial name, federal prosecutors issued a public appeal for the information. \n \"Caution: He could be violent and armed,\" the notice warned. \"A reward of up to 100,000 euros ($104,000) has been issued for information leading to the suspect's arrest.\" \n A separate European arrest warrant from Germany obtained by The Associated Press states that Amri has at times used at least six different names and three different nationalities. He was described as being of average height and weight, with black hair and brown eyes. \n Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere cautioned that Amri's involvement in the attack wasn't yet certain even though documents in his name were found in the cab of the truck \n \"This is a suspect, not necessarily the perpetrator,\" de Maiziere said after briefing Parliament's domestic affairs committee. \"We are still investigating in all directions.\" \n Twelve people were killed and 48 injured when a truck plowed into a popular Berlin market Monday evening in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. Twelve of the wounded were still being treated today for very serious injuries and some were in critical condition, Berlin health officials said. \n The suspect apparently arrived in Germany in July 2015 and has lived in three German regions since February, mostly in Berlin, said Ralf Jaeger, the interior minister of western North Rhine-Westphalia state. \n \"Security agencies exchanged information about this person in the joint counter-terrorism center, the last time in November,\" he said. \n State prosecutors in Berlin told The AP that they launched an investigation of Amri on March 14 following a tip from federal security agencies. \n The tip warned that Amri might be planning a break-in to finance the purchase of automatic weapons for use in an attack. Surveillance showed that Amri was involved in drug dealing in a Berlin park and involved in a bar brawl, but found no evidence to substantiate the original warning. \n The observation was called off in September, by which time Amri had disappeared from his regular haunts in Berlin, prosecutors said. \n Separately, Amri's asylum application was rejected in July. German authorities prepared to deport him but weren't able to do so because he didn't have valid identity papers, Jaeger said. In August they started trying to get him a replacement passport. \n \"Tunisia at first denied that this person was its citizen, and the papers weren't issued for a long time,\" Jaeger said. \"They arrived today.\" \n The claim of responsibility by IS did not identify the man seen fleeing from the truck in Berlin, but described him as \"a soldier of the Islamic State\" who \"carried out the attack in response to calls for targeting citizens of the Crusader coalition.\" \n Germany's top prosecutor, Peter Frank, told reporters the attack was reminiscent of a deadly rampage in the southern French city of Nice and appeared to follow instructions published by IS.

{"date": "December 21, 2016", "text": "WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. >> A retired police officer has been accused of killing four men who went missing during a drug deal this year, and authorities have discovered the remains of four bodies on property linked to him. \n Nicholas Tartaglione was arrested on Monday on charges of murder and conspiracy to distribute 5 kilograms and more of cocaine, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. \n \"While all murders tear at the fabric of our communities, when the alleged perpetrator of a gangland-style, quadruple homicide is a former police officer, that strikes at the heart of civilized society,\" Bharara said. \n Tartaglione, who used to work for the Briarcliff Manor police department and lives in Otisville, pleaded not guilty. His lawyer, Mark DeMarco, did not immediately return a telephone message requesting comment. \n Prosecutors said Tartaglione participated in the killing of Martin Luna, Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna and Hector Gutierrez in April in and around a bar called the Likquid Lounge in Chester while conspiring to sell cocaine. They said some of the victims were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n \"These four men had not been seen or heard from since the day of their alleged murder,\" said Bharara, who hoped the arrest brought \"some measure of comfort to the victims' families and loved ones.\" \n Chester police Chief Peter Graziano said one or two of the victims had been involved in some kind of drug activity. \n He told The Journal News the four bodies were recovered in Otisville, about 60 miles north of New York City, on Tuesday on property rented by Tartagliano. He said the remains were being sent to the county's medical examiner's office for identification. \n Tartaglione, who's 49 years old, joined the Briarcliff Manor police department in 1996 after stints as a police officer in Mount Vernon and Pawling, The Journal News said.

Los Angeles police have arrested a man for investigation of murder and are searching his home for the body of a former reality TV show contestant who went missing over the weekend. \n COURTESY NAEGLE FAMILY VIA AP \n This undated photo of Lisa Marie Naegle was provided by her family to police and news media as they and authorities seek the public's help in locating her. Naegle, 36, was last seen leaving a party in Torrance, Calif. Police on Tuesday, Dec. 20, detained a man for questioning in the disappearance. \n LOS ANGELES >> A body believed to be that of a former reality show contestant was found buried in a backyard near Los Angeles after a man in one of her nursing classes pointed police to the shallow grave as they questioned him in the woman's disappearance, authorities said. \n Lisa Marie Naegle, 36, a nurse, was a losing contestant in 2010 on the E! network show \"Bridalplasty,\" where she competed for a dream wedding and plastic surgery. \n Police said they arrested Jackie Jerome Rogers on suspicion of murder Tuesday after questioning him and that he indicated her body was at his house in the community of Lennox, near Los Angeles International Airport. \n \"We can confirm a body which we believe is Lisa Marie was discovered in a shallow grave at the suspect's home,\" police spokesman Sal Ramirez said Tuesday night. \"The detectives strongly believe it is her.\" \n Naegle taught nursing at West Los Angeles College, and Rogers was one of her students, the Daily Breeze newspaper reported. Police did not give details on their relationship or a motive for the killing. \n It was not immediately clear whether Rogers had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. \n Naegle had gone to a birthday party Saturday night at a beer hall and restaurant in Torrance. Her husband, Derek Harryman, said he got home from work and texted her around 2 a.m. Sunday to see where she was. \n \"Within a minute or two, she called me,\" Harryman told the newspaper. \"She sounded really, really drunk. She said, 'I'm going to get some food and then I'll be home.'\" \n She never arrived. \n Harryman and Naegle's sister filed a missing person's report and launched a social media campaign to help find her. \n The family said a friend who works at the beer hall let them see surveillance video that they say shows Naegle leaving with Rogers and getting into his vehicle. \n \"We went and we looked at the film and she left with him,\" her brother, Rafael Chavez, told the Daily Breeze. \"He told everybody he left without her.\" \n The family said they asked Rogers to tell them what happened. \n \"While he was talking to us and telling us his story, multiple different times he said he absolutely did not go home with her, or did not take her home,\" Naegle's sister, Danielle Naegle-Kaimona, told KABC-TV. \n After the family confronted Rogers with the video, they said he altered his story to say that Naegle had gotten into his car but then got out moments later.
