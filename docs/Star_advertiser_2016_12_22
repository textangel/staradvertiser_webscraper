Efforts were ramped up after the infectious disease caused a major outbreak, beginning in 2013 in Guinea and spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. About 11,300 people died. \n The World Health Organization, which acknowledged shortcomings in its response to the West Africa outbreak, led the study of the vaccine, which was developed by the Canadian government and is now licensed to the U.S.-based Merck & Co. Results were published Thursday. \n Merck is expected to seek regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe sometime next year. \n The experimental vaccine was given to about 5,800 people last year in Guinea, as the virus was waning. All had some contact with a new Ebola patient. They got the vaccine right away or three weeks later. After a 10-day waiting period, no Ebola cases developed in those immediately vaccinated, 23 cases turned up among those with delayed vaccination. \n The Lancet paper published Thursday mostly crystallizes what was already largely known from interim results released last year. The vaccine proved so effective that the study was stopped midway so that everyone exposed to Ebola in Guinea could be immunized. \n \"I really believe that now we have a tool which would allow (us) to control a new outbreak of Ebola of the Zaire strain,\" said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, a WHO assistant director-general who was the study's lead author. \"It's the first vaccine for which efficacy has been shown.\" \n She noted that other Ebola vaccines are underdoing testing, and that a vaccine is also needed to protect against a second strain, Sudan. \n The virus first turned up in Africa in 1976 and had caused periodic outbreaks mostly in central Africa, but never with results as deadly as the West Africa outbreak. Many previous vaccine attempts have failed. Among the hurdles: the sporadic nature of outbreaks and funding shortages. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Final test results confirm Ebola vaccine highly effective"}

But U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer didn't say Thursday, Dec. 22, 2016, how much the owners and leaseholders would receive on top of a buyback or repairs of their cars. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> A federal judge on Thursday warned Volkswagen owners eligible for a buyback under one of the company's emissions cheating settlements not to strip their vehicles of parts before turning them in. \n The German automaker reached a deal this week with U.S. regulators and attorneys for owners on the remaining 3-liter diesel cars caught in the scandal. At a hearing about compensation for those buyers, Volkswagen attorney Robert Giuffra complained that a handful of customers were removing car parts under an earlier deal on a larger number of vehicles with smaller engines. \n That settlement for about 475,000 2-liter diesel cars calls for them to be returned in the condition they were being driven, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said. \n In at least one case, the customer even took the seats and air bags, Giuffra said. \n \"We ask the court to advise class members if they wish to receive settlement benefits, they should not engage in deliberate part stripping,\" the attorney said. \n The nearly $15 billion deal for the 2-liter cars gives their owners the option to have the automaker buy back their vehicle or pay for repairs. Volkswagen also will pay those owners $5,100 to $10,000 each. \n The company has agreed to spend up to $10 billion compensating those consumers. That settlement also includes $2.7 billion for unspecified environmental mitigation and $2 billion to promote zero-emissions vehicles. \n Giuffra said that as of Sunday, more than 100,000 customers had accepted Volkswagen's buyback offer at a total value of nearly $2 billion. \n The second settlement in the emissions scandal came this week for the remaining 80,000 vehicles. Under that agreement, Volkswagen is offering to buy back 20,000 3-liter diesel vehicles. The company believes it can repair the others. \n Breyer said Thursday that the automaker had reached a separate deal to compensate owners and leaseholders of the 80,000 vehicles, but he didn't say how much they would receive on top of a buyback or repairs. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Judge warns VW owners not to strip car parts before buybacks"}

A downtown Tultepec Catholic church hosted funeral Masses throughout the day Thursday for victims of the massive fireworks explosion at the San Pablito Market on Tuesday, that killed more than 30 people. \n TULTEPEC, Mexico >> President Enrique Pena Nieto pledged on Thursday to help rebuild a fireworks market where explosions killed at least 35 people and reopen it next year, while a Roman Catholic church held funeral Masses throughout the day. \n Families packed Our Lady of Loreto Catholic Church in Tultepec in Mexico State, where chain-reaction blasts destroyed the country's best-known fireworks market Tuesday. Investigators have still not announced the cause of the tragedy, which was the third explosion at the market since 2005 and cast a pall over Mexico's Christmas season. \n Pena Nieto visited the injured in a hospital near Tultepec. But it was later at an anniversary ceremony for one of Mexico's independence heroes that the president spoke about the future of the San Pablito fireworks market. \n \"We commit to support all of the artisans, the 300 vendors from this market, to recover or to support them so that they can restart their normal activities next year and we can achieve the reconstruction of that market,\" Pena Nieto said. \n Vendors have said that while they recognize the dangers of the fireworks market, it is their only way to make a living and they would return to work there. \n Safety measures were put in place after the previous two explosions at the market but were apparently ignored. \n Investigators were focusing their attention on reports that vendors displayed fireworks outside their concrete stalls in the passageways that were designed as safety buffers to prevent exactly the sort of devastating chain-reaction explosions that occurred. \n Refugio Leon, whose family ran seven stalls in the market, said vendors commonly stacked displays of bottle rockets and firecrackers outside their establishments in the passageways in violation of the rules. \n \"Everybody did it,\" Leon said, speculating that it may have played a role in the rapid spread of the explosions. \n Video and photos of the stalls from previous years show concrete-block enclosures with open dirt passageways between them. Later photos show the passageways filling up with fireworks and awnings. \n Because it was the holiday season, the market was packed with fireworks and bustling with hundreds of shoppers when the blasts reduced the market to a stark expanse of ash, rubble and scorched metal. Dramatic video of the disaster showed a towering plume of smoke that was lit up by a staccato of bangs and flashes of light. \n On Dec. 12, the city of Tultepec had issued a statement calling San Pablito \"the safest market in Latin America.\" It said 100 tons of fireworks were expected to be sold during the high season, which runs from August to New Year's. \n The city quoted Juan Ignacio Rodarte Cordero, director of the state's Fireworks Institute, as saying that \"the stalls are perfectly designed and with sufficient space between them to avoid any chain of fires.\" City officials said the stalls were equipped with trained personnel, sand, shovels and fire extinguishers. \n But during a recent visit to the market, little of that safety equipment could be seen. And when Tuesday's explosions began, vendors and customers didn't have time to look for it \u2014 or even, in many cases, to run. \n Deadly fireworks explosions have also occurred elsewhere in Mexico: In 2002, a blast at a market in the Gulf coast city of Veracruz killed 29; in 1999, 63 people died when an explosion of illegally stored fireworks destroyed part of the city of Celaya; in 1988, a fireworks blast in Mexico City's La Merced market killed at least 68; and in 2013 a rocket struck a truck loaded with fireworks for a religious procession in Tlaxcala state, killing 17 people. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mexican president pledges to rebuild fireworks market"}

Relations dipped further after Russia last year launched an air offensive in Syria to support President Bashar Assad. \n Both Russia and NATO members have conducted a flurry of military drills near Russia's borders this year. Russia insists it is responding to a growing NATO threat. \n Speaking at the defense ministry's headquarters in Moscow, Putin said Russia should be swift in \"adjusting plans to neutralize potential threats to our country.\" \n He said strengthening Russia's nuclear capability should be a chief objective for 2017. \n \"We need to enhance the combat capability of strategic nuclear forces, primarily by strengthening missile complexes that will be guaranteed to penetrate existing and future missile defense systems,\" Putin said. \n At the same meeting, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu presented an annual report that lauded Russian military achievements in Syria and ongoing efforts to modernize the army. \n Shoigu said Russia has fully covered the Russian border with early warning anti-missile systems for the first time. He complained about increased NATO surveillance flights in border areas and announced plans to send more troops to Russia's west, southwest and the Arctic. \n \"Instead of uniting efforts against the global evil, terrorism, NATO has proclaimed Russia its main threat and continues to increase its military potential around our borders,\" Shoigu said. \n Analysts say Russia's military forces remain materially weaker than NATO armies but are gaining technological ground, aided by Putin's aggressive command. \n Igor Sutyagin, a senior research fellow at London's Royal United Services Institute think tank, said the Russian military was not the world's strongest. But he said Russian military performance was improving in part because Putin wields more control over his military compared with NATO nations. \n \"The lack of restrictions makes them better equipped for combat,\" he said. \"They are stronger because if Putin wants to use them, he doesn't ask advice. He doesn't come to Parliament or to Capitol Hill.\" \n In its annual report on the global military balance, Britain's International Institute for Strategic Studies noted that Russia's use of new cruise missile designs in Syria and other recent military displays showed that it was catching up with the West on advanced weapons systems. \n Putin thanked the defense ministry for its work but cautioned that \"the situation might change very quickly (if) \u2026 we let ourselves relax even for a moment.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Putin: Russia's military is stronger than any potential foe"}

She also is a frequent guest on television news programs. \n Trump called Conway \"a tireless and tenacious advocate of my agenda.\" \n The president-elect has spent part of the week discussing national security issues, including the deadly attack on a Christmas market in Germany. He called the violence an \"attack on humanity\" and appeared to suggest a willingness to move ahead with his campaign pledge to temporarily ban Muslim immigrants from coming to the United States. \n Trump proposed the Muslim ban during the Republican primary campaign, drawing sharp criticism from both parties. During the general election, he shifted his rhetoric to focus on temporarily halting immigration from an unspecified list of countries with ties to terrorism, though he did not disavow the Muslim ban, which is still prominently displayed on his campaign website. \n The president-elect, when asked Wednesday if the attack in Berlin would cause him to evaluate the proposed ban or a possible registry of Muslims in the United States, said, \"You know my plans.

But transition officials did not comment on whether Trump could also push for the overarching ban on Muslims. \n The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for Monday's attack in Berlin that left 12 people dead and 48 injured. On Wednesday, German officials launched a Europe-wide manhunt for a \"violent and armed\" Tunisian man suspected in the killings. \n Conway said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" today that Trump is \"the guy out there saying we need extreme vetting policies, that we need to have a better system vis a vis countries that train, harbor and export terrorists.\" \n \"He said during the campaign long after he originally proposed that that this would be more strictly tied to countries where we know they have a history of terrorism and that this is not a complete ban,\" she added. \n Trump, who addressed journalists Wednesday for less than two minutes outside his palatial South Florida estate, said he has not spoken to President Barack Obama since the attack. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump says U.S. must 'greatly strengthen' nukes"}
