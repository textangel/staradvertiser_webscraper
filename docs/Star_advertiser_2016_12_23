{"date": "December 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This May 17, 2016 file photo shows construction on land owned by Palestinian Mohammad Abu Ta'a, in east Jerusalem. \n UNITED NATIONS >> In a striking rupture with past practice, the United States allowed the U.N. Security Council on Friday to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem as a \"flagrant violation\" of international law. In doing so, the outgoing Obama administration brushed aside Donald Trump's demands that the U.S. exercise its veto and provided a climax to years of icy relations with Israel's leadership. \n The decision to abstain from the council's 14-0 vote is one of the biggest American rebukes of its longstanding ally in recent memory. And it could have significant ramifications for the Jewish state, potentially hindering Israel's negotiating position in future peace talks. Given the world's widespread opposition to settlements, the action will be almost impossible for anyone, including Trump, to reverse. \n Nevertheless, Trump vowed via Twitter: \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th.\" \n The resolution said Israel's settlements in lands the Palestinians want to include in their future state have \"no legal validity.\" It demanded a halt to such activities for the sake of \"salvaging the two-state solution.\" Loud applause erupted in the council chamber after U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power permitted the resolution to pass. \n Friday's condemnation, a day after Egypt suddenly postponed a scheduled showdown, capped days of frantic diplomacy in capitals around the world. \n American officials indicated they would have been prepared to let the resolution pass, despite blocking such proposals for years. Israeli officials said they were aware of such plans and turned to Trump for support. The U.S. president-elect sent a tweet urging President Barack Obama to block the U.N. effort. Egypt then pulled its resolution, with U.S. officials citing fierce Israeli pressure as the reason. Israeli officials then accused Obama of colluding with the Palestinians in a \"shameful move\" against the Jewish state. Washington denied the charge. \n Most of the world is opposed to Israel's construction of Jewish settlements in lands it seized in the 1967 Mideast War. The primary holdout at the U.N. has been the United States, which sees settlements as illegitimate but has traditionally used its veto power as a permanent member of the Security Council to block such resolutions on the grounds that Israeli-Palestinian disputes should be addressed through negotiation. \n Underscoring that unity, Friday's resolution was proposed by nations in four different parts of the world: Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela. It is the first resolution on settlements to pass in 36 years, Malaysia's U.N. Ambassador Ramlan Bin Ibrahim said. \n Explaining the U.S. vote, Power quoted a 1982 statement from then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan, which declared that Washington \"will not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlements.\" \n \"That has been the policy of every administration, Republican and Democrat, since before President Reagan and all the way through to the present day,\" Power said. Settlement activity, she added, \"harms the viability of a negotiated two-state outcome and erodes prospects for peace and stability in the region.\" \n She noted that until Friday, Obama was the only president in the last half-century that did not have a Security Council resolution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict pass on his watch. \n \"One would think that it would be a routine vote,\" Power said. But she acknowledged that, in reality, the vote was \"not straightforward\" because it occurred at the United Nations, a body that has singled out Israel for criticism for decades. \n Chief Palestinian negotiation Saeb Erekat hailed the result as a \"victory for the justice of the Palestinian cause.\" He said Trump's choice was now between \"international legitimacy\" or siding with \"settlers and extremists.\" \n But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office voiced anger. \n \"Israel rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution at the U.N. and will not abide by its terms,\" it said, blaming Obama for failing to \"protect Israel against this gang-up at the UN\" and even colluding with the country's detractors. \"Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with all our friends in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution,\" the statement said. \n In some ways, the American abstention served as a direct reflection of the deep distrust between Obama and Netanyahu. It followed months of intensely secret deliberations in Washington, including what one official said was an unannounced meeting earlier this month between Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, and a spate of fresh Israeli settlement announcements that have wrought exasperation and anger from American officials. \n Trump has signaled he will be far more sympathetic to Israel's stances on the two territories, where some 600,000 Israelis live. His campaign platform made no mention of the establishment of a Palestinian state, a core policy objective of Democratic and Republican presidents over the past two decades. He also has vowed to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which would anger Palestinians and lack international support. Trump's pick for ambassador to Israel, Jewish-American lawyer David Friedman, is a donor and vocal supporter of the settlements. \n The resolution is little different in tone or substance from Obama's view, with the exception of its language on the legality of settlements. Washington has long avoided calling the activity illegal, in part to maintain diplomatic wiggle room for a negotiated solution that would allow Israel to incorporate some of the larger settlement blocs. \n While the resolution doesn't impose sanctions on Israel, it enshrines the world's disapproval of the settlements. A reversal would require a follow-up vote that avoids a veto from the U.S., Britain, China, France or Russia \u2014 a highly unlikely scenario given the current stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. \n In Washington, Republicans were already threatening consequences. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who heads the Senate appropriations panel in charge of U.S. payments to the global body, said he would \"form a bipartisan coalition to suspend or significantly reduce\" such funding. He said countries receiving U.S. aid also could be penalized for backing the effort. \n In a Hanukkah message Friday, Obama didn't mention the matter. He referenced Israel once, noting that Jews there and around the world would soon \"gather to light their Hanukkah menorahs, display them proudly in the window and recall the miracles of both ancient times and the present day.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "UN condemns Israeli settlements as Obama declines to veto"}

Two hijackers diverted a Libyan commercial plane to Malta and threatened to blow it up with hand grenades, Maltese authorities and state media said. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n An Afriqiyah Airways plane stood on the tarmac at Malta International airport as an unidentified man waved a flag today. Hijackers diverted the Libyan commercial plane to Malta and threatened to blow it up with hand grenades, Maltese authorities and state media said. \n VALLETTA, Malta >> Two Libyan hijackers diverted a domestic flight to the Mediterranean island of Malta on today to demand asylum in Europe and create a new political party in honor of the late dictator Moammar Gadhafi, officials said. After hours of negotiations, the standoff ended peacefully with the hijackers freeing all 117 people on board and walking off the plane to surrender. \n The hijacked Airbus A320 flight, operated by Afriqiyah Airways, was traveling from the Libyan oasis city of Sabha to the coastal city of Tripoli when it was diverted to Malta and landed at 11:34 a.m. local time. \n Malta state television TVM said the two hijackers had hand grenades and had threatened to explode them. All flights to Malta International Airport were immediately diverted and emergency teams including negotiators were sent to the airport tarmac. \n Afriqiyah Airways said when the plane reached a cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, pilot Ali Milad was told the hijackers were armed and wanted to land in Rome. Milad suggested landing in Tripoli, the hijackers refused, and a decision was made to land in Malta due to fuel limitations. \n Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told reporters the hijackers wanted negotiators to board the plane after it landed but his government refused and insisted that all passengers and crew be released. \n The hijackers then allowed the plane's doors to open at 1:44 p.m. and a staircase was brought over so freed passengers could disembark in groups. \n In a series of tweets, Muscat said 65 people were allowed to leave, then another 44 were freed, including some crew, all coming out without hand luggage. Finally the two hijackers walked off the plane with the final crew members, including the pilot and co-pilot. \n Muscat announced that the hijacking was over in a tweet at 3:44 p.m., saying the two hijackers surrendered unconditionally. They were searched, taken into custody and being questioned, he said. \n The airline said 117 people, including six crew members, had been on board the hijacked plane. Twenty-five of the passengers were artists, writers and intellectuals from southern Libya heading to a cultural forum in Tripoli. \n Muscat said the two hijackers had one hand grenade and one pistol on them and a second pistol was found on the plane when it was searched by Maltese soldiers. \n In a later statement, the government said initial forensic investigations showed that the weapons used by the hijackers were identical \"replica\" weapons \u2014 imitation weapons that may not actually fire but are difficult to distinguish visually from real guns. \n Police said it was most likely the two hijackers would be arraigned Saturday. \n Late today, security experts were still checking to make sure the aircraft was free of explosives or other arms and Maltese authorities were still questioning the passengers and doing security checks on them to make sure another hijacker was not among them. \n Passenger Ibrahim Bashir told Al-Nabaa TV the passengers were \"trapped\" inside buses at the Malta airport and not allowed to leave. The airline said a chartered plane was being sent to Malta to bring the passengers back to Libya after the questioning. \n Milad, the pilot, identified the two hijackers as Moussa Shaha and Ahmed Ali, who other Libyan officials said were in their twenties. \n The pilot said the men were seeking political asylum in Europe and wanted to set up a political party called \"the New Fateh.\" Fateh is a reference to Gadhafi, who led the Fateh revolution after his coup in 1969. \n After many hostages left the plane this afternoon, one hijacker waved Libya's old green flag from the plane's doorway. \n At a news conference later in Tripoli, Libya's transportation minister defended his country's airport security. \n \"Security breaches happen everywhere and Libya is not an exception,\" Milad Matouq said. \"Despite the security situation (in the country), things are excellent. This is the first incident since the (2011) revolution.\" \n But a Libyan lawmaker disputed the minister's comments, saying he was not surprised that a plane from Sabha was hijacked because security measures were \"messy\" at the nearby Tamanhent airport. \n The Sabha airport was closed after tribal clashes two years ago and its air base was turned into a civilian airport for internal Libyan flights. A small militia from the city of Misrata in northwestern Libya has been guarding it since 2014. \n Salah Qalma, a lawmaker from Sabha, said while the airport has an electronic gate at its arrival hall there are no electronic gates or guards at its adjacent exit gates. \n \"It's very easy for anyone to enter without passing through the electronic gates,\" he said. \n Qalma also said the airport building has no fence or guards outside it and planes on the tarmac are not separated from the parking lot. \n Malta International Airport said it hoped to clear up the backlog of delayed and diverted flights by late today. It said 44 flights were affected. \n Libya, a sprawling oil-rich North African country, has been split between rival parliaments and governments, each backed by a loose array of militias and tribes, since Gadhafi was ousted and killed in 2011. \n Western nations view the newly-formed U.N.-brokered government as the best hope for uniting the country, but Libya's parliament, which meets in the country's far east, has refused to accept it.

The case was initially cast as road rage while Myers taught her 15-year-old daughter to drive in a school parking lot, but authorities later attributed it to a series of misunderstandings and parties mistakenly identifying each other. \n \"My intentions were to take someone bad out, not a loving, caring mom,\" Nowsch said in a nearly three-hour taped interview last year obtained by The Associated Press. \"My intention was to take someone who was going to hurt my family out, not someone's mom, not Tammy.\" \n Nowsch will be eligible for parole after 10 years, but also must serve at least four more years for a weapons enhancement. \n \"Am I going to forgive you? Never. Ever,\" Meyers' widower, Robert Meyers, told the defendant at the hearing. \"I hope for me and mine that you burn in hell and you get what you have coming to you today, because you, mister, are an animal.\" \n Nowsch tried earlier this month to withdraw his guilty plea, but was denied. He requested Thursday that his sentencing be delayed because he didn't have enough time to prepare, but District Judge Michael Villani denied that too, saying the killing stemmed from \"one of the worst chain of events this community has seen.\" \n Getaway driver Derrick Andrews, 28, was sentenced to five to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter and accessory to murder. \n The Feb. 12 shooting appears to have resulted from a series of tragic coincidences. Investigators believe Meyers was shot outside her home after an initial confrontation with another driver. \n That night, she was teaching her teenage daughter how to drive in a parking lot when that driver, who has never been found or identified, apparently threatened to kill the mother and daughter. Meyers' family said she was upset and afraid when she dropped her daughter off and picked up her son, who came armed with a gun. \n They drove around the neighborhood to confront that driver. Meanwhile, Nowsch said he had been walking in a park when he noticed a car following him.

An initial estimate placed the street value of the suspected meth at more than $60 million. \n SWAT and police teams surrounded the house, which was near a main road and a shopping center, while agents examined the bags of drugs, along with drug-making equipment, found in the house and a parked truck. \n Officials said the drugs may have been manufactured elsewhere and stored in the house for distribution. The raids were conducted by the NBI backed by other police. \n Duterte has been waging a brutal crackdown against illegal drugs since he took office in June. More than 6,000 suspected drug users and dealers have been killed, alarming U.S. and U.N. officials and human rights advocates. \n More than 2,000 of the slain suspects died in purported gunbattles with the police, including a detained town mayor, who was said to have hidden a gun and illegal drugs in his cell and reportedly chose to shoot it out with policemen in a clash last month that killed him and another inmate in a central Philippine jail. \n The NBI, Manila's counterpart of the FBI, said in an investigation that the mayor was killed in a rubout by the policemen, who raided the jail, but Duterte backed the officers and said he believed their claim that the mayor died in a firefight despite the finding. \n U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein asked Philippine authorities Tuesday to investigate Duterte for murder after he claimed to have killed people in the past and also to examine the \"appalling epidemic of extra-judicial killings\" committed during his anti-drug crackdown. \n Duterte angrily responded to Zeid's call with an expletives-laden outburst Thursday, saying the U.N. human rights chief has no right to order around a government helping fund the world body. \n \"You son of a bitch I'm paying your salary,\" Duterte said. \"You idiot, you don't tell me what to do.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philippines seizes more than half ton of suspected meth, arrests 6"}

{"date": "December 23, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Russian President Vladimir Putin gestured as he spoke during his annual news conference in Moscow, Russia today. \n MOSCOW >> Russian President Vladimir Putin voiced hope today that frayed relations with the U.S. will improve once Donald Trump becomes president despite his pledge to strengthen the U.S.'s nuclear arsenal. \n Speaking during a marathon end-of-year news conference that lasted the best part of four hours, Putin heaped praise on the president-elect while downplaying any concerns stemming from Trump's support for a strengthened U.S. nuclear capability. \n Putin also used the opportunity offered by the press conference to lambast Trump's rivals in the Democratic Party for seeking to blame their defeat in November's election to hacking accusations against Moscow. \n \"They are losing on all fronts, and are trying to find the culprits elsewhere,\" he said. \"They are humiliating themselves. They must know how to lose with dignity.\" \n Asked how he responded to President Barack Obama's hacking accusations during a conversation shortly before the vote that Russia was involved in the hacking of Democratic Party officials' emails, Putin said he wouldn't divulge details of a confidential talk. \n \"The most important thing is the substance of the information the hackers have presented to the public opinion,\" Putin said, adding that the Democrats should have apologized to Americans over the \"manipulations\" the emails revealed. \n \"The current administration and the Democratic Party's leadership are trying to shift the blame for all their failures to external factors,\" Putin said. \n He pointed at \"the gap in views of what is good and what is bad between the elites and broader masses,\" adding that \"the current administration has systemic problems.\" \n In response to Obama's comment that \"Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave\" upon seeing recent poll results showing that more than one-third of Republicans view Putin favorably, Putin said Reagan would be happy to see his party win. \n \"Reagan would be happy that representatives of his party win everywhere, and he would be happy for the president-elect,\" Putin said, adding with a smile: \"No one but us believed in his victory.\" \n Putin said he was encouraged that the U.S. election showed that \"there are people who sympathize with our views of traditional values, because it's a good basis for developing relations between our two powerful countries.\" \n Putin expressed hope that he would meet soon with Trump to discuss how to improve the two countries' relations \u2014 and would \"definitely\" visit the United States if Trump invites him. \n Relations between the U.S. and Russia have become increasingly strained over the past few years, sinking to their worst since the Cold War. The conflict in Ukraine, which saw Russia annex the Crimea peninsula, and disagreements over the war in Syria have lain behind the growing distrust between the two. \n The Russian leader also reaffirmed his claim that the Russian military is \"stronger than any potential aggressor,\" even though he acknowledged that the U.S. military is bigger. \n Putin said that the U.S. military has \"more missiles, submarines and aircraft carriers, and we aren't arguing with that.\" \n \"We are just saying that we are simply stronger than any aggressor,\" he said. \n Putin said he saw \"nothing unusual\" in Trump's nuclear weapons pledge, adding that the statement is in line with the president-elect's campaign promises. \n The ongoing modernization of Russia's strategic nuclear forces has come as a response to the U.S. opting out of a Cold War-era treaty that banned missile defenses, Putin said. Russia had to either design a similar shield or build new missiles capable of penetrating the U.S. defenses to maintain a nuclear parity, the Russian leader argued. \n \"It's not us who have been speeding up the arms race,\" Putin said, adding that Russia has fully complied with the existing arms control agreements. \n He also noted that the U.S. has been modernizing its tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. \n Pointing at this week's terror attack in Berlin, Putin called for better cooperation in fighting terrorism, saying such efforts between Russia and the West have been effectively paralyzed by Western sanctions against Russia. \n \"We can only fight this threat efficiently if we pool our efforts together,\" he said. \n The Russian president pointed at the evacuation of civilians and rebels from eastern Aleppo as a result of successful cooperation between Russia, Turkey and Iran. He said a cease-fire on the entire territory of Syria must come now, followed by peace talks. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Putin praises Trump's judgment, rejects hacking claims"}

Italy's interior minister Marco Minniti says the man killed in an early-hours shootout in Milan is \"without a shadow of doubt\" the Berlin Christmas market attacker Anis Amri. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Italian police collected evidence after a shootout between police and a man near a train station in Milan's Sesto San Giovanni neighborhood, Italy, early today. Italy's interior minister Marco Minniti says the man killed in an early-hours shootout in Milan is \"without a shadow of doubt\" the Berlin Christmas market attacker Anis Amri. \n MILAN >> The Tunisian man suspected in a deadly attack on a Christmas market in Berlin was killed early today in a shootout with police in Milan during a routine patrol outside a train station, ending a Europe-wide manhunt. \n Italian police said Anis Amri traveled from Germany through France and into Italy after the attack, at least some of it by train. French officials refused to comment on his passage through France, which has increased surveillance on its trains after both recent French attacks and the Berlin massacre. \n Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni praised the two young police officers for their courage in taking down Amri during a routine check of ID papers while he was alone outside the deserted station. But he also called for greater cross-border police cooperation, suggesting some dismay that Europe's open border policy had enabled Amri to easily move around despite being Europe's No. 1 fugitive. \n Amri was identified with the help of fingerprints supplied by Germany. \n \"The person killed, without a shadow of a doubt, is Anis Amri, the suspect of the Berlin terrorist attack,\" said Italian Interior Minister Marco Minniti. \n The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for Monday's attack outside Berlin's Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in which a truck plowed into a Christmas market, killing 12 people and injuring 56 others. It also claimed the Milan shooting. \n In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she has ordered a comprehensive investigation into all angles of the case after it emerged that German authorities had tracked Amri for months on suspicion of planning an attack. \n \"We can be relieved at the end of this that one acute danger has been ended. But the danger of terrorism as a whole remains, as it has for many years \u2014 we all know that,\" she said. \n Milan, Rome and other cities have been on heightened alert since the attack, with increased surveillance and police patrols. Italian officials stressed that the young officers who stopped Amri didn't suspect he was the Berlin attacker, but rather grew suspicious because he was a North African man, alone outside a deserted train station at 3 a.m. \n Amri, 24, who had spent time in prison in Italy, was stopped by two officers during a routine patrol in the Sesto San Giovanni neighborhood of Milan early today. He pulled a gun from his backpack after being asked to show his identification and was killed in an ensuing shootout. \n One of the officers, Christian Movio, 35, was shot in the right shoulder and underwent surgery for a superficial wound and was in good condition. Movio's 29-year-old partner, Luca Scata, fatally shot Amri in the chest. \n He had no ID, no phone and only a pocket knife on him, as well as the loaded 22-caliber pistol he used to shoot Movio. \n \"He was a ghost,\" Milan police chief Antoio de Iesu said, adding that he was stopped because of basic police work, intensified surveillance \"and a little luck.\" \n Amri's death doesn't reduce the terrorist threat to Germany, the country's top security official said. \n The threat \"remains high\" and security won't be scaled down, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said. \n He said the two Milan police officers \"did excellent work and acted with great bravery.\" \n \"I'm very relieved that this attacker poses no risk anymore,\" he said. \n Amri passed through France before arriving by train at Milan's central station where video surveillance showed him at around 1 a.m. today, de Iesu said. A train ticket indicates that he travelled from Chambery, France through Turin and into Milan, an Italian anti-terrorism official said. \n De Iesu declined to provide further information, citing the ongoing investigation. \n Germany's chief federal prosecutor, Peter Frank, said his office is in contact with Italian authorities to establish what route Amri took. \n A Milan anti-terrorism official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly about the investigation, said Amri made his way to the piazza outside the Sesto San Giovanni train station in a suburb of Milan, which is 7.5 kilometers (nearly 5 miles) from the main train station. \n Authorities are still trying to determine how Amri arrived at the piazza because only a few buses operate at that hour. \n \"It is now of great significance for us to establish whether the suspect had a network of supporters or helpers in preparing and carrying out the crime, and in fleeing; whether there were accessories or helpers,\" Frank said. \n Prosecutors also want to know whether the gun Amri was carrying in Milan was the same one used to shoot the Polish driver of the truck he had commandeered for the attack, Frank added. The driver was found dead in the vehicle's cab. \n The Milan anti-terrorism official said investigators also are working to determine what contacts, if any, Amri had in Milan. There is no evidence he ever passed through Milan during his previous stay in Italy, where he spent time after leaving Tunisia in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. \n Amri's brother Abdelkader told The Associated Press by telephone that the family wants to find out the \"truth about my brother.\" He hung up when asked about the family's reaction to Amri's death. \n The family told a crowd outside their house to leave when news of the police shootout reached the central Tunisian town of Oueslatia, according to neighbor Wiem Khemili. Police stood guard around the impoverished town, where everyone was talking about Amri. \n Amri served 3\u00bd years in Italy for setting a fire at a refugee center and making threats, among other things \u2014 but authorities apparently detected no signs that he was becoming radicalized. He was repeatedly transferred among Sicilian prisons for bad conduct, with prison records saying he bullied inmates and tried to spark insurrections. \n His mother said he went from there to Switzerland and then to Germany last year. \n Authorities in Germany deemed him a potential threat long before the Berlin market attack, and even kept him under covert surveillance for six months this year. \n Authorities said he has used at least six different names and three nationalities in his travels around Europe. \n They had been trying to deport him after his asylum application was rejected in July but were unable to do so because he lacked valid identity papers and Tunisia initially denied that he was a citizen. \n Merkel said she spoke with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi and told him that the repatriation of Tunisians who aren't entitled to residency in Germany needs to be stepped up. \n Essebsi firmly condemned the \"cowardly terrorist act\" in Berlin and called for tighter cooperation to fight \"the plague of terrorism that threatens the security and stability of all countries and all societies.\" \n Tunisian authorities have insisted the reason it took so long to issue Amri's papers is that they needed to carry out all necessary verifications of his identity, noting that his numerous aliases made this especially important. \n Frank Jordans and Geir Moulson in Berlin, and Bouazza ben Bouazza in Tunis, Tunisia, contributed.  \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Berlin truck attack suspect killed in Milan police shootout"}
