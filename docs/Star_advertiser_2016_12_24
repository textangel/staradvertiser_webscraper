{"date": "December 24, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Weather specialist Benison Estareja shows the track of Tropical Storm Nock-Ten during a press conference in Quezon city, north of Manila, Philippines. \n MANILA, Philippines >> A powerful typhoon is on its way to slam into the eastern Philippines on Christmas Day as officials struggled to divert people's attention from family celebrations and travel. A provincial governor offered roasted pigs to entice villagers to move to emergency shelters. \n Typhoon Nock-Ten packed maximum sustained winds of 185 kilometers (114 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 255 kph (158 mph), and was expected to smash into the island province of Catanduanes Sunday night. It's then forecast to blow westward across the southern portion of the main Luzon island and pass close to the capital, Manila, on Monday, before exiting into the South China Sea. Nock-Ten may weaken after landfall and hitting the Sierra Madre mountain range in southern Luzon. \n Heavy rainfall, destructive winds and battering waves were threatening heavily populated rural and urban regions, where the Philippine weather agency raised typhoon warnings. Officials warned of storm surges in coastal villages, flash floods and landslides and asked villagers to evacuate to safer grounds. \n But Christmas is the biggest holiday in the country, Asia's bastion of Catholicism, giving officials a hard time getting people's attention away from the holidays to heed the warnings. With many refusing to leave high-risk communities, some officials said they decided to carry out forced evacuations. \n In the past 65 years, seven typhoons have struck the Philippines on Christmas Day, according to the government's weather agency. \n Gov. Miguel Villafuerte of Camarines Sur, which is on the typhoon's forecast path, offered roast pigs, a popular Christmas delicacy locally called \"lechon,\" in evacuation centers to entice villagers to move to emergency shelters. \n \"I know it's Christmas \u2026 but this is a legit typhoon,\" Villafuerte tweeted on Christmas Eve. \"Please evacuate, we'll be having lechon at evacuation centers.\" \n Camarines Sur officials targeted about 50,000 families \u2014 some 250,000 people \u2014 for evacuation by Saturday night, but the number of those who responded was far below expectations. \n In Catanduanes province, Vice Gov. Shirley Abundo said she has ordered a forced evacuation of villagers, saying some \"are really hard-headed, they don't want to leave their houses because it's Christmas.\" \n \"We need to do this by force, we need to evacuate them now,\" she told ABS-CBN television. \n The Department of Social Welfare and Development, which helps oversee government response during disasters, said only about 4,200 people were reported to have moved to six evacuation centers by Sunday morning in the Bicol region that includes Camarines Sur. She expects more people to heed evacuation orders as the weather begins to deteriorate. \n \"It's difficult to force celebrations when our lives will be put at risk. Please prioritize safety and take heed of warnings by local government units,\" welfare official Felino Castro told The Associated Press by telephone. \n He said food, water and other emergency supplies had been pre-positioned in areas expected to be lashed by the typhoon. His department was to activate an emergency cluster composed of the military, police, coast guard and other agencies Sunday to oversee disaster-response plans. \n About 20 typhoons and storms, mostly from the Pacific, lash the Philippine archipelago each year and provincial governments have long laid down a contingency system to launch war-like logistical preparations each time a major typhoon approaches. \n But in an impoverished nation of more than 100 million people, where many live near the coast and on and around mountains and volcanoes, deadly natural catastrophes are a part of life in one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. \n In November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan struck the central Philippines with ferocious power, leaving more than 7,300 people dead and missing and displacing more than 5 million others after leveling entire villages despite days of dire warnings by government officials. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philippines braces for Christmas storm, offers roasted pigs"}

{"date": "December 24, 2016", "text": "MOSCOW >> A Russian plane carrying 92 people to an air base in Syria crashed Sunday into the Black Sea minutes after taking off from the city of Sochi, Russia's Defense Ministry said. Thousands of rescue workers were searching the undersea crash site but there appeared to be no survivors. Those on board included dozens of members of Russia's world-famous army choir. \n The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known. At least one expert cited a terror attack as a possible reason \u2014 a scenario rejected by Russian officials. \n In all, 84 passengers and eight crew members were on the Tu-154 plane when it disappeared from radar two minutes after taking off in good weather. Emergency crews found fragments of the plane about 1.5 kilometers (less than one mile) from shore and by Sunday afternoon, rescue teams had already recovered 10 bodies. \n The plane belonged to the Defense Ministry and was taking the Alexandrov Ensemble to a New Year's concert at Hemeimeem air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia. Those on board also included nine Russian journalists and a Russian doctor famous for her work in war zones. New Year's is the main holiday for most Russians. \n Russian President Vladimir Putin went on television to declare Monday a nationwide day of mourning. \n \"We will conduct a thorough investigation into the reasons and will do everything to support the victims' families,\" Putin said. \n More than 3,000 people \u2014 including dozens of divers \u2014 worked from 27 ships and several helicopters to search the crash site, according to the Defense Ministry. Drones were also flown over to help spot bodies and debris. About 100 more divers were being flown in from naval facilities across Russia, and powerful spotlights were brought in so the search could continue around the clock. \n Magomed Tolboyev, a decorated Russian test pilot, said the circumstances of the crash indicated that all on board had died. \n \"There is no chance to survive in such situation,\" he said, according to the Interfax news agency. \"The plane gets instantly blown into pieces.\" \n The Tu-154 is a Soviet-built three-engine airliner designed in the late 1960s. More than 1,000 have been built, and they have been used extensively by carriers in Russia and worldwide. The plane that crashed was built in 1983, and underwent factory check-ups and maintenance in 2014 and earlier this year, according to the Defense Ministry. \n Viktor Ozerov, head of the defense affairs committee in the upper house of the Russian parliament, said the crash could have been caused by a technical malfunction or a crew error. He said it could not have been a terror attack because the plane was operated by the Russian military. \n \"I totally exclude\" the idea of an attack bringing down the plane, he said according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. \n However, some experts contested Ozerov's claim, saying the crew's failure to report a malfunction pointed at a possible terror attack. \n \"Possible malfunctions \u2026 certainly wouldn't have prevented the crew from reporting them,\" Vitaly Andreyev, a former senior Russian air traffic controller, told RIA Novosti, adding that it points at an \"external impact.\" \n Russian planes have been brought down previously by terror attacks. \n In October 2015, a Russian passenger plane carrying mostly Russian tourists back from vacation in Egypt was brought down by a bomb over the Sinai, killing all 224 people aboard. Officials said the explosive device was planted in the plane's luggage compartment. The local affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility. \n In August 2004, two Russian planes were blown up in the skies over Russia by suicide bombers, killing 89 people. A Chechen warlord claimed responsibility for the twin attacks, which happened on the same day. \n The Russian military has repeatedly flown groups of Russian singers and artists to perform at Hemeimeem, which serves as the main hub for the Russian air campaign in Syria. \n The passenger list for the Sochi plane released by the Defense Ministry included 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, including its leader, Valery Khalilov. The ensemble, often referred to as the Red Army choir, is the official choir of the Russian military and also includes a band and a dance company. The choir sang \"Get Lucky\" at the opening of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games that Russia hosted in Sochi, becoming an instant online sensation. \n The damage to the choir was reported to be extensive. Viktor Yeliseyev, head of the rival choir of the Russian National Guard, said \"most singers of the choir have died.\" \n Also on board was Yelizaveta Glinka, a Russian doctor who has won wide acclaim for her charity work, which has included missions to war zones in eastern Ukraine and Syria. Her foundation said Glinka was accompanying a shipment of medicine for a hospital in Syria. \n Putin presented Glinka with an award earlier this month. \n \"We never feel sure that we will come back alive,\" she said at the Kremlin award ceremony. \"But we are sure that kindness, compassion and charity are stronger than any weapon.\" \n Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the crash as a \"terrible tragedy.\" Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was personally coordinating the rescue efforts. \n In recent years, Russian airlines have replaced their Tu-154s with more modern planes, but the military and some other government agencies in Russia have continued to use them. While noisy and fuel-guzzling by modern standards, the plane has been popular with crews that appreciate its maneuverability and ruggedness. \n \"It's an excellent plane, which has proven its reliability during decades of service,\" veteran pilot Oleg Smirnov said in televised remarks. \n In April 2010, a Tu-154 carrying Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others crashed while trying to land at a sporadically used military airport in Smolensk in western Russia, killing everyone on board. Investigations by both Polish and Russian experts blamed pilot error in bad weather conditions, but Polish authorities have launched a new probe. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Russian plane carrying 92 crashes in Black Sea; 10 dead seen"}

Trump Foundation amid efforts to eliminate any conflicts of interest before he takes office next month. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump takes a question from a member of the media at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Fla., Wednesday, Dec. 21, 2016. Trump on Thursday abruptly called for the United States to \"greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability\" until the rest of the world \"comes to its senses\" regarding nuclear weapons. Trump made the statement on Twitter and did not expand on either the actions he wants the U.S. to take or the issues he sees around the world. \n WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. >> President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday he will dissolve his charitable foundation amid efforts to eliminate any conflicts of interest before he takes office next month. \n The revelation comes as the New York attorney general's office investigates the foundation following media reports that foundation spending went to benefit Trump's campaign. \n Trump said in a statement that he has directed his counsel to take the necessary steps to implement the dissolution of the Donald J. Trump Foundation, saying that it operated \"at essentially no cost for decades, with 100 percent of the money going to charity.\" \n \"The foundation has done enormous good works over the years in contributing millions of dollars to countless worthy groups, including supporting veterans, law enforcement officers and children,\" he said in a statement. \n \"I will be devoting so much time and energy to the presidency and solving the many problems facing our country and the world. I don't want to allow good work to be associated with a possible conflict of interest,\" he said. \n Trump said he will pursue philanthropic efforts in other ways, bu didn't elaborated on how he'd do so. \n A 2015 tax return posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar shows the Donald J. Trump Foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of IRS regulations \u2014 not only during 2015, but in prior years. \n Those regulations prohibit self-dealing by the charity. That's broadly defined as using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation. \n The tax filing doesn't provide details on the violations. Whether Trump benefited from the foundation's spending has been the subject of an investigation by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. \n In September, Schneiderman disclosed that his office has been investigating Trump's charity to determine whether it has abided by state laws governing nonprofits. \n Documents obtained by The Associated Press in September showed Schneiderman's scrutiny of The Donald J. Trump Foundation dated back to at least June, when his office formally questioned the donation made by the charity to a group supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. \n Amy Spitalnick, press secretary for Schneiderman's office, said Saturday that the foundation \"cannot legally dissolve\" until the investigation is complete. \n Trump's announcement to dissolve his own foundation came a day after the president-elect took to Twitter to declare it a \"ridiculous shame\" that his son Eric will have to stop soliciting funds for his charitable foundation, the Eric Trump Foundation, because of a conflict of interest. \n \"My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with my presidency,\" Trump tweeted. \"He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop.

{"date": "December 24, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n National emblems still hold meaning, but Europe's open borders seem to symbolize liberty and forward thinking for the region, although they increasingly look like the continent's Achilles' heel, with its inability to implement cross border security. \n PARIS >> Europe's open borders symbolize liberty and forward thinking for many residents \u2014 but they increasingly look like the continent's Achilles' heel. \n Europe's No. 1 terrorism suspect crossed at least two borders this week despite an international manhunt, and was felled only by chance, in a random ID check in a Milan suburb. The bungled chase for Berlin market attack suspect Anis Amri is just one example of recent cross-border security failures that are emboldening nationalists fed up with European unity. Extremist violence, they argue, is too high a price to pay for the freedom to travel easily. \n Defenders of the EU's border-free zone say the security failures show the need for more cooperation among European governments, even shared militaries \u2014 not new barriers. Hidebound habits of hoarding intelligence within centuries-old borders, they contend, are part of the problem. \n But their arguments are easily drowned out by the likes of far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who is hoping to win France's presidency in May. \n \"The myth of total free movement in Europe, which my rivals are clinging to in this presidential election, should be definitively buried. Our security depends on it,\" she said in a statement Friday, calling Europe's free-travel zone a \"total security catastrophe.\" \n That poses a dilemma for European Union devotees like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, facing a re-election battle next year. \n Merkel's defense of the EU, and the welcoming hand she extended to Syrian war refugees, were once seen as assets, signs of her moral authority. Today, with anti-immigrant, anti-establishment sentiment rising across Europe, they are threatening to become liabilities. \n Millions of people cross borders in the 26-country Schengen travel zone every day, thanks to a 31-year-old system encompassing nearly 400 million people that has dramatically boosted trade and job prospects across the world's largest collective economy. \n It's a pillar of a system designed to prevent new world wars \u2014 a system that's under growing strain. While EU countries debated over how to manage an influx of migrants last year, eastern nations rebuilt fences and exposed EU weaknesses. \n The German far right is insisting on closing the country's borders. Merkel's conservatives are suggesting \"transit zones\" to hold migrants at the borders while their identities are confirmed, and making it easier to hold people in pre-deportation detention. \n Berlin truck attacker Amri is a painful example of how Islamic extremists have used Europe's open borders to attack the principles of tolerance they're meant to epitomize. \n After migrating illegally from Tunisia in 2011, he was imprisoned for burning down a migrant detention center in Italy. When freed, attempts to deport him to Tunisia failed for bureaucratic reasons. He subsequently traveled to Switzerland and then Germany, where he apparently fell under the influence of a radical network accused of recruiting for the Islamic State group. \n Although Germany rejected his asylum application last summer and flagged him as a potential terror threat, authorities patiently waited for Tunisia to produce the required paperwork before deporting him. \n And just as the deportation was being finalized Monday, Amri is believed to have hijacked a truck and rammed it into holiday crowds at a Berlin Christmas market, killing 12 and wounding dozens. \n He evaded an international manhunt for more than three days, slipping apparently into France \u2014 possibly with a pistol in his pocket \u2014 and then Italy before stumbling into a standard ID check in suburban Milan, where he died in a police shootout. \n Germany, France and Italy have failed to explain how he escaped the dragnet. \n \"Movement from one country to another in Europe is easy, especially for someone like Anis Amri, who had lived in Europe for several years\" and knew which borders were easier to cross, said Tunisian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bouraoui Limam. \n France is especially embarrassed. \n It's been under high security as part of a state of emergency since last year. It's acutely aware of the risks of violence on trains, after American passengers thwarted an attack on a Paris-Amsterdam train in 2015. \n Yet French President Francois Hollande visited the Alpine town of Chambery on the same day that Amri is believed to have passed through its train station en route to Italy, unnoticed by border guards or the president's security detail. \n The next morning, as Italian police were identifying Amri's body, France's interior minister visited a Paris train station to talk about the vigorous transport security in place for the holidays. \n France's far right and the conservative opposition have assailed the Socialist government as lax. \n \"How could this person enter in Europe without being monitored? How could we let him settle in Europe?\" said Eric Ciotti, lawmaker for the Republicans. \n What's worse, it's not the first time. \n Last year, hours after IS extremists killed 130 people at multiple targets in Paris, key suspect Salah Abdeslam fled to Belgium despite increased checks on both the French and Belgian borders. It took authorities four months to find him. Further, Abdeslam, a French national, had traveled through the Italian port of Bari on a roundtrip journey to Greece in August, months before the attack. \n And in 2014, Mehdi Nemmouche allegedly killed four people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, then crossed into France and traveled to the Mediterranean city of Marseille before being picked up in a police check. \n Security and migration will be central issues in elections in the coming year in Germany, France and the Netherlands \u2014 all founding nations of the EU. And related fears could be key to fueling opposition calls for an early election in Italy after its recent political crisis. \n The leader of Italy's anti-migrant Northern League, Matteo Salvini, called Saturday for closing and reinforcing Europe's borders after the latest terror attack. \n \"I don't want another two or three massacres before Europe wakes up,\" Salvini said. \n A candidate for France's left-wing primary next month, Vincent Peillon, pleaded for joint European rules on borders, defense and intelligence. \n \"It's all of Europe that is being attacked,\" he said. \n Le Pen's far-right National Front party wants to retrench rather than reach out, to \"give France back full control over its sovereignty.\" \n As Europeans head home for the holidays, many crossing multiple borders on the way without showing a single passport or changing any currency, people are asking themselves: Is it all worth it? \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "After Berlin attack, Europe weighs freedom against security"}

{"date": "December 24, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Thursday, Aug. 4, 2016 photo, sap runs out of a frankincense tree near Mader Moge, Somaliland, a breakaway region of Somalia. The last wild frankincense forests on Earth are under threat as prices rise with the global appetite for essential oils. Overharvesting has trees dying off faster than they can replenish, putting the ancient resin trade at risk. \n ERIGAVO, Somalia >> In a tradition dating to Biblical times, men rise at dawn in the rugged Cal Madow mountains of Somaliland in the Horn of Africa to scale rocky outcrops in search of the prized sap of wild frankincense trees. \n Bracing against high winds, Musse Ismail Hassan climbs with his feet wrapped in cloth to protect against the sticky resin. With a metal scraper, he chips off bark and the tree's white sap bleeds into the salty air. \"My father and grandfather were both doing this job,\" said Hassan, who like all around here is Muslim. \"We heard that it was with Jesus.\" \n When dried and burned, the sap produces a fragrant smoke which perfumes churches and mosques around the world. Frankincense, along with gold and myrrh, was brought by the Three Kings as gifts in the Gospel account of the birth of Jesus. \n But now these last intact wild frankincense forests on Earth are under threat as prices have shot up in recent years with the global appetite for essential oils. Overharvesting has led to the trees dying off faster than they can replenish, putting the ancient resin trade at risk. \n \"(Frankincense) is something that is literally given by God to humanity, so if we don't preserve it, if we don't take care of it, if we don't look after it, we will lose that,\" said Shukri Ismail, Somaliland's minister of environment and rural development. \n The Cal Madow mountains, which rise from the Gulf of Aden in sheer cliff faces reaching over 8,000 feet (2,440 meters), are part of Somaliland, an autonomous republic in Somalia's northwest. The frankincense trade is Somaliland's largest source of government revenue after livestock and livestock products, Ismail said. \n Harvesting frankincense is risky. The trees can grow high on cliff edges, shallow roots gripping bare rock slithering with venomous snakes. Harvesters often slip and tumble down canyon walls. \n \"Every year people either break both legs or die. Those casualties are so often,\" said Hassan, adding that he wished he had proper ropes and climbing gear. \"It's a very dangerous job, but we don't have any alternative.\" \n Once the resin is collected, women sort the chunks by color and size. The various classes of resin are shipped to Yemen, Saudi Arabia and eventually Europe and America. Besides its use as incense, frankincense gum is distilled into oil for use in perfumes, skin lotions, medicine and chewing gum. \n In the last six years, prices for raw frankincense have shot up from around $1 per kilogram to $5 to $7, said Anjanette DeCarlo, an ecologist and director of Conserve Cal Madow, an environmental group. \n The rise in demand is the result of stronger marketing in the essential oils industry, which labels frankincense as the \"King of Essential Oils,\" DeCarlo said. The dwindling supply of high-quality resin, and competition between exporters, also are factors. \n Now over-tapping is destroying the trees across the Cal Madow, as tappers try to extract as much sap as possible and make too many cuts per tree. They also tap the trees year-round rather than seasonally, preventing the trees from recovering. \n \"The death rate of the adult trees is alarming,\" DeCarlo said. \"There is potential for regeneration, but it takes about 40 years or so for these trees to become viable for tapping if it's done right.\" \n Officials worry the ancient trade could disappear. \n \"Frankincense that the pharaohs were using came from here, so you could imagine it has a history, it has a rich history,\" Ismail said. \"I'm afraid that we will lose that rich history.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "World's last wild frankincense forests are under threat"}

Volunteers are answering phone calls and emails and posting updates about Santa's storybook world tour on Facebook and Twitter. \n Navy Lt. Cmdr. Paul Noel said 1,500 volunteers answered nearly 141,000 phone calls and more than 2,800 emails last year.

When he figured out he was talking to a little boy, he pretended he was Santa. \n More children called, and Shoup instructed airmen to play along. \n It's now a tradition, beloved by kids and the military. Volunteers range from generals and admirals to enlisted men and women, who sometimes report for telephone duty in military uniform and a Santa hat. \n ___ \n WHAT IS NORAD? \n The North American Aerospace Defense Command is a joint U.S.-Canada operation that defends the sky over both nations and monitors sea approaches.

{"date": "December 24, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Congressional Republicans are planning a massive overhaul of the nation's tax system in 2017, a heavy political lift that could ultimately affect families at every income level and businesses of every size. \n WASHINGTON >> Congressional Republicans are planning a massive overhaul of the nation's tax system next year, a heavy political lift that could ultimately affect families at every income level and businesses of every size. \n Their goal is to simplify a complicated tax code that rewards wealthy people with smart accountants, and corporations that can easily shift profits \u2014 and jobs \u2014 overseas. It won't be easy. The last time it was done was 30 years ago. \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., have vowed to pass a tax package that would not add to the budget. The Washington term is \"revenue neutral.\" \n It means that for every tax cut there has to be a tax increase, creating winners and losers. Lawmakers would get some leeway if non-partisan congressional analysts project that a tax cut would increase economic growth, raising revenue without increasing taxes. \n Nevertheless, passing a massive tax package will require some tough votes, politically. \n Some key Republican senators want to share the political risk with Democrats. They argue that a tax overhaul must be bipartisan to be fully embraced by the public. They cite President Barack Obama's health law \u2014 which passed in 2010 without any Republican votes \u2014 as a major policy initiative that remains divisive. \n Congressional Democrats say they are eager to have a say in overhauling the tax code. But McConnell, who faulted Democrats for acting unilaterally on health care, is laying the groundwork to pass a purely partisan bill. \n Both McConnell and Ryan said they plan to use a legislative maneuver that would prevent Senate Democrats from using the filibuster to block a tax bill. \n McConnell says he wants the Senate to tackle a tax plan in the spring, after Congress repeals Obama's health law. House Republicans are more eager to get started, but haven't set a timeline. \n Some things to know about Republican efforts to overhaul the tax code: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE HOUSE PLAN \n House Republicans have released the outline of a tax plan that would lower the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three. The gist of the plan is to lower tax rates for just about everyone, and make up the lost revenue by scaling back exemptions, deductions and credits. \n The plan, however, retains some of the most popular tax breaks, including those for paying a mortgage, going to college, making charitable contributions and having children. \n The standard deduction would be increased, giving taxpayers less incentive to itemize their deductions. \n The non-partisan Tax Policy Center says the plan would reduce revenues by $3 trillion over the first decade, with most of the savings going to the highest-income households. \n That's not revenue neutral. \n Small business owners would get a special top tax rate of 25 percent. \n Investment income would be taxed like wages, but investors would only have to pay taxes on half of this income. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n SENATE PLAN \n Senate Republicans have yet to coalesce around a comprehensive plan, or even an outline. \n \u2014\u2014 \n TRUMP'S PLAN \n Trump's plan has fewer details. He promises a tax cut for every income level, with more low-income families paying no income tax at all. \n The Tax Policy Center says Trump's plan would reduce revenues by a whopping $9.5 trillion over the first decade, with most of the tax benefits going to the wealthiest taxpayers. Trump has disputed the analysis. \n Like the House plan, Trump would reduce the top income tax rate for individuals to 33 percent, and he would reduce the number of tax brackets to three. He would also increase the standard deduction. \n Trump has embraced two ideas championed by Obama but repeatedly rejected by Republicans over the past eight years. Trump's plan would cap itemized deductions for married couples making more than $200,000 a year. It would also tax carried interest, which are fees charged by investment fund managers, as regular income instead of capital gains. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n CORPORATE TAXES \n The top corporate income tax rate in the U.S. is 35 percent, the highest in the industrialized world. However, the tax is riddled with so many exemptions, deductions and credits that most corporations pay much less. \n Both Trump and House Republicans want to lower the rate, and pay for it by scaling back tax breaks. \n Trump wants to lower the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. Ryan says 20 percent is more realistic, to avoid increasing the budget deficit. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n BORDER ADJUSTMENT TAX \n This is one of the most controversial parts of the House Republicans' tax plan. It is also key to making it work. \n Under current law, the United States taxes the profits of U.S.-based companies, even if the money is made overseas. However, taxes on foreign income are deferred until a company either reinvests the profits in the U.S. or distributes them to shareholders. \n Critics say the system encourages U.S.-based corporations to invest profits overseas or, more dramatically, to shift operations and jobs abroad to avoid U.S. taxes. \n House Republicans want to scrap America's worldwide tax system and replace it with a tax that is based on where a firm's products are consumed, rather than where they are produced. \n Under the system, American companies that produce and sell their products in the U.S. would pay the new 20 percent corporate tax rate on profits from these sales. However, if a company exports a product abroad, the profits from that sale would not be taxed by the U.S. \n There's more: Foreign companies that import goods to the U.S. would have to pay the tax, increasing the cost of imports. \n Exporters love the idea. But importers, including big retailers and consumer electronics firms, say it could lead to steep price increases on consumer goods. The lobbying has already begun. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "GOP on taxes: Cut rates, brackets but what about the deficit"}

{"date": "December 24, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this July 27, 2004, file photo, Barack Obama, then-candidate for the Senate from Illinois, speaks to delegates during the Democratic National Convention at the FleetCenter in Boston. \n WASHINGTON >> In boasting about his tenure in the White House, President Barack Obama often cites numbers like these: 15 million new jobs, a 4.9 percent unemployment rate and 74 months of consecutive job growth. \n There's one number you will almost never hear: More than 1,030 seats. \n That's the number of spots in state legislatures, governor's mansions and Congress lost by Democrats during Obama's presidency. \n It's a statistic that reveals an unexpected twist of the Obama years: The leadership of the one-time community organizer and champion of ground-up politics was rough on the grassroots of his own party. When Obama exits the White House, he'll leave behind a Democratic Party that languished in his shadow for years and is searching for itself. \n \"What's happened on the ground is that voters have been punishing Democrats for eight solid years \u2014 it's been exhausting,\" said South Carolina state Sen. Vincent Sheheen, who lost two gubernatorial campaigns to Nikki Haley, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for ambassador to the U.N. \"If I was talking about a local or state issue, voters would always lapse back into a national topic: Barack Obama.\" \n When Obama won the presidency, his election was heralded as a moment of Democratic dominance \u2014 the crashing of a conservative wave that had swept the country since the dawn of the Reagan era. \n Democrats believed that the coalition of young, minority and female voters who swept Obama into the White House would usher in something new: an ascendant Democratic majority that would ensure party gains for decades to come. \n The coalition, it turns out, was Obama's alone. \n After this year's elections, Democrats hold the governor's office and both legislative chambers in just five coastal states: Oregon, California, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware. Republicans have the trifecta in 25, giving them control of a broad swath of the middle of the country. \n The defeats have all but wiped out a generation of young Democrats, leaving the party with limited power in statehouses and a thin bench to challenge an ascendant GOP majority eager to undo many of the president's policies. To be sure, the president's party almost always loses seats in midterm elections. But, say experts, Obama's tenure has marked the greatest number of losses under any president in decades. \n \"Obama just figured his important actions on policies like immigration and health care would solidify support, but that hasn't really materialized,\" said Daniel Galvin, a political science professor at Northwestern University and the author of a book on presidential party building. \"He's done basically the minimal amount of party building, and it's been insufficient to help the party.\" \n It's a political reality that Obama has only been willing to acknowledge publicly after his party's devastating November losses. He's admitted he failed to create \"a sustaining organization\" around the political force that twice elected him to office. \n \"That's something I would have liked to have done more of, but it's kind of hard to do when you're also dealing with a whole bunch of issues here in the White House,\" he said at his year-end press conference. \n It is perhaps not surprising that Obama \u2014 a politician who promised a post-party era \u2014 turned out not to be a party stalwart. \n Obama and his aides came into office neither beholden to his party's establishment, nor particularly interested in reinforcing his party's weak spots. \n He electrified the 2004 Democratic National Convention with a speech seeking common cause over party differences. Four years later, he defeated Hillary Clinton, the pick of the party insiders, to win the Democratic presidential nomination. \n In the White House, Obama's failure to do the typical Washington schmoozing was a constant source of complaint among congressional Democrats, as was his reluctance to endorse down-ballot candidates and inability to parlay Organizing for Action, his grassroots organization, into a significant force. \n State parties languished and the Democratic National Committee struggled with dysfunction and debt. \n \"We built this beautiful house, but the foundation is rotten,\" said South Carolina Democratic Chairman Jaime Harrison, a candidate to lead the Democratic National Committee. \"In hindsight we should have looked at this and said, 'Maybe the state parties should be strong.'\" \n Toward the end of his presidency, Obama began doing more, stepping in to assist more than 150 state legislative candidates in October and campaigning across the country for Clinton. \n He's indicated he intends to make partisan politics a bigger piece of his post-presidential life. Aides say Obama will be closely involved in an effort to focus on drawing district lines more in the favor of Democrats. \n The president's advisers blame the losses on such structural trends. They point to a flood of Republican super PAC dollars and a resurgence of Republican political power in statehouses. That state-level dominance has given Republicans the ability to redraw district lines and created voting rules that could benefit their party for years to come. \n The refusal by many Democrats to accept help from Obama in the 2010 and 2014 midterms was also a strategic mistake, they argue. \n \"Frankly, when people have asked, the president has been more than willing to engage,\" said David Simas, Obama's political director. \n Some Democrats blame Obama for an executive agenda that highlighted social issues \u2014 such as transgender rights and access to birth control \u2014 over the economic anxiety still felt by many voters. \n \"The backlash to the Obama presidency was perhaps bigger than any of us really realized,\" said Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democratic Network, a Democratic think tank. \"A lot of the story of this election was people feeling like the culture was evolving in a way that made it feel like they were no longer living in the country they grew up in.\" \n Others are focusing on the one clear truth of the November defeats: What worked for Obama just did not work for this party. \n Perhaps the most remarkable twist of a shocking political season? Even as voters chose to elect a successor who vows to undo most of Obama's legacy, his approval rating remains the highest it's been since the spring of 2009. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "As Obama accomplished policy goals, his party floundered"}

{"date": "December 24, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n When Michelle Obama considered the daunting prospect of becoming first lady, she purposely avoided turning to books by her predecessors for guidance. Instead, she turned inward. \n WASHINGTON >> When Michelle Obama considered the daunting prospect of becoming first lady, she avoided turning to books by her predecessors for guidance. \n Instead, she turned inward. \n \"I didn't want to be influenced by how they defined the role,\" Mrs. Obama once said. She instinctively knew she had to define the job \"very uniquely and specifically to me and who I was.\" \n That meant doing it her way: shaping the role around her family, specifically her two young daughters, and not letting her new responsibilities consume her. \n Throughout her eight years, Mrs. Obama has been a powerful, if somewhat enigmatic, force in her husband's White House. She chose her moments in the often unforgiving spotlight with great care and resisted pressure to become more engaged in the mudslinging of partisan politics. \n At times, she's been more traditional than some expected \u2014 or wanted from this first lady. At other times, she's been eager to update stuffy conventions associated with the office. \n As she navigated her way through, the woman who grew up on the South Side of Chicago discovered a talent for television and a comfort with Hollywood A-listers, haute couture and social media. And she used all of those elements to promote her causes \u2014 childhood obesity, support for military families, girls' education \u2014 with at least some success. \n When she leaves the White House next month just a few days after celebrating her 53rd birthday, Mrs. Obama will do so not just as a political figure, but as a luminary with international influence. \n Friends say she charted that path largely on her own. \n \"What she did was she sort of listened to herself and allowed her own inner voice and strength and direction to lead her in the way that felt most authentic to her,\" Oprah Winfrey told The Associated Press. \"And I think watching somebody makes you want to do that for yourself.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n Mrs. Obama grappled with the childhood obesity issue before becoming first lady; a doctor had warned her about her daughters' weight. \n At the White House, she decided to share her experience with the country and started by planting the first vegetable garden there in more than 60 years. That led the following year, in 2010, to the launch of her anti-childhood-obesity initiative, \"Let's Move.\" \n The first lady appealed to elected officials, food makers, sellers, restaurant chains and others to try to make healthy food more accessible. She lobbied lawmakers to add more fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and limit fat, sugar and sodium in the federal school lunch program. \n That led to the first update to the program in decades, and for Mrs. Obama the process was akin to a crash course in Washington sausage-making. Mrs. Obama's effort was not universally welcomed. Republicans in Congress wanted to reverse the rules. Others said Mrs. Obama was acting like the \"food police.\" Even the kids she wanted to help added to the backlash. Some students posted photos of lunches they found unappealing on Twitter with the hashtag #ThanksMichelleObama, or simply tossed the food into the trash. \n Mrs. Obama had won. But she would never again try to work closely with Congress on an issue. She chose instead to use her platform to press industry to change its ways. \n It's too early to know how Mrs. Obama's efforts may affect childhood obesity rates long term, but advocates believe she helped change the national dialogue around healthy eating. And although incoming Republican President Donald Trump, a proud patron of McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, has yet to comment on school meal regulations, advocates worry about the fate of Mrs. Obama's effort under a White House and Congress that will be controlled by the GOP. \n Reflecting on her childhood obesity work, Mrs. Obama said some people initially wondered why she would bother with such a \"softball issue\" but \"now, all those challenges and criticisms are off the table.\" She told talk-show host Rachael Ray that \"at least we've become very aware as a society that this is one of our most important health issues.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Mrs. Obama's push to put the country on a health kick extended to exercise \u2014 and she made herself exhibit A. \n To promote \"Let's Move,\" the first lady often donned athletic wear and ran around with kids at sports clinics, some on the South Lawn. She twirled a hula hoop around her waist 142 times and kick-boxed in a video of the gym workout that helped tone the upper arms she showed off regularly, as in her official White House photo. \n She did pushups with Ellen DeGeneres, raced in a potato sack against late-night TV's Jimmy Fallon in the East Room and shimmied with a turnip in a brief video popular on social media \u2014 all to show that exercise can be fun. \n \"I'm pretty much willing to make a complete fool of myself to get our kids moving,\" she once said. \n Instead of going the fool's route, Mrs. Obama turned herself into a fitness guru and a figure significantly more popular than her husband. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n First lady was never a position Mrs. Obama imagined for herself, given her modest upbringing, her distaste for politics and having never seen her skin color on a U.S. president and first lady. \n Her early aversion to politics developed while watching her father navigate Chicago politics for his job with the city water department, and was reinforced by her husband's pursuit of a political career. Both Obamas have said his political ambition had strained their marriage and family. \n Once in the White House, Mrs. Obama vowed to protect her then 10- and 7-year-old daughters' right to a normal childhood. She declared being \"mom in chief\" to Malia and Sasha as her priority, irking women who hoped the first lady might be less constrained by stereotypes. \n She showed few signs of trying to push those boundaries. \n Mrs. Obama was an enthusiastic White House hostess. She rarely spoke about issues that were outside of her portfolio. She crafted her public schedule around her daughters' activities and limited her travel so she could spend time with them. \n The Obamas' parenting style \u2014 often described by both Obamas as warm, but strict \u2014 made them role models on that front, a point of pride, particularly in the African-American community. \n \"We have heard no Obama children drama,\" said Ingrid Saunders Jones, national chairwoman of the National Council of Negro Women. \n Mrs. Obama didn't really begin to open up about the historic nature of her service as the first black woman to become first lady until the end of the presidency was in sight. She mostly addressed the subject in interviews when she was asked to reflect about it, and discussed how important it was for children to see a black president and first lady. \n Longtime friend and White House adviser Valerie Jarrett said Mrs. Obama was often reluctant to talk about such matters earlier because she wanted her legacy to be more than just her place in history. \n \"Her goal is not what she is, but what she does,\" Jarrett said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n In the final weeks of the presidential race, Mrs. Obama set aside her distaste for politics to wage one last campaign, an ultimately futile attempt to help elect Democrat Hillary Clinton. She quickly became one of most passionate Democratic voices opposing Trump and calling him out for \"bragging about sexually assaulting women\" in comments caught on a 2005 video. \n \"I know it's a campaign, but this isn't about politics,\" she said at a Clinton rally shown live on cable TV news, rare exposure for a first lady in a campaign. If Trump's past words are \"painful to us as grown women,\" she asked, \"what do you think this is doing to our children?\" \n It was yet another moment when Mrs. Obama again seemed to be following her path rather than precedent. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "A first lady who followed her own path more than precedent"}
