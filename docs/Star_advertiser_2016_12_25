Cooper, North Carolina's next Democratic governor, has vowed to keep his campaign promises to bend back the rightward course of the state. But with only a 10,000-vote victory over GOP Gov. Pat McCrory and bitter partisan distrust in this deeply divided state, he's already slipped along the rocky path he must walk to work successfully with the legislature. And Republicans will maintain veto-proof majorities in 2017. \n RALEIGH, N.C. >> North Carolina's next Democratic governor has seen a deal he helped broker to repeal the state's law limiting LGBT protections fall apart and had several of his powers stripped away by the state's Republican-dominated legislature. And he hasn't even been sworn in yet. \n Gov.-elect Roy Cooper has vowed to keep his campaign promises to bend back the rightward course of the state. But with only a 10,000-vote victory over GOP Gov. Pat McCrory and bitter partisan distrust in this deeply divided state, he's already slipped along the rocky path he must walk to work successfully with the legislature. And Republicans will maintain veto-proof majorities in 2017. \n \"My future negotiations with them are certainly going to have to be instructed by this,\" a somber yet angry Cooper told reporters last week after the deal to repeal the law known nationally as the \"bathroom bill\" collapsed. \n Two December special sessions, one of which saw raucous protests against Republicans and dozens of arrests, have created further strain in a divided state that chose Republicans Donald Trump for president and Richard Burr for U.S. Senate but went with a Democrat for governor. \n \"There's a complete lack of trust between the legislative leadership and Cooper at this point in time,\" longtime state Democratic consultant Brad Crone said. \"That does not bode well for an incoming governor.\" \n Missing out on ending House Bill 2 \u2014 which also directed transgender people to use bathrooms in public buildings corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate \u2014 prompted finger-pointing between Cooper and legislative leaders. It would have been a major accomplishment to repeal a bill that has been blamed for job losses, canceled concerts and sporting events, and staining North Carolina's reputation. \n \"I think Roy Cooper did everything he could to sabotage a reasonable compromise,\" said Senate leader Phil Berger, R-Rockingham. \n Cooper shot back: \"My mom and dad used to tell me that when you sat down and looked somebody in the eye and told them something you should keep your promise, and clearly they have not done so.\" \n Even before the General Assembly sessions, Cooper already was at a disadvantage. \n Cooper is a 30-year veteran of state politics \u2014 14 years in the legislature before 16 as attorney general \u2014 and claimed victory on election night. But it was another 27 days before McCrory conceded while dozens of ballot protests and a partial recount worked out the results. \n Set to take office Jan. 1, Cooper hasn't yet announced a single Cabinet appointment \u2014 something McCrory had done by this time after his 2012 election \u2014 and faces new hurdles for his choices. One law the General Assembly approved this month requires his Cabinet choices be confirmed by legislators. The state Constitution gives the Senate the ability to \"advise and consent\" to the governor's appointees by a majority vote, but that provision hadn't been used in at least several decades. \n GOP legislators argued they are only rebalancing the powers between the legislative and executive branches, but Democrats and their allies call it a brazen, unlawful power grab. \n Another law reduces the number of political appointees Cooper can hire. Republicans had expanded the number of such policymaking jobs for McCrory from 400 to 1,500. That number goes back down to 425 for Cooper. \n Cooper previously threatened lawsuits to challenge the efforts to scale back his power. \"They will see me in court,\" he told The Charlotte Observer last week. \n Even as lawmakers held special sessions, the board of North Carolina's private nonprofit tasked with luring companies to the state \u2014 now filled with appointees from McCrory and the legislature \u2014 passed a bylaw change that will make it hard for Cooper to put his board choices on quickly. \n The bad blood with lawmakers could portend Cooper's difficulties to follow through on other campaign platform planks, such as accelerating public education funding and shifting tax burdens away from the middle class. He's also vowed to preserve voting and abortion rights, after Republicans passed laws in 2013 scaling back early in-person voting and extending the abortion waiting period to three days. \n But both Cooper and GOP lawmakers have said they could locate areas of agreement. \n \"I am optimistic that we can strike a good balance with the governor-elect in trying to build a consensus agenda and move our state forward,\" said Rep. David Lewis, R-Harnett, chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee. \"Relationships have changed between the legislative and the executive branch, but that doesn't mean \u2026. we can't work together.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Failed deal to undo LGBT law marks rocky start for North Carolina governor"}

Russian ships, helicopters and drones are searching for bodies after a plane carrying 92 people crashed into the Black Sea. The plane was taking the Alexandrov Ensemble, a military choir, to perform at Russia's air base in Syria when it went down shortly after takeoff. \n SOCHI, Russia >> Backed by ships, helicopters and drones, Russian rescue teams searched Sunday for victims after a Russian plane carrying 92 people to Syria crashed into the Black Sea shortly after takeoff. Investigators said they are looking into every possible cause for the crash, including a terror attack. \n All 84 passengers and eight crew members on board the Soviet-built Tu-154 plane operated by the Russian military are believed to have died when it crashed two minutes after taking off at 5:25 a.m. in good weather from the southern Russian city of Sochi. \n More than 3,000 people \u2014 including over 100 divers flown in from across Russia \u2014 worked from 32 ships and several helicopters to search the crash site, the Defense Ministry said. Drones and submersibles were also being used to help spot bodies and debris. Powerful spotlights were brought in so the search could continue around the clock. \n Emergency crews found fragments of the plane about 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) from shore. By Sunday evening, rescue teams had recovered 11 bodies and Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov said fragments of other bodies were also found. \n Asked if a terror attack was a possibility, Sokolov said investigators were looking into every possible reason for the crash. \n The plane belonging to the Defense Ministry was taking its world famous choir, the Alexandrov Ensemble, to a New Year's concert at Hemeimeem air base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia. Those on board also included nine Russian journalists and a Russian doctor famous for her work in war zones. \n Russian President Vladimir Putin went on television to declare Monday a nationwide day of mourning. \n \"We will conduct a thorough investigation into the reasons and will do everything to support the victims' families,\" Putin said. \n The Black Sea search area \u2014 which covered 10 square kilometers (nearly 4 square miles) \u2014 was made more difficult by underwater currents that carried debris and body fragments into the open sea. \n Sokolov said the plane's flight recorders did not have the radio beacons common in more modern aircraft, so locating them on the seabed was going to be challenging. \n The Tu-154 is a Soviet-built three-engine airliner designed in the late 1960s. More than 1,000 have been built, and they have been used extensively in Russia and worldwide. The plane that crashed Sunday was built in 1983, and underwent factory check-ups and maintenance in 2014 and earlier this year, according to the Defense Ministry. \n Magomed Tolboyev, a decorated Russian test pilot, said the circumstances of the crash indicated that all on board had died. \n \"There is no chance to survive in such situation,\" he said, according to the Interfax news agency. \n Before Sokolov spoke to reporters in Sochi, senior Russian lawmakers had ruled out a terror attack, arguing that the military plane was tightly secured. Security is particularly tight in Sochi, which hosted the 2014 Winter Games and is regularly visited by Putin, who has a residence there. \n But some experts noted that the crew's failure to report a malfunction pointed at a possible terror attack. \n \"Possible malfunctions \u2026 certainly wouldn't have prevented the crew from reporting them,\" Vitaly Andreyev, a former senior Russian air traffic controller, told RIA Novosti, adding that it points at an \"external impact.\" \n Russian planes have been brought down previously by terror attacks. \n In October 2015, a Russian plane carrying mostly Russian tourists back from vacation in Egypt was brought down by a bomb over the Sinai Peninsula, killing all 224 people aboard. Officials said the explosive device was planted in the plane's luggage compartment. The local affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility. \n In August 2004, two Russian planes were blown up in the skies over Russia on the same day by suicide bombers, killing 89 people. A Chechen warlord claimed responsibility for the twin attacks. \n In the last year, the Russian military has repeatedly flown Russian singers and artists to perform at Hemeimeem, which serves as the main hub for the Russian air campaign in Syria. This plane was carrying performers for New Year's, the main holiday for most Russians. \n The passenger list for the Sochi plane released by the Defense Ministry included 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, including its leader, Valery Khalilov. The ensemble is the official choir of the Russian military and also includes a band and a dance company. The choir sang \"Get Lucky\" at the opening of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, becoming an instant online sensation. \n The damage to the choir was reported to be devastating. Viktor Yeliseyev, head of the rival choir of the Russian National Guard, said \"most singers of the choir have died.\" \n Also on board was Yelizaveta Glinka, a Russian doctor who has won wide acclaim for her charity work, which has included missions to war zones in eastern Ukraine and Syria. Her foundation said Glinka was accompanying a shipment of medicine for a hospital in Syria. \n \"We never feel sure that we will come back alive,\" she said when Putin presented her with an award earlier this month. \"But we are sure that kindness, compassion and charity are stronger than any weapon.\" \n Syrian President Bashar Assad was among numerous foreign leaders who sent a condolence note to Putin, saying he received the news \"with deep grief and sadness.\" \n In recent years, Russian airlines have replaced their Tu-154s with more modern planes, but the military and other government agencies in Russia have continued to use them. While noisy and fuel-guzzling, the plane is popular with crews that appreciate its maneuverability and ruggedness. \n \"It's an excellent plane, which has proven its reliability during decades of service,\" veteran pilot Oleg Smirnov said in televised remarks. \n Still, since 1994 there have been 17 major plane crashes involving the Tu-154 that have killed over 1,760 people. Most resulted from human error. \n In the latest previous deadly crash of a Tu-154, a plane carrying Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others crashed in April 2010 while trying to land at a military airport in Smolensk in western Russia, killing everyone on board. Investigations by both Polish and Russian experts blamed pilot error in bad weather, but Polish authorities have launched a new probe. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Russia examines all possible reasons for Black Sea jet crash"}

A severe tropical storm has gained strength as it moves closer to the Philippines and may intensify further into a typhoon, bringing moderate to heavy rains and blustery weather on Christmas Day, the biggest holiday in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation, weather forecasters said. \n MANILA, Philippines >> A powerful typhoon slammed into the eastern Philippines on Christmas Day, spoiling the biggest holiday in Asia's largest Catholic nation, where a governor offered roast pig to entice villagers to abandon family celebrations for emergency shelters. \n Typhoon Nock-Ten was packing maximum sustained winds of 114 miles per hour and gusts of up to 158 mph when it made landfall Sunday night in Catanduanes province, where fierce winds and rain knocked down the island's power and communications, officials said. \n There were no immediate reports of injuries. \n After Catanduanes, the typhoon, which had a 300-mile rain band, was expected to barge westward across the mountainous southern plank of the Philippines' main island of Luzon and blow close to the capital, Manila, on Monday, before starting to exit toward the South China Sea. Nock-Ten may weaken after hitting the Sierra Madre mountain range in southern Luzon. \n Heavy rainfall, destructive winds and battering waves were threatening heavily populated rural and urban regions, where the Philippine weather agency raised typhoon warnings, stranding thousands of people in ports as airlines canceled flights and ferries were prevented from sailing. Officials warned of storm surges in coastal villages, flash floods and landslides, and asked villagers to evacuate to safer grounds. \n Christmas is the biggest holiday in the Philippines, which has Asia's largest Roman Catholic population, making it difficult for officials to get people's attention to heed the warnings. With many refusing to leave high-risk communities, some officials said they decided to carry out forced evacuations. \n In the past 65 years, seven typhoons have struck the Philippines on Christmas Day, according to the government's weather agency. \n Gov. Miguel Villafuerte of Camarines Sur province, which is in the typhoon's expected path, offered roast pig, a popular Christmas delicacy locally called \"lechon,\" in evacuation centers to entice villagers to move to emergency shelters. \n \"I know it's Christmas \u2026 but this is a legit typhoon,\" Villafuerte tweeted on Christmas Eve. \"Please evacuate, we'll be having lechon at evacuation centers.\" \n Camarines Sur officials had targeted about 50,000 families \u2014 some 250,000 people \u2014 for evacuation by Saturday night, but the number of those who responded was initially far below expectations. \n In Catanduanes province, Vice Gov. Shirley Abundo said she ordered a forced evacuation of villagers, saying some \"are really hard-headed, they don't want to leave their houses because it's Christmas.\" \n \"We need to do this by force, we need to evacuate them now,\" she told ABS-CBN television. \n The Department of Social Welfare and Development, which helps oversee government response during disasters, said only about 4,200 people were reported to have moved to six evacuation centers by Sunday morning in the Bicol region, which includes Camarines Sur. \n \"It's difficult to force celebrations when our lives will be put at risk. Please prioritize safety and take heed of warnings by local government units,\" welfare official Felino Castro told The Associated Press by phone. \n Food, water and other emergency supplies had been pre-positioned in areas expected to be lashed by the typhoon, Castro said. His department was to activate an emergency cluster comprising the military, police, coast guard and other agencies Sunday to oversee disaster-response plans. \n In the farming town of Guinobatan in Albay province, which is near Nock-Ten's path, more than 17,600 villagers moved to evacuation shelters without hesitation because of fears of a repeat of a typhoon several years ago that unleashed smoldering mudflows from nearby Mayon Volcano, leaving hundreds dead, the town's mayor, Ann Ongjoco, said by phone. \n Josefina Nao, who evacuated to a Guinobatan school with her six children, grandchildren and siblings, said that Sunday was one of her bleakest Christmas holidays, but that poor people like her did not have much choice. She said it was tough to replicate Christmas away from home, adding that town officials tried to cheer evacuees by distributing holiday food such as spaghetti. \n \"We live in a flood-prone community near a river where many had been swept to their deaths by floodwaters during typhoons,\" the 60-year-old Nao said by phone from a classroom-turned-storm shelter that was void of any Christmas lights or decorations. \"I wish it was a merrier Christmas, but this is our best option because we'll all be safe together.\" \n About 20 typhoons and storms, mostly from the Pacific, lash the Philippines each year, making the poor country of more than 100 million people one of the most disaster-prone in the world. \n In November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan struck the central Philippines with ferocious power, leaving more than 7,300 people dead or missing and displacing more than 5 million after leveling entire villages despite days of dire warnings by government officials. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Powerful typhoon slams into Philippines, spoiling Christmas"}

{"date": "December 25, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump is embracing some of his top attacks on Hillary Clinton as he forms his new administration, engaging in some of the same behavior he used against his rival during the presidential campaign. \n WASHINGTON >> Donald Trump spent the past two years attacking rival Hillary Clinton as crooked, corrupt, and weak. \n But some of those attacks seem to have already slipped into the history books. \n From installing Wall Street executives in his Cabinet to avoiding news conferences, the president-elect is adopting some of the same behavior for which he criticized Clinton during their fiery presidential campaign. \n Here's a look at what Trump said then \u2014 and what he's doing now: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n GOLDMAN SACHS \n Then: \"I know the guys at Goldman Sachs,\" Trump said at a South Carolina rally in February, when he was locked in a fierce primary battle with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. \"They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton.\" \n Now: A number of former employees of the Wall Street bank will pay a key role in crafting Trump's economic policy. He's tapped Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn to lead the White House National Economic Council. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, spent 17 years working at Goldman Sachs and Steve Bannon, Trump's chief strategist and senior counselor, started his career as an investment banker at the firm. \n Trump is following in a long political tradition, though one he derided on the campaign trail: If Cohn accepts the nomination, he'll be the third Goldman executive to run the NEC. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n BIG DONORS \n Then: \"Crooked Hillary. Look, can you imagine another four years of the Clintons? Seriously. It's time to move on. And she's totally controlled by Wall Street and all these people that gave her millions,\" Trump said at a May rally in Lynden, Washington. \n Now: Trump has stocked his Cabinet with six top donors \u2014 far more than any recent White House. \"I want people that made a fortune. Because now they're negotiating with you, OK?\" Trump said, in a December 9 speech in Des Moines. \n The biggest giver? Incoming small business administrator Linda McMahon gave $7.5 million to a super PAC backing Trump, more than a third of the money collected by the political action committee. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n NEWS CONFERENCES \n Then: \"She doesn't do news conferences, because she can't,\" Trump said at an August rally in Ashburn, Virginia. \"She's so dishonest she doesn't want people peppering her with questions.\" \n Now: Trump opened his last news conference on July 27, saying: \"You know, I put myself through your news conferences often, not that it's fun.\" \n He hasn't held once since. \n Trump skipped the news conference a president-elect typically gives after winning the White House. Instead, he released a YouTube video of under three minutes. This week, Trump abruptly canceled plans to hold his first post-election news conference, opting instead to describe his plans for managing his businesses in tweets. \"I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times!\" he tweeted in mid-December. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n FAMILY TIES: \n Then: \"It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins. It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office. They sold access and specific actions by and really for I guess the making of large amounts of money,\" Trump said at an August rally in Austin. \n Now: While Trump has promised to separate himself from his businesses, there is plenty of overlap between his enterprises and his immediate family. His companies will be run by his sons, Donald Jr and Eric. And his daughter, Ivanka, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have joined Trump at a number of meetings with world leaders of countries where the family has financial interests. \n In a financial disclosure he was required to file during the campaign, Trump listed stakes in about 500 companies in at least 25 countries. \n Ivanka, in particular, has been caught making early efforts to leverage her father's new position into profits. After an interview with the family appeared on \"60 Minutes,\" her jewelry company, Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, blasted out an email promoting the $10,800 gold bangle bracelet that she had worn during the appearance. The company later said they were \"proactively discussing new policies and procedures.\" \n Ivanka is also auctioning off a private coffee meeting with her to benefit her brother's foundation. The meeting is valued at $50,000, with the current top bid coming in at $25,000. \n \"United States Secret Service will be Present for the Duration of the Experience,\" warns the auction site. \n Trump on Saturday said he would dissolve his charitable foundation amid efforts to eliminate any conflicts of interest before he takes office next month. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n CLINTON INVESTIGATIONS \n Then: \"If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor,\" Trump said in the October presidential debate. \n Now: Since winning office, Trump has said he has no intention of pushing for an investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of State or the workings of her family foundation. \"It's just not something that I feel very strongly about,\" he told the New York Times. \n \"She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways,\" he said. \"I'm not looking to hurt them.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump adopting same behavior he criticized Clinton for"}

{"date": "December 25, 2016", "text": "SANDRINGHAM, England >> A heavy cold is keeping Queen Elizabeth II from attending the traditional Christmas morning church service near her Sandringham estate in rural Norfolk, England. \n It is extremely rare for Elizabeth to miss the service, which is a cornerstone of the royal family's Christmas celebrations and brings the monarch into contact with local residents who gather outside for a glimpse of her. \n \"The Queen continues to recover from a heavy cold and will stay indoors to assist with her recovery,\" Buckingham Palace said. \"Her Majesty will participate in the royal family Christmas celebrations during the day.\" \n Those festivities usually include a gala lunch. In past years, the royal family would often go for extended walks in the countryside. \n Elizabeth has been in generally good health and has maintained an active schedule in the last year despite traveling less often than in the past. \n Her husband, 95-year-old Prince Philip, has also cut back his public schedule and his charitable works. He was also suffering from a heavy cold earlier in the week, the palace said. \n The flu season has hit many Britons hard in the last two weeks and colds and flus are spreading. A cold can be dangerous for people in their 90s, doctors warn. \n Earlier this week, the royal couple delayed their departure from London to Sandringham because of their colds but traveled one day later than expected, using a helicopter instead of a train. \n The royal family received some sad news Saturday, when it was revealed that the queen's granddaughter, Zara Tindall, had suffered a miscarriage while expecting her second child with husband Mike Tindall. \n The queen plans to use her pre-recorded Christmas Day message to praise British Olympic and Paralympic athletes and others who inspired her. \n The message will be televised throughout Britain and much of the Commonwealth on Sunday afternoon. \n Remarks released by Buckingham Palace indicate she will say she often draws strength from meeting ordinary people doing extraordinary things. \n Elizabeth and Philip will be joined in Sandringham by other senior royals. Prince William and his wife Kate, along with their two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, are celebrating Christmas with Kate's parents. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II to miss Christmas service due to illness"}
