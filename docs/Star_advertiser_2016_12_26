So sad!\" \n On Friday, Trump warned, \"As to the U.N., things will be different after Jan. 20th,\" referring to the day he takes office. \n The decision by the Obama administration to abstain from Friday's U.N. vote brushed aside Trump's demands that the U.S. exercise its veto and provided a climax to years of icy relations with Israel's leadership. \n Trump told The Associated Press last December that he wanted to be \"very neutral\" on Israel-Palestinian issues. But his tone became decidedly more pro-Israel as the presidential campaign progressed. He has spoken disparagingly of Palestinians, saying they have been \"taken over\" by or are condoning militant groups. \n Trump's tweet today about the U.N. ignores much of the work that goes on in the 193-member global organization. \n This year the U.N. Security Council has approved over 70 legally binding resolutions, including new sanctions on North Korea and measures tackling conflicts and authorizing the U.N.'s far-flung peacekeeping operations around the world. The General Assembly has also approved dozens of resolutions on issues, like the role of diamonds in fueling conflicts; condemned human rights abuses in Iran and North Korea; and authorized an investigation of alleged war crimes in Syria. \n Trump's criticism of the U.N. is by no means unique. While the organization does engage in large-scale humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts, its massive bureaucracy has long been a source of controversy. The organization has been accused by some Western governments of being inefficient and frivolous, while developing nations have said it is overly influenced by wealthier nations. \n Trump tweeted later today, \"The world was gloomy before I won \u2014 there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10 percent and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!\" \n Markets are up since Trump won the general election, although not quite by that much. The Standard & Poor's 500 is up about 6 percent since Election Day, while the Dow has risen more than 8 percent. \n As for holiday spending, auditing and accounting firm Deloitte projected in September that total 2016 holiday sales were expected to exceed $1 trillion, representing a 3.6 percent to 4.0 percent increase in holiday sales from November through January. \n Finally, Trump took to Twitter again late today to complain about media coverage of his charitable foundation. He wrote that of the \"millions of dollars\" he has contributed to or raised for the Donald J. Trump Foundation, all of it \"is given to charity, and media won't report.\" \n Trump said Saturday he will dissolve his charitable foundation before taking office to avoid conflicts of interest. The New York attorney general's office has been investigating the foundation following media reports that foundation spending went to benefit Trump's campaign. \n The president-elect is spending the holidays at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.  \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump says U.N. just a club for people to 'have a good time'"}

{"date": "December 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / NOV. 29 \n Rescue workers worked at the wreckage site of the LaMia chartered airplane crash in La Union, a mountainous area near Medellin, Colombia. \n BOGOTA, Colombia >> A series of human errors caused an airliner to run out of fuel and crash in Colombia last month, killing 71 people including most of a Brazilian soccer team, aviation authorities said today. \n Colombia's Civil Aeronautics agency concluded in its investigation that the plan for the flight operated by Bolivia-based charter company LaMia did not meet international standards. Among the errors made were the decisions to let the plane take off without enough fuel to make the flight safely and then to not stop midway to refuel. The pilot also did not report the plane's emergency until it was too late, it said. \n Neither the company nor Bolivian authorities should have allowed the plane to take off with the flight plan submitted, said Freddy Bonilla, air safety secretary for Colombia's aviation authority. He said the agency's preliminary conclusions were based on the plane's black boxes and other evidence. \n Experts had earlier suggested that fuel exhaustion was a likely cause of the Nov. 28 crash that wiped out all but a few members of the Chapocoense soccer team, as well as team officials and journalists accompanying them to a championship playoff match in Medellin, Colombia. \n The BAE 146 Avro RJ85 has a maximum range was 2,965 kilometers (1,600 nautical miles) \u2014 just under the distance between Medellin and Santa Cruz, Bolivia, where the plane had taken off at almost full capacity. \n The plane was in the air for about 4 hours and 20 minutes when air traffic controllers in Medellin put it into a holding pattern because another flight had reported a suspected fuel leak and was given priority. \n Investigators found that crew members of the LaMia flight were aware of the lack of fuel but waited too long to report the emergency. \n Bonilla said that during the flight the pilot and co-pilot are heard on \"various occasions\" talking about stopping in Leticia \u2014 a city near the borders separating Brazil, Peru and Colombia \u2014 to refuel but decided not to do so. When the plane entered Colombian airspace it was flying into a wind, which caused more fuel to be consumed. \n And when the pilot asked for priority to land in Medellin, six minutes before crashing, the plane had already spent two minutes with a motor shut off, the investigation concluded. All the motors shut down minutes later. \n In a recording of a radio message from the pilot, he can be heard repeatedly requesting permission to land due to a lack of fuel and a \"total electric failure.\" A surviving flight attendant and a pilot flying nearby also overheard the frantic pleas from the doomed airliner. \n In addition, there was no explosion upon impact, pointing to a scarcity of fuel. \n Investigators in Colombia concluded that the plane did not have the fuel reserves required by international standards for such a flight. They said there was no evidence of sabotage or mechanical failure. \n Authorities also detected an excess of baggage, but did not relate it to the accident, and, according to its plan, the flight was expected to reach 30,000 feet, an altitude the plane was not certified for. \n Details of the complete report by Colombia's aviation agency will be released in April 2017. Bolivia, Brazil and the United Kingdom contributed to it. \n Bolivia's government has already blamed the airline and its pilot for the accident. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Probe finds human error, lack of fuel in Colombia air crash"}

Amid population declines for many wildlife species in Africa, conservationists are sounding alarm bells for the cheetah, the fastest animal on land, where there are an estimated 7,100 cheetahs remaining across Africa and in a small area in Iran. \n JOHANNESBURG >> Amid population declines for many wildlife species in Africa, conservationists are sounding alarm bells for the cheetah, the fastest animal on land. \n An estimated 7,100 cheetahs remain in the wild across Africa and in a small area of Iran, and human encroachment has pushed the wide-ranging predator out of 91 percent of its historic habitat, according to a study published on Monday. \n Consequently, the cheetah should be defined as \"endangered\" instead of the less serious \"vulnerable\" on an official watch list of threatened species worldwide, the study said. \n \"This period is really crunch time for species like cheetah that need these big areas,\" said Sarah Durant, a cheetah specialist at the Zoological Society of London and the lead author of the report published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n About 77 percent of cheetah habitats fall outside wildlife reserves and other protected areas, the study said, requiring outreach to governments and villages to promote tolerance for a carnivore that sometimes hunts livestock. \n Besides habitat loss, cheetahs face attacks from villagers, loss of antelope and other prey that are killed by people for their meat, an illegal trade in cheetah cubs, the trafficking of cheetah skins and the threat of getting hit by speeding vehicles. \n A cheetah has been recorded running at a speed of 29 meters (95 feet) per second. The species may move more slowly while hunting and it can only maintain top speeds for a few hundred meters. \n More than half of the world's cheetahs live in southern Africa, including in Namibia and Botswana, which have relatively sparse human populations. Cheetahs have been virtually wiped out in Asia, save for fewer than 50 in Iran, according to the study, whose contributors included the Panthera group and the Wildlife Conservation Society. \n Durant said there was uncertainty over the 7,100 number, which was based on data from experts in areas where cheetahs live and estimates for other areas. Cheetahs are difficult to find because they move over vast regions, she said. \n Durant also led a previous assessment of nearly 6,700 cheetahs published last year by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which keeps a watch list of threatened species. Since then, experts have provided new information and refined counting methods, contrasting with rough estimates in the 10,000-range in recent decades. \n The cheetah population in Zimbabwe declined from an estimated 1,500 in 1999 to between 150 and 170, according to a survey conducted between 2013 and 2015 by a group called Cheetah Conservation Project Zimbabwe. The group solicited cheetah photographs and reports of sightings from tourists, safari guides and others and interviewed more than 1,000 people, including village heads and cattle managers. \n Cheetah experts note that Angola is developing a plan to protect cheetahs and African wild dogs. That could yield better data on cheetah numbers in a country where information has been thin, said Rosemary Groom, a conservationist who participated in an October workshop on the subject in Angola's Quicama National Park. \n Despite habitat loss across the continent, the Mara area in southwest Kenya and in the adjacent Serengeti National Park in Tanzania still offers a refuge, said Femke Broekhuis, head of the Mara Cheetah Project. Recent data from a GPS collar on one Mara cheetah showed that it traveled 19 kilometers (12 miles) overnight, she said. \n Cheetahs often roam alone, though on Monday morning Broekhuis saw a rare sight: five male cheetahs, together. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Cheetah numbers decline as African habitat shrinks"}

{"date": "December 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this photo provided by Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman LLP, David Friedman, President-elect Donald Trump's choice for ambassador to Israel. \n NEW YORK >> If President-elect Donald Trump wanted to show he planned to obliterate President Barack Obama's approach to Israel, he might have found his man to deliver that message in David Friedman, his pick for U.S. ambassador. \n The bankruptcy lawyer and son of an Orthodox rabbi is everything Obama is not: a fervent supporter of Israeli settlements, opponent of Palestinian statehood and unrelenting defender of Israel's government. So far to the right is Friedman that many Israel supporters worry he could push Israel's hawkish Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be more extreme, scuttling prospects for peace with Palestinians in the process. \n The heated debate over Friedman's selection is playing out just as fresh tensions erupt between the U.S. and Israel. \n In a stunning decision Friday, the Obama administration moved to allow the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution condemning Israeli settlements as illegal. The move to abstain, rather than veto, defied years of U.S. tradition of shielding Israel from such resolutions, and elicited condemnation from Israel, lawmakers of both parties, and especially Trump. \n \"Things will be different after Jan. 20th,\" when he's sworn in, Trump vowed on Twitter. \n Presidents of both parties have long called for a two-state solution that envisions eventual Palestinian statehood, and Netanyahu says he agrees. Friedman, who still must be confirmed by the Senate, does not. He's called the two-state solution a mere \"narrative\" that must end. \n Under Obama, the U.S. has worked closely with J Street, an Israel advocacy group sharply critical of Netanyahu. Friedman accuses Obama of \"blatant anti-Semitism\" and calls J Street \"worse than kapos,\" a reference to Jews who helped the Nazis imprison fellow Jews during the Holocaust. \n For decades, the U.S. has opposed Israeli settlement-building in lands it seized in the 1967 Mideast war. Friedman runs a nonprofit that raises millions of dollars for Beit El, a settlement of religious nationalists near Ramallah. Beit El runs a right-wing news outlet and a yeshiva whose dean has provocatively urged Israeli soldiers to refuse orders to uproot settlers from their homes. \n So it's unsurprising that Friedman's nomination has already sharpened a growing balkanization of American Jews, between those who want the U.S. to push Israel toward peace and those who believe Obama's approach abandoned America's closest Mideast ally. \n It's a debate playing out even at Temple Hillel, near the Long Island-Queens border, where Friedman's father was rabbi for almost half a century. \n \"Clearly, David's opinions do not appeal to everybody in the synagogue, and they appeal to others in the synagogue,\" said Ken Fink, the synagogue's president and longtime congregant. \"But there's a huge amount of pride for the hometown boy.\" \n Thirty-two years before Trump's election, President Ronald Reagan donned a yarmulke and noshed on chicken cutlets and noodle pudding at Rabbi Morris Friedman's home, after a speech at Temple Hillel affirming the separation between church and state. Coming just two weeks before Reagan's re-election, the attempt to woo Jewish voters struck some as opportunistic, and they protested on the streets of the heavily Jewish town of North Woodmere. \n Seated at the Sabbath table with Reagan was David Melech Friedman \u2014 his middle name means \"king\" in Hebrew. The rabbi's son went on to become Trump's bankruptcy lawyer, an advocate for far-right policies on Israel, and now, Trump's choice for ambassador, despite having no diplomatic experience. \n Cindy Grosz, who said she's known Friedman for nearly 50 years, recalled big parties with boisterous debates about Jewish issues held in his family's sukkah, the outdoor hut Jews build during the harvest festival Sukkot. \n \"He still has the same best friends he's had for over 30 years,\" Grosz said. \n At his midtown Manhattan law firm, Friedman opens his offices to those in mourning who need a minyan \u2014 a quorum of 10 men in Orthodox Judaism \u2014 to say the Mourner's Kaddish, a prayer that observant Jews say daily for one year after a parent's death. \n And it was a parent's death, in a way, that brought Friedman and Trump closer together. Over the years, Friedman has told friends the story of how the billionaire real estate mogul defied an oppressive snowstorm that had kept others away to \"sit shiva\" for Friedman's father during the Jewish mourning period. \n Educated at Columbia University and NYU School of Law, Friedman developed a reputation as an aggressive, high-stakes bankruptcy attorney, representing Trump when his Atlantic City casinos went through bankruptcy. \n In the courtroom, he's known as a formidable opponent, said attorney Tariq Mundiya, Friedman's adversary in several cases. He said he'd been aware of Friedman's advocacy on Israel but added, \"When you're in the fog of war with David, the last thing you're talking about is the Middle East.\" \n Enraged by Trump's pick, left-leaning groups and Palestinian officials have suggested his confirmation could spell the end of any serious discussions about peace. \n Netanyahu has stayed publicly quiet about Trump's pick. Friedman and Trump's transition team didn't respond to requests for comment. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's pick for ambassador to Israel sparks hot debate"}

{"date": "December 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A woman mourns standing in front of monument to Alexander Alexandrov, founder of the Alexandrov Ensemble, near the Alexandrov Ensemble building in Moscow, Russia, Monday, Dec. 26, 2016, the day after a plane carrying 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble crashed into the Black Sea minutes after taking off from the resort city of Sochi. \n SOCHI, Russia >> The Kremlin on Monday played down the possibility that a terror attack might have downed a Syria-bound Russian plane, killing all 92 people on board, as the nation observed a day of mourning for the victims, including most members of a world famous military choir. \n The Tu-154 owned by the Russian Defense Ministry crashed into the Black Sea early Sunday two minutes after taking off in good weather from the city of Sochi. The plane was carrying members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, often referred to as the Red Army Choir, to a New Year's concert at a Russian military base in Syria. \n About 3,500 people, 43 ships and 182 divers have been sweeping a vast crash site for bodies of the victims and debris, and dozens of drones and several submersibles also have been involved in the search. Rescue teams so far have recovered 11 bodies and numerous body fragments, which have been flown to Moscow for identification. \n Divers have located parts of the plane's fuselage and other fragments, but the search for the jet's flight recorders will likely prove challenging as they lack underwater locator beacons for easy spotting common in more modern planes. \n Officials sought to squelch speculation that the crash might have been caused by a bomb planted on board or a portable air defense missile. \n But some aviation experts pointed that the crew's failure to communicate any technical problem and a large area over which fragments of the plane were scattered point at a possible explosion on board. \n Evidence of a bombing of a Syria-bound military flight would badly embarrass the Kremlin, highlighting Russia's extreme vulnerability to attacks even as it boasts its success in Syria after Aleppo fell into President Bashar Assad's hands. \n President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that an attack isn't a likely scenario. Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov, who oversaw the rescue efforts, said investigators were looking into a possible technical fault or pilot error as the most likely reasons behind the crash. \n But some experts remained skeptical, noting that the crew would have reported any technical glitch. \n \"Possible malfunctions \u2026 certainly wouldn't have prevented the crew from reporting them,\" Vitaly Andreyev, a former senior Russian air traffic controller, told RIA Novosti, adding that an \"external impact\" was the most likely reason. \n Russia's main domestic security and counter-terrorism agency, the FSB, said it has found \"no indications or facts pointing at the possibility of a terror attack or an act of sabotage on board the plane.\" \n The plane departed from the Chkalovsky military airport just outside Moscow and stopped in Sochi for refueling early Sunday. The FSB said border guards and military servicemen were protecting the plane as it sat on the tarmac in Sochi, and the chief pilot along with the flight engineer personally monitored the refueling. The agency said that a border guard officer and a customs official were the only ones to briefly come on board in Sochi. \n Some Russian media pointed at lax security at Chkalovsky outside Moscow where the plane was based, saying that it's quite porous compared to civilian airports. \n Alexander Gusak, a former chief of the FSB special forces unit, also hinted at security breaches at Chkalovsky and said that even a much more secure Sochi airport could be vulnerable. \n \"It's possible to penetrate any facility. It depends on your skills,\" Gusak told Dozhd TV. \n Russian planes have been brought down previously in terror attacks. \n In October 2015, a Russian passenger plane was brought down by a bomb over Egypt, killing all 224 people aboard. Officials said the explosive device was planted in the plane's luggage compartment. A local affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility. \n In August 2004, two Russian planes were blown up on the same day by suicide bombers, killing 89 people. A Chechen warlord claimed responsibility for the twin attacks, which were made possible by lax security at a Moscow airport. \n While ruling out an attack in Sunday's crash, the FSB said that investigators are looking into bad fuel, pilot error, alien objects stuck in the engines or equipment failure. \n John Goglia, a former U.S. National Transportation Safety Board member and aviation safety expert, argued that while pilot error or bad fuel \"would be high on my list,\" they wouldn't have prevented the pilot from alerting traffic controllers to the situation. He also noted that the Tu-154 has been \"a pretty reliable platform.\" \n The Tu-154 is a Soviet-built three-engine airliner designed in the late 1960s. The plane that crashed Sunday was built in 1983, and underwent factory check-ups and maintenance in 2014 as well as earlier this year. \n While the Tu-154 is no longer used by Russian airlines because it's too noisy and fuel-hungry, the Russian military has continued to operate it. The plane has been popular with crews who appreciate its maneuverability and ruggedness. \n Flags were at half-staff across Russia on Monday, nationwide television stations canceled their entertainment programs and the Cabinet began its session with a moment of silence as part of the nationwide mourning. People piled up red and white carnations outside the Moscow office of the Alexandrov Ensemble, popular across the world for its fiery performances. \n Vadim Ananyev, a soloist who stayed home with his family, said he was devastated. \n \"I have lost my friends and colleagues, all killed, all five soloists,\" Ananyev told The Associated Press. \"I have known these people for 30 years. I know their wives and children. I feel terrible for the children and for all that I have lost.\" \n Ananyev said he had received condolences from all over Russia and from abroad. \n \"We were loved all over the world, never mind the political situation,\" he said. \n In Rome, Pope Francis led thousands of faithful in silent prayer for the plane crash victims and noted that the Russian army choir had performed in 2004 at the Vatican. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Kremlin plays down terror attack possibility in jet crash"}

The backing dancers' strapless costumes and polka-dot miniskirts also stunned the audience in China at a time when people still dressed in similar shades of green and gray. \n \"It was the first time a Western band had come to China, everyone was ready to make some noise and stand,\" said Li Ji, a restaurant owner who went to the concert in his 20s. \"But there were so many police officers there, people didn't dare to.\" \n Wham!'s manager Simon Napier-Bell had spent 18 months persuading the Chinese government to let them in and secure their place as one of the world's biggest bands by telling them it would help them attract foreign investment. \n The police had warned spectators to stay seated, worried that they would be unable to control the crowds and that there might even be riots. Some young Chinese who got up to dance were hauled away by security officers. \n The Wham! concert influenced Chinese musicians, who had never seen electric guitars played on stage and began to get interested in rock 'n' roll. \n Huang Wen, a music writer, said that the performance had an impact on big-name musicians, including the godfather of Chinese rock, Cui Jian. \"In the early 1980s, pop songs from Hong Kong were very popular in mainland China and after the concert college students and people in the music industry started to get interested in rock 'n' roll,\" she said. \n Li said the army department that his parents worked for had given out tickets as a benefit. He attended the concert along with his parents' colleagues and their kids. \n \"I remember there was a little incident during the concert, the main lights went out because there was a problem with the electricity, so the bassist danced a little break dance,\" Li said. \"It was the first time people saw that and it was so popular, people liked it.\" \n State media said Monday that the concert \"was a sensation.\" \n While young Chinese today don't know the names George Michael or Wham!, many instantly recognize his well-loved songs \"Last Christmas\" and \"Careless Whisper.\" The latter song had already been translated into Chinese and sung in several versions before the 1985 concert. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Wham!'s influence felt in China after landmark 1985 concert"}

{"date": "December 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster, 69, who will replace South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley if she joins Donald Trump's Cabinet is a large contrast from the nationally popular daughter of Indian immigrants who has been the face of the state for six years. \n COLUMBIA, S.C. >> If South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump's pick for United Nations ambassador, her successor will be an entrenched veteran of the state's GOP who as attorney general decided not to prosecute then-Gov. Mark Sanford for his spending after his disappearance to rendezvous with his mistress. \n Lt. Gov. Henry McMaster, a 69-year-old known for his ability to disagree affably, would get the job he's long wanted in the governorship. His leadership offers a sharp contrast in style if not in substance from Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants and the nation's youngest governor at 44, who hasn't hesitated to publicly bash legislators who differed with her. \n McMaster also was the nation's first statewide officeholder to back Trump for president, in an endorsement before the state's first-in-the-South presidential primary. The move stunned political observers, but McMaster's support never wavered, despite Democrats' calls to withdraw it. \n He told The Associated Press last month he never regretted the endorsement. \n \"No ma'am, the more it went on, the more confident I was he was the man for the job,\" he said in his characteristic, genteel drawl. He's revealed little about what he would do as governor, and his office said he wasn't available for an interview. \n But as a savvy political insider, McMaster has forged strong relationships statewide. \n He's \"a commonsense conservative \u2014 very reasonable, never abrasive,\" said House Judiciary Chairman Greg Delleney, R-Chester. \"He's a realist, and he's a gentleman, and I think he's going to work with the General Assembly to get things done.\" \n Legislators hope McMaster's entry could finally lead to passage of a comprehensive road-funding bill. Haley's threats to veto anything with a gas tax increase stymied efforts for years. \n Questioned by reporters after a meeting earlier this month, McMaster said, \"We will make progress, great progress,\" but gave no specifics. \n In the 2010 GOP primary, Haley trounced McMaster and two other better-known men partly by running against the \"good ol' boy\" network. Yet days after taking a 32-percentage-point beating, McMaster endorsed Haley with an exuberant \"I'm all in!\" and has been a close ally since. Beyond campaigning with her statewide, he arranged a series of private meetings between Haley and skeptical business leaders a week after she publicly chided the state Chamber of Commerce as a fan of bailouts and corporate welfare. \n Bakari Sellers, a Democrat who lost to McMaster in the 2014 lieutenant governor's race, contends McMaster \"exemplifies the good ol' boy network in South Carolina.\" \n \"Henry's been around a very long time. He's the status quo,\" said Sellers, a former state House member. \"Courageous and visionary are not adjectives you use to describe Henry McMaster.\" \n Other longtime political adversaries applaud McMaster's impending move. \n \"Henry is somebody who wants to do the right thing and move the state forward,\" said former state Democratic Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian, who's not one to pull punches. \"If a good ol' boy means somebody who remembers his friends and has a genial approach to governing, then I would take that as a compliment. He's not going to rant and rave and pick fights. He's not going to denigrate people publicly.\" \n McMaster began his political career in 1973 as an aide to then-U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond. He led the state Republican Party for 10 years, while the GOP took control of the Legislature. \n He frequently boasts of being President Ronald Reagan's first appointment for U.S. attorney in 1981 and launched \"Operation Jackpot,\" an investigation into international drug smuggling that resulted in more than 100 convictions. \n As state attorney general, he created a task force of officers posing as children to catch online sex predators and built an attorney network to prosecute criminal domestic violence.

{"date": "December 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This Dec. 20, 2016 photo shows the ice surface at the Union Arena in Woodstock, Vt. Organizers want to make the arena the nation's first skating rink to go \"net zero\" on energy, meaning no costs spent on electricity or heating fuel. \n WOODSTOCK, Vt. >> A small community skating rink that was once in danger of folding is working on a long-term plan to eliminate its biggest single expense \u2014 its energy bill \u2014 by becoming what its leaders believe would be the country's first with no costs for electricity or heating fuel. \n The plan includes upgrading the existing equipment at Woodstock's Union Arena for efficiency, finding ways to reuse some of the heat generated by the power-sucking compressors used to make ice and, finally, buying solar panels that will be erected elsewhere. \n While the long-term plan to eliminate the power bill, making the rink \"net zero,\" is in its early phases, the rink's electricity consumption from early November to early December was down 12.5 percent from the same period a year ago, said Harold Mayhew, the president of the Union Arena Board of directors and an architect who specializes in skating rinks. \n \"If you can make a hockey rink a net zero building, you can make anything net zero,\" said Mayhew, who designed the rink at Maine's Bowdoin College, which opened in 2009 and became the nation's first hockey rink to be certified by The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program, or LEED, that rates buildings for their energy efficiency. \n Energy costs are typically the largest bills for skating rinks, which use huge amounts of electricity to run the equipment that makes and maintains the ice used by hockey players, figure skaters and others, such as curlers . \n \"Utilities is what kills the rinks,\" said Paul Moore, the chairman of the Board of Governors for Falmouth Youth Hockey in Massachusetts and the coach of the Falmouth High School hockey team. He has worked to reduce his facility's electric bill by installing 4,400 solar panels on the roof and in a nearby parking lot that produces just short of 1 megawatt of electricity, enough for about 164 homes. \n Through a deal with a utility, the Falmouth facility is guaranteed for 10 years an $85,000 a year savings on its electric bill, but it's not down to zero. \n \"This has been huge for us,\" Moore said. \"We're a nonprofit. The youth hockey organization owns the rink, so this allows us to continue our mission statement of keeping tuition low and keeping ice rates low.\" \n Across the country, rinks large and small are always looking for ways to save energy and therefore money, said Kevin McLaughlin, the senior director of hockey development at USA Hockey, the organization that oversees most youth hockey programs in the country. \n For example, he said, at the University of Colorado, excess heat from the skating rink's ice system is used to heat the water in the swimming pool. National Hockey League teams are also working to save energy, and the NHL's Greener Rinks initiative is sharing best practices with the small community rinks. \n \"Community rinks are the front lines of our game,\" said Omar Mitchell, NHL's vice president for corporate and social responsibility. \n Mayhew, a Woodstock resident who designed the original rink that opened in 2003 and became involved again several years ago when the energy bill had helped push the rink to the brink of closing. Energy costs at about $140,000 a year were about a third of the rink's total budget. \n \"They were having such a hard time keeping the doors open they couldn't afford to do any of the work to cut down on energy consumption,\" said Mayhew, who joined the Board of Directors in 2013 and later became president. \n The first goal was to raise enough money to pay off the rink's debts. Then the rink embarked on its four-tier plan to eventually reach net zero. \n Mayhew designs rinks in New England, but he works with people who know the industry across North America and beyond. He says no one he has spoken with is aware of any other facility working to reduce its energy bill to zero. \n The rink is still raising the estimated $1.3 million that will be needed to make the changes. \n Mayhew said he hoped the net zero goal can be reached in about two years and then serve as an example for other rinks. \n \"I firmly believe that once the first one is done, there will be dozens in a very short time,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ice rinks across the country fight enemy No. 1: Energy bills"}

{"date": "December 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Oct. 14, 2016 photo, a technician works to prepare voting machines to be used in the upcoming election in Philadelphia. These paperless digital voting machines, used by roughly one in five U.S. voters last month, present one of the most glaring dangers to the security of the rickety, underfunded U.S. election system. \n ALLENTOWN, Pa. >> Jill Stein's bid to recount votes in Pennsylvania was in trouble even before a federal judge shot it down Dec. 12. That's because the Green Party candidate's effort stood little chance of detecting potential fraud or error in the vote \u2014 there was basically nothing to recount. \n Pennsylvania is one of 11 states where the majority of voters use antiquated machines that store votes electronically, without printed ballots or other paper-based backups that could be used to double-check the balloting. There's almost no way to know if they've accurately recorded individual votes \u2014 or if anyone tampered with the count. \n More than 80 percent of Pennsylvanians who voted Nov. 8 cast their ballots on such machines, according to VotePA, a nonprofit seeking their replacement. VotePA's Marybeth Kuznik described the proposed recount this way: \"You go to the computer and you say, 'OK, computer, you counted this a week-and-a-half ago. Were you right the first time?'\" \n These paperless digital voting machines, used by roughly 1 in 5 U.S. voters last month, present one of the most glaring dangers to the security of the rickety, underfunded U.S. election system. Like many electronic voting machines, they are vulnerable to hacking. But other machines typically leave a paper trail that could be manually checked. The paperless digital machines open the door to potential election rigging that might not ever be detected. \n Their prevalence also magnifies other risks in the election system, simply because error or fraud is harder to catch when vote counts can't be verified. And like other voting machines adopted since the 2000 election, the paperless systems are nearing the end of their useful life \u2014 yet there is no comprehensive plan to replace them. \n \"If I were going to hack this election, I would go for the paperless machines because they are so hard to check,\" said Barbara Simons, the co-author of \"Broken Ballots,\" a study of flawed U.S. voting technology. \n Stein described her recount effort as a way to ensure that the 2016 election wasn't tainted by hacking or fraud. There's no evidence of either so far \u2014 a fact federal judge Paul Diamond cited prominently in his decision halting the Pennsylvania recount . \n Stein pursued similar recounts in Wisconsin and Michigan, to little avail. Those states use more reliable paper-based voting technologies. (The Electoral College certified Donald Trump's presidential victory last week.) \n But a cadre of computer scientists from major universities backed Stein's recounts to underscore the vulnerability of U.S. elections. These researchers have successfully hacked e-voting machines for more than a decade in tests commissioned by New York, California, Ohio and other states. \n Stein and her witnesses said worries about fraud were justified given U.S. charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential campaign. Emails of top Democrats were hacked and leaked. Over the summer, hackers also tried to breach the voter registration databases of Arizona and Illinois using Russia-based servers, U.S. officials said. Election networks in at least 20 states were probed for vulnerabilities. \n \"It's a target-rich environment,\" said Rice University computer scientist Dan Wallach. Researchers would like to see the U.S. move entirely to computer-scannable paper ballots, because paper can't be hacked. \n The U.S. voting system \u2014 a loosely regulated, locally managed patchwork of more than 3,000 jurisdictions overseen by the states \u2014 employs more than two dozen types of machinery from 15 manufacturers. Elections officials across the nation say they take great care to secure their machines from tampering. They are locked away when not in use and sealed to prevent tampering. \n All of that makes national elections very difficult to steal without getting caught. \n But difficult is not impossible. Wallach and his colleagues believe a crafty team of pros could strike surgically, focusing on select counties in a few battleground states where \"a small nudge might be decisive,\" he said. \n Most voting machines in the U.S. are at or near the end of their expected lifespans . Forty-three states use machines more than a decade old. Most run on vintage operating systems such as Windows 2000 that pre-date the iPhone and are no longer updated with security patches. \n On Nov. 8, election officials across the U.S. handled numerous complaints of aging touchscreens losing calibration and casting votes for the wrong candidate. \n But while many experts agree the U.S. voting system needs an upgrade, no one wants to pay to fix it. \n Money flowed after the 2000 Florida recount debacle, when punch-card technology was discredited by hanging chads. Congress appropriated $4 billion for election upgrades; states raced to replace punch cards and lever machines with digital technology. \n But when that money ran out, so did the ability of many states to address security concerns overlooked in their initial rush. Four in 5 U.S. election officials polled by New York University's Brennan Center last year said they are desperate to replace equipment but lack the cash. \n Voters in poorer areas suffer disproportionately, the center found. Data collected in Virginia, Ohio, Minnesota and Colorado suggests the poor are more apt to encounter failing machines. \n In Virginia, wealthier counties near Washington have upgraded technology while lower-income counties in the state's southwest have not been able to afford it, said Edgardo Cortes, the state elections commissioner. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Recounts or no, U.S. elections are still vulnerable to hacking"}

{"date": "December 26, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The transition to Donald Trump's administration signals a possible end of eight years of sweeping Indian Country policy reforms under Obama, who met with tribal leaders annually. Trump, who rarely acknowledged Native Americans during his campaign, and since the election, hasn't publicly outlined how he would improve or manage the United States' longstanding relationships with tribes. \n For hundreds of protesters, it was cause to cheer when the Obama administration this month declined to issue an easement for the Dakota Access pipeline's final segment. But that elation was dampened by the uncertainty of what comes next: a Donald Trump-led White House that might be far less attuned to issues affecting Native Americans. \n \"With Trump coming into office, you just can't celebrate,\" said Laundi Germaine Keepseagle, who is 28 and from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where the demonstrators have been camped out near the North Dakota-South Dakota border. \n Anxiety over the 1,200-mile pipeline illustrates a broader uncertainty over how tribes will fare under Trump following what many in Indian Country consider a landmark eight years. \n President Barack Obama has won accolades among Native Americans for breaking through a gridlock of inaction on tribal issues and for putting a spotlight on their concerns with yearly meetings with tribal leaders. \n Under his administration, lawmakers cemented a tribal health care law that includes more preventive care and mental health resources and addresses recruiting and retaining physicians throughout Indian Country. \n The Interior Department restored tribal homelands by placing more than 500,000 acres under tribes' control \u2014 more than any other recent administration \u2014 while the Justice Department charted a process approved by Congress for tribes to prosecute and sentence more cases involving non-Native Americans who assault Native American women. Before Obama, a gap in the laws allowed for such crimes to go unpunished. \n In addition, the federal government settled decades-old lawsuits involving Native Americans, including class-action cases over the government's mismanagement of royalties for oil, gas, timber and grazing leases and its discrimination against tribal members seeking farm loans. \n \"In my opinion, President Obama has been the greatest president in dealing with Native Americans,\" said Brian Cladoosby, chairman of the Swinomish Tribe north of Seattle and president of the nonpartisan National Congress of American Indians, based in Washington, D.C. \"The last eight years give us hope going forward with the relationships we have on both sides of the aisle.\" \n Trump, meanwhile, rarely acknowledged Native Americans during his campaign and hasn't publicly outlined how he would improve or manage the United States' longstanding relationships with tribes. \n His Interior secretary pick, Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, sponsored legislation that he says would have given tribes more control over coal and other fossil fuel development on their lands. \n But some of Trump's biggest campaign pledges \u2014 including repealing health care legislation and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 would collide with tribal interests. \n In Arizona, Tohono O'odham Nation leaders have vowed to oppose any plans for a wall along the 75-mile portion of the border that runs parallel to their reservation. And the nonprofit National Indian Health Board in Washington says it's aiming to work with lawmakers to ensure the Indian Health Care Improvement Act remains intact. \n The law, which guarantees funding for care through the federal Indian Health Services agency, was embedded in Obama's health care overhaul after consultation with tribes. \n The government's role figures prominently in Native Americans' daily lives because treaties and other binding agreements often require the U.S. to manage tribal health care, law enforcement and education. \n Some tribal members say they're unsure how much Trump understands or cares about their unique relationship with the federal government. \n \"I think there was a great hope that we had here in Indian Country with the direct dialogue that President Obama had established with tribal nations,\" said Duane \"Chili\" Yazzie, president of the Navajo Nation's Shiprock Chapter. \"If a similar effort to communicate with us were carried on by the Trump administration, I would be surprised.\" \n Though most reservations lean Democratic in presidential elections, Trump does have some supporters in Indian Country. They hope the businessman can turn around lagging economies in rural reservations, such as the 27,000-square-mile Navajo Nation, which covers parts of Utah, New Mexico and Arizona. \n \"Trump is pro-job growth, and tribes need a healthy dose of business creation,\" said Deswood Tome, a former spokesman for the tribe from Window Rock, Arizona. \"To do that, a lot of federal barriers must be removed. We're the only ethnic group who have so much federal control in our lives.\" \n The Dakota Access pipeline illustrates another chasm between Obama and Trump. \n This fall, the pipeline dispute led Obama's administration to begin tackling a final piece of its Indian Country agenda: guidelines for how cabinet departments should consult with tribes on major infrastructure projects. \n A top complaint from the Standing Rock Sioux was that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to properly consult with them before initially approving a pipeline route that ran beneath Lake Oahe, the tribe's primary source of drinking water. \n After the administration halted construction on the project in September to review the complaint, it held seven meetings with tribal leaders and began drafting a report on how federal officials should consult with tribes. \n U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said the report will be completed before Obama leaves office, and she expects it to have a lasting impact, even with an incoming administration that promises to undo some of the president's policies. \n What's unclear is whether Trump, who once owned stock in the pipeline builder, will seek to reverse the Army's decision this month to explore alternate routes. \n A spokesman said only that the president-elect plans to review the move after he takes office. However, Trump's transition team said in a recent memo to campaign supporters and congressional staff that he supports the pipeline's completion. \n In the meantime, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault has begun lobbying for a meeting with Trump to make a case for his tribe's opposition to the project, which the chairman says threatens not just water but sacred cultural sites. \n \"You have to respect Mother Earth; she's precious,\" Archambault said. \"You can still believe in capitalism, and you can still invest in infrastructure projects, but these infrastructure projects should be focused toward renewable energy rather than fossil fuel development.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pipeline uncertainty illustrates broader concerns for tribes"}
