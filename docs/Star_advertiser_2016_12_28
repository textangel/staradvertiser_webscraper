{"date": "December 28, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump spoke to reporters today in Palm Beach, Fla. \n PALM BEACH, Fla. >> Donald Trump touted plans by a Japanese mogul today to bring 8,000 jobs to the United States.  \n They could be the first of the 50,000 jobs tech billionaire Masayoshi Son promised to create after meeting with the president-elect earlier in December. \n In the grand scheme of the economy, the jobs announcement is unlikely to have a major impact. Still, it's another example of how Trump is trying to stoke voters' belief that he is actively fighting for their well-being. \n The announcement came during a whirlwind day in which Trump accused President Barack Obama of throwing up \"inflammatory\" roadblocks during the transition of power and said his administration was treating Israel with \"total disdain.\" \n Son is the founder and chief executive of SoftBank, one of Japan's largest technology outfits. He owns the U.S. mobile carrier Sprint, which Trump said would be moving 5,000 jobs \"back\" to the United States. Son also controls OneWeb, which Trump said would hire 3,000 workers. \n It was unclear whether the president-elect was referencing the Dec. 6 commitment by Son to invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 jobs. \n Trump said the addition of 8,000 jobs was \"because of what's happening and the spirit and the hope.\" \n Still, the U.S. job market has been robust for much of 2016. Employers have added more than 2.2 million jobs over the past 12 months \u2014 a sign of economic health that pre-dates Trump's presidential victory. \n Sprint has struggled since its 2013 acquisition by SoftBank. The carrier shed roughly 9,000 workers between 2012 and 2016, reducing its staff to 30,000, according to annual reports. \n Sprint's attempt to join with rival T-Mobile failed in 2014 after regulators objected to combining two of the four largest mobile telecom companies in the United States. Analysts say a Trump administration would be more likely to approve telecom mergers, including a deal between Sprint and T-Mobile. \n Sprint Chief Executive Marcelo Claure said in a statement that the company is \"excited\" to work with Trump. \n \"We believe it is critical for business and government to partner together to create more job opportunities in the U.S. and ensure prosperity for all Americans,\" Claure said. \n The Sprint jobs announcement came after tensions rose and fell today between Trump and Obama. Trump has made it clear that it didn't sit well with him when Obama recently boasted that he would have won the election if he'd been running. \n \"Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks,\" Trump tweeted today. \"Thought it was going to be a smooth transition \u2014 NOT!\" \n Later, however, journalists at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida asked him about the tweet and how he thought the transition was going. \n He said: \"I think very, very smoothly. It's very good. You don't think so?\" \n Even later today, Trump told reporters he had spoken by phone with Obama and said the two \"had a very nice conversation.\" \n White House spokesman Eric Schultz said Obama phoned Trump. \"Today's call, like the others since the election, was positive and focused on continuing a smooth and effective transition,\" Schultz said. \"The president and president-elect committed to staying in touch over the next several weeks.\" \n Trump also took direct issue with the Obama administration's decision to let a United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israel pass. \n \"We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect,\" he said in a two-part tweet. \"They used to have a great friend in the U.S., but \u2026 not anymore. The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U.N.)! Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\" \n The president-elect's complaints about the treatment of Israel came a few hours before John Kerry made his final speech about Mideast peace as secretary of state. Kerry criticized Israel for settlement-building and accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of dragging Israel away from democracy. \n Trump resumed his busy schedule of meetings following a brief lull for the holidays. He first met with David Rubenstein, head of the Carlyle Group investment firm. He also met former California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado and former Texas A&M president Elsa Murano \u2014 two candidates for agriculture secretary. \n Trump also held meetings with a number of medical executives, likely for discussions about Obama's signature heath care plan, which Trump has called a \"total disaster.\" \n They include Mayo Clinic chief executive John Noseworthy; the head of Johns Hopkins medical center, Paul Rothman; the head of the Cleveland Clinic, Toby Cosgrove; and Partners Healthcare chief executive David Torchiana. Spicer said Trump would also discuss Obamacare in a meeting with former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson. \n Trump is telling visitors to his Florida club that he plans to write his inaugural address himself and is drawing inspiration from Presidents Ronald Reagan and John F.

{"date": "December 28, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / JUNE 21 \n Malcolm Lehi, a Ute Mountain Tribal Commissioner, pointed to a rock formation near Blanding, Utah. \n SALT LAKE CITY >> President Barack Obama designated two national monuments today at sites in Utah and Nevada that have become key flashpoints over use of public land in the U.S. West, marking the administration's latest move to protect environmentally sensitive areas in its final days. \n The Bears Ears National Monument in Utah will cover 1.35 million acres in the Four Corners region, the White House said. In a victory for Native American tribes and conservationists, the designation protects land that is considered sacred and is home to an estimated 100,000 archaeological sites, including ancient cliff dwellings. \n It's a blow for state Republican leaders and many rural residents who say it will add another layer of unnecessary federal control and close the area to new energy development, a common refrain in the battle over use of the American West's vast open spaces. Utah's attorney general vowed to sue. \n In Nevada, a 300,000-acre Gold Butte National Monument outside Las Vegas would protect a scenic and ecologically fragile area near where rancher Cliven Bundy led an armed standoff with government agents in 2014. It includes rock art, artifacts, rare fossils and recently discovered dinosaur tracks. \n The White House and conservationists said both sites were at risk of looting and vandalism. \n \"Today's actions will help protect this cultural legacy and will ensure that future generations are able to enjoy and appreciate these scenic and historic landscapes,\" Obama said in a statement. \n His administration has rushed to safeguard vulnerable areas ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. It has blocked new mining claims outside Yellowstone National Park and new oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean. Obama's creation and expansion of monuments covers more acreage than any other president. \n But Trump's upcoming presidency has tempered the excitement of tribal leaders and conservationists, with some worrying he could try to reverse or reduce some of Obama's expansive land protections. \n Utah's Republican senators vowed to work toward just that. \n \"This arrogant act by a lame duck president will not stand,\" U.S. Sen. Mike Lee tweeted about Bears Ears, which is named for a set of rock formations. \n Sen. Orrin Hatch said Obama showed \"an astonishing and egregious abuse of executive power\" and that \"far-left special interest groups matter more to him than the people who have lived on and cared for Utah's lands for generations.\" \n Christy Goldfuss, managing director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the Antiquities Act that allows a president to create monuments does not give a president authority to undo a designation, a rule the courts have upheld. She acknowledged that Congress could take action, though. \n Opponents agreed the area is a natural treasure worth preserving but worried the designation would restrict oil and gas development as well as residents' ability to camp, bike, hike and gather wood. \n New mining or energy development will be banned, but existing operations won't be affected, federal officials said. Wood and plant gathering is still allowed as well as hunting, fishing and other recreation, they said. \n Members of Utah's all-GOP congressional delegation had backed a plan to protect about 1.4 million acres at Bears Ears, while opening up other areas of the state for development. \n The boundaries of the monument are roughly based on that plan \u2014 significantly smaller than what a coalition of tribes had sought. \n But Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye called it an exciting day for his tribe and people of all cultures. \n \"We have always looked to Bears Ears as a place of refuge,\" Begaye said. \"The rocks, the winds, the land \u2014 they are living, breathing things that deserve timely and lasting protection.\" \n The Navajo Nation is one of five tribes that will get an elected official on a first-of-its-kind tribal commission for the Bears Ears monument. It will provide federal land managers with expertise about the area, officials said. \n Tucked between existing national parks and the Navajo reservation, the monument features stunning vistas at every turn, with a mix of cliffs, plateaus, towering rock formations, rivers and canyons across wide expanses covered by sagebrush and juniper trees. \n At the Gold Butte site, Native American rock art and artifacts are scattered amid rugged mountains, sandstone formations and Joshua tree forests. Pioneers used the area for cattle ranching and mining, while campers and ATV riders enjoy it today. It's named for an early 1900s mining town. \n Retiring Democratic Sen. Harry Reid pushed for protection of the remote area northeast of Lake Mead, but GOP members of Nevada's congressional delegation have been vocal opponents. \n The \"designation is a wonderful capstone to a career of fighting to protect Nevada's pristine landscapes,\" Reid said in a statement. \n Nevada Sen. Dean Heller and Gov. Brian Sandoval, both Republicans, said Congress should make land designations. \n But the governor said he \"recognized the inevitability\" of the move and met with landowners and White House officials to ensure it aligned with state water law and the land would be open to recreation. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama names Utah, Nevada monuments despite GOP opposition"}

Reynolds was 84. \n \"She's now with Carrie and we're all heartbroken,\" said Reynolds' son, Todd Fisher, from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where his mother was taken by ambulance earlier today. \n He said the stress of his sister's death \"was too much\" for Reynolds. \n Reynolds enjoyed the very heights of show business success and endured the depths of personal tragedy and betrayal. She lost one husband to Elizabeth Taylor and two other husbands plundered her for millions. Fisher, who found lasting fame as Princess Leia in \"Star Wars\" and struggled for much of her life with drug addiction and mental health problems, died on Tuesday after falling ill on a plane and being hospitalized. \n In her screen career, Reynolds was a superstar early in life. After two minor roles at Warner Bros. and three supporting roles at MGM, studio boss Louis B. Mayer cast her in \"Singin' in the Rain,\" despite Gene Kelly's objections. She was 19 with little dance experience, and she would be appearing with two of the screen's greatest dancers, Donald O'Connor and Kelly, who also co-directed. \n \"Gene Kelly was hard on me, but I think he had to be,\" Reynolds, who more than held her own in the movie, said in a 1999 Associated Press interview. \"I had to learn everything in three to six months. Donald O'Connor had been dancing since he was three months old, Gene Kelly since he was 2 years old. \u2026 I think Gene knew I had to be challenged.\" \n \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" was based on the life of a Colorado woman who rose from poverty to riches and triumphed over tragedy, including the sinking of the Titanic. \n The 1964 Meredith Willson musical, with Molly's defiant song \"I Ain't Down Yet,\" brought Reynolds her only Academy Award nomination. She also received a Tony nomination in 1973 when she starred on Broadway in the revival of \"Irene,\" in which her daughter also appeared. \n After her transition from starlet to star, Reynolds became immensely popular with teenage girls and even more so when in 1955 she married Eddie Fisher, the pop singer whose fans were equally devoted. \n The couple made a movie together, \"Bundle of Joy,\" which seemed to mirror the 1956 birth of Carrie. The Fishers also had a son, Todd, named for Eddie's close friend and Taylor's husband, showman Mike Todd. \n During this period, Reynolds had a No. 1 hit on the pop charts in 1957 with \"Tammy,\" the Oscar-nominated song from her film \"Tammy and the Bachelor.\" But the Cinderella story ended after Mike Todd died in a 1958 airplane crash. Fisher consoled the widow and soon announced he was leaving his wife and two children to marry Taylor. \n The celebrity world seemed to lose its mind. Taylor was assailed as a husband stealer, Fisher as a deserter of his family. Reynolds won sympathy as the innocent victim, a role emphasized when she appeared before news cameras with diaper pins on her blouse. A cover headline in Photoplay magazine in late 1958 blared: \"Smiling through her tears, Debbie says: I'm still very much in love with Eddie.\" \n Fisher's singing career never recovered, but Taylor, who left him for Richard Burton in 1962, remained a top star. And Reynolds' film career flourished. She starred with Glenn Ford in \"The Gazebo,\" Tony Curtis in \"The Rat Race,\" Fred Astaire in \"The Pleasure of His Company,\" Andy Griffith in \"The Second Time Around,\" with the all-star cast in \"How the West Was Won\" and Ricardo Montalban in \"The Singing Nun.\" \n She also provided the voice of Charlotte the spider in the 1973 animated \"Charlotte's Web.\" \n But over the years, her marital woes continued. \n In 1960 Reynolds married shoe magnate Harry Karl. The marriage ended in disaster when she discovered that Karl, a compulsive gambler, had devastated her assets and left her deeply in debt. She divorced him in 1973 and toured tirelessly with her song and dance show to pay off creditors. \n Reynolds' third marriage, to Virginia businessman Richard Hamlett in 1984, proved equally disastrous. In 1992, against friends' advice, she paid $10 million to buy and convert the faded Paddlewheel Hotel in Las Vegas into the Debbie Reynolds Hotel and Casino. She performed nightly and conducted tours of her movie memorabilia, which she had collected since MGM auctioned its artifacts in 1970. \n Reynolds, who ended up filing for bankruptcy in 1997 and selling the property at auction the next year, accused Hamlett of making off with her money. She once again went on the road. \n \"All of my husbands have robbed me blind,\" she asserted in 1999. \"The only one who didn't take money was Eddie Fisher. He just didn't pay for the children.\" \n In her later years, Reynolds continued performing her show, traveling 40 weeks a year. She also appeared regularly on television, appearing as John Goodman's mother on \"Roseanne\" and a mom on \"Will & Grace.\" Her books included the memoirs \"Unsinkable\" and \"Make 'Em Laugh.\" \n In 1996 she won critical acclaim in the title role of Albert Brooks' movie \"Mother,\" in which Brooks played a struggling writer who moves back home and works on his strained relationship with Reynolds' character. A few years earlier, she had wanted to play the mother in the film adaptation of Fisher's bittersweet autobiographical novel \"Postcards From the Edge,\" which featured mother-daughter actresses. Director Mike Nichols cast Shirley MacLaine instead. \n Reynolds and Fisher were featured together in the HBO documentary \"Bright Lights,\" scheduled for release in 2017. \n Mary Frances Reynolds spent the first eight years of her life in Depression-era poverty in El Paso, Texas, where she was born on April 1, 1932. Her father, a carpenter for the Southern Pacific Railroad, was transferred to southern California and the family settled in Burbank, near Warner Bros. studio. \n The girl flourished, winning 48 Girl Scout merit badges, excelling in sports and playing French horn and bass viola in the Burbank Youth Symphony. Girlfriends persuaded her to enter the beauty contest for Miss Burbank, and she won over the judges by lip-syncing to a Betty Hutton record. \n She did team up with Taylor \u2014 long since divorced from Fisher \u2014 and two other veterans, Joan Collins and MacLaine, for the 2001 TV movie \"These Old Broads.\" The script, co-written by Reynolds' daughter, was about aging, feuding actresses who get together for a reunion show. Reynolds would look back wryly on the Taylor affair, acknowledging that no man could have resisted her and that she actually voted for Taylor when she was up for best actress in 1960. The former romantic rivals had reconciled years before Taylor died in 2011; Reynolds recalled they had both been passengers on the Queen Elizabeth. \n \"I sent a note to her and she sent a note to me in passing, and then we had dinner together,\" she told The Huffington Post a few months after Taylor's death. \"She was married to Richard Burton by then. I had been remarried at that point. And we just said, 'Let's call it a day.' And we got smashed.

{"date": "December 28, 2016", "text": "DALLAS >> A police dashcam video released five months after a Texas officer shot a black man appears to show the man walking away as the officer fired, and the man's lawyer says he was not a threat. \n David Collie was shot in the back, leaving him paralyzed, lawyer Nate Washington said today. Police said at the time of the July encounter that a Fort Worth officer fired twice, striking Collie \"once in the lower torso.\" \n The officer and a Tarrant County sheriff's deputy with him were off-duty at the time and working a security detail at an apartment complex, Washington said. \n Police were searching for two shirtless black men who they believed had committed a robbery near a gas station, Washington said. Authorities said in a news release they issued at the time that Collie pulled a box cutter from his pocket and pointed it at the officers. \n Collie was charged with aggravated assault on a public servant but a grand jury declined to indict him. \n Fort Worth police today defended the actions of the officers, who they have not named. Sgt. Marc Povero said in a statement that Collie failed to comply with commands to stop and that he appeared to point a silver object at the deputy, consistent with earlier reports by the robbery victim that a suspect flashed a silver handgun. Washington said Collie was not involved in the robbery. A box cutter found nearby didn't belong to Collie, Washington said. \n The shooting occurred late at night and darkness obscures Collie's actions, but the video seems to show him pointing in another direction as he walks away and it is not clear if there is anything in his hand. \n Povero said a department review of the incident had been completed but declined to discuss the outcome. The officer who shot Washington has since returned to duty, he said. Povero declined to comment on the race of the officer. \n The 33-year-old Collie was walking from work to a friend's apartment when the officers approached him in their patrol vehicle, Washington said. The video appears to show the Fort Worth officer firing his weapon about 10 seconds after exiting the vehicle and as Collie walked away. \n The video was obtained about three weeks ago from the Tarrant County district attorney's office through an open-records request, Washington said. The attorney said he released the video Tuesday at a news conference at Collie's insistence because Collie was tired of comments made to his mother by people assuming he must have done something wrong. \n Washington said Collie wanted to make clear he \"didn't do anything to threaten an officer.\" \n The two officers argued over the decision to fire on Collie, Washington said, and the deputy prayed with him as he was on the ground. \n \"I don't believe most people are racist but there are indeed racial biases that persist, and they don't go away when you go to the police academy,\" Washington said. \"Having racial biases doesn't necessarily make you a bad person but we need to find a way to remove them when it comes to police work.\" \n The release of the video came just days after the Fort Worth police were in the spotlight over another incident. A cellphone video captured a white Fort Worth officer last week wrestling a black woman to the ground and then arresting her and her two daughters.

No Nazis.\" \n The owners of Cafe 8 1/2 have taken down a sign from the Italian restaurant's front door telling voters of President-elect Donald Trump they did not want them there. \n The sign at the downtown Honolulu restaurant said, \"If you voted for Trump, you cannot eat here! No Nazis.\" \n Robert Warner, chef and restaurant co-owner, said he took down the pencil-scrawled sign this morning because he felt there was no point in keeping it up. \n \"It's not necessary anymore,\" Warner said. \"It ran its course \u2026 no need for more aggravation for me or them and all that.

My son needs his mother, my husband needs his wife. I am not letting my mother bury me. I can't let this happen,\" Karen Klein told \"Good Morning America\" this week. \n Klein, recounting her roughly 30-hour journey in an interview from her hospital bed in Utah, said the family realized too late Thursday that their GPS sent them onto forest roads covered in dense snow. They were trying to reach the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, which is closed for the winter. \n Their car got stuck. Husband Eric Klein had recently suffered a back injury, so his 46-year-old wife, a marathon runner, decided to walk for help, leaving her family with the car. \n Klein, walking through snow that reached 3 feet deep, got lost. Eric Klein and the couple's son Isaac tried to follow but had to turn around, Coconino County, Arizona, sheriff's spokeswoman Erika Wiltenmuth told The Associated Press. \n The next afternoon, the 47-year-old father tried again to get help, hiking nearly 10 miles in a different direction until he found cellphone service to call 911, Wiltenmuth said. \n Rescuers took the father and son to get treated for exposure and launched an air-and-ground search for the missing mother. \n Karen Klein, a community college professor in Easton, Pennsylvania, had set out wearing a parka, a knit cap and hiking boots but not snow gear, sheriff's deputies said. \n She told NBC News that she ate aspen and evergreen twigs for sustenance but pulled a muscle and lost a shoe due to compacted snow. She said she kept herself awake amid the freezing temperatures by talking to herself and rocking back and forth to stay warm. \n Klein finally found a cabin, breaking a window to get in and then curling up on a bed. \n Rescuers on snowmobiles found her just after midnight on Christmas Eve, hours before a major winter storm was expected to hit. \n Klein was exhausted and dehydrated. Crews airlifted her to a Utah hospital, where she was being treated for exposure. \n \"I think that people should realize that they have more strength within them than they think, whether it's a mental strength or a physical strength, and to draw upon that and to not give up hope,\" Klein told \"GMA.\" \n The cabin where she was found is at a closed entrance station about 30 miles from the gate where the highway is closed for the winter. \n Several National Park Service employees stay at the North Rim over the winter and can get in and out on snowmobiles, but they're miles away where the park lodge, campground and other closed facilities are located. \n Klein said she feels lucky to be alive but is grappling with some frostbite on her toes, which she's not sure if she will lose. \n \"In the grand scheme of things,\" she said, \"I keep thinking: 'You know what? It's a few toes. Don't worry about it.'\" \n Klein didn't respond to emails, Facebook messages or calls to the hospital Tuesday from the AP. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mom says she ate twigs, snow to survive 26-mile hike in snow"}

{"date": "December 28, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Secretary of State John Kerry spoke about Israeli-Palestinian policy, today, at the State Department in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Secretary of State John Kerry tore into Israel today for settlement-building, accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of dragging Israel away from democracy and forcefully rejecting the notion that America had abandoned Israel with a controversial U.N. vote. Netanyahu accused the Obama administration of a biased bid to blame Israel for failure to reach a peace deal. \n In a farewell speech, Kerry laid out a two-state vision for peace that he won't be in office to implement, but that the U.S. hoped might be heeded even after President Barack Obama's term ends. He defended Obama's move last week to allow the U.N. Security Council to declare Israeli settlements illegal, the spark that set off an extraordinary and deepening diplomatic spat between the U.S. and its closest Mideast ally. \n \"If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic, it cannot be both, and it won't ever really be at peace,\" Kerry said in a speech that ran more than an hour, a comprehensive airing of grievances that have built up in the Obama administration over eight years but were rarely, until this month, discussed publicly. \n Netanyahu pushed back in a hastily arranged televised statement in which he suggested he was done with the Obama administration and ready to deal with President-elect Donald Trump, who has sided squarely with Israel. The Israeli leader faulted Kerry for obsessing over settlements while paying mere \"lip service\" to Palestinian attacks and incitement of violence. \n \"Israelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by foreign leaders,\" Netanyahu said from Jerusalem. \n The dueling recriminations marked a low point for U.S.-Israel relations, and a bitter end to eight years of frustrated ties between Obama and Netanyahu, who quarreled repeatedly over settlements, the peace process and Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. \n It was unclear what impact Kerry's speech, coming in the final days of the administration, might have. \n Netanyahu expressed concern that a French-hosted summit next month could lead to an international framework that the U.N. Security Council might then codify with Obama's assent, boxing Israel in. Yet Kerry seemed to rule out the possibility Obama would take more parting shots, such as promoting that type of U.N. resolution or recognizing Palestinian statehood. \n The diplomatic fracas erupted last week when the U.S., in a departure from past policy, decided to abstain rather than veto a U.N. Security Council resolution calling Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem a violation of international law. Israel was incensed, and today, Netanyahu claimed Israel has \"absolute, indispensable evidence\" the U.S. actually spearheaded the resolution. \n Netanyahu offered what he called proof of U.S. collusion: a document, leaked to an Egyptian newspaper, that purports to be a Palestinian account of a December meeting between top U.S. and Palestinian officials. But White House spokesman Ned Price called it a \"total fabrication\" and added: \"This meeting never occurred.\" \n Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas responded to the speech by reaffirming that he's ready to resume peace talks if Israel halts settlement construction. \n Kerry, unveiling a six-part outline of what a future peace deal could look like, deviated from the traditional U.S. message that foreign powers shouldn't impose a solution. His outline tracked closely with principles long assumed to be part of an eventual deal, and Kerry insisted he was merely describing what's emerged as points of general agreement. \n Though Kerry faulted Palestinian leaders for insufficiently condemning violence and terrorism against Israelis, most of his speech focused on Israel. He said the two-state solution, the basis for all serious peace talks for years, was \"now in serious jeopardy,\" and called Netanyahu's' government \"the most right-wing in Israel's history.\" \n He invoked the widespread concern that the growing Arab population in Israel and the Palestinian territories will eventually make Jews a minority in Israel, creating a demographic crisis for Israel unless there's a separate Palestinian state. \n \"The settler agenda is defining the future of Israel. And their stated purpose is clear: They believe in one state,\" Kerry said. \n The U.S, the Palestinians and most of the world oppose Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967 and claimed by the Palestinians for an independent state. But Israel's government argues previous construction freezes failed to advance a peace deal and that the future of the settlements \u2014 now home to 600,000 Israelis \u2014 must be resolved in direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians. \n While Israel's Arab population has citizenship rights, the roughly 2.5 million Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank do not. Israel has annexed east Jerusalem, where Palestinians have residency rights but few have citizenship, in a move not internationally recognized. \n Kerry said a future deal would have to ensure secure borders for Israel and a Palestinian state formed in territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war, with \"mutually agreed, equivalent swaps.\" He said both countries must fully recognize each other, ensure access to religious sites and relinquish all other existing claims. Kerry also called for assistance to help Palestinian refugees. \n Yet he offered fewer details about how to get to such a deal, given the failure of so many previous attempts, including his own nine-month effort that collapsed in 2014. He urged Israelis and Palestinians to take \"realistic steps on the ground now\" to begin separating themselves into two states. \n Kerry reiterated that the Obama administration's commitment to Israel was as strong as that of previous presidents, but he also noted that previous U.S. administrations had also abstained on certain resolutions critical of Israel. \n Obama, who is vacationing in Hawaii, hasn't commented publicly on the resolution or the resulting spat. \n Associated Press writers Josef Federman and Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "In parting shot, Kerry tears into Israel over settlements"}

He says that while the cost of living is higher in Japan, access to health care is not. \n Newly widowed, Kay McCowen quit her job, sold her house, applied for Social Security and retired to Mexico. It was a move she and her husband, Mel, had discussed before he passed away in 2012. \n \"I wanted to find a place where I could afford to live off my Social Security,\" she said. \"The weather here is so perfect, and it's a beautiful place.\" \n She is among a growing number of Americans who are retiring outside the United States. The number grew 17 percent between 2010 and 2015 and is expected to increase over the next 10 years as more baby boomers retire. \n Just under 400,000 American retirees are now living abroad, according to the Social Security Administration. The countries they have chosen most often: Canada, Japan, Mexico, Germany and the United Kingdom. \n Retirees most often cite the cost of living as the reason for moving elsewhere, said Olivia S. Mitchell, director of the Pension Research Council at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. \n \"I think that many people retire when they are in good health and they are interested in stretching their dollars and seeing the world,\" Mitchell said. \n McCowen's rent in Ajijic, a community outside Guadalajara near Mexico's Lake Chapala, is half of what she was paying in Texas. And since the weather is moderate, utility bills are inexpensive. \n In some countries, Mitchell said, retirees also may find it less expensive to hire someone to do their laundry, clean, cook and even provide long-term care than in the United States. \n McCowen has a community of other American retirees nearby and has adjusted well. \n But for others there are hurdles to overcome to adjust to life in a different country. \n Viviana Rojas, an associate professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio, says the biggest obstacle is not speaking the language or knowing the culture. \n \"Many of the people we interviewed said they spoke Spanish, but they actually spoke very little Spanish,\" said Rojas, who is writing a book about retirees in Mexico. \"They didn't have the capacity of speaking enough Spanish to meet their basic needs like going to the doctor or to the store.\" \n Access to health care also can be a challenge. While retirees still can receive Social Security benefits, Medicare is not available to those living abroad, Mitchell said. \n Joseph Roginski, 71, says that while the cost of living is higher in Japan, access to health care is not. \"Things are very expensive here. It is impossible to live off Social Security alone,\" said Roginski, who was stationed in Japan in 1968. \"But health insurance is a major factor in staying here.\" \n The former military language and intelligence specialist said he pays $350 annually to be part of Japan's national health insurance. His policy covers 70 percent of his costs. The rest is covered by a secondary insurance program for retired military personnel. \n Japan experienced the biggest growth of American retirees \u2014 at 42 percent \u2014 and more than any other country between 2010 and 2014, according to data from the Social Security Administration. The large U.S. military presence in the country may be a factor. \n There are more than 50,000 U.S. military servicemen and -women stationed in Japan. The presence is so large that in the island of Okinawa, the U.S. military occupies about 19 percent of the area, according to Ellis S. Krauss, professor emeritus of Japanese politics and policy-making at the University of California, San Diego. \n Roginski, who volunteers for the Misawa Air Base Retiree Activities Office, said he helps connect more than 450 retirees and their families living in Northern Japan with resources. He said he would never move back to the United States. \n \"We have a real strong sense of security here,\" he said. \"I can leave my door unlocked and no one will take anything. When I go to another country I feel nervous, but when I come back I feel like I'm home.\" \n Mexico has become home for retired firefighter, Dan Williams, 72, and his wife, Donna, 68. The couple has been living near the same retirement community in Lake Chapala for 14 years. \n \"The climate and the medical services are very good,\" Williams said. \n Williams teaches painting to adults and children and puts together a monthly magazine for the local American Legion. He is also a member of the Lake Chapala Society, which offers daily activities for American retirees. \n It was those same services that attracted McCowen to the region. \n \"Before moving, I found out how many widowed and divorced women lived here,\" she said. \"There is comfort in numbers.\" \n She says she loves being in a lively community. \n \"I see older people walking year round. I see them all over the place, even in their wheelchairs. If they were in the U.S., they would probably be in a nursing home,\" she said. \"I don't think I could move back.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Growing number of Americans are retiring outside the U.S."}

On a busy day, Savukynas said that fellow elves report as many as 10 or 20 to get them removed. He himself focuses on writing, maintaining a personal blog devoted to, among other things, deconstructing Soviet nostalgia or pulling apart conspiracy theories. \n The elves do a decent job of \"pinpointing some manipulation and some social networking sites,\" said Nerijus Maliukevicius, a researcher at Vilnius University's Institute of International Relations, who studies the role of media during times of conflict. But in a telephone interview, Maliukevicius said that Lithuania needs a complex counterstrategy to beat what he describes as Kremlin propaganda. \n \"Elves are just one bit of this,\" he said. \n Talk of Russian interference is bubbling on both sides of the Atlantic in the wake of the recent U.S. election, which propelled Russia-friendly candidate Donald Trump to power amid allegations of Kremlin interference. Earlier this month, Germany's intelligence agency accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the country with propaganda and cyberattacks before its general election planned for next year. \n Lithuania, which like other Baltic nations was long subject to Moscow's rule, feels those concerns more keenly than most \u2014 all the more so after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. \n And the elf versus troll war on Facebook is just one battlefield. News websites and broadcasters have also been drawn into the mix. \n \"We recognized, especially recently, that we have a pretty huge and long lasting disinformation campaign against our society,\" said Tomas Ceponis, an analyst for the Lithuanian military. He said the power of propaganda was harder to quantify than tanks or planes, but it was clearly aimed at \"really a very huge variety of targets.\" \n Delfi, one of the main news sites in Lithuania, was one of them. It found its comment sections filling up with pro-Russia posts in the lead up to the Ukrainian confrontation, said Monika Garbaciauskaite, the editor-in-chief, and now has full-time staff deleting the most extreme messages. \n The hostile propaganda has led to more aggressive action from both sides. \n Lithuania's leading commercial news channel TV3 has been repeatedly targeted by hackers who compromised the group's networks three times, according to Sigitas Babilius, TV3's head of news. Last month, Lithuania banned Russia's RTR Planeta channel until February after a Russian politician made anti-U.S. comments deemed as \"incitement to war, discord and hatred.\" Similar three-month bans on Russian state-owned channels have been ordered in previous years. \n Lithuania, meanwhile, has launched a campaign on television urging citizens to report any suspicious activity \u2014 on the street or on the web. \n The moves rankle Moscow's representative to the tiny NATO nation. \n \"I do not think that sticking a propaganda label on another's point of view is right,\" Russian Ambassador Alexander Udaltsov told the AP. \"It's always better to use counterarguments to prove your truth, but unfortunately our Western partners lack these arguments and continue with bans of Russian TV stations.\" \n Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius makes no apology for the bans. \n \"A lie is not an alternative point of view,\" Linkevicius said. \"One can say 'it's freedom of speech, everyone can say whatever he wants.' Of course, I agree. But if it's (a) resourced propaganda machine brainwashing people, it's not just an alternative point of view. It's a weapon.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n AP Cybersecurity Writer Raphael Satter in Paris contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lithuanian 'elves' combat Russian influence online"}

{"date": "December 28, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A Russian Emergency Ministry diver lifts a fragment of a plane in the Black Sea, outside Sochi, Russia, Tuesday, Dec. 27, 2016. \n MOSCOW >> Search teams on Wednesday recovered another flight recorder from a military plane that crashed in the Black Sea, killing all 92 aboard, the Defense Ministry said. \n The first flight recorder was found the previous day and experts have started analyzing its data to determine the cause of the crash. \n The Tu-154 of the Russian Defense Ministry crashed into the sea early Sunday, two minutes after taking off in good weather from the city of Sochi. It was carrying members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, widely known as the Red Army Choir, to a New Year's concert at a Russian military base in Syria. \n The Defense Ministry said 15 bodies and 239 body fragments have been recovered from the crash site. It previously said 17 bodies had been found. \n A massive recovery effort has involved 3,600 people, including about 200 navy divers flown to the site from all over Russia. They have been aided by drones and submersibles. \n Investigators were looking into whether the crash might have been caused by bad fuel, pilot error, equipment failure or objects stuck in the engines. The top Russian investigative agency said it had taken samples from a fuel tank used to fill the plane, which flew from Moscow's Chkalovsky military airport and stopped in Sochi for refueling. \n The Komsomolskaya Pravda daily and online publication Life.ru published what they described as a script of cockpit conversation, with a pilot yelling about a problem with the plane's flaps and then shouting: \"Commander, we are falling!\" It was impossible to verify the report, but both publications were known to have good connections with Russian security agencies. \n Flaps are moveable panels mounted on the edge of the wings to increase lift. \n The Kommersant daily also said that investigators believed that the crash was caused by a combination of malfunctioning flaps and pilot error, which caused the plane to lose speed and stall. \n Russia's main domestic security and counter-terrorism agency, the FSB, said it found \"no indications or facts pointing at the possibility of a terror attack or an act of sabotage\" on the plane. \n However, some aviation experts have noted that the crew's failure to report any technical problem and the large area over which fragments of the plane were scattered could point to a possible explosion on board. \n The Tu-154 is a Soviet-built three-engine airliner designed in the late 1960s. Russian airlines decommissioned the noisy, fuel-guzzling aircraft years ago, but the military and other government agencies continue using the plane, which is still loved by crews for its maneuverability and sturdiness. \n The plane that crashed Sunday was built in 1983 and underwent factory checkups and maintenance in 2014 as well as earlier this year. Investigators have taken relevant documents from the plant that did the job. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Second flight recorder recovered from Black Sea crash site"}
