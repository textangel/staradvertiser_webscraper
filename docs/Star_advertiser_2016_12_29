After a pair of diplomatic victories, the Palestinians are now setting their sights on a Mideast peace conference in France next month in a bid to rally support as they prepare for the uncertainty of the Trump Administration. \n RAMALLAH, West Bank >> After a pair of diplomatic victories, the Palestinians are now setting their sights on a Mideast peace conference in France next month in a bid to rally support as they prepare for the uncertainty of the Trump administration. \n The Palestinians are hopeful that a strong international endorsement in Paris will insulate them from what they fear will be a close alliance between President-elect Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \n With their hopes for gaining independence in a deep freeze, the Palestinians had a rare week of optimism. First, the U.S. allowed the U.N. Security Council to adopt Resolution 2334, which declared Israeli settlements on occupied lands illegal. Then, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry delivered a farewell speech that harshly criticized Israeli settlements, saying Israel's continued construction was imperiling hopes for a peace agreement and endangering the country's democracy. \n Palestinian officials say they are now counting on the French-hosted Mideast peace conference to build on the momentum and set clear terms of reference for any future negotiations with Israel. Some 70 nations are expected to attend, although Israel and the Palestinians will not be participating. \n \"The tools we have now are Security Council Resolution 2334, the Kerry speech and the Paris conference,\" said Husam Zumlot, a senior adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. He said the Palestinians would seek to make the resolution \"a base for any political initiative.\" \n The Palestinians seek the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war, for an independent state. They say that Israeli settlements in these areas, now home to about 600,000 Israelis, are threatening their hopes for independence by taking in lands where they hope to establish their state. \n The latest U.N. resolution, along with Kerry's speech, essentially endorsed the Palestinian position by calling for the pre-1967 lines to serve as the reference point for a final border. Netanyahu, who opposes a return to the 1967 lines, has condemned the moves as \"skewed\" and \"shameful.\" Netanyahu says all disputes must be settled through direct negotiations without any preconditions, and that any international pressure undermines the negotiating process. \n In a speech on Thursday, Netanyahu dismissed Israel's conflict with the Palestinians as a \"marginal issue.\" The real issue, he said, is the \"collapse of entire nations, of entire states in internal conflict, and in the wars of radical Islam over the future of the Arab world and the Muslim world.\" \n With the gaps so wide, and with little faith in the U.S. as a neutral broker, the Palestinians have long tried to engage the international community in their conflict with Israel, seeking membership in the U.N. and other international bodies to promote their cause. \n \"We are going to end the old formula of direct talks with Israel under U.S. sponsorship,\" Zumlot said. \"Now we have the tools to do that.\" \n That strategy appears even more critical as Trump prepares to assume the presidency. While the president elect has not outlined a Mideast strategy, he has given a number of signs that he will be far more sympathetic to Netanyahu than was the Obama White House. \n His campaign platform made no mention of Palestinian independence, an objective of Republican and Democrat presidents for the past two decades, and his choice for ambassador to Israel has strong ties to the West Bank settler movement. He has promised to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, despite Palestinian objections, and says Obama has treated Israel with \"total disdain.\" \n \"Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!\" Trump wrote on his Twitter feed shortly before Kerry's speech on Wednesday. \n Netanyahu replied with his own tweet, thanking Trump for his \"warm friendship\" and \"clear-cut support for Israel.\" \n The Palestinians have said little about Trump publicly, but some officials privately say they are concerned about his budding friendship with Netanyahu. Earlier this month, Trump transition officials turned down a request to meet with a Palestinian delegation in Washington, after holding meetings with several senior Israeli officials, including the head of the Mossad spy agency. \n Jibril Rajoub, a senior Palestinian official, played down the Trump-Netanyahu partnership. \"What can this alliance to do us?\" he said. \"They know that any pressure tactics on us would lead to deterioration. That is not in the interest of anyone.\" \n In the meantime, the Palestinians say they are pressing forward with an outreach program to the Israeli public in hopes of rallying support for moderates who oppose the policies of Netanyahu's nationalist government. \n On Thursday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas hosted a group of 13 officials from the Israeli opposition Zionist Union party. Another group of Israeli leaders is expected on Jan. 5. \n \"We are reaching out to the Israeli society to remind everyone of the mutual interest in the two-state solution,\" said Ziad Darwesh, an official in the Palestinian outreach program. \"We see changes in the Israeli society.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "With clock ticking, Palestinians pin hopes on Paris summit"}

Johnson Lumber Co. in Riddle, Ore., poses for a photo as he shows an example of a cross-laminated timber, or CLT, panel that underwent a flammability test. \n RIDDLE, Ore. >> John Redfield watches with pride as his son moves a laser-guided precision saw the size of a semi-truck wheel into place over a massive panel of wood. \n Redfield's fingers are scarred from a lifetime of cutting wood and now, after decades of decline in the logging business, he has new hope that his son, too, can make a career shaping the timber felled in southern Oregon's forests. \n That's because Redfield and his son work at D.R. Johnson Lumber Co., one of two U.S. timber mills making a new wood product that's the buzz of the construction industry. It's called cross-laminated timber, or CLT, and it's made like it sounds: rafts of 2-by-4 beams aligned in perpendicular layers, then glued \u2014 or laminated \u2014 together like a giant sandwich. \n The resulting panels are lighter and less energy-intensive than concrete and steel and much faster to assemble on-site than regular timber, proponents say. Because the grain in each layer is at a right angle to the one below and above it, there's a counter-tension built into the panels that supporters say makes them strong enough to build even the tallest skyscrapers. \n \"We believe that two to five years out, down the road, we could be seeing this grow from just 20 percent of our business to potentially 60 percent of our business,\" said Redfield, D.R. Johnson's chief operating officer. \"We're seeing some major growth factors.\" \n From Maine to Arkansas to the Pacific Northwest, the material is sparking interest among architects, engineers and researchers. Many say it could infuse struggling forest communities like Riddle with new economic growth while reducing the carbon footprint of urban construction with a renewable building material. \n Visually blemished wood that currently goes to waste can be used in the middle layers of a CLT panel without sacrificing strength or look. Supporters say it could bring sawmills back online while improving forest health through thinning dense stands and making use of low-value wood and local tree species. Trees as small as 5 inches in diameter at the top and those damaged by pests and wildfire are prime candidates. \n But challenges remain before CLT becomes as common in the United States as it is in Europe and Canada, and not all builders are sold. \n U.S. building codes generally place height limits on all-wood buildings for safety reasons, though a special committee of the International Code Council is investigating potential changes to address the use of CLT in such structures. And research is still underway on critical questions of how these buildings withstand fire and earthquakes in high-seismic regions. \n Building codes in Oregon allow cutting-edge designs using new technology like CLT in some cases, but only after rigorous testing and an intensive approval process. \n That can make such projects cost-prohibitive, said Peter Dusicka, an engineering professor at Portland State University who's been researching the strength of CLT panels. \n \"The early adopters are looking at it and seeing it as a good opportunity,\" but before CLT can take off, there will have to be more examples to get people excited and more mills producing it, said Thomas DeLuca, professor and director of University of Washington's School of Environmental and Forest Sciences. \n SmartLam in Montana is the other company producing CLT panels. \n This spring, cross-laminated timber will get its ultimate test in the United States when a Portland architectural firm breaks ground on a 12-story wood building in the city's trendy Pearl District. It would be the tallest all-wood building in the world constructed in a seismic zone and the tallest all-wood building in North America. \n An all-wood building in Norway is taller, but is not in a seismic zone. An 18-story wood building in British Columbia is also taller, but rests on a traditional concrete core. \n Lever Architecture is using $1.5 million it won in a tall wood building competition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the softwood industry that's intended to promote CLT as a domestic building material. A 10-story residential tower in New York City also got $1.5 million. \n The Portland firm has been working with scientists at Portland State University and Oregon State University to test the panels' strength by subjecting them to hundreds of thousands of pounds of pressure. They are also testing various methods for joining the massive panels together. \n \"We're looking at creating a resilient design, a design that could withstand a major earthquake \u2014 basically the earthquake that we all worry about \u2014 and be repaired,\" said Thomas Robinson, founder of Lever Architecture. \n The results of the structural testing in Oregon will be made public for other U.S. designers, bringing the material one step closer to the mainstream, Dusicka said. \n Back in Riddle, a tiny town tucked in the mist-shrouded forests of Douglas County, Redfield is once more excited about timber in a place where logging used to be king. \n The 125-employee company has been inundated with visitors from around country interested in touring their new CLT business expansion. \n Watching as layers of beams whirred through a glue machine, Redfield said: \"We're able to take wood that may be turned into chips or pulp and turn it into a product that's pretty exciting.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New wood technology may offer hope for struggling timber"}

Yu is one of seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body. His speech could be a measure of how much Beijing is willing to yield in potential dialogue with the Holy See. \n State media reported that Yu called on Catholic churches to adhere to \"socialism with Chinese characteristics,\" \u2014 a term that describes China's model of development, which for decades has favored economic liberalization but not political reform. China's ruling Communist Party is officially atheistic. Yu also said Chinese Catholics should adhere \"to the correct direction of development.\" \n China and the Vatican have long clashed over whether the party-controlled Chinese church could operate outside the pope's authority. Beijing severed relations with the Holy See in 1951, shortly after the Communist Party took power, and officially allows worship only in state-sanctioned churches. Many of China's estimated 12 million Catholics are thought to worship in underground congregations. \n Starting under Pope Benedict XVI, the Vatican has sought to unite Chinese Catholics under the Holy See. Pope Francis has said that both sides had resumed meetings of working groups over the naming of bishops, an issue central to the dispute between both sides. \n But just last week, the Vatican said it was saddened that the ordination of two new Chinese bishops was marred by the presence of a bishop ordained without the pope's consent. It said it would watch this week's conference with hope for new confidence in the Vatican-China dialogue. \n Wang Zuo'an, China's head of religious affairs, said earlier this week he hoped the Vatican would be flexible and pragmatic, and take concrete steps to improve relations, state media reported. No details were given of what Beijing expects. \n State media also reported that Bishop Ma Yinglin was re-elected president of one of the groups at the conference, the Bishops Conference of Catholic Church of China. Ma was excommunicated in 2006 by the Vatican after being named by the Chinese church as a bishop in southwestern Yunnan province. \n The Vatican-affiliated AsiaNews service, which closely covers the underground church in China, quoted on Thursday one priest from northern China calling the meeting \"a staged theatrical representation.\" \n \"Everything was very well planned: the assignment of roles, their scripts, the well-chosen audience, who raised their hands to vote and approve content, the media coverage,\" said the priest, identified only as Father Peter. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Top China leader says Catholics must act 'independently'"}

{"date": "December 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Patricia Krenwinkel, a follower of cult killer Charles Manson, is again seeking parole 47 years after she helped kill actress Sharon Tate and six others in 1969. \n SACRAMENTO, Calif. >> A two-member parole panel delayed making a decision Thursday on whether to release an accomplice of cult killer Charles Manson who is the longest-serving female inmate in California. \n After a daylong hearing, the panel from the Board of Parole Hearings postponed a decision on whether to free Patricia Krenwinkel \"because they felt information discussed at the hearing was cause for an investigation,\" spokeswoman Vicky Waters said in an email. \n The hearing will be continued once the investigation is concluded, she said \n Sharon Tate's sister, Debra Tate, said the parole officials told her the hearing was likely to be postponed about six months while they research to see if Krenwinkel meets the criteria for having bartered women's syndrome. \n Krenwinkel's attorney, Keith Wattley, did not immediately return telephone and email messages. \n \"She totally minimized her action and blamed everything on other people the whole hearing,\" Tate said. \n Tate said she didn't buy the concept that Krenwinkel was a victim because she was free to leave at any time and participated in murders two nights in a row. \n \"We all have to be accountable four our actions. I don't buy any of this stuff. She was there because she wanted to be there. Nobody held a gun to her head,\" Tate said. \n The decision to delay by the panel came after the 69-year-old Krenwinkel was previously denied parole 13 times, most recently in 2011. \n Krenwinkel acknowledged during her trial that she chased down and repeatedly stabbed Abigail Ann Folger, the 26-year-old heiress of a coffee fortune, at Tate's home and helped kill grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary the following night. \n Los Angeles County prosecutors say Krenwinkel carved the word \"war\" into Leno LaBianca's stomach then wrote \"Helter Skelter\" in blood on the couple's refrigerator. \n Krenwinkel's attorney, Keith Wattley, successfully petitioned the state to hold the parole hearing a year early at the California Institution for Women, about 40 miles east of Los Angeles, where Krenwinkel is imprisoned. \n \"California law officially recognizes a person's capacity to change and to address the factors that contributed to their previous behavior so that they can safely be paroled,\" Wattley told The Associated Press in an email before the hearing. \n Krenwinkel contended at her previous parole hearing in 2011 that she is a changed woman. She has a clean disciplinary record, earned a bachelor's degree behind bars, taught illiterate inmates to read and trained service dogs for disabled people. \n Sharon Tate's sister, Debra Tate, said before Thursday's hearing that killers such as Krenwinkel cannot be rehabilitated. \n \"She was a very prolific killer,\" Debra Tate said recently. \"They may behave well in a controlled environment, but we cannot trust that, given the pressures of life, that they will be able to remain straight\" outside prison. \n Krenwinkel was a 19-year-old secretary when she met Manson at a party. She testified at her previous hearing that she left everything behind three days later to pursue what she believed was a budding romance with him. \n She wept and apologized, saying she became a \"monster\" after she met Manson. \n \"I committed myself fully to him. I committed myself to the act of murder,\" she said then. \"I was willing to sacrifice others' lives for my own.\" \n Prosecutors say the slayings were an attempt to ignite a race war after which Manson and his followers would rise from the rubble to rule the world. \n Krenwinkel was initially sentenced to death, but the California Supreme Court invalidated the death penalty in 1972. \n Gov. Jerry Brown has the power to block the release of inmates if parole is granted. He previously stopped the parole of Manson followers Leslie Van Houten, 67, and Bruce Davis, 74. \n Krenwinkel became the state's longest-serving female inmate when fellow Manson follower Susan Atkins died of cancer in prison in 2009. \n Anthony DiMaria, the nephew of victim Thomas Jay Sebring, noted that Krenwinkel has lived a long time and denied that opportunity to her victims. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Panel delays decision on whether to release Manson follower"}

{"date": "December 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, listens to Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow, Russia on Thursday, Dec. 29, 2016. Putin is ordering to scale down the Russian military presence in Syria. Putin made the statement Thursday while declaring that a cease-fire in Syria brokered by Russia and Turkey will start at midnight. \n BEIRUT >> A cease-fire brokered by Russia and Turkey went into effect in war-ravaged Syria at midnight Thursday, a potential breakthrough in the six years of fighting that have left more than a quarter-million people dead and triggered a refugee crisis across Europe. \n If it holds, the truce between the Syrian government and the country's mainstream rebel forces will be followed by peace talks next month in Kazakhstan, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in announcing the agreement. He described it, however, as \"quite fragile\" and requiring \"special attention and patience.\" \n The first half-hour of the cease-fire was one of \"comprehensive calm,\" said Rami Abdurrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. He said that before the truce came into force, the government was bombing several areas, including the province of Aleppo and suburbs of the capital, Damascus. \n The truce had the backing of both Russia, Syria's chief battlefield ally, and Turkey, which has been supporting the rebels. Russia said the deal was signed by seven of Syria's major rebel factions, though none of them immediately confirmed it, and one of them denied signing. \n Several previous cease-fires in the Syrian civil war all collapsed, some of them in a matter of days. And this latest agreement, like previous ones, does not include extremist factions such as the Islamic State group and al-Qaida's branch in Syria. \n Still, the deal raised hopes for a political settlement to the ruinous war, in part because the landscape has significantly shifted recently. \n For one thing, the tide has turned in Syrian President Bashar Assad's favor militarily over the past year, with the government retaking the city of Aleppo from the rebels just days ago. Also, Turkey, which is fighting Kurdish and Islamic militants at home, appears more willing to strike a bargain with Russia if it means protecting its borders. \n \"This is a different political scene, and one would expect some outcomes to emerge,\" said Hilal Khashan, political science professor at the American University of Beirut. He cautioned, however, against expecting immediate results from the first round of talks. \n Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem welcomed the cease-fire agreement said there is a \"real chance\" for a political settlement. \n In comments made to Syrian TV, he said the Syrian government will attend the peace talks \"with an open mind,\" but he suggested it would not be willing to compromise on Assad's fate. Assad's remaining in power has been a major sticking point in the crisis. \n \"Everything is negotiable except national sovereignty and the people's right to choose its leadership,\" al-Moallem said. \n Putin said the cease-fire will be guaranteed by both Moscow and Turkey. Turkey has been allowing opposition forces to use its long border with Syria to cross back and forth. The agreement was also praised by Iran, another of Assad's strongest backers. \n Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that the truce will include 62,000 opposition fighters across Syria and that the Russian military has established a hotline with its Turkish counterpart to monitor compliance. Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said President-elect Donald Trump's administration will be welcome to join the peace process once he takes office. \n Putin said he ordered the Russian military to scale back its presence in Syria, where it has provided crucial support to Assad's forces. Putin didn't say how many troops and weapons will be withdrawn. He said Russia will continue \"fighting international terrorism in Syria\" and supporting Assad's military. \n The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, welcomed the cease-fire announcement, saying he hopes the agreement will save civilian lives, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and pave the way for productive peace talks. \n Earlier Thursday, Turkey called on Hezbollah to withdraw its fighters from Syria. The Iranian-backed extremist group has sent thousands of fighters to support Assad and has been playing an instrumental role in the civil war since 2013. \n Foreign fighters from around the world have joined both sides of the Syrian conflict, which has displaced half the country's population and produced more than 4 million refugees. Many of those refugees have been streaming into Europe, fueling anti-immigration sentiment and terrorist fears that are reshaping the continent's political landscape. \n Syria's military noted that the cease-fire comes after the \"successes achieved by the armed forces,\" an apparent reference to the fierce fighting in Aleppo. \n Osama Abo Zayd, a spokesman for mainstream Syrian opposition groups, told reporters in the Turkish capital of Ankara that 13 armed opposition factions have signed the agreement. \n He said the peace talks will be based on the Geneva 2012 declaration that calls for a governing body with full executive powers to run Syria during a transition period. \"This means that there will be no presence for Assad in the future,\" he said. \n However, Khashan, the political analyst, said Assad's exit is \"out of the question.\" \"Neither the Russians nor the Iranians would allow it to happen,\" he said. \n Saeed Sadek, a professor of political sociology at Cairo's Future University, said Assad has no power to accept or reject any deals. \n \"He is now under the control of Moscow, Tehran and Ankara. All these countries will decide his future,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Cease-fire goes into force in war-ravaged Syria"}

{"date": "December 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Hawaii officials are exploring what it would take to run a ferry between islands. But they're facing skepticism over costs and whether there's a ferry system residents would accept. But the idea is bringing back memories of the Superferry, an emotional and expensive failure in Hawaii history. Years ago protesters blocked the Superferry from docking in Kauai. And a court later ordered the ferry to stop running because the state didn't do a proper environmental review. \n When a 30-foot-tall ferry loomed outside a Kauai harbor in 2007, surfers and kayakers \u2014 looking like tiny ducks in comparison \u2014 blocked its path, preventing it from unloading hundreds of passengers and sending the giant catamaran back to Oahu. \n The emotional standoff where surfers bobbed in the water for hours marked the end to an expensive failure in Hawaii's history: the Superferry. Now the state is exploring bringing back a ferry to run between islands, facing skepticism over financing and whether there's a ferry system residents would accept. \n Lawmakers approved $50,000 in May to study a possible inter-island ferry, and the state Department of Transportation received a $500,000 grant from the federal Maritime Administration to hire consultants to explore potential routes and boats. \n \"The feasibility study might come back and say maybe it's not financially feasible for us to do this,\" said Ford Fuchigami, director of the state Transportation Department. \"But right now, using federal money which is available \u2026 we want to be sure that we use that money to see whether or not this is possible.\" \n The Hawaii Superferry ran primarily between Oahu and Maui from 2007 until 2009, but was shut down after a judge ruled the state broke the law by not completing required environmental reviews. \n It was a costly gamble. Hawaii spent at least $34 million on equipment for the ferry, which it later sold for just $425,000. The barges and ramps were custom-made for the Superferry, complicating the sale, said Tim Sakahara, Department of Transportation spokesman. \n Hawaii Superferry filed for bankruptcy, leaving $136.8 million in debt to the Maritime Administration \u2014 which repossessed the ferries \u2014 and a $22.9 million debt to Austal USA, which built two ferries for Hawaii for $190 million. The Navy later paid the Maritime Administration just $35 million to buy both ships. One now serves as a ferry between Maine and Nova Scotia. \n \"In the beginning, people believed what they were reading, that it was going to be this really low-cost way to go inter-island and it sounded like a great thing,\" said Irene Bowie, former executive director of the Maui Tomorrow Foundation, which opposed the ferry based on environmental concerns. \"But the devil is always in the details.\" \n The new study will explore public or private ownership of vessels and operations. If the state owns the vessels, it could get federal subsidies, Fuchigami said. But it might be cheaper for a third party to operate a ferry system, he said. \n \"Almost no ferry system in the country is self-sustaining,\" said Lauren Brand, an associate administrator for the Maritime Administration. \"The vast majority of them have to have public dollars to help them keep on.\" \n Washington State's ferry system, which Fuchigami has identified as a potential model for Hawaii, gets about 30 percent of its operating costs from subsidies and 70 percent from the fare box, ferry experts said. The Staten Island Ferry in New York, where customers ride for free, is also subsidized by taxpayers. \n Hawaii's open ocean geography, deadly channels and protected marine life pose unique challenges. \n But Hawaii can learn from ferry systems operating in the Greek Islands, the Philippines and between Argentina and Uruguay, said David Moseley, a former director of Washington Ferries and senior consultant with Carus, a firm that may compete to conduct the Hawaii study. \n \"There are places all over the world where ferry systems with similar situations to Hawaii are operating very successfully,\" Moseley added. \n Fuchigami is considering a red-eye trip from Honolulu to Hawaii Island and inter-island trips from Oahu to Kauai and Maui. He also wants commuter ferries on Oahu and Maui. \n \"Everyone talks about traffic,\" Fuchigami said, proposing a ferry from Oahu's West side \u2014 where homes are less expensive \u2014 into urban Honolulu. \n To ensure a steady revenue stream, Fuchigami hopes inter-island ferries could carry cargo such as farm produce. \n \"The main thing is that we're going to be very, very careful,\" Fuchigami said. \n Superferry wasn't the only failed sea vessel attempt in Hawaii. In 2009, the same year the Superferry shut down, Honolulu ended a passenger ferry service called \"TheBoat\" which shuttled passengers between downtown Honolulu and West Oahu for $2. \n \"It didn't really attract ridership,\" said Michael Hansen, president of the Hawaii Shippers Council. \"Most of the people being carried were just tourists taking a boat ride.\" \n A ferry running from Molokai to Maui shut down this year amid financial losses. \n The Sierra Club, which opposed the Superferry, worries ferries could spread invasive species and rapid ohia death, a fungal disease killing native ohia trees, said director Marti Townsend. \n \"If there is a way to operate a ferry that can guarantee against the spread of invasive species, then we will keep an open mind, but from what we know now, it's an inherent fatal flaw,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Superferry dreams face cost, public opinion hurdles"}

Nurses, meanwhile, were rushing to glimpse her father, the crooner Eddie Fisher. \n \"So when I arrived I was virtually unattended,\" wrote Fisher. \"And I have been trying to make up for that ever since.\" \n Thus began one of the more complicated, thoroughly documented and ultimately tender mother-daughter relationships in Hollywood, one both strained by celebrity and deepened through fiction.

Their relationship underwent dramatic swings, much of it chronicled in Fisher's books, and in their big-screen alter-egos: Suzanne Vale (Meryl Streep) and Doris Mann (Shirley MacLaine) in \"Postcards From the Edge,\" the adaptation of Fisher's semi-autobiographical novel. \n But Reynolds and Fisher had this in common: They were both show-business survivors. \n Reynolds, three-times divorced, weathered cheating men and swindlers who bilked her for millions. Fisher persisted through bipolar disorder and drug addiction. When the two appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in 2011 to celebrate their relationship, Fisher said: \"I'm not afraid of almost anything. And that's a lot because of your example.\" \n That Reynolds, 84, and Fisher, 60, died a day apart \u2014 Reynolds on Wednesday, Fisher on Tuesday \u2014 is the final heartbreak in a year full of them. Both passed away in the same hospital, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles \u2014 a tragic if not poetic end for a mother and daughter who bridged the gulf that was once between them. \n \"She said, 'I want to be with Carrie,'\" Todd Fisher, Reynolds' son, told The Associated Press. \"And then she was gone.\" \n Such a poignant last sentiment was once unfathomable. The two were estranged for nearly a decade in Fisher's 20s. \"I didn't want to be around her,\" Fisher once said. \"I did not want to be Debbie Reynolds' daughter.\" \n \"She was so beautiful, and I dreamed of looking like her one day,\" Fisher wrote in her memoir. \"I think it was when I was ten that I realized with profound certainty that I would not be, and was in no way now, the beauty that my mother was. I was a clumsy-looking and intensely awkward, insecure girl. I decided then that I'd better develop something else \u2014 if I wasn't going to be pretty, maybe I could be funny or smart.\" \n It wasn't only the considerable shadow of her mother that Fisher recoiled from. It was, she often said, being forced to share her with the wider public. (A documentary on their relationship is to air in the new year on HBO.) \n \"It took like 30 years for Carrie to be really happy with me,\" Reynolds told People magazine in 1988. \"I don't know what the problem ever was. I've had to work at it. I've always been a good mother, but I've always been in show business, and I've been on stage and I don't bake cookies and I don't stay home.\" \n Reynolds performed frequently while raising two children. That created some distance for Fisher, who recalled phone calls from her mom beginning, \"Hello, dear, this is your mother, Debbie.\" The child-of-a-star peculiarities were sometimes surreal. Reynolds, for example, had Cary Grant give Fisher a \"don't do drugs\" speech when she began developing a taste for them as a teenager. Later, in \"Postcards from the Edge,\" Fisher depicted the mother as the center of attention even at her daughter's homecoming from rehab. \n \"There have been a few times when I thought I was going to lose Carrie,\" Reynolds told Winfrey. \"I've had to walk through a lot of my tears. But she's worth it.\" She added: \"Carrie and I have finally found happiness. I always feel as a mother does, that I protect her.\" \n Fame, of course, eventually found Fisher, too. Reynolds sometimes called herself \"Princess Leia's mother.\" Navigating celebrity, disappointing men and depression, the two increasingly found common ground. Before Fisher became an outspoken advocate for mental health issues, Reynolds co-founded a group that has raised millions for mental health. \"And four and a half million of that money is allocated just for me,\" joked Fisher, introducing her mother at the 2015 Screen Actors Guild Awards. \n \"She's an immensely powerful woman, and I just admire my mother very much,\" Fisher told NPR's Fresh Air last month. \"There's very few women from her generation who worked like that, who just kept a career going all her life, and raised children, and had horrible relationships, and lost all her money, and got it back again. I mean, she's had an amazing life, and she's someone to admire.\" \n Their relationship, in all its complexity and candor, grew to be truer than the celebrity that surrounded it. Fisher may have been unattended at birth, but she was joined in death. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Reynolds, Fisher up and down in life, together in death"}

Some died in traffic accidents, but nearly half were shot to death. \n That's a 56 percent increase in shooting deaths over the previous year. Of the 64 who were fatally shot, 21 were killed in ambush attacks often fueled by anger over police use of force involving minorities. \n \"We've never seen a year in my memory when we've had an increase of this magnitude in officer shooting deaths,\" said Craig Floyd, president and chief executive of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. \"These officers were killed simply because of the uniform they wear and the job they do. This is unacceptable to the humane society that we are.\" \n In Dallas, a sniper on July 7 attacked at the end of what had been a peaceful rally against police brutality. He killed five law enforcement officers and wounded nine others \u2014 the largest death toll among law enforcement from a single event since the 9/11 attacks, which killed 72 officers. Months later, Dallas businesses and residents still display blue ribbons and banners declaring, \"We support our Dallas police officers.\" \n But even amid community support, the police department remains unsettled. Hundreds of officers have retired or left the force over the past six months as the city struggles to find a way to increase pay and save a failing police and fire pension. Former Chief David Brown, who became a national figure in the aftermath, was among those who opted to retire. And interim Dallas Police Association president Frederick Frazier said that morale is \"almost nonexistent.\" \n \"A lot of us are going through the motions at work.

Mitchell has daily reminders of the deadly shootout, driving past the scene on his way to police headquarters. \n \"Just passing there, you can't help but replay it over and over again,\" he said. \n Mitchell said the shooting has made him more alert and aware of potential dangers on patrol, sometimes in situations that wouldn't have alarmed him before, like a hand in a pocket. \"You learn to cope with it, because if you don't, you can drive yourself crazy,\" he said. \n The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund's Floyd said the impact of this year has been profound on law enforcement. Agencies are struggling to recruit officers to their ranks and those who continue to serve \"talk about how their head is now on a swivel.\" \n \"They're always looking over their shoulder, always worrying about the next attack that could come at any time from any direction,\" Floyd said. \n That was underscored by the slaying in November of a San Antonio detective who was fatally shot and killed outside police headquarters as he was writing a traffic ticket.

Nineteen states, including New York and California, will ring in the year with an increase in the minimum wage. \n Massachusetts and Washington state will have the highest new minimum wages in the country, at $11 per hour. \n California will raise its wage to $10. New York state is taking a regional approach, with the wage rising to $11 in New York City, $10 in its downstate suburbs and $9.70 elsewhere. \n \"This $1.50 increase, I cannot even comprehend or tell you how important this will be,\" said Alvin Major, a New York City fast-food worker. The 51-year-old father of four helped lead the fight for the increase in his state, one of several successful efforts by fast-food workers and other low wage workers around the country. \"The price of food has gone up. Rent has gone up. Everything has gone up. \u2026 This will make a difference for so many people.\" \n Voters in Arizona, Maine, Colorado and Washington approved increases in this year's election.

The other states seeing increases are Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Michigan and Vermont. \n Workers and labor advocates argue the increases will help low-wage workers now barely making ends meet and boost the economy by giving some consumers more money to spend. But many business owners opposed the higher wages, saying they would lead to higher prices and greater automation. \n Some restaurant owners may consider reducing portion sizes or charging for side dishes that were once included in the price of a meal to absorb the increase, according to Melissa Fleischut, president of the New York State Restaurant Association. \n \"I'm sure prices will go up where they can, but restaurants want to avoid sticker shock,\" she said. \"They're going to have to get creative.\" \n The adjustments in Oregon, New York, California and several other states are part of a series of gradual increases to a $12 or $15 hourly wage. \n The minimum wage will also go up this weekend in 22 cities and counties, including San Diego, San Jose and Seattle. \n The high number of states and localities raising the wage this year reflects the successful work of fast-food workers and organized labor, according to Tsedeye Gebreselassie, senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project, as well as federal inaction on the wage.

{"date": "December 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n An Israeli grocery store owner watched the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerr'sy speech at the State Department at Washington, in Sderot near the Israel and Gaza border on Wednesday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office denounced Secretary of State John Kerry's Mideast policy speech, saying it was \"skewed against Israel\" and \"obsessively\" focuses on Israeli settlements. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Secretary of State John Kerry spoke about Israeli-Palestinian policy, Wednesday, at the State Department in Washington. \n It took eight years of backbiting and pretending they got along for relations between President Barack Obama's administration and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to finally hit rock bottom. \n Though they've clashed bitterly before, mostly notably over Iran, the two governments seemed further apart than ever after a speech Wednesday by Secretary of State John Kerry and last week's United Nations resolution. \n The key question for the Obama administration, newly willing to air grievances with Israel on live television, is why now? \n \"We cannot, in good conscience, do nothing and say nothing when we see the hope of peace slipping away,\" Kerry said in a speech that ran more than an hour. \n Yet in just over three weeks, Obama will no longer be president, Kerry will no longer be secretary of state, and the U.S. will have a new leader under no obligation to embrace any of what Kerry said. President-elect Donald Trump has assured Israel that things will be different after Jan. 20, when he's to be inaugurated, and lamented how the Jewish state was \"being treated very, very unfairly.\" \n Kerry took pains to voice America's staunch commitment to Israel's security and support for its future, and to detail U.S. complaints about Palestinian leadership and its failure to sufficiently deter violence against Israelis. He laid out a six-point framework for a potential peace deal that it will be up to the next U.S. government to try to enact, if it chooses to do so. \n The White House has portrayed Obama's decision to break with tradition by abstaining from \u2014 rather than vetoing \u2014 a U.N. Security Council resolution declaring Israeli settlements illegal as a reaction forced by other countries that brought it up for a vote. Obama didn't seek this out, his aides have argued. \n Yet the White House has also acknowledged that Obama had long considered the possibility of taking some symbolic step before leaving office to leave his imprint on the debate. For much of the year, his staff pored over options that included a U.N. resolution outlining principles for a peace deal and a presidential speech much like the one Kerry gave Wednesday. Yet there was reluctance to act before the U.S. election, given the way it would have thrust the Israeli-Palestinian issue into the campaign. \n Kerry acknowledged Trump appears to favor a different approach. Yet, frustrated by years of Israeli actions he deemed counterproductive for peace, Obama appeared to have decided it was better to make his administration's views known while still in office, even if it risked a blockbuster clash with America's closest ally. \n In his speech, Kerry tore into Israel for settlement-building, accusing Netanyahu of dragging Israel away from democracy. He defended the move to allow the U.N. vote, the spark that set off an extraordinary and deepening diplomatic spat between the U.S. and its closest Mideast ally. \n \"If the choice is one state, Israel can either be Jewish or democratic, it cannot be both, and it won't ever really be at peace,\" Kerry said \n Shortly afterward, Netanyahu appeared on camera in Jerusalem and suggested he was done with the Obama administration and ready to deal with Trump. The Israeli leader faulted Kerry for obsessing over settlements while paying mere \"lip service\" to Palestinian attacks and incitement of violence. \n \"Israelis do not need to be lectured about the importance of peace by foreign leaders,\" Netanyahu said. \n Trump wouldn't say whether settlements should be reined in. But he told reporters Israel was being \"treated very, very unfairly by a lot of different people.\" \n In a nod to Netanyahu's concerns that Obama would take more parting shots, Kerry seemed to rule out the possibility Obama would support more U.N. action or, even more controversially, recognize statehood. \n A day after the speech, the European Union seemed to rally behind Kerry's message. EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic says his speech showed \"the international community does not give up on peace in the Middle East.\" \n The U.S, the Palestinians and most of the world oppose Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967 and claimed by the Palestinians for an independent state. But Israel's government argues previous construction freezes didn't advance peace and that the settlements \u2014 now home to 600,000 Israelis \u2014 must be resolved in direct Israelis-Palestinian talks. \n While Israel's Arab population has citizenship rights, the roughly 2.5 million Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank do not, and most in annexed east Jerusalem have residency rights but not citizenship. \n Kerry said a future deal would have to ensure secure borders for Israel and a Palestinian state formed in territories Israel captured in 1967, with \"mutually agreed, equivalent swaps.\" He said both countries must fully recognize each other, ensure access to religious sites and relinquish other existing claims. Kerry also called for assistance for Palestinian refugees. \n Associated Press writers Josef Federman in Jerusalem and Vivian Salama in Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Relations between Obama, Netanyahu camps hit rock bottom"}

{"date": "December 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama spoke during a Dec. 16 news conference in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. President Barack Obama has imposed sanctions on Russian officials and intelligence services in retaliation for Russia's interference in the U.S. presidential election by hacking American political sites and email accounts. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis, right, looked at U.S. Sen. John McCain, center left, during a press conference, Wednesday, in Riga, Latvia, while Lindsey Graham, R-SC., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., stood in the background. \n In a sweeping response to election hacking and other bad behavior, President Barack Obama today sanctioned Russian intelligence services and their top officials, kicked out 35 Russian officials and shuttered two Russian-owned compounds in the U.S. It was the strongest action the Obama administration has taken to date to retaliate for a cyberattack. \n \"All Americans should be alarmed by Russia's actions,\" Obama said, adding, \"Such activities have consequences.\" \n In a bid to expose Moscow's cyber aggression, the U.S. also released a detailed report about Russia's hacking infrastructure that it said was designed to help computer specialists identify compromised systems and prevent more hacking. And Obama said more action was coming. \n \"These actions are not the sum total of our response to Russia's aggressive activities,\" Obama said in a statement released while he was vacationing in Hawaii. The U.S. has previously left open the possibility it could mount a covert retaliatory strike. \n Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said today that Moscow regrets the new U.S. sanctions and will consider retaliatory measures. \n The White House has promised to release a report before Obama leaves office detailing Russia's cyber interference in U.S. elections, a move that could address Russia's complaints that the U.S. hasn't shown proof of its involvement. But the U.S. moved forward with the response today even as the report has yet to be released. \n Still, Obama administration officials said the list of entities Obama was sanctioning made clear who exactly the U.S. believes was behind the hacking of Democratic groups and the theft of emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. \n Obama amended an executive order issued in 2015, meant to combat cyberattacks, to authorize sanctions on entities \"interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions.\" \n Under this new authority, Obama ordered sanctions against two Russian intelligence services, the GRU and the FSB, plus companies that the U.S. says support the GRU. The cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee to investigate theft of its emails determined earlier this year the hacking came from the Fancy Bear group, believed to be affiliated with the GRU. \n The FSB is Russia's main domestic and counter-terrorism intelligence agency. It was formed following the Soviet collapse, when the KGB was split into the FSB and the foreign intelligence agency SVR. The GRU is the Russian military intelligence agency. \n The president also sanctioned Lt. Gen. Igor Korobov, the head of GRU, and three of his deputies. Other individuals sanctioned include Alexsey Belan and Yevgeny Bogachev, two Russian nationals who have been wanted by the FBI for cybercrimes for years. \n Obama's move puts President-elect Donald Trump in the position of having to decide whether to roll back the measures once in office, and U.S. officials acknowledged that Trump could use his executive authorities to do so. \n U.S. allegations of hacking during the campaign have ignited a heated debate over Trump's approach to Russia and his refusal to accept the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia's government was responsible and wanted to help him win. Though U.S. lawmakers have long called for Obama to be tougher on Russia, some Republicans have found that position less tenable now that Trump is floating the possibility of closer ties to Moscow. \n \"While today's action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \n Obama said the hacking \"could only have been directed by the highest levels of the Russian government,\" a contention the U.S. has used to suggest Russian President Vladimir Putin was personally involved. \n Although the White House announced at the same time it was kicking out Russian officials and closing facilities, it said those were responses to other troubling Russian behavior: harassment of U.S. diplomats by Russian personnel and police. \n The 35 Russian diplomats being kicked out are intelligence operatives, Obama said. They were declared \"persona non grata,\" and they were given 72 hours to leave the country. The State Department declined to identify them. \n Fyodor Lukyanov, the head of Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, an association of top Russian political experts, called the decision to expel 35 Russian diplomats \"a Cold War-like diplomatic war.\" \n Lukyanov said on Rossiya 24 television that because of today's sanctions the Trump administration \"will have to start off from an even lower point than it was\" in trying to mend the U.S.-Russia ties. \n \"I think the new administration will try to soften the blow and at least distance itself from, to show this has nothing to do with them,\" he said. \n The two compounds being closed down are recreational facilities owned by Russia's government \u2014 one on the eastern short of Maryland and the other on Long Island, New York \u2014 that were also used for intelligence activities, the U.S. said. The White House said Russia had been notified that Russia would be denied access to the sites starting noon Friday. \n Russian officials have denied the Obama administration's accusation that the highest levels of the Russian government were involved in trying to influence the U.S. presidential election. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia's goal was to help Trump win \u2014 an assessment Trump has dismissed as ridiculous. \n Stewart Baker, former general counsel for the National Security Agency and former head of policy at the Homeland Security Department, said the administration's public response to Russia's hacking activities was \"better than nothing\" but \"more symbolic than real.\" He noted that Russia would likely retaliate with similar measures such as ejecting U.S. diplomats. \n \"On its face, this is more than a slap on the wrists but hardly an appropriate response to an unprecedented attack on our electoral system,\" Baker said. \n Associated Press writer Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama retaliates against Russia for election hacking"}

{"date": "December 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Residents walked past a board highlighting the security markers on the latest Yuan note outside a bank in Beijing, China on Nov. 24. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to label China a currency manipulator on his first day in the White House. \n WASHINGTON >> President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to name China a currency manipulator on his first day in the White House. \n There's only one problem \u2013 it's not true anymore. China, the world's second-biggest economy behind the United States, hasn't been pushing down its currency to benefit Chinese exporters in years. And even if it were, the law targeting manipulators requires the U.S. spend a year negotiating a solution before it can retaliate. \n Trump spent much of the campaign blaming China for America's economic woes. And it's true that the U.S-China trade relationship is lopsided. China sells a lot more to the United States than it buys. The resulting trade deficit in goods amounted to a staggering $289 billion through the first 10 months of 2016. \n But in fact, for the past couple of years China has been intervening in markets to prop up its currency, the yuan, not push it lower. \n When China's yuan falls against the U.S. dollar, Chinese products become cheaper in the U.S. market and American products become more costly in China. \n So the U.S. Treasury Department monitors China for signs it is manipulating the yuan lower. Treasury has guidelines for putting countries on its currency blacklist. They must, for example, have spent the equivalent of 2 percent of their economic output over a year buying foreign currencies in an attempt to drive those currencies up and their own currencies down. \n Treasury hasn't declared China a currency manipulator since 1994. \n Probably not much, at least initially. \n If Treasury designates China a currency manipulator under a 2015 law, it is supposed to spend a year trying to resolve the problem through negotiations. \n Should those talks fail, the U.S. can take a number of small steps in retaliation, including stopping the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp., a government development agency, from financing any programs in China. Trouble is, the United States already suspended OPIC operations in China years ago \u2014 to punish Beijing in the aftermath of the bloody 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square. \n So naming China a currency manipulator is mostly \"just a jaw-boning exercise,\" said Amanda DeBusk, chair of the international trade department at the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed and a former Commerce Department official. \"There's no immediate consequence.\" \n Is China guility of using currency to help its exporters? \n For years, China pretty clearly manipulated its currency to gain an advantage over global competitors. It bought foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar in particular, to push them higher against the yuan. As it did, it accumulated vast foreign currency reserves \u2014 nearly $4 trillion worth by mid-2014. \n But now the Chinese economy is slowing, and Chinese companies and individuals have begun to invest more heavily outside the country. As their money leaves China, it puts downward pressure on the yuan. \n The yuan has dropped nearly 7 percent against the dollar so far this year. The Chinese government has responded by draining its foreign exchange reserves to buy yuan, hoping to slow the currency's fall. China's reserves have dropped by $279 billion this year to $3.05 trillion. \n If Beijing stepped back and let market forces determine the yuan's level, it likely would fall even faster, giving Chinese exporters even more of a competitive edge. \n So Beijing is doing the opposite of what Trump says it's doing. Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad earlier this month called Trump's plans to name China a currency manipulator \"unmoored from reality.\" \n \"The whole discussion is ironic,\" said David Dollar, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former official at the World Bank and U.S. Treasury Department. \"It's out of date.\" \n Could Trump do anything on his own? \n Gary Hufbauer, an expert on trade law at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, notes that as president, Trump could nonetheless escalate any dispute over the currency on his own. Over the years, Congress has ceded the president broad authority to impose trade sanctions. Trump has threatened to slap a 45 percent tax, or tariff, on Chinese imports to punish it for unfair trade practices, including alleged currency manipulation. \n Brookings' Dollar said China likely would bring a case to the World Trade Organization \"against any protectionist measures that are a violation of U.S. commitments to the WTO,\" which oversees the rules of global commerce and rules on trade disputes. \n Some trade analysts wonder if Trump is using the tariff threat as a negotiating tool to win concessions from China. \n Whatever the U.S. motive, China has a consistent record of retaliating against trade sanctions. When the Obama administration slapped tariffs on Chinese tire imports in 2009, for instance, China lashed back by imposing a tax on U.S. chicken parts. \n China's Global Times newspaper, published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, has already speculated that \"China will take a tit-for-tat approach\" if Trump's tariffs are enacted. The paper suggested that Beijing might limit sales of Apple iPhones and Boeing jetliners in China. \n \"The Chinese are predictable and reliable,\" DeBusk said. \"If they get punched, they punch back.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "What it means if Trump names China a currency manipulator"}

{"date": "December 29, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This combination of photos released by the Hamilton Police Department in New Jersey shows Barbara Briley, left, and her 5-year-old great-granddaughter La'Myra Briley. The two were found alive near their vehicle on private property south in Dinwiddie County, Va., south of Richmond, on Wednesday. \n RICHMOND, Va. >> A New Jersey woman and her 5-year-old great-granddaughter have been found alive in secluded woods in rural Virginia, apparently stranded there for days after disappearing on a holiday road trip, authorities said. \n Seventy-one-year-old Barbara Briley was unconscious when she was found Wednesday afternoon with her great-granddaughter La'Myra Briley in Dinwiddie County at least a mile from a paved road, Virginia State Police said. The girl was reported to be alert and unhurt. \n Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said in a statement that the two were near their vehicle, stuck on a dirt road on private property where a man found them. Authorities said it appears the two had snacks and drinks to get by. \n The two had been the focus of a multistate search and police added that no foul play was suspected in the disappearance. The county where the two were is in an area south of Richmond, Virginia's capital. \n Barbara Briley was flown by helicopter to VCU Medical Center in Richmond where she was in serious condition, police said. Authorities said the child appeared alert and unhurt and received a medical evaluation before being reunited with a family member. \n The property owner had spotted the car from a distance and when he went to check on it, he found the two seated nearby, authorities said. Maj. William Knott of the Dinwiddie County Sheriff's Office said the man had seen news reports about the missing travelers, realized who the Brileys were and called 911. \n \"This person probably saved them,\" Knott said. \n Barbara Briley was \"not responsive to questions\" when authorities arrived, but Knott said the child was \"in good shape and very talkative\" and has since been reunited with a relative. \n The Brileys had left New Jersey on Christmas Eve to visit relatives in North Carolina but never arrived. They were last seen last weekend at a gas station in Ruther Glen, Virginia, about 30 miles north of Richmond. \n Surveillance video from the gas station shows Barbara Briley walking inside about 5:40 p.m. Saturday. She exits and re-enters before eventually pulling away just after 6 p.m., authorities said. \n Gas station clerk Joanna Strange told local media that Briley came inside to say she was lost and she then helped the woman with her GPS before Briley went on her way. \n Police said the evidence points to Briley having pulled onto a dirt road, which she then followed a short distance into the woods in Dinwiddie County. There she drove over a small tree and got stuck in a remote area of the property when she tried to back up, according to police. \n Family members have said Barbara Briley was a former driver for New Jersey Transit and had made the long trip numerous times. They also said she didn't have any known medical issues. \n A relative of Briley's reached by The Associated Press declined comment, and VCU Medical Center didn't immediately return a message. \n Lt. Travis Nutter of the Caroline County Sheriff's Office, which released the video, said nothing in the footage indicated any kind of suspicious activity at the gas station where the travelers were seen. \n \"That video is the last anybody saw of her,\" he had said. \n State troopers had searched around Ruther Glen area and along the Interstate 85 corridor from south of the Virginia capital city of Richmond to the North Carolina line, state police spokesman Sgt. Stephan Vick said. \n They used a helicopter and hunted for signs of guard rail damage or other evidence that a car may have run off the road, he said. \n The North Carolina Highway Patrol also aided in the search. The investigation was being led by Hamilton Township, New Jersey, police, who didn't immediately return messages seeking comment. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Missing New Jersey family members found alive in Virginia"}
