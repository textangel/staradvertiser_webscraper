Vasip Sahin said. He did not say who may have carried out the attack. \n Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the attacker, who has not been identified, was still at large. \"Our security forces have started the necessary operations. God willing he will be caught in a short period of time,\" he said. \n Private NTV news channel said the assailant entered the upscale nightclub, on the shores of the Bosporus, on the European side of the city, dressed in a Santa Claus outfit. The minister said the attacker was believed to have left the club wearing different clothing to what he entered the club in. He said the attacker is believed to have carried out the assault alone. \n At least 15 of the dead were foreign nationals, Soylu said, without providing information on their nationalities. Five of the victims were identified as Turkish nationals while authorities were still trying to identify the rest. At least 69 people were being treated in hospitals, four in serious condition, Soylu said. \n Three or four of the Turkish victims may have been employees at the nightclub, he said. \n \"This was a massacre, a truly inhuman savagery,\" Soylu said. \n Gov. Sahin said: \"Unfortunately (he) rained bullets in a very cruel and merciless way on innocent people who were there to celebrate New Year's and have fun,\" Sahin told reporters. \n Some customers jumped into the waters of the Bosporus to escape the attack, the NTV report said. \n Sinem Uyanik was inside the club with her husband, who was wounded in the attack. \n \"Before I could understand what was happening, my husband fell on top me,\" she said outside Istanbul's Sisli Etfal Hospital. \"I had to lift several bodies from on top of me before I could get out. It was frightening.\" Her husband was not in serious condition despite sustaining three wounds. \n Police with riot gear and machine guns backed up by armored vehicles blocked the area close to the Reina nightclub, one of the most popular night spots in Istanbul. Several ambulances flashing blue lights arrived on the scene, some taking wounded to hospitals. \n The White House condemned what it called a \"horrific terrorist attack\" and offered U.S. help to Turkey. \n White House spokesman Eric Schultz said President Barack Obama was briefed on the attack by his national security team and asked to be updated as the situation developed. Obama is vacationing in Hawaii this week with his family. \n European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini tweeted: \"Our thoughts are with victims and their loved ones. We continue to work to prevent these tragedies,\" \n The British ambassador to Turkey, Richard Moore, noting that foreigners were among the victims, urged British nationals in the city to let their families know they were safe. \n An estimated 600 people were celebrating inside the club that is often frequented by famous locals, including singers, actors and sports stars. Several shocked revelers were seen fleeing the scene after the attack and the music fell silent. \n Turkey was rocked by a series of deadly attacks in 2016 carried out by the Islamic State group or Kurdish militants, killing more than 180 people. \n On Dec. 10, a double bomb attack outside a soccer stadium near the Reina nightclub killed 44 people and wounded 149 others. The attack was claimed by Turkey-based Kurdish militant group, the Kurdish Freedom Falcons. Nine days later, an off-duty Turkish riot policeman assassinated Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov at a photo exhibition in the capital, Ankara. The government has suggested that a movement led by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen was behind the killing \u2014 an accusation the cleric has denied. \n Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag vowed that Turkey would press ahead with its fight against violent groups. \n \"Turkey will continue its determined and effective combat to root out terror,\" Bozdag said on Twitter. \n Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities, with police barring traffic leading up to key squares in Istanbul and the capital Ankara. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were put on duty, some disguised as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reported. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Turkey: search launched for New Year's nightclub attacker"}

Because I'll tell you what: No computer is safe,\" Trump told reporters during his annual New Year's Eve bash. \"I don't care what they say.\" \n Trump has repeatedly cast aside allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia tried to influence the presidential election through hacking. President Barack Obama earlier this week ordered sanctions on Russian spy agencies, closed two Russian compounds and expelled 35 diplomats the U.S. said were really spies. The Russian government has denied the allegations. \n Trump, who has said that he plans to meet with intelligence officials next to week to learn more about the allegations, said he wants U.S. officials \"to be sure because it's a pretty serious charge.\" He pointed to intelligence failures over the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq before the U.S. invasion, and declared himself an expert in the area. \n \"I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove, so it could be somebody else,\" he said. \n He added, cryptically, that he also knows \"things that other people don't know. And so they cannot be sure of the situation.\" \n Trump made the comments during his annual New Year's Eve bash at his Mar-a-Lago club. Hundreds of guests gathered in the club's grand ballroom, including action star Sylvester Stallone and romance novel model Fabio. Reporters were invited to watch as guests arrived. \n Earlier in the day, Trump ditched his press pool, traveling to play golf at one of his clubs without a pool of journalists on hand to ensure the public has knowledge of his whereabouts. \n A member of Trump's golf club in Jupiter, Florida, posted a photo on Twitter of Trump on the greens Saturday morning and said about 25 U.S. Secret Service agents accompanied the president-elect.

Love!\" \n With the arrival of 2017, another New Year's message moved on Trump's Twitter account at about midnight. \n This one was decidedly more upbeat, addressed to all Americans, and including an abbreviation for his campaign slogan: Make America Great Again. \n \"To all Americans- HappyNewYear & many blessings to you all!

{"date": "December 31, 2016", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n South Koreans watch a TV news program showing North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's New Year's speech, at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea. \n TOKYO >> North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hinted Sunday that Pyongyang may ring in the new year with another bang \u2014 the test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. \n In his annual New Year's address, Kim said that after testing what the North claims was its first hydrogen bomb last year, preparations for launching an intercontinental ballistic missile have \"reached the final stage\" \n Kim did not explicitly say an ICBM test, which if successful would be a big step forward for the North, was imminent. But he has a birthday coming up \u2014 on Jan. 8 \u2014 and last year Pyongyang conducted a nuclear test on Jan. 6. \n Kim threatened in the address to boost his country's military capabilities further unless the U.S. ends war games with rival South Korea. But he also said efforts must be made to defuse the possibility of another Korean war and stressed the importance of building the economy under a five-year plan announced in May. \n \"The political and military position of socialism should be further cemented as an invincible fortress,\" Kim said, according to an outline of the speech carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency. \"We should resolutely smash the enemies' despicable and vicious moves to dampen the pure and ardent desire of the people for the party and estrange the people from it.\" \n The address was shown on television mixing video with Kim speaking and stretches of audio only, as still photos were broadcast. It was less than 30 minutes long. \n Under Kim, who rose to power following his father's death in 2011, North Korea has seen steady progress in its nuclear and missile programs, including two nuclear tests in 2016. It recently claimed a series of technical breakthroughs in its goal of developing a long-range nuclear missile capable of reaching the continental United States. \n U.N. resolutions call for an end to North Korea's nuclear and missile tests. Kim appears uninterested in complying. \n The year ahead could be a tumultuous one in north Asia, with Donald Trump set to become the new U.S. president on Jan. 20, and South Korea's politics in disarray over a scandal that brought the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye. \n Kim indicated there will be no change in the North's nuclear policy unless Washington makes a big, conciliatory first move, which, even with the advent of Trump, would seem unlikely. \n Trump has somewhat offhandedly suggested he would be willing to meet with Kim \u2014 but not in North Korea \u2014 and has at the same time indicated that he wants China to exert significantly more control over Pyongyang to get it to abandon its nuclear program. \n Demands from Pyongyang for the U.S. to stop its joint military exercises with the South and enter into negotiations to sign a peace treaty formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War have fallen on deaf ears in Washington for years amid an atmosphere of distrust and deepening hostility. \n Kim is in his early 30s and is now in his fifth year as the North's leader. \n His New Year addresses, and a marathon speech at the May ruling party congress, are a contrast with his enigmatic father, Kim Jong Il, who rarely spoke in public. But he has yet to meet a foreign head of state or travel outside of North Korea since assuming power, and remains one the world's most mysterious national leaders. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "North Korea's leader hints of long-range missile test launch"}

The company said U.S. utilities were alerted by the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday of the code. \n \"This attack shows how rampant Russian hacking is. It's systemic, relentless, predatory,\" Rep. Peter Welch said in a statement. \"They will hack everywhere, even Vermont, in pursuit of opportunities to disrupt our country.\" \n Welch said the breach also underscores that sanctions President Barack Obama took against Russia this week were warranted.

The Obama administration is issuing new rules it says will crack down on illegal fishing and seafood fraud by preventing unverifiable fish products from entering the U.S. market. \n PORTLAND, Maine >> The Obama administration is issuing new rules it says will crack down on illegal fishing and seafood fraud by preventing unverifiable fish products from entering the U.S. market. \n The new protections are called the Seafood Import Monitoring Program, and they are designed to stop illegally fished and intentionally misidentified seafood from getting into stores and restaurants by way of imported fish. \n The rules will require seafood importers to report information and maintain records about the harvest and chain of custody of fish, officials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. \n The program will start by focusing on \"priority species\" that are especially vulnerable to illegal fishing, such as popular food fish like tuna, swordfish, Atlantic cod and grouper. The government hopes eventually to broaden the program out to include all fish species, NOAA officials said. \n \"It sends an important message to the international seafood community that if you are open and transparent about the seafood you catch and sell across the supply chain, then the U.S. markets are open for your business,\" said Catherine Novelli, a State Department undersecretary. \n Estimates of the economic damage of illegal fishing vary, but conservation group Oceana reported in a 2013 study that illegal fishing causes more than $10 billion in global losses every year. Some other estimates are higher. \n The rules will help make sure that importers are able to supply \"the who, what, why, when, how of fishing,\" said Beth Lowell, a senior campaign director with Oceana. \n \"For the first time ever, some imported species will be held to the same standard that domestic wild caught species are,\" Lowell said. \n The new rules are an outgrowth of a presidential task force established in June 2014 to crack down on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and seafood fraud. NOAA officials said the new requirements will allow regulators to trace seafood from its point of entry into the U.S. to the point when it was harvested from the sea. \n The information submitted by importers to comply with the rules will be kept confidential, and there is not a consumer labeling component. \n The National Marine Fisheries Service, an arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will administer the program, NOAA officials said. The rules go on the books Jan. 9 and compliance from importers is expected by Jan. 1, 2018. \n Shrimp and abalone are included in the plan, but implementation for those species will come later because of gaps in availability of information, NOAA officials said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. issuing new rules to curb illegal fishing, seafood fraud"}

Bush's administration supported him because \"we wanted someone who would do what the member governments wanted\" \u2014 and not take the lead on issues and act as the world's top diplomat like then-secretary-general Kofi Annan. \n \"I think Ban Ki-moon lived up to our expectations, which is not to say I agreed with every position he took on climate change and things like that,\" Bolton told AP. \n When the former South Korean foreign minister, who grew up during the Korean War, took over as secretary-general from Annan at the start of 2007, he promised his tenure would be \"marked by ceaseless efforts to build bridges and close divides.\" And he made tackling global warming, then on a back burner, a top priority. \n During his first term, he won plaudits for helping move climate change close to the top of the global agenda, for creating UN Women to focus on the fight for gender equality, and for speaking out early and strongly for demonstrators in Tunisia and other countries that rose up in the Arab Spring. \n During his second term, his campaign for a new global climate deal culminated in the December 2015 Paris agreement. He got all 193 member states to agree on 17 new U.N. goals and 169 targets to combat poverty, achieve gender equality, protect the environment and ensure good governance by 2030. He called early on for an end to the Syrian conflict and he strongly backed gay rights despite opposition from many countries. \n But Ban also faced criticism \u2014 in his first term for not speaking out against human rights abuses in China and Russia. In his second term, the U.N.'s handling of the cholera epidemic in Haiti and its failure to deal effectively with sexual abuse by U.N. peacekeepers in the Central African Republic and elsewhere were widely criticized. Ban's temporary removal of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in Yemen from a U.N. blacklist for allegedly killing children after coalition supporters threatened to stop funding many U.N. programs was sharply rebuked as well. \n A workaholic, Ban traveled more than any of his predecessors on U.N. business. He said most Western leaders speak through statements, but he believes face-to-face meetings with world leaders are critical to getting support to end conflicts or promote action on issues like climate change and combatting poverty. \n Despite his decade as U.N. chief, Ban Ki-moon is hardly a household name. He has been criticized for his lack of charisma and communication skills crucial in an increasingly globalized and interconnected world, though in private and at the off-the-record U.N. Correspondents Association's annual gala he has regularly displayed a good sense of humor. \n France's U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre told AP he deeply values Ban's \"sense of humility.\" \n \"The world owes him a lot, both as a man whose commitment to common good is second to none and as a leader whose secret weapon is a genuine respect for others \u2014 the best tool for real leadership,\" Delattre said. \n When Ban came to the U.N., he had been in the forefront of South Korea's nuclear negotiations with Pyongyang. He said he planned to travel to North Korea as secretary-general, something Annan never did, but he didn't get there. \n His hope of using his U.N. position to promote peace and reconciliation on the Korean peninsula \"and a peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue\" remained unrealized. But after some time off, he will return to South Korea amid widespread speculation he will be a candidate to replace the country's impeached president. If so, North Korea will again be at the top of his agenda. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ban Ki-moon buoyed by climate accord but laments conflicts"}
