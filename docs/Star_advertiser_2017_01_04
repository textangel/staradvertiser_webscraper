{"date": "January 4, 2017", "text": "DENNIS ODA / 2013 \n Garrett McNamara in Mokuleia. \n For the first time in his 20-plus years as a big-wave surfer, Garrett McNamara began to question why he was still chasing the walls of water. \n It seemed an inconceivable notion for someone like McNamara, one of surfing's big-wave godfathers. The slightly stocky Hawaii resident was in the lineup the day Laird Hamilton, the sport's most influential ambassador, was first towed into a wave. McNamara even holds several big-wave records, including having surfed a 78-foot swell \u2014 the largest ever officially measured \u2014 off the coast of Nazar\u00e9, Portugal. \n \"Big-wave surfers have this extra twitch to trust themselves, and part of the Garrett McNamara show is watching him yell as he is about to drop in,\" said Curt Myers, a photographer who often shoots McNamara. \n But in recent years, especially as 2016 approached, the adrenaline surge that McNamara, then 48, felt as he sped down the wave's face had waned. \n \"I had gotten too comfortable,\" he said. \"I was desensitized whenever I got in the water. I started riding big waves for that rush, but now that feeling is nonexistent. I couldn't figure out why I still ride these giant waves.\" \n McNamara considered retirement. With a long list of sponsors, he could provide for his wife, Nicole, and their 2-year-old son, Barrel, without going anywhere near the ocean. \n Yet McNamara still itched whenever he heard whispers of a forthcoming swell half a world away. \n \"My mind froths,\" he said. \n Like all big-wave surfers, McNamara consults weather maps several times a day. When he recognized an ideal set of conditions last January at Mavericks, a big-wave mecca south of San Francisco, he knew he had to be there. \n Equipped with an inflated survival suit to keep him afloat if knocked unconscious and a Gun surfboard, which is thicker than a standard board, McNamara paddled slowly into what he described as a \"normal\" 70-foot wave. \n That wave last Jan. 7 would alter McNamara's life and surfing future. \n A third of the way down the wave's face, McNamara lost his footing and catapulted off his board, skipping like a rock several stories into the surf. The lip of the wave broke onto him. \n \"It was one of the gnarliest falls I have seen,\" said Myers, who had towed McNamara to the site. \n McNamara attributed the fall to his upright stance, which prevented him from absorbing the wave's momentum. \n \"I didn't fear these massive waves anymore,\" he said. \n Upon impact, McNamara suffered a four-part fracture of the humerus bone in his left arm. Like a cracked egg, the head of the humerus shattered into nine pieces, and the shaft was stuck in McNamara's pectoral muscle, where it remained for 24 hours until doctors could remove it during emergency surgery. \n His shoulder was stabilized with a metal plate and pin, and though the injury was the worst of his career, McNamara was told that if he began stretching immediately, he could be back in the water within six months. \n Several complications clouded this rosy prediction. A bone on the back side of his humerus was elevated 2 centimeters out of position, and the humeral head sagged out of its socket. This indicated that the deltoid muscle's main nerve, which keeps the shoulder in place, was significantly damaged. A week after McNamara's initial surgery in mid-January, his shoulder again blew apart. \n \"It was the most severe pain I had felt in my life,\" McNamara said. \"I didn't want to be on Earth anymore.\" \n Dr. Ed Weldon, a Honolulu-based orthopedic surgeon who performed a second operation on McNamara, said he could not repair the nerve. \n \"We thought it best not to explore the nerve and just give it time to see if it would return,\" he added. \n There was a chance McNamara's shoulder \"wouldn't work well again for any type of daily activities,\" including surfing, Weldon said. \n After an hourlong procedure, McNamara's left arm was strapped into a pulley system. The machine kept his arm in a constant state of motion and helped slow the growth of scar tissue. But the pain was severe. \n \"The pain was never-ending for the first three months,\" McNamara said. \n The prolonged recovery changed his outlook on surfing, too. \n \"For the first time in my life, I didn't have this monkey on my back that I needed to catch swells,\" McNamara said. \"I was missing the biggest winter we have ever had in surfing history, and I didn't care.\" \n He did not idly let his body heal on its own course, though. McNamara worked out in the same manner that he charged big waves \u2014 with a ferocity that to others seemed maniacal. \n During a trip to Malibu, California, in June, McNamara rode a few small waves. \"I had no business being out there, but it made me feel better,\" he said. \n After that confidence boost, he redoubled his rehab efforts in August, meeting daily with Daniel Bachmann, a trainer whose specialty is shoulder mobility and mechanics. \n By December, his left shoulder's range of motion was at just 80 percent. \n Every big-wave surfer has at least one epic wipeout story. As Ion Banner, another big-wave great, said: \"That gas is taken out of you at some point, but you have to get back on the horse. If you wait too long, the fear inside of you builds up.\" \n That is why McNamara quickly accepted an invitation to the World Surf League's Big Wave Tour's inaugural event in Nazar\u00e9, which began in October. \n The spot, off a sleepy hamlet in central Portugal, is McNamara's home base, and he has long been revered in the country. Jamie Mitchell of Australia won the top honors in Nazar\u00e9 when the contest wrapped up in late December. McNamara was not in shape, or confident enough, to compete. Rather, he helped officials organize the event. \n \"I'm still not comfortable riding anything larger than 20 feet,\" McNamara said. \"I went out recently on one that big and I was scared. I kept thinking about whether I'd get injured again.\" \n Surfing has largely defined McNamara's life, and those around him were concerned that he would become a shell of himself without that passion. \n \"I worried about his mental health if he didn't get back to surfing,\" said his wife, Nicole. \"He always has said he'll be a woodworker when he can't surf anymore, but he's never made anything for me out of wood.\" \n McNamara hopes to return to Mavericks on the anniversary of his accident. Even after the crash, he kept poring over daily weather maps, so by Wednesday, three days before the accident's anniversary, he will know whether to risk his health to join the other big-wave obsessives in the water. \n To McNamara, being at the place where his life forever shifted is important for his recovery. \n \"I might just paddle out to hang out, and if I get a wave, I'd do it, but if I don't, it's still worth it,\" he said. \n He maintained that the wave that derailed his past year was the best thing to happen to him. \n \"The question 'Why am I still doing this?' had entered my mind often,\" McNamara said. \"Haven't I had enough? It was challenging to get that rush I felt when I first started. \n \"I now know better than to freak out like I used to and try to ride every one, but I'd like to find out if I get the rush again after this wipeout. I hope I will. That would be cool.\" \n ", "author": "New York Times", "title": "Hawaii big-wave great ponders the surf after the wipeout of a lifetime"}

She has a track record of trying to overhaul troubled police agencies. \n Chicago hired her six months ago to lead an effort to oversee police reforms. She was a finalist for chief after a video showing an officer fatally shooting a black teenager 16 times led to the superintendent's firing. \n Speaking with a distinct southern drawl, Kirkpatrick vowed to rebuild damaged relations with Oakland's significant black community while working to revitalize a demoralized rank-and-file force. \n \"I'm interested in transformation,\" Kirkpatrick said. \n She offered few specifics of her plans but said, \"I don't consider it a mess,\" when asked about taking over the embattled department. \"It's an opportunity.\" \n Maya Whitaker, a black community organizer who helped with the job search, said the new chief is aware that she is entering a \"no-trust zone\" and needs \"to break down barriers.\" \n Whitaker said she's optimistic that Kirkpatrick, who is white, has the experience to succeed in Oakland but the community \"will hold her accountable\" if she fails. \n Sgt. Barry Donlan, head of the officers' union, said \"Oakland's hard-working police officers look forward to working collaboratively with Chief Kirkpatrick in serving our community.\" \n She joins a rare slate of female leaders of a large city. Oakland's mayor, fire chief and city administrator are all women. \n Kirkpatrick previously held high-ranking law enforcement posts in Washington state, including as Spokane's police chief for six years through 2012. The city hired her to reform a department rocked by a police brutality scandal. Along the way, she earned a law degree at Seattle University. \n Kirkpatrick will bring her background in reform to an agency dogged by a scandal that ensnared two dozen officers throughout the San Francisco Bay Area accused of having sex with the teen daughter of an Oakland dispatcher. \n About a dozen Oakland officers resigned, were suspended or were implicated in the scandal, and seven current and former Bay Area officers faced criminal charges. \n The teen has told The Associated Press and other media outlets that she worked as a 17-year-old prostitute and had sex with two dozen officers, sometimes in exchange for tips on prostitution stings and protection from arrest. \n The allegations led to Oakland cycling through three police chiefs in June before the mayor announced that the city's administrator would take over management of the department until a permanent chief was hired. \n The police force has been under federal court supervision since the 2003 settlement of a civil rights lawsuit that accused officers of planting evidence, beating suspects and other wrongdoing. \n Under former Chief Sean Whent, the city was close to shedding court oversight when the sex scandal derailed the department's reform process and forced Whent to resign. \n Bay Area Rapid Transit Deputy Chief Ben Fairow was appointed to replace Whent but resigned shortly afterward when news of an extramarital affair surfaced. \n Oakland Deputy Chief Paul Figueroa agreed to act as interim chief but stepped down two days later for unknown reasons. Figueroa was then demoted to captain, and management of the department was turned over to the city administrator. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "1st female Oakland police chief vows to mend community ties"}

{"date": "January 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n One of two beluga whales that washed ashore on a beach south of Anchorage, Alaska. \n ANCHORAGE, Alaska >> A federal plan for the recovery of an endangered Alaska beluga whale calls for a reduction in threats of high concern while scientists try to pinpoint what has kept the population from growing. \n The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Wednesday announced its recovery plan for Cook Inlet beluga whales, a population listed as endangered since 2008. \n NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service acknowledges it does not know why the population hasn't bounced back. In the absence of an answer, the agency will focus on research and potential threats, such as noise and the cumulative effects of \"multiple stressors.\" \n \"Until we know which threats are limiting this species' recovery, the strategy of this recovery plan is to focus recovery efforts on threats identified as of medium or high relative concern,\" the agency said. \n The state of Alaska fought the endangered species listing of Cook Inlet belugas eight years ago and took issue with the recovery plan. Division of Wildlife Conservation director Bruce Dale in a statement said it contains untenable recovery criteria that will limit acceptance by interested parties and extend hurdles to development. \n \"The most critical action for recovering the Cook Inlet belugas will be to determine why the population isn't growing,\" Dale said. \"The threats limiting recovery are unknown.\" \n A 1979 survey counted nearly 1,300 beluga whales. A 2014 survey estimated just 340 and a population continuing to trend downward. \n The recovery plan calls for an upgrade to \"threatened\" status when the population reaches 520 animals and delisting when there are 780. Dale took issue with those targets. \n \"These demographic criteria are problematic because the number of animals in a population is not necessarily an indication of the risk of extinction,\" Dale said. The plan includes threats-based recovery criteria that cannot be measured and are impossible to meet, he said. \n Cook Inlet belugas are one of five beluga populations in U.S. waters. Cook Inlet stretches 180 miles from Anchorage to the Gulf of Alaska and the fisheries service considers 1,300 animals to be its carrying capacity. \n The whales turn white as adults and can reach 15 feet long. They feed on salmon, smaller fish, crab, shrimp, squid and clams and in late summer can be spotted from highways leading from Anchorage, chasing salmon schooled at stream mouths. \n The Cook Inlet beluga population dwindled steadily through the 1980s and early '90s. The decline accelerated between 1994 and 1998 when Alaska Natives harvested nearly half the remaining 650 whales in only four years. Subsistence hunting ended in 1999. \n Federal officials initially figured that controlling subsistence hunting would allow the population to recover. When it did not, they declared belugas endangered in 2008. \n The agency identified 10 potential threats to belugas. Of highest concern are catastrophic events, such as natural disasters or oil spills; cumulative effects of multiple stressors; and noise. \n Threats of medium concern include disease agents, such as blooms of harmful algae, loss of habitat, a reduction in prey and unauthorized killing. \n Threats of relatively low concern include pollution, predation and subsistence hunting. \n The agency estimated recovery could take at least 50 years, which translates into two generations of whales. \n Karla Dutton, Alaska program director for Defenders of Wildlife, said the recovery plan was overdue but welcome. \n \"We call on National Marine Fisheries Service to properly fund in a timely manner the science needed to further understand and address these threats so we can work together to recover this iconic Cook Inlet species,\" she said by email. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "NOAA releases plan for Alaska endangered beluga whales"}

On Tuesday police searched the shelter. \n BERLIN >> An acquaintance of suspected Berlin Christmas market attacker Anis Amri who dined with him the night before the rampage is under investigation for possible participation in planning the attack, German prosecutors said Wednesday. He was arrested, but in a separate case. \n The 26-year-old Tunisian had known Amri since the end of 2015 and the pair ate together at a Berlin restaurant the night before the Dec. 19 attack, said Frauke Koehler, a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors. His quarters at a refugee home were searched on Tuesday. \n The pair's meeting led prosecutors to believe that the man may have been involved in the attack or at least knew that Amri planned to commit one, Koehler said. She said that \"communications devices\" seized in Tuesday's search are being evaluated, but federal prosecutors do not currently have enough evidence to seek an arrest warrant against him. \n The man was, however, detained Tuesday in a separate case run by Berlin local prosecutors, Koehler said. Berlin prosecutors said the arrest was for allegedly falsely claiming benefits. \n A further search was conducted Tuesday at the home of a one-time roommate of Amri who is being treated as a witness in the case, Koehler said. \n Amri, a 24-year-old Tunisian, tried to reach that person on the morning and afternoon of Dec. 19, but it isn't clear whether they actually spoke, she added. \n Investigators say Amri drove the truck that plowed into a Christmas market in central Berlin. Twelve people were killed \u2014 including the truck's regular driver, whose body was found in the cab after the attack. \n Koehler said that the Polish driver apparently was fatally shot before the truck set off for the market from its parking place north of central Berlin. She said investigations have shown \"no indications that there was a third person in the cab at the time of the attack.\" \n Germany on Dec. 21 released a Europe-wide wanted notice for Amri, who used a string of different names and nationalities. He was killed in a shootout Dec. 23 with Italian police in a Milan suburb after they stopped him for a routine identity check. \n Surveillance footage from the Zoologischer Garten station, a few minutes' walk from the Christmas market, appears to show Amri shortly after the attack, Koehler said. \n The pictures \"suggest that Amri was aware that he was being recorded by this video camera,\" she said. She added that he turned to the camera and showed a \"tawhid finger\", or a raised index finger \u2014 an Islamic gesture sometimes used by jihadis. \n The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack days afterward. \n On Dec. 21, footage from cameras in the Netherlands suggests that he was at the railway station in Nijmegen, Koehler said. \n Amri traveled by train from Nijmegen to Amsterdam the same day, then caught a train to Brussels, Dutch prosecutors said in a statement Wednesday. \n Belgian authorities said that he spent two hours at the Brussels North station coming from Amsterdam. He then traveled to Italy via France. \n Ballistics tests \"confirmed 100 percent\" that the .22-caliber, German-manufactured handgun, used by Amri to shoot one of the Italian policemen who had stopped him for a security check \"was the same one that was fired in Germany at the Christmas market attack,\" said Gianpaolo Zambonini, of the Rome forensic police. \n Zambonini said investigations are ongoing to determine whether the gun might have been used in other crimes in Italy or elsewhere. \n The bullet that lodged in the wounded policeman's shoulder was too damaged to be used for comparison, so Italian police ballistics experts used a simulator at a laboratory in Rome to fire another bullet from the gun. Then they compared scratches on the bullet with those found on bullet cartridges recovered in Berlin, police said. \n Koehler said investigators are still trying to figure out how Amri got hold of the gun, but that's difficult because manufacturer Erma went bankrupt at the end of the 1990s, she added. \n Amri, who had previously spent time in prison in Italy, arrived in Germany in July 2015. German authorities tried last year to deport him to Tunisia after his asylum application was rejected. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, and Frances D'Emilio in Rome contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Germany arrests Tunisian who dined with market attacker"}

He said it was critical to ensure that \"we are doing everything we can to make sure that the next president will benefit from the same kinds of outstanding advice and service that these people around the table have provided me.\" \n Obama's comments as he sat down with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the military's combatant commanders came amid concerns in military and diplomatic circles about how Trump may handle national security challenges. Over the last few days, Trump has disputed the U.S. intelligence community's assessments about Russian hacking, insisted without explanation that North Korea won't develop a nuclear weapon that could hit the U.S. and questioned the worth of the United Nations. \n Obama pointed to a handful of conflicts that Trump will inherit when he takes office on Jan. 20, including the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria and in the Iraqi city of Mosul, the biggest IS stronghold in Iraq and last major Iraqi city where the extremist group still has control. He also noted that the conflict in Afghanistan \"is still active.\" \n In praising the military, Obama appeared to call attention to traditions that Democrats are most concerned that Trump may not uphold. Trump has nominated retired Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis for defense secretary despite the prohibition on recently departed military members running the civilian-led Pentagon, and at one point in the campaign, Trump called for reinstating waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques. \n Obama said he was optimistic about the country's future because the military upholds \"the values of rule of law and professionalism and integrity, and recognizes our constitutional structure and maintains strict adherence and respect for civilian authority and democratic practices in determining how we use the awesome force of the American military.\" \n The president was also honored at a farewell ceremony at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, a short drive from the White House. \n Addressing a room of men and women from the various branches of the military, Obama praised their service and sacrifice.

Each count carries a maximum sentence of death or life in prison without the possibility of parole. Skagit County Prosecuting Attorney Richard Weyrich said his office has 30 days to decide whether they'll seek the death penalty. \n A message left for Cetin's public defender, Keith Tyne, was not immediately returned. \n Cetin's stepfather, David Marshall, told the media after an initial court hearing that Cetin \"has had mental health issues that we have been working on him with.\" \n The 20-year-old had a history of violent behavior toward his family and ex-girlfriend. His neighbor described Cetin as \"creepy.\" \n Cetin had visited his mother and Marshall before the Sept. 23 shooting, and stole his stepfather's .22-caliber Ruger rifle, which had been hidden under a bed, according to records acquired by The Associated Press. \n On the night of the shooting, he first went to the mall's movie theater and used his cell phone to prop the door open when he went outside. But another movie-goer closed the door behind him and gave the phone to theater officials, thwarting whatever plans Cetin may have had. \n Soon after, Cetin retrieved his phone from officials and went into the mall. \n Cetin entered through the Chuck E. Cheese restaurant just before 7 p.m. and headed for the Macy's Women's store, Mount Vernon Police Officer Dave Shackleton said in an arrest warrant affidavit. \n Surveillance video shows Cetin shooting a teenage girl near some clothing racks and then shooting a man.

The sentencing phase of Roof's federal trial begins Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2016, in Charleston. He could face the death penalty or life in prison. \n CHARLESTON, S.C. >> Convicted Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof spoke to the jury for the first time at his death penalty trial Wednesday, telling them that there's nothing wrong with him psychologically and that he is not trying to keep any secrets from them. \n But perhaps most important is what he didn't say: He didn't ask jurors to spare him from the death penalty. The jury last month unanimously found Roof guilty of hate crimes and other charges in the shooting deaths of nine black church members during Bible study. The jurors will now decide whether he should be sentenced to life in prison or death. \n \"My opening statement is going to seem a little bit out of place,\" the soft-spoken 22-year-old white man said calmly as he stood in front of a podium, occasionally glancing at notes. \"I am not going to lie to you. \u2026 Other than the fact that I trust people that I shouldn't and the fact that I'm probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone who's ever existed, there's nothing wrong with me psychologically.\" \n Roof's attorneys have indicated that he chose to represent himself during the sentencing phase of his trial because he was worried they might present embarrassing evidence about himself or his family. They have not said what that evidence may be. Roof was found competent to represent himself during two different hearings, one as recently as within the last week. \n Prosecutors said Roof deserved the death penalty because he painstakingly chose to target vulnerable people during Bible study at Emanuel AME Church in June 2015. \n \"This defendant's horrific acts justify the death penalty,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Nathan Williams said. \"He killed nine people. \u2026 He killed them because of the color of their skin.

{"date": "January 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People gather in Lafayette Park to see the White House illuminated with rainbow colors in commemoration of the Supreme Court's ruling to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington. \n It was a new look for the White House: illuminated in rainbow colors to celebrate the Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage nationwide. \n President Barack Obama, who was inside, felt the glow on that June night in 2015. \n \"To see people gathered in the evening outside on a beautiful summer night, and to feel whole and to feel accepted, and to feel that they had a right to love \u2014 that was pretty cool,\" he said a few days later. \n \"Pretty cool.\" That might be a fair description of how Obama himself is viewed by legions of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans who consider him \u2014 among all of the nation's presidents \u2014 the greatest champion of their rights and well-being. \n The relationship was slow in developing. \n Obama took office in 2009 as a self-described \"fierce advocate\" for gay rights, yet for much of his first term drew flak from impatient, skeptical activists who viewed him as too cautious, too politically expedient. They were frustrated he wouldn't endorse same-sex marriage \u2014 Obama cagily said he was \"evolving\" \u2014 and wanted him to move faster on several other issues. But the pace of Obama's actions steadily accelerated. \n In December 2010, he signed legislation enabling gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military. In 2011, he directed government agencies to combat LGBT rights abuses internationally. By May 2012 \u2014 soon after Vice President Joe Biden set the example \u2014 Obama endorsed gay marriage. \n His administration also stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal recognition to same-sex couples. That move helped clear the way for the Supreme Court's historic same-sex marriage ruling in 2015. \n In the nationwide marriage debate, Obama was not a pace-setter \u2014 a Gallup poll showed a majority of Americans supporting same-sex marriage a year before he did. But the president didn't pause at the stage; he continued throughout his two terms to find ways to support the LGBT community even when Congress was in partisan deadlock. \n According to a tally by the Human Rights Campaign, Obama's administration has made more than 125 changes to regulations and policies to expand LGBT rights, and Obama appointed more than 250 openly LGBT people to federal positions, including 15 judicial appointments and nine high-level diplomatic posts. \n Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the policy achievements tell only part of the story. \n \"More than all of this, he honestly and without reservation embraced and celebrated our community as part of the human family,\" she said. \"He was not perfect, but he leaves a legacy that will be hard to beat.\" \n In the past year alone, there were several telling moments. \n On June 16, Obama traveled to Orlando, Florida, to meet with the families of the 49 people killed four days earlier by a rampaging gunman at an LGBT nightclub. \n \"This was an attack on the LGBT community,\" Obama said. \"Americans were targeted because we're a country that has learned to welcome everyone, no matter who you are or who you love.\" \n Eight days later, Obama designated the first national monument honoring LGBT rights \u2014 the site of the Stonewall Inn in New York City where a 1969 community uprising in response to a police raid helped energize LGBT activism nationwide. \n And in November, Obama gave a warm embrace to Ellen DeGeneres \u2014 who boldly came out as a lesbian in 1997 \u2014 while awarding her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \"Her courage and candor helped change the hearts and minds of millions of Americans,\" said the White House citation. \n While supporters of LGBT-rights are extolling Obama's record, some religious conservatives say the president went too far in some cases, infringing on the religious liberties of Americans whose faiths disapprove of same-sex marriage. \n \"The Obama administration has waged an aggressive and unnecessary culture war,\" wrote Ryan Anderson, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, in a recent column. \n He urged President-elect Donald Trump to make clear that his incoming administration \"will never penalize any individual or institution because they believe and act on the belief that marriage is the union of husband and wife.\" \n Professor and author Ed Stetzer, executive director of the Billy Graham Center for Evangelism at Wheaton College, recalled how Obama had reached out to evangelicals during his first presidential campaign in 2008 \u2014 an outreach that troubled LGBT activists. But Stetzer said many evangelicals became disenchanted by Obama's later advocacy of same-sex marriage. \n \"He has tried to wade through some of the issues, but many evangelicals feel he didn't strike the right balance,\" Stetzer said. \"They genuinely feel that their religious liberty is in jeopardy because of a shift on LGBT rights.\" \n Since Trump's election victory, LGBT-rights activists have expressed fears that the new Republican administration will reverse some of Obama's supportive executive orders and back legislation allowing some forms of discrimination against LGBT people if it's based on religious beliefs. \n Among those unsettled by the presidential transition is Cari Searcy of Mobile, Alabama, who along with her wife waged years of litigation seeking joint parental rights to their son. Their lawsuit overturned Alabama's ban on same-sex marriage. \n \"After fighting such a long, hard battle for equal protections for our family, it is a very real concern that those rights could now be taken away,\" said Searcy. \n As for Obama, Searcy said he \"revolutionized the way America sees us.\" \n \"The policies and protections that our community gained under his administration changed our daily lives and included us in the national conversation,\" she said. \"We have come so far under his leadership, and for that, I will forever be grateful.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "LGBT activists view Obama as staunch champion of their cause"}

Tim Ryan, D-Ohio. \"Tell the stories about the people who have benefited from it. The more you can get that message through, the better off we're going to be.\" \n Pence spoke to reporters after an hour-long session with House Republicans. Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., said GOP leaders want to get legislation dismantling the health care law to Trump for his signature by Feb. 20. \n \"The first order of business is to repeal and replace Obamacare,\" Pence said, using the overhaul's nickname. He said Americans \"voted decisively for a better future for health care in this country, and we are determined to give them that.\" \n Pence said Trump's team was already working with GOP congressional leaders on plans to undo Obama's law with both legislation and executive action the president and federal agencies would be able to take. \n Pence did not specify what those actions would be. But House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters they would involve \"transition relief.\" That phrase has been used to describe help for consumers and insurers while Obama's law is being phased out and replaced with a GOP alternative, a process expected to take years. \n Republicans are discussing delaying the timing for major provisions of the change to actually take effect, perhaps to 18 months or more. It is expected to take at least that long for GOP lawmakers to rally behind a plan. \n Obama's and Pence's strategy sessions came on the second day of the new, GOP-led Congress. The Senate voted 51-48 Wednesday to begin debating a budget that, once approved, will prevent Democrats from using a filibuster to block future Republican legislation to scuttle the health care law. \n Republicans control the Senate by 52-48, but it takes 60 votes to end a filibuster, a procedural roadblock that can kill legislation. The Senate was expected to complete the budget by next week, with House approval to follow. \n Minutes before Obama and Pence met with lawmakers, Trump tweeted that voters are faulting Democrats for the health care law and its rising premiums, deductibles and other problems. \n \"Massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess.

Republicans also face divisions over potential replacement legislation. \n The budget legislation gives congressional committees until Jan. 27 \u2014 a blink of an eye for lawmakers \u2014 to write legislation repealing major parts of the health care law. Likely targets include the law's tax penalties for people who don't obtain insurance, its requirement that many companies cover workers and its tax increases on higher-earning individuals and many health care firms. \n Aware they have no chance of quickly agreeing on replacement legislation, Republicans plan to delay when their repeal would actually take effect. A range of 18 months to three years \u2014 perhaps longer \u2014 has been under discussion. \n Trump has provided few specifics about how he would revamp the nation's $3 trillion-a-year health care system. Steps he and congressional Republicans have mentioned include greater reliance on tax credits to help people afford coverage. \n Republicans don't want to abruptly end health care coverage for millions of voters who live in GOP-represented districts and states, or cause chaos in health care markets and prompt insurance companies to stop selling policies. So they are considering including provisions in their repeal bill to protect consumers and insurers during the transition period. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Repeal 'Obamacare,' but don't hurt consumers, Pence says"}

Honolulu Fire Department Spokesman Capt. Kevin Mokulehua said the hikers, described to be in their 20s, were hiking for about two hours when they got lost. \n Firefighters located them at approximately 9:41 p.m. and escorted them out of the trail. No injuries were reported. \n At Waimano Home Trail, the fire department also responded to five distressed hikers at about 7:30 p.m. In a news release, Mokulehua said the hikers were on the trail for about four hours when they became lost. \n After firefighters began their search, they came across two other lost hikers and escorted them back to the trailhead. \n Almost three hours later, fire crews located the five hikers. There were no reports of any injuries. \n Mokulehua recommended hikers to start their hike early in the day. \"We don't recommend anyone starting their hikes late. It's very difficult to find your way back, especially at night.\" \n If individuals start their hike in the afternoon hours, their hike should be cut in half so they have enough time to head back to the trailhead before dusk, Mokulehua said. \n Mokulehua also advised hikers to stay on the trail to reduce the risk of getting lost or injured such as a serious fall. He urged hikers to carry a charged cell phone, flashlight and a whistle in the event of an emergency. \n The fire department also reminded the public to know their limits after firefighters rescued a woman at the Diamond Head Crater Trail early today after she fainted and had difficulty breathing. \n Firefighters responded to the distress call shortly after 6:30 a.m. The woman, described to be in her 50s, was hiking on the trail when she ran into trouble. Fire crews arrived and located the woman and her family near the tunnel of the trail, according to Mokulehua. \n Family members told rescuers she had fainted several times during their hike and had trouble breathing. The fire crew secured her in a rescue basket before Air 1 airlifted her to a nearby landing zone where paramedics assessed the hiker. \n Before going on a hike, Mokulehua advised hikers to select a trail that best suits your level of experience. \n ", "author": "By Star-Advertiser staff", "title": "Lost, distressed hikers keep rescue crews busy"}

Others sat, stunned, on the pavement outside \u2014 bleeding, holding ice packs on their heads, rising and limping away with help from rescuers. \n \"The entire structure started shaking,\" said Steben Medina, who was having coffee at the terminal when he heard the crash and screams. \"I thought a bomb had gone off or something.\" \n The most serious injury, though, appeared to be a broken leg, said Mayor Bill de Blasio. \n \"Luckily \u2026 all things considered, this was a relatively minor accident,\" said Gov. Andrew Cuomo. \n The terminal is beneath a shopping mall in downtown Brooklyn, adjacent to the Barclays Center, home to Nets basketball, Islanders hockey and major concerts. \n A similar accident across the harbor in Hoboken, New Jersey in September was much worse. There, a New Jersey Transit commuter train plowed off the end of a track, killing a woman standing in the station. Federal investigators are examining whether a more modern bumper or other barriers could have made a difference. \n The train in today's wreck originated in the Far Rockaway section of Queens and was carrying around 450 people, officials said. \n \"People just went flying,\" passenger Donette Smith told The New York Times. \"It was very scary.\" \n \"I sort of slammed into the folks who were facing me,\" said Audrey Foster, who was sitting in the second car and hurt her side. \n Foster said there were a lot of familiar faces on her daily commute, and many of those people were injured. \"It's just sad,\" she said. \n The National Transportation Safety Board dispatched investigators. \n Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chairman Thomas Prendergast said there is \"a signal system that controls it coming in at limited speeds. But when you're getting to the end it's the locomotive engineer's responsibility. And the train's brakes have to work.
