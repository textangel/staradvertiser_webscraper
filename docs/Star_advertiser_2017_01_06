{"date": "January 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Secretary of State John Kerry spoke during a news conference at the State Department in Washington on Thursday. \n WASHINGTON >> Stung by years of failure to stop Syria's bloodshed, the United States is now but a bystander to the civil war as President Barack Obama leaves office. \n Secretary of State John Kerry still is speaking sporadically with Russian, Turkish and Arab foreign ministers about cease-fire efforts, and there are occasional consultations with the opposition. But less than two weeks before Donald Trump's presidency begins, the outgoing administration is no longer even claiming to play the leading part in the peace mediation that it spearheaded unsuccessfully for years. Formal contacts with Russia and others in Geneva, the main meeting point for the U.S.-led diplomacy, have ended. \n Leadership has been ceded to Russia and, to a lesser degree, Turkey and Iran. After helping Syria's military oust the remaining rebels in Aleppo last month, Moscow has cast itself as the would-be peacemaker, clinching a new truce without Washington's help and announcing today that it was starting to draw down its forces in the region. Russian envoys also are organizing the first talks between the Syrian government and opposition in nearly a year, set for later this month in Astana, Kazakhstan. \n \"We still are at the proverbial table,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said today. \"We may not be at the table in Astana, we may not be at the table in Moscow, I understand that. But it's not like we are walking away from Syria.\" \n He added later: \"We aren't connected to this piece of it. It's not like we're pulling out from the whole puzzle.\" \n With no indication about how the incoming Trump administration intends to proceed on Syria, U.S. diplomats are wary of engaging in any new initiatives that would require a sustained American role. As a result, it is ambivalent about attending even in an observer role the proposed peace meeting. Turkey has told the U.S. its presence would be acceptable, American officials said, but Washington has yet to make a decision. \n The diminution of the American role could have drawbacks. \n Obama demanded almost six years ago that Syrian President Bashar Assad leave power and allow for a democratic transition. But Obama's reticence to plunge the U.S. into another Mideast war meant the United States never had the capability to shape such an outcome. Its increasingly marginal role in recent months means it could have even less capacity to help shape Syria's future and safeguard vital American interests, such as Israel's security and fighting the Islamic State group. \n On the other hand, Obama hands the baton to Trump without any large-scale military or diplomatic engagement in Syria. The president never wanted to own the conflict, which has killed up to a half-million people and prompted millions to flee as refugees. And his reticence to intervene at least means Trump will have flexibility, which Obama didn't have in inheriting the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. \n In a farewell news conference Thursday, Kerry insisted the administration hadn't given up on Syria and that he hoped the warring sides could get to \"real negotiations\" on a peace agreement. \n But some officials were frustrated by the administration essentially withdrawing from the process. For example, Kerry hasn't spoken to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov since Dec. 27. Their discussions occurred almost daily at some points last year. \n Two U.S. officials said the administration was content to let the Russians, Turks and Iranians now try their hand at the complicated task of forging peace in Syria. The prevailing attitude, they said, was to let those countries find out for themselves the difficulty of the task. \n Russia, which backs the Syrian government, and Turkey, a strong supporter of Syria's moderate opposition, brokered the current shaky cease-fire, which came into effect on Dec. 30. The truce has mostly held but not altogether halted fighting; the government and opposition have blamed each other for violations. \n The truce doesn't include areas in Syria controlled by IS. \n The U.S. is pressing on with its effort in that campaign, and Trump and his national security advisers have said it will be a top priority for them. \n The Obama administration has an undisclosed number of special operations troops, presumably around 200-250, in Syria. They are advising and assisting what the Americans call the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is comprised of Syrian Kurds and Arabs. Some of the Americans are embedded with the SDF in northern Syria. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. goes from bandleader to bystander in Syria peace efforts"}

{"date": "January 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / OCT. 14 \n A technician worked to prepare voting machines to be used in the presidential election in Philadelphia. \n WASHINGTON >> Citing increasingly sophisticated cyber bad actors and an election infrastructure that's \"vital to our national interests,\" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is designating U.S. election systems critical infrastructure, a move that provides more federal help for state and local governments to keep their election systems safe from tampering.  \n \"Given the vital role elections play in this country, it is clear that certain systems and assets of election infrastructure meet the definition of critical infrastructure, in fact and in law,\" Johnson said in a statement today. He added: \"Particularly in these times, this designation is simply the right and obvious thing to do.\" \n The determination came after months of review and despite opposition from many states worried that the designation would lead to increased federal regulation or oversight on the many decentralized and locally run voting systems across the country. It was announced on the same day a declassified U.S. intelligence report said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"ordered\" an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. \n The declassified report said that Russian intelligence services had \"obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards.\" None of the systems targeted or compromised was involved in vote tallying, the report said. \n A 2013 presidential directive identified 16 sectors as critical infrastructures, including energy, financial services, health care, transportation, food and agriculture and communications. \n The designation announced today places responsibilities on the Homeland Security secretary to identify and prioritize those sectors, considering physical and cyber threats against them. The secretary is also required to conduct security checks and provide information about emerging and imminent threats. \n Such a change does not require presidential action, and only requires the secretary to first consult with the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. \n Discussions about whether to designate elections systems as critical infrastructure surfaced after hackers targeted the voter registration systems of more than 20 states in the months prior to the November election. \n While the designation puts responsibilities on the Department of Homeland Security, it does not require entities that are determined \"critical infrastructure\" to participate. Much of the nation's critical infrastructure is in the private sector. \n Johnson said election infrastructure included storage facilities, polling places and vote tabulation locations, plus technology involved in the process, including voter registration databases, voting machines and other systems used to manage the election process and report and display results. \n The designation allows for information to be withheld from the public when state, local and private partners meet to discuss election infrastructure security \u2014 potentially injecting secrecy into an election process that's traditionally and expressly a transparent process. U.S. officials say such closed door conversations allow for frank discussion that would prevent bad actors from learning about vulnerabilities. DHS would also be able to grant security clearances when appropriate and provide more detailed threat information to states. \n The Obama administration has proposed international cyber rules for peacetime that would expressly note that countries shouldn't conduct online activity targeting critical infrastructure, which will now also include election systems. \n President Barack Obama used sanctions last week to retaliate against Russian efforts to interfere in the U.S. election process by expanding a prior executive order that allows for their use in the case of cyberattack on critical infrastructure to entities \"interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions.\" With election infrastructure designated as critical, an attack that takes the system down would also qualify for a response of sanctions. \n Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, who is the ranking Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, commended Johnson's action and said, \"In the long term, this will put our electoral systems on a more secure footing and maintain public confidence in our elections.\" \n Rep. Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat and co-chairman of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, said in a statement that the decision \"demonstrates the vital need to ensure votes can't be tampered with. We must also act as a nation to build our resilience against future information warfare attacks.\" \n Georgia Secretary of State Brian P. Kemp, who is a member of the U.S. Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group run by DHS, is among those who have opposed the designation. Testifying in September to a House Oversight subcommittee, Kemp said more federal oversight could make systems more vulnerable and could make protected records more accessible. \n When Johnson discussed the likelihood of the designation in a conference call with state officials on Thursday, Kemp called the action \"a federal overreach into a sphere constitutionally reserved for the states.\" According to a copy of his comments released by his office, Kemp told Johnson on the phone that \"this smacks of partisan politics\" given the dwindling days left in the Obama administration. \n Kemp has appealed to President-elect Donald Trump to investigate \"failed cyberattacks\" on the Georgia secretary of state's network that traced to the Department of Homeland Security, calling the department's technical explanations insufficient. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "State election systems to get more federal aid for security"}

Headquarters. \n UNITED NATIONS >> Samantha Power has completed a personal goal she set when becoming the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in August 2013: She has visited the missions of the 189 countries the United States has diplomatic relations with \u2014 and she recommends that her successor Nikki Haley does the same. \n Power's last courtesy call this morning was to the two-room mission of the Pacific island kingdom of Tonga and its Ambassador Mahe'uli'uli Sandhurst Tupouniua, who surprised her by saying \"Our 18th century constitution, I understand, is the second oldest to the United States.\" \n \"Wow! Really! That's amazing!\" Power said. \n But she appeared less impressed when the ambassador \u2014 whom she knows because they're both in the U.N. band \"UN Rocks\" \u2014 told her that women still don't have the right to vote or inherit land, though efforts are underway to allow women to inherit property. \n Power said she decided to pay a courtesy call on every mission the U.S. has relations with because \"it would send a really important signal of the respect that the United States has for these countries, for their views, for their history, for their cultures \u2014 and to show American curiosity.\" \n She said she wanted to show that she was \"not just speaking at people\" but was seeking to learn from the ambassadors \"how we can better partner together.\" \n And she also thought the \"show of respect might be something that would matter to them and would make them an ally\" on tough U.N. votes. \n Three U.N. member states that the United States doesn't have diplomatic relations with missed out on a visit \u2014 North Korea, Iran and Syria. \n Power said she was amazed to discover that about 40 countries had never had a visit from an American ambassador. \n She recalled her first visit to a mission that had never had a U.S. ambassador cross its doorstep \u2014 the Central African Republic \u2014 which she went to soon after her arrival at the U.N. to learn more about the sectarian strife between Muslims and Christians engulfing the country. \n Then ambassador Charles-Armel Doubane \"literally wept and said you have no idea what this means to my country that America would deign to come. We didn't think you knew where we lived even,\" Power recalled. \n When she saw what just showing up meant, she said her decision to visit every mission was reinforced. \n Power said she prepares for her visits by learning as much as she can about the ambassador and the country, and she usually goes into the meetings with no agenda. \n This always surprises the ambassadors \"because they're so used to, when America comes calling we always have a list of 10 things we want,\" she said. \n \"Believe me, I have that list,\" Power said, but for the visits, which last between 30 minutes and an hour, she said her focus is on finding out how the ambassadors got to the U.N., about their country and their concerns. \n Many stories are very moving, she said, like the Bhutan ambassador who started life in a community where no one was literate. \n \"Don't get me wrong,\" Power said. \"In these courtesy calls we argue. It's not as if you park your national interests at the door. They have theirs and we have ours. But you do so on their turf.\" \n Sometimes, she said she's learned to make arguments more persuasively because she understands the country's position better and \"that will make you a better diplomat as well.\" \n Power said visiting every mission is a big investment of time, \"but I absolutely will recommend it\" to Haley, the South Carolina governor tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to succeed her. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. ambassador meets goal of visiting 189 U.N. missions"}

He soon found out that at Terminal 2, the gunman had opened fire moments earlier. And now, they were part of the second wave of panic. People who heard the reports of another round of shots ran toward Terminal 4.

Paul Dahlen. \n In recent years, Santiago had been living in Anchorage, Alaska, his brother, Bryan Santiago, told the Associated Press from Puerto Rico. Bryan Santiago said his brother's girlfriend had recently called the family to alert them to his treatment. \n In November, Esteban told FBI agents in Alaska that the government was controlling his mind and was forcing him to watch Islamic State group videos, a law enforcement official said. The official was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation by name and spoke today on condition of anonymity. \n The FBI agents notified the police after the interview with Esteban Santiago, who took him in for a mental health evaluation. \n Bryan Santiago said his brother never spoke to him directly about his medical issues. \n \"We have not talked for the past three weeks,\" Bryan Santiago said. \"That's a bit unusual \u2026 I'm in shock. He was a serious person \u2026 He was a normal person.\" \n Esteban Santiago was born in New Jersey but moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2, his brother said. He grew up in the southern coastal town of Penuelas before joining the Guard in 2007. \n Since returning from Iraq, Santiago served in the Army Reserves and the Alaska National Guard in Fairbanks. He was serving as a combat engineer in the Guard before his discharge for \"unsatisfactory performance,\" said Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead, a spokeswoman. His military rank upon discharge was E3, private 1st class, and he worked one weekend a month with an additional 15 days of training yearly, Olmstead said. \n She would not elaborate on his discharge, but the Pentagon said he'd gone AWOL several times and was demoted and discharged. \n Still, he'd had some successes during his military career, being awarded a number of medals and commendations including the Iraq Campaign Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. \n His uncle and aunt in New Jersey were trying to make sense of what they were hearing about Santiago after his arrest at the Fort Lauderdale airport.

FBI agents were also seen at the scene by neighbors. \n Santiago was flying from Anchorage on a Delta flight and had checked only one piece of luggage \u2014 the one containing the gun. \n He was involved in a number of minor court cases in Alaska, including fines for not having proof of insurance and a criminal mischief case that led to a deferred sentence.

{"date": "January 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump, left, departed a meeting at the Cond\u00e9 Nast offices at One World Trade Center in New York today. \n WASHINGTON >> After a briefing from the nation's top intelligence officials, President-elect Donald Trump said today he is confident Russians did not affect the outcome of the U.S. presidential election but he didn't say whether he now accepts the intelligence assessment that Moscow did meddle in the race. \n Trump acknowledged in a statement that \"Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people\" are consistently trying to hack U.S. networks, including the Democratic National Committee's. But his statement did not include any mention of Russia's interference in the election aimed at helping him \u2014 a conclusion that U.S. intelligence agencies have made with high confidence and presented to him this afternoon. \n Trump said \"there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\" However, allegations of Russian interference concern email hacking, not any accusations of tampering with voting machines. \n Trump in his statement said that as president he would appoint a team to develop a plan to \"aggressively combat and stop cyberattacks.\" \n Before even seeing the classified intelligence report today, Trump dismissed the assessment and told The New York Times the focus on Russia's involvement is a \"political witch hunt\" by adversaries who are embarrassed they lost the election. \"They got beaten very badly in the election,\" Trump said. \"They are very embarrassed about it. To some extent, it's a witch hunt. They just focus on this.\" \n The officials \u2014 Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey \u2014 were prepared to point to multiple motives for Moscow's alleged meddling. They briefed senior lawmakers this morning. President Barack Obama received a briefing on Thursday. \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the intelligence report presented by the officials was \"quite a stunning disclosure.\" \n A declassified version was expected to be released later today, according to one U.S. official, who wasn't authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n Several advisers joined Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence for the intelligence briefing.

McFarland and Thomas Bossert, Trump's pick for homeland security adviser. \n Since winning the presidency, Trump has repeatedly questioned U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and individual Democrats including Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. Stolen emails contained politically damaging information published by news organizations after the emails were released by WikiLeaks and other anonymously operated websites. \n Trump remained dubious about the assertion even on the eve of his intelligence briefing, asking how officials could be \"so sure\" about the hacking if they had not examined DNC servers. \n \"What is going on?\" he wrote on Twitter. \n A senior law enforcement official said the FBI in its investigation had repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the importance of obtaining direct access to servers \"only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated.\" The official said the FBI had to rely on a \"third party\" for information, but eventually got access to the material it needed. \n The Washington Post, citing anonymous U.S. officials, reported Thursday that intelligence agencies have identified parties who delivered stolen Democratic emails to WikiLeaks. The officials also said there were disparities between efforts to infiltrate Democratic and Republican networks, and said the U.S. intercepted communications in which Russian officials celebrated Trump's victory.

Scores of inmates were slain, some with their hearts and intestines ripped out, during a prison killing spree led by Brazil's largest gang, authorities said. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Heavily armed police officers walked outside the Agricultural Penitentiary of Monte Cristo, after dozens of inmates were killed, in Boa Vista, Roraima state, Brazil today. Scores of inmates were slain, some with their hearts and intestines ripped out, during a prison killing spree led by Brazil's largest gang, authorities said. \n RIO DE JANEIRO >> Thirty-three inmates were slain today in northern Brazil, some with their hearts and intestines ripped out, during a prison killing spree led by the country's largest gang, authorities said. \n The bloodshed comes just days after 60 inmates were killed during rioting at two prisons in a neighboring state and it increases fears that violence could spread, including to the streets of major cities, as gangs vie for influence and territory both inside prisons and in slums where trafficking operations are often based. \n It's also becoming a flashpoint for the government of President Michel Temer, whose administration is already struggling with an economic crisis and mounting corruption allegations. Authorities of the state of Roraima, on the border with Venezuela, said they requested help from Brazil's federal government more than once to deal with its prison crisis, but no support was sent. \n \"This is a national crisis,\" said Uziel Castro, security secretary of the state where the latest massacre happened. \n Castro said the slaying spree began around 2:30 a.m. today at the Agricultural Penitentiary of Monte Cristo in the town of Boa Vista. He said it was led by members of Sao Paulo-based First Command, Brazil's biggest criminal organization. \n He said First Command members did not attack members of a rival gang, but rather other prisoners, for motives that were not yet clear. \n \"There was no confrontation, this was a killing spree,\" said Castro. \"It was barbaric. Some were beheaded, others had their hearts or intestines ripped out.\" \n Castro said firearms were not involved, and none of the 1,500 inmates in the prison built for about 700 had escaped. \n It wasn't immediately clear whether there was a connection to the gruesome rioting earlier this week in the neighboring state of Amazonas, which officials blamed on a gang war between the First Command and Family of the North, which fight over control of prisons and drug routes in northern Brazil along the borders of Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and the Guianas. \n A police statement said officers, including a heavily armed military-like riot squad, had been deployed to the prison. \n Just as details about the latest disturbance were emerging, Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes announced measures to curb the violence. \n Moraes said federal police would be more integrated in state capitals and that special task forces would be created to more quickly process criminal charges, a measure aimed at reducing overcrowding. Moraes offered no deadlines for the initiatives but said they would \"be realistic\" given the recession in Latin America's largest economy. \n \"The situation isn't out of control,\" said Moraes. \"It's (just) another difficult situation.\" \n The rioting Sunday and Monday in Amazonas included the country's worst prison massacre since 1992, with half of the 56 slain at one institution beheaded and several others also dismembered. In another of the riots in the state, four prisoners died. \n A total of 184 inmates escaped from Amazonas prisons in the disturbances. As of Thursday afternoon, only 65 had been recaptured. \n \"The federal government needs to prepare for a worst case scenario, and that means accelerating measures to keep the situation from getting worse,\" said Col. Jose Vicente, a former national security adviser and risk consultant. \n In October, a riot at the Agricultural Penitentiary of Monte Cristo, the same where disturbances were reported today, left 10 dead. Authorities said that clash involved the First Command and Red Command, which has its base in Rio de Janeiro. On the same day, eight others were killed in a prison in the state of Rondonia, which borders Bolivia. \n After that clash, Roraima state's Castro asked the federal government for help with the prison, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. \n Castro requested that the national guard be sent in to help because the moving of prisoners deemed leaders of the rebellion had led to threats of retaliation. \n Asked about the request today, Moraes, the minister of justice, said that Roraima had requested policemen to help in patrolling Venezuelans that were entering Brazilian territory \u2014 though that is not what the letter itself stated. He acknowledged that no help had been sent. \n Moraes cancelled his trip to Roraima after Castro said the state had repeatedly asked the federal government for help and was always denied. Brazil's Justice Ministry did not offer any explanation on the decision. \n \"Criminals are trying to kill each other. What we need is the federal government help,\" said Castro. \"This is all over Brazil.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hearts, intestines ripped out in Brazil prison killing spree"}

Kealoha is expected to be present and answer questions today when the city Police Commission meets to discuss whether to fire or suspend him. \n Honolulu Police Chief Louis Kealoha has agreed to retire in the wake of a federal corruption investigation, ending a 33-year career on the police force. \n The decision was announced early this afternoon by Police Commission Chairman Max Sword at the Honolulu Police Department's Beretania Street headquarters after a closed-door meeting on the chief's fate. Sword said the seven-member commission, which has the authority to hire and fire the chief, came to \"an agreement in principle\" with Kealoha on his retirement. \n A police spokeswoman said Kealoha was not at today's closed-door meeting as was expected. \n \"We are working the details out and we'll have the final approval by the commission on the meeting on \u2026 Jan. 18,\" Sword said after the hour-long meeting. \n Kealoha was a captain in 2009 when he was picked by the commission to replace Boisse Correa as chief of the 2,000-officer force. After contentious relations between Correa and the State of Hawaii Organization of Police Officers, SHOPO leaders applauded Kealoha's selection. \n Sword spoke with reporters outside the building with Corporation Counsel Donna Leong, the city's top civil attorney, standing next to him. She did not address the media. \n Sword thanked the chief for his more than 30 years with HPD, adding that the commission wished \"him well in his retirement.\" \n Kealoha has been the subject of a lengthy federal grand jury investigation into alleged wrongdoing and corruption. On Dec. 20, Kealoha placed himself on \"restriction of police authority\" status shortly after the FBI sent him a letter informing him that he was the target of a criminal investigation. \n The commission discussed Kealoha's fate in executive session for more than two hours Wednesday before deciding to recess. Sword told reporters afterward that he and his colleagues wanted time to gather additional information but he declined to provide specifics. \n On Wednesday, the commission affirmed his \"on leave\" status and made it indefinite. Deputy Chief Cary Okimoto has been acting chief since then. Okimoto has 32 years with HPD and served as its deputy chief for administrative operations since 2015. \n After Sword's announcement today, HPD issued a written statement, saying, \"Under the leadership of Acting Chief Cary Okimoto, HPD will work to ensure seamless continuity of the essential functions that make Honolulu one of the safest major cities in the country. The safety and security of our community has always been, and will continue to be, HPD's top priority.\" \n Attorney Myles Breiner, who has represented Kealoha on the criminal allegations against him, referred questions to Kevin Sumida, who is providing the chief with legal counsel on civil matters including the settlement that is leading to his retirement. \n \"I'm disappointed that the chief retired but I understand why,\" Breiner said by telephone after Sword's announcement. \"I support his decision; it still preserves the integrity of the Police Department. There's been no admission or acknowledgement of any wrongdoing whatsoever because there's been no wrongdoing.\" \n Sumida could not immediately be reached for comment. \n Four other HPD officers also were put on \"restriction of police authority,\" or ROPA, status as a result of receiving similar letters. Their names have not been disclosed by the department. \n A federal grand jury has been looking into corruption and other wrongdoing at HPD stemming from the theft of the mailbox at Kealoha's Kahala home. The chief and his wife, Katherine Kealoha, a city prosecutor, are widely believed to be at the center of the investigation. \n In June, the Kealohas filed a lawsuit against the city Ethics Commission claiming that former Executive Director Chuck Totto and commission staff unfairly investigated them. \n It's unclear whether the terms of the retirement settlement will affect those matters. \n Mayor Kirk Caldwell, who was ill and out of the office today, issued a statement thanking Kealoha for his years of service and the commission \"for taking decisive action on this matter.\" \n \"I believe the Commission made the right decision to accept Chief Kealoha's retirement, and he made the correct decision for the sake of the police department and the thousands of officers who serve with integrity, respect and fairness,\" the mayor said, adding, \"Today's announcement allows the Honolulu Police Department to move forward.\" \n SHOPO president Tenari Ma'afala, a 32-year police veteran who has known Kealoha since before their time at HPD, said he respects the chief's decision. \n \"If you ask me, and this is not indicative of his decision, if I was in his shoes, and I knew for certain I didn't do anything wrong, I would leave on my terms,\" Ma'afala said, stressing that he did not know if Kealoha left voluntarily or not. \n \"For selfish reasons, I hate to see him leave,\" he said, adding that he hopes Kealoha's actions reflect what's best for his family. \n During the public portion of Wednesday's commission meeting, several people urged the commission members to reconsider their decision to hold the Kealoha discussion behind closed doors. But commission members said they wanted to go into executive session with its attorneys to discuss the personnel matter. \n ", "author": "By Gordon Y.K.

{"date": "January 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A shooting victim was unloaded from an emergency vehicle and taken to Broward Health Trauma Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. today. Authorities said multiple people have died after a lone suspect opened fire at the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, international airport. \n GOOGLE MAPS \n Ft. Lauderdale International Airport \n FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. >> An Army veteran who complained that the government was controlling his mind drew a gun from his checked luggage on arrival at the Fort Lauderdale airport and opened fire in the baggage claim area today, killing five people and wounding eight, authorities said. \n He was taken into custody after throwing his empty weapon down and lying spread-eagle on the ground, one witness said. \n \"People started kind of screaming and trying to get out of any door they could or hide under the chairs,\" the witness, Mark Lea, told MSNBC. \"He just kind of continued coming in, just randomly shooting at people, no rhyme or reason to it.\" \n The gunman was identified as 26-year-old Esteban Santiago of Anchorage, Alaska, who served in Iraq with the National Guard but was demoted and discharged last year for unsatisfactory performance. His brother said he had been receiving psychological treatment recently. \n A law enforcement official told The Associated Press that Santiago had walked into the FBI office in Anchorage in November to say that the U.S. government was controlling his mind and making him watch Islamic State videos. \n Agents questioned an agitated and disjointed-sounding Santiago and then called police, who took him for a mental health evaluation, according to the official, who was not authorized to discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n FBI agent George Piro, who is in charge of the Miami field office, confirmed that Santiago had come into the Anchorage office and clearly indicated at the time that he was not intent on hurting anyone. \n Authorities said the motive for the attack was under investigation. Shortly after the shooting, and before details of Santiago's mental health became public, Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said that it remained to be seen whether it was terrorism or the work of \"someone who is mentally deranged.\" \n Piro said authorities are looking at leads in several states and have not ruled out terrorism. \"We're looking at every angle, including the terrorism angle,\" he said \n Santiago, who is in federal custody, will face federal charges and is expected to appear in court Monday, Piro said. \n One witness said the attacker gunned down his victims without a word and kept shooting until he ran out of ammunition for his handgun, sending panicked travelers running out of the terminal and spilling onto the tarmac, baggage in hand. \n Others hid in bathroom stalls or crouched behind cars or anything else they could find as police and paramedics rushed in to help the wounded and establish whether there were any other gunmen. \n Bruce Hugon, who had flown in from Indianapolis for a vacation, was at the baggage carousel when he heard four or five pops and saw everyone drop down on the ground. He said a woman next to him tried to get up and was shot in the head. \n \"The guy must have been standing over me at one point. I could smell the gunpowder,\" he said. \"I thought I was about to feel a piercing pain or nothing at all because I would have been dead.\" \n It is legal for airline passengers to travel with guns and ammunition as long as the firearms are put in a checked bag \u2014 not a carry-on \u2014 and are unloaded and locked in a hard-sided container. Guns must be declared to the airline at check-in. \n Santiago arrived in Fort Lauderdale after taking off from Anchorage aboard a Delta flight Thursday night, checking only one piece of luggage \u2014 his gun, said Jesse Davis, police chief at the Anchorage airport. \n At Fort Lauderdale, \"after he claimed his bag, he went into the bathroom and loaded the gun and started shooting. We don't know why,\" said Chip LaMarca, a Broward County commissioner who was briefed by investigators. \n The bloodshed is likely to raise questions of whether aviation safety officials need to change the rules. \n The attack also exposed another weak point in airport security: While travelers have to take off their shoes, put their carry-on luggage through X-ray machines and pass through metal detectors to reach the gates, many other sections of airports, such as ticket counters and baggage claim areas, are more lightly secured and more vulnerable to attack. \n In 2013, a gunman with a grudge against the Transportation Security Administration shot and killed one of the agency's screeners and wounded three others during a rampage at Los Angeles International Airport. Last November, an airline worker was shot and killed near an employee parking lot at Oklahoma City's airport, and in 2015 a machete-wielding man was shot to death after he attacked federal security officers at the New Orleans airport. \n \"The fact is that wherever there are crowds, such as at our airports, we remain vulnerable to these types of attacks,\" Nelson said. \n The Fort Lauderdale gunman said nothing as he \"went up and down the carousels of the baggage claim, shooting through luggage to get at people that were hiding,\" according to Lea. The killer went through about three magazines before running out of ammunition, Lea said. \n \"He threw the gun down and laid spread-eagle on the ground until the officer came up to him,\" Lea said. \n The gunman was arrested unharmed, with no shots fired by law enforcement officers, and was being questioned by the FBI, Sheriff Scott Israel said. \n Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said 30 to 40 people were injured \u2014 scrapes, bruises and broken bones \u2014 after the shooting. \n The condition of the wounded was not disclosed. At least one of the victims was seen lying in a pool of blood with what appeared to be a head wound. \n The airport was shut down, with incoming flights diverted and outgoing flights held on the ground. Airport Director Mark Gale said it will try to reopen at 5 a.m. Saturday but urged travelers to check with their individual airlines on flight status. He said 10,000 of the airport's stranded travelers were being bused overnight to the city's spacious Port Everglades cruise ship terminal. \n President Barack Obama was briefed by his Homeland Security adviser, the White House said. President-elect Donald Trump said that it is a \"disgraceful situation that's happening in our country and throughout the world\" and that it was too soon to say whether it was a terrorist attack. \n Santiago's brother, Bryan, told the AP that his brother had been receiving psychological treatment in Alaska. He said Santiago's girlfriend alerted the family to the situation in recent months. Bryan Santiago said that he didn't know what his brother was being treated for and that they never talked about it. \n He said Esteban Santiago was born in New Jersey and moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2. He was sent to Iraq in 2010 and spent a year there with the 130th Engineer Battalion, according to Puerto Rico National Guard spokesman Maj. Paul Dahlen. He later joined the Alaska National Guard. \n The Pentagon said Santiago had gone AWOL several times during his stint with the Alaska National Guard and was demoted \u2014 from specialist to private first class \u2014 and given a general discharge, which is lower than an honorable discharge. \n John Schilcher told Fox News he came up to the baggage claim and heard the first gunshot as he picked up his bag off a carousel. \n \"The person next to me fell to the ground and then I started hearing other pops. And as this happened, other people started falling and you could hear it and smell it, and people on either side of me were going down and I just dropped to the ground,\" said Schilcher, who was there with his wife and mother-in-law. \"The firing just went on and on.\" \n \"I was down on the floor. When we finally looked up there was a policeman standing over me,\" he said. \"That's when I assumed it was safe.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "5 dead, 8 injured in shooting at Florida airport"}

{"date": "January 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n From left to right: Tesfaye Cooper, Brittany Covington, Tanishia Covington and Jordan Hill. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson spoke during a news conference, Thursday, on the hate crime and other charges filed against four individuals for an attack on a man that was captured on a Facebook video. \n CHICAGO >> The two teens had been schoolmates, police said. After meeting in suburban Chicago, they spent two days together, driving around visiting friends. Then a pretend fight between them escalated into a real beating, and the attack on a mentally disabled teenager stirred racial tensions after being broadcast on Facebook Live. \n Authorities say four black people assaulted the white suburban teenager, threatening him with a knife and taunting him with profanities against white people and President-elect Donald Trump. The suspects were charged Thursday with hate crimes, kidnapping and battery. They were to make their first court appearance today. \n The beating was captured on cellphone video by one of the assailants and has since been viewed millions of times on social media. \n \"This should never have happened,\" David Boyd, the victim's brother-in-law, said at a brief news conference in suburban Chicago. He said the victim was traumatized but doing as well as could be expected. \n Neal Strom, a family spokesman, told The Associated Press the victim has had \"profound emotional and physical disabilities throughout his life.\" He did not elaborate. \n Police said drug use may have been involved in the incident. The video shows the two female suspects smoking what authorities \"presume to be blunts,\" a term often used for a marijuana-filled cigar. While the victim was tied up, his attackers used racial slurs and made references \"to his mental capacity,\" Chicago Police Commander Kevin Duffin said. \n The uproar over the beating intensified the glare on Chicago after a bloody year of violent crime and protests against Mayor Rahm Emanuel and a police department that has been accused of using excessive force and hushing-up wrongdoing. The department has also been the subject of a long civil-rights investigation by the Justice Department, which is expected to report its findings soon. \n The incident also stirred emotions still raw after a presidential election campaign that split the nation. The case heightened political tensions on social media, with some conservatives suggesting it was linked to the Black Lives Matter movement. Police said there was no indication of any connection. \n The cruelty of the attack and the intense social media exposure prompted President Barack Obama to respond, calling it \"despicable.\" \n \"I take these things very seriously,\" he told Chicago's WBBM-TV on Thursday. But he said the assault does not mean that race relations have gotten worse. \n \"We see visuals of racial tensions, violence and so forth because of smartphones and the internet and media \u2026 a lot of the problems that have been there a long time,\" he said. \n Chicago police initially said the youth was singled out because he has \"special needs,\" not because he was white. But authorities later said the charges resulted from both the suspects' use of racial slurs and their references to the victim's disability. \n Cook County prosecutors identified the suspects as Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, both of Chicago, and Jordan Hill, of suburban Carpentersville. All are 18. A fourth suspect was identified as Covington's 24-year-old sister, Tanishia Covington, also of Chicago. \n Two of the suspects were arrested as juveniles on armed robbery and other serious charges. \n Hill was arrested in 2015 on allegations of armed robbery, possession of a stolen vehicle and residential burglary. Chicago police said they did not know the disposition of those arrests by suburban officers. \n Tanishia Covington was arrested in 2007 on attempted armed robbery and aggravated battery charges. Police records do not show any convictions as a juvenile. As an adult, she was arrested on charges of battery and aggravated assault, but those charges were dropped. \n Excerpts of the video posted by Chicago media outlets show the victim with his mouth taped shut and slumped in a corner of a room. At least two assailants are seen cutting off his sweatshirt, and others taunt him off camera. The video shows a wound on the top of the man's head. One person pushes the man's head with his or her foot. \n A red band also appears to be around the victim's hands. He was tied up for four to five hours, authorities said. \n The incident began New Year's Eve, when the victim and alleged assailant Jordan Hill met at a suburban McDonald's to begin what both the victim and his parents believed would be a sleepover, police said. \n Instead, Hill drove the victim around in a stolen van for a couple of days, ending up at a home in Chicago, where two of the other suspects lived, Detective Commander Kevin Duffin said. \n The victim told police what began as playful fighting escalated. A downstairs neighbor who heard noises threatened to call police. When two of the suspects left and kicked down the neighbor's door, the victim escaped. A police officer later spotted the bloodied and obviously disoriented man wandering down a street. \n The victim's parents reported him missing Monday evening, two days after last hearing from him. The police report said the victim's mother knew the first name of her son's friend \u2014 Jordan \u2014 but wasn't clear on his last name. The report also noted that the victim \"does not like telling his parents who he's with.\" \n The parents later received text messages \"from persons claiming to be holding him captive,\" police said. While investigating the messages, police discovered the Facebook video. \n The grandmother of Brittany Covington said the granddaughter she raised from infancy is \"not this person.\" \n \"I'm so upset, my head is about to bust open,\" said Priscilla Covington of Chicago. \"I don't know if someone influenced her. \u2026 She had her ups and down.

{"date": "January 6, 2017", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The makeup of President-elect Donald Trump's trade team suggests he wasn't joking when he promised voters to shake things up. \n On the campaign trail, Trump portrayed an America that has been shortchanged by bad trade deals and unscrupulous trading partners, leading to the hollowing out of the nation's manufacturing sector. He promised to label China a currency manipulator and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. \n Since the election, Trump has taken aim at individual companies, warning General Motors Co. this week that it could face a \"big border tax\" if it doesn't shift production to the U.S. from Mexico. And the track records of his top trade officials signal that his administration will take aggressive steps to boost exports, according to trade experts. \n \"It's clear this wasn't just campaign rhetoric. The team that the president-elect has put in place was at the core of advising him during the campaign and has a clear playbook of what it wants to implement,\" said Mark Wu, an assistant professor at Harvard Law School who worked in the office of the U.S. trade representative under George Bush. \"They've been pretty straightforward about their view of the status quo, which is that it undermines American economic interests.\" \n Chinese state media have already criticized all three key players in Trump's trade team as supporters of rolling back globalization, warning the incoming administration about the risks of sparking a trade war. \n Robert Lighthizer, appointee for U.S. trade representative \n Trump this week nominated Lighthizer as his chief trade negotiator. Lighthizer, 69, was deputy trade representative under Ronald Reagan, and is now a partner in the Washington offices of law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. He has extensive experience representing the U.S. steel industry, which has frequently accused China of dumping cheap products in world markets. In a 2011 article published in The Washington Times, Lighthizer said that using tariffs to promote American industry was a Republican tenet harking back to the party's roots. \"How does allowing China to constantly rig trade in its favor advance the core conservative goal of making markets more efficient?\" he wrote. He'll face Senate confirmation. \n Wilbur Ross, Commerce secretary nominee \n Ross, 79, is a veteran private-equity investor who has served on the board of companies ranging from Luxembourg-based steel giant ArcelorMittal to the Bank of Ireland. He also happens to be an avid collector of Chinese art, according to a recent profile in Politico Magazine. Before the election, Ross decried what he perceived to be a penchant toward China bashing in the U.S. But during the campaign, he co-authored an unflattering report that described the world as \"riddled with trade cheaters,\" with China the biggest culprit. The Senate must approve his appointment. \n Peter Navarro, head of White House National Trade Council \n Ross's co-author on that report was Navarro, an economics professor at University of California, Irvine who has been a vocal critic of China's trade practices. As the head of a newly formed trade council inside the White House, Navarro will be an influential voice on everything from how the U.S. deals with China to the way it taxes its corporations. Navarro, 67, has blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement and China's 2001 entry into the WTO for hobbling the U.S. economy. He directed a documentary called \"Death By China: One Lost Job At a Time\" based on a book he co-authored. \n \"They see trade as a zero-sum game,\" said Daniel Ikenson, director of trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a free-market think tank in Washington. \"It's Team America against the foreign team, with exports as Team America's points and imports as the foreign team's points.\" \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "Trump's trade team suggests his tough campaign talk was no bluff"}

{"date": "January 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This Sept. 17, 2015, image made from video provided by NOAA Fisheries, shows a fish farm off the shore of Hawaii island near Kona. \n  As traditional commercial fishing is threatening fish populations worldwide, U.S. officials are working on a plan to expand fish farming into federal waters around the Pacific Ocean. \n The government sees the move toward aquaculture as a promising solution to overfishing and feeding a hungry planet. But some environmentalists say the industrial-scale farms could do more harm than good to overall fish stocks and ocean health. \n The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is creating a plan to manage commercial fish farms in federal waters, the area of ocean from three to 200 miles offshore, around Hawaii and other Pacific islands. \n The program is similar to one recently implemented by NOAA in the Gulf of Mexico. The farms in the Gulf and the Pacific would be the only aquaculture operations in U.S. federal waters, though there are smaller operations in state waters close to shore. \n Fish farming has been practiced for centuries in Hawaii and around the world. But modern aquaculture, some environmentalists say, carries pollution risks and the potential for non-native farmed fish to escape and enter the natural ecosystem. \n Most shellfish consumed in America comes from farms, and their methods are widely considered sustainable. However, some farms that grow carnivorous fish such as salmon have raised concerns about sustainability because they use wild-caught fish to feed the captive species. \n There are three ways to farm fish: fully contained land-based systems that pump water in and out with little, if any, environmental impact; near-shore operations incorporating natural and man-made elements; and off-shore farms. \n Former NOAA chief scientist and founder of ocean advocacy group Mission Blue Sylvia Earle said there are more environmentally sustainable and economically viable options than open-ocean aquaculture, which uses huge floating net-pens or submerged cages. \"We have to make a choice with aquaculture,\" she said. \"Is our goal to feed a large number of people? Or is our goal to create or to serve a luxury market?\" \n Last year, NOAA and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography put an economic value of $17 billion a year on the ocean off the west coasts of North and South America. That includes $4.3 billion from commercial and sport fishing and $12.9 billion for the capture of carbon. \n Earle said the ocean is worth more, and no dollar figure can be attached to keeping the ocean, and in turn humans, healthy. \"We now have recognition of other values of the ocean beyond what we can extract either for food or for products,\" she said. \n New technologies are being developed for open-ocean aquaculture, and many U.S. companies are sending their crews overseas to farm, according to NOAA officials. \n \"The U.S.'s view is we'd rather have these U.S. companies pursuing these opportunities in a sustainable, environmentally sound way in the U.S.,\" said Michael Tosatto, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service regional administrator. \n The NOAA plan would create a regulatory and permitting scheme for the industry. \"It's reasonably common knowledge that the environmental laws are less where aquaculture occurs the most, (that) being China and other Southeast Asia countries,\" Tosatto said. \n Many foreign operations have U.S. companies supplying the breed stock, then the fish are grown and sold back to the U.S. as imported seafood. U.S.-farmed fish in 2014 was valued at $1.3 billion, Tosatto said, and constitutes 19 percent of the nation's seafood production. \n That amounts to only 1 percent of the global farmed product. \n NOAA has been trying to establish an aquaculture industry in federal waters for many years. But attempts to get legislation to implement open-sea aquaculture have failed. \n \"And so (NOAA) moved into the fishery management process \u2026 as a means to move forward with ocean aquaculture under the radar of the public,\" said Marianne Cufone, executive director of the Recirculating Farms Coalition. NOAA received input from thousands of people during a public comment period last year on its plans. \n Cufone's New Orleans-based organization has been developing land-based aquaculture systems that are fully contained. Cufone says these types of farms are more sustainable than ocean aquaculture, and Earle agrees. \n \"Controlled systems are the most promising,\" Earle said. \"I personally am wary of the open ocean approach to aquaculture.\" \n Meanwhile, NOAA says researchers off Hawaii's Big Island are studying ways to make open ocean farming safe and efficient. They are studying different techniques and species to better understand probelms the industry could face. \n Native Hawaiians have long practiced sustainable aquaculture. They build walls around shoreline areas, allowing fresh water from the mountains and salt water from the ocean to flow in and out. Fish enter through slotted gates, and can't get back out. The ponds are monitored to make sure they are healthy, mimicking nature. \n \"Our ancestors, they could \u2026 sustainably feed themselves no problem,\" said Luka Mossman, a Native Hawaiian who grew up working on a traditional fish pond and is now helping study and restore such ponds with the nonprofit environmental group Conservation International. \n \"You constantly watch how the natural system works, and you adapt to that. You don't try and adapt the natural system to work for you,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "NOAA plans to open federal waters in Pacific to fish farming"}
