{"date": "January 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A woman wore a mask as she walked past a construction site as smog choked Beijing on Friday. \n BEIJING >> Officials in Beijing have announced a new environmental police squad to root out illegal burning, the latest government response to the widespread public anger over China's persistent problems with smog. \n Beijing's acting mayor, Cai Qi, said at a meeting today that the force would target open-air barbecues, garbage incineration and the burning of wood and other biomass, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. \n Cai announced several other measures today, including a target of cutting the use of coal by 30 percent in 2017 to shutting down 500 higher-polluting factories and upgrading 2,500 more. About 300,000 high-pollution vehicles will also be restricted from entering the city starting next month, he said. \n Beijing and dozens of cities in China spend many winter days under a thick, gray haze, with air pollution levels that routinely exceed World Health Organization guidelines. Beijing spent part of last week under an \"orange alert,\" the second-highest level in China's four-tiered air alert system. More than 20 cities were on the highest \"red alert.\" \n Smog is an acutely felt issue in China's cities, where a \"red alert\" can lead to the closure of schools and businesses, flight cancellations, and shutdowns of highways to keep cars off the roads. During a red alert in Beijing last month, authorities banned construction crews from spray-painting and even seized the charcoal grills from some restaurants. \n But enforcement remains an issue. China's environmental ministry said during last week's red alert that its inspection teams found companies resuming production despite a government ban. Many factories remain under severe pressure to meet production targets regardless of air pollution. \n Cai on Saturday blamed polluting activities like burning garbage or wood on \"the result of lax supervision and weak law enforcement.\" \n But China's pollution is caused chiefly by its thousands of coal-burning factories and a surplus of older, inefficient vehicles. While it tries to answer the loud public calls to tamp down on pollution, China's Communist government is also grappling with an economic slowdown and the challenge of maintaining growth. \n China is also the world's largest producer and consumer of coal, and measures like capping production days or shutting down older coal mines run the risk of driving up energy prices and further slowing the economy. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Choked by smog, Beijing creates new environmental police"}

{"date": "January 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Bryan Santiago spoke about his brother Esteban, a man accused of shooting five people at a Florida airport on Friday, in Penuelas, Puerto Rico, today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This booking photo provided by the Broward Sheriff's Office shows suspect Esteban Ruiz Santiago, 26, today in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \n PENUELAS, Puerto Rico >> The brother of a man accused of killing five people at a Florida airport questioned Saturday why his brother was allowed to keep his gun after U.S. authorities knew he'd become increasingly paranoid and was hearing voices. \n Esteban Santiago, 26, had trouble controlling his anger after serving in Iraq and told his brother that he felt he was being chased and controlled by the CIA through secret online messages. When he told agents at an FBI field office his paranoid thoughts in November, he was evaluated for four days, then released without any follow-up medication or therapy. \n \"The FBI failed there,\" Bryan Santiago told The Associated Press. \"We're not talking about someone who emerged from anonymity to do something like this.\" \n Speaking in Spanish outside his family's house in Penuelas, the brother said: \"The federal government already knew about this for months, they had been evaluating him for a while, but they didn't do anything.\" \n Bryan Santiago said he noted that his brother was behaving differently when he returned from Iraq. \n \"He sometimes couldn't control his anger,\" he said. \"You could tell something had changed.\" \n Bryan Santiago said that when he went to visit his brother in Alaska last August, he said Santiago told him he was hearing voices and felt he was being chased. \n Authorities in Alaska on Saturday defended their interactions with Esteban Santiago. FBI Special Agent in Charge Marlin Ritzman told a news conference that Santiago broke no laws when he walked into the Anchorage FBI office \"making disjointed comments about mind control.\" He characterized Santiago as a \"walk-in complaint,\" which he said offices around the country receive daily. \n Anchorage police were called to the office by the agency, told Santiago he was having \"terroristic thoughts\" and believed he was being influenced by the so-called Islamic State group and was taken to a mental health facility, city Police Chief Chris Tolley said. Santiago had left a gun and his newborn child in his vehicle when he went to the FBI office. Police held the gun until Santiago was released and contacted him about picking up the weapon, which he did on Dec. 8, Tolley said. \n Authorities would not confirm whether he used the same gun Friday. \"There is speculation that it is the same gun. I have not received confirmation that it, in fact, is that gun,\" Tolley said. \n In recent years, Esteban Santiago \u2014 a new dad \u2014 had been living in Anchorage. But there were signs of trouble. \n He was charged in a domestic violence case in January 2016, damaging a door when he forced his way into a bathroom at his girlfriend's Anchorage home. The woman told officers he yelled at her to leave, choked her and smacked her on the side of the head, according to charging documents. \n A month later, municipal prosecutors said he violated the conditions of his release when officers found him at her home during a routine check. He told police he had lived there since he was released from custody the previous month. His Anchorage attorney, Max Holmquist, declined to discuss his client. \n Tolley detailed other complaints of physical disturbances last year involving Santiago but said officers either found no probable cause for arrest or were told by the city prosecutor not to arrest him. \n Bryan Santiago said his brother had requested psychological help but barely received any. \n \"I told him to go to church or to seek professional help,\" he said. \n Family members have said Esteban Santiago changed after serving a yearlong tour in Iraq. He was born in New Jersey but moved to Puerto Rico when he was 2, his brother said. He grew up in Penuelas before joining the Guard in 2007. \n He deployed in 2010 as part of the Puerto Rico National Guard, spending a year with an engineering battalion, according to Guard spokesman Maj. Paul Dahlen. \n Esteban Santiago's mother wiped tears from her eyes as she stood inside a screen door Saturday. She said her son had been tremendously affected by seeing a bomb explode near two friends while serving in Iraq. \n Alaska National Guard spokeswoman Lt. Col. Candis Olmstead told The New York Times that two soldiers in Santiago's company had died during his stint in Iraq. \n Former neighbor Ursula Candelario in Penuelas recalled seeing Esteban Santiago grow up and said people used to salute him after he joined the Guard. \"He was very peaceful, very educated, very serious,\" she said. \"We're in shock. I couldn't believe it.\" \n Since returning from Iraq, Santiago served in the Army Reserves and the Alaska National Guard in Anchorage, Olmstead told AP. He was serving as a combat engineer in the Guard before his discharge for \"unsatisfactory performance.\" His military rank upon discharge was E3, private 1st class, and he worked one weekend a month with an additional 15 days of training yearly, Olmstead said. \n She would not elaborate on his discharge. The Pentagon said he went AWOL several times and was demoted and discharged. \n While it is unclear if Esteban Santiago had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, as many as one in five veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan develop the affliction each year, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. A 2014 Veterans Affairs study found that almost 30 percent of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan who sought treatment at VA hospitals were diagnosed with PTSD symptoms. \n His uncle and aunt in New Jersey were trying to make sense of what they were hearing about Santiago. FBI agents arrived at their house to question them on Friday. \n Maria Ruiz told The Record newspaper that her nephew had recently become a father to a son and was struggling. \n \"It was like he lost his mind,\" she said in Spanish of his return from Iraq. \"He said he saw things.\" \n Santiago was flying from Anchorage on a Delta flight and had checked only one piece of luggage, which contained the gun. \n Puerto Rico Sen. Nelson Cruz, who knew the family and represents the town where they live, said he had been talking regularly with Bryan Santiago since the shooting. \n \"They're very humble and very Christian people,\" Cruz said. \"They want to tell the families of the victims that they're extremely saddened and extremely upset by what happened.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Brother of airport shooting suspect says U.S. government failed him"}

On Saturday, guests packed into the restaurant with floor-to-ceiling windows or hunkered down in their cabins, enjoying the calm ahead of the massive storm. \n \"All of our rooms have fire places going and our guests are just hunkered down,\" Geanides said. \"When we have storms like this there is a certain romantic element and our guests take advantage of it.\" \n This storm is expected to bring as much as 15 inches of rain in some Northern California foothills communities in a very short time. No storm in the foothills the last 15 years has produced that much rain in three days, according to the National Climatic Data Center. \n This stormy weather comes as California enters its sixth year of drought. Each storm is welcomed, but officials say several more like this are needed to replenish depleted groundwater supplies. \n The strong wet season began in October with more rain falling than in three decades, mostly in Northern California. Los Angeles is experiencing the wettest winter in six years, forecasters say. \n Forecasters anticipate the storm surge stretching from Hawaii in the Pacific \u2014 called an atmospheric river \u2014 could dump up to 8 inches of rain from Sonoma to Monterey counties. \n The storm's mild temperatures will drive up the snowline to above 9,000 feet throughout the Sierra Nevada, causing runoff in the lower elevations, said Zach Tolby, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Reno. \n \"This is a classic set up for us for flooding,\" Tolby said. \"We're definitely expecting a very wet weekend.\" \n Flooding could rival the winter of 2005-2006 that sent 5 feet of water into the Sparks industrial area made up of warehouses and manufacturing plants. Crews worked to secure storage drums filled with hazardous materials to stop them from floating away as they have in past floods. \n Rangers at Yosemite National Park closed all roads leading to the park's valley floor, a major attraction for visitors from around the world eager to view gushing waterfalls and gaze up at towering granite rock formations such as El Capitan and Half Dome. \n A huge storm in 1997 flooded Yosemite Valley, closing the park for two months and washing out roads, lodging and campgrounds. This weekend's storm is not expected to be quite that severe. \n The closure is expected at least through Sunday. Other parts of the park remain open, but rangers caution visitors to be aware of ice and falling debris on the roads. \n Photographer and rock climber Josh Hilling who lives in the foothills below the park, spent recent days chopping wood and stocking up on groceries. \n \"If you live long enough in this canyon, you experience lots of natural disasters \u2014 floods, fires, rock falls,\" Hilling said Friday from his family's home in El Portal. \n The Truckee River, which flows from Lake Tahoe through Reno, is forecast to rise to its highest point in more than a decade, according to the weather service, which has issued a flood warning. \n Another storm is forecast for next week and with the ground already saturated rain won't seep into the soil quickly enough and extra runoff could end up in already swollen rivers and creeks. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Steady rain, gusty winds sweep over Northern California"}

{"date": "January 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A part of the declassified version Intelligence Community Assessment on Russia's efforts to interfere with the U.S. political process is photographed in Washington. \n NEW YORK >> President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that \"only 'stupid' people or fools\" would dismiss closer ties with Russia, and he seemed unswayed after his classified briefing on an intelligence report that accused Moscow of meddling on his behalf in the election that catapulted him to power. \n \"Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing,\" Trump said in a series of tweets. \n He added, \"We have enough problems without yet another one,\" and said Russians would respect \"us far more\" under his administration than they do with Barack Obama in the White House. \n Trump repeatedly has questioned the assessment by American intelligence agencies that the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 election, and a classified report presented to him Friday seemed to have little changed his thinking. \n The report explicitly tied Russian President Vladimir Putin to election meddling and said that Moscow had a \"clear preference\" for Republican Trump in his race against Democrat Hillary Clinton. \n But Trump tweeted that with the many global issues confronting the United States, it doesn't need testy ties with Russia on the list. \"Only 'stupid' people, or fools, would think that it is bad\" to have a good relationship, he said, and suggested his approach might allow the adversaries to work together to solve \"some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!\" \n Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only \"stupid\" people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We\u2026.. \n have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and\u2026. \n both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD! \n Even as intelligences officials looked back in their reports on the election, they also made a troublesome prediction: Russia isn't done intruding in U.S. politics and policymaking. \n Immediately after the Nov. 8 election, Russia began a \"spear-phishing\" campaign to try to trick people into revealing their email passwords, targeting U.S. government employees and think tanks that specialize in national security, defense and foreign policy, the report said. \n The report was the most detailed public account to date of Russian efforts to hack the email accounts of the Democratic National Committee and individual Democrats, among them Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta. \n The unclassified version said Russian government provided emails to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks even though the website's founder, Julian Assange, has denied that it got the emails it released from the Russian government. The report noted that the emails could have been passed through middlemen. \n Russia also used state-funded propaganda and paid \"trolls\" to make nasty comments on social media services, the report said. Moreover, intelligence officials believe that Moscow will apply lessons learned from its activities in the election to put its thumbprint on future elections in the United States and allied nations. \n The public report was minus classified details that intelligence officials shared with President Barack Obama on Thursday. \n In a brief interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Trump said he \"learned a lot\" from his discussions with intelligence officials, but he declined to say whether he accepted their assertion that Russia had intruded in the election on his behalf. \n After finally seeing the intelligence behind the claims of the outgoing Obama administration, Trump released a one-page statement that did not address whether Russia sought to meddle. Instead, he said, \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election\" and that there \"was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\" \n Intelligence officials have never made that claim. And the report stated that the Department of Homeland Security did not think that the systems that were targeted or compromised by Russian actors were \"involved in vote tallying.\" \n The report released publicly lacked details about how the U.S. learned what it said it knows, such as any intercepted conversations or electronic messages among Russian leaders, including Putin, or about specific hacker techniques or digital tools the U.S. may have traced back to Russia in its investigations. Exactly how the U.S. monitors its adversaries in cyberspace is a closely guarded secret. Revealing such details could help foreign governments further obscure their activities. \n The unclassified version included footnotes acknowledging that it \"does not include the full supporting information on key elements of the influence campaign.\" It said its conclusions were identical to the classified version, which was more detailed. \n The unclassified report said the Russian effort was both political and personal. \n \"Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency,\" it said. \"We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\" \n Putin most likely wanted to discredit Clinton because he blames her for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he resents her for disparaging comments she has made about him, the report said. \n Before the intelligence agencies completed their assessment, Obama announced sanctions against Russia. Trump has not said whether he will undo them once he takes office, but lawmakers are calling for more punitive measures against Russia and have little to no appetite to roll back any current sanctions. \n Trump said he would appoint a team within three months of taking office to develop a plan to \"aggressively combat and stop cyberattacks.\" \n On Saturday, he said he wanted retired Sen. Dan Coats to be national intelligence director, describing the former member of the Senate Intelligence Committee as the right person to lead the new administration's \"ceaseless vigilance against those who seek to do us harm.\" \n Coats, in a statement released by Trump's transition team, said: \"There is no higher priority than keeping America safe, and I will utilize every tool at my disposal to make that happen.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump: Only 'stupid' people, fools oppose better Russia ties"}

Gov.-elect Cyrus Habib, right, holds the gavel as he stands at the Senate chamber dais next to Senate Counsel Jeannie Gorrell, left, Thursday, Jan. 5, 2017, during a practice session to test technical equipment in Olympia, Wash. \n OLYMPIA, Wash. >> As Washington state prepares to swear in its first blind lieutenant governor, the Senate has undergone a makeover that incorporates Braille into that chamber's floor sessions. \n On a recent day just weeks before the start of the legislative session that begins Monday, the desks of 49 senators got an upgrade: a system that will allow Lt. Gov.-elect Cyrus Habib to know by the touch of his finger which lawmaker is seeking to be recognized to speak. \n \"I'm really excited to show the public, particularly school children, that anything is possible,\" Habib said Thursday, just hours after testing the system out. \n Habib, a 35-year-old attorney who completely lost his eyesight to cancer at age 8, was first elected to the state House in 2012 and won a state Senate seat in 2014. In November he beat Republican Marty McClendon to replace Lt. Gov. Brad Owen, a Democrat who is retiring after holding the post since 1997. Habib will be sworn in on Wednesday. \n The second highest position in the state, the lieutenant governor is best known as the president of the Senate and presides over that chamber during the legislative sessions, ensuring that protocol is followed and weighing in on parliamentary questions that arise during debate. \n Change comes slowly to the Washington state Senate \u2014 often called the more deliberative body \u2014 where voice votes are still conducted instead of the more expedient electronic vote system the House employs. \n But because the lieutenant governor is charged with controlling the Senate debate, Habib will make the call on who to recognize first when a parliamentary motion is made, or a request to speak on a bill. Usually a lawmaker jumps up out of their seat and addresses the presiding officer. But even though Habib, as a former member of the Senate, may recognize the voices, when a bunch of lawmakers jump up \u2014 as they occasionally do \u2014 it would be impossible for him to know who was first without a staffer telling him. \n Now, lawmakers will instead push a touchscreen installed on their desks as they stand. A list, in order of those who pushed the button, will be transmitted to the rostrum, where the Braille display in front of Habib will go from flat to a series of raised dots that spell out the lawmaker's name. \n \"The key thing here is to be able to do it quickly,\" Habib said. \"You want to keep the debate moving.\" \n When Habib joined the House, he was given a Braille reader and software on his laptop that provided both Braille and text-to-speech translation for the multitude of bills, emails and news stories he reads daily. And while the audio software is his preferred system, the added multitasking of calling on lawmakers made the Braille reader for the rostrum essential. In addition, the Senate purchased a Braille printer so that Habib can read in advance things like who's leading the chamber's prayer, or bringing the flags to the rostrum. \n Deputy Secretary of the Senate Paul Campos said that while the Braille upgrade is unprecedented, it's in line with ensuring the chamber runs as smoothly as possible. \n \"Our job is to make sure the work gets done,\" he said. \"This is simply another piece of that.\" \n Campos said that the touchscreens cost about $57,000 and the Braille reader, printer and software was about $12,000. \n Habib, who already hands out Braille business cards, said that the new system in the Senate is just another way to show people who visit the state Capitol the various ways technology has evolved and is used in state government. \n \"This is what innovation can do,\" he said. \"This is how it can solve problems.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Washington set to swear in 1st blind lieutenant governor"}

Snow pounded a swath of Virginia on Saturday as hundreds crashed on icy roads, thousands lost power and blizzard warnings were issued along the East Coast. \n DURHAM, N.C. >> Snow and sleet pounded a large swath of the East Coast on Saturday, coating roads with ice and causing hundreds of crashes. Thousands of people lost power and forecasters warned of blizzard-like conditions from Virginia to parts of the Northeast. \n Police investigated several fatal crashes as potentially storm-related, but some of the South's biggest cities \u2014 Atlanta, Charlotte and Raleigh \u2014 appeared to avoid the worst of the storm. Authorities praised residents for learning the lessons of past storms that resulted in icy gridlock, where thousands of people were stranded along the interstates. But officials warned that bitter cold would keep roads treacherous well after the snow and sleet stopped. \n \"If I tell you anything it would be stay home,\" Gov. Roy Cooper said. \"Do not go out and drive on the roads unless you absolutely have to.\" \n North Carolina cities Burlington, Greensboro and Roxboro received 8 inches or more of snow, and several inches fell in southeast Virginia, where a blizzard warning was issued for the cities along the coast. \n North Carolina reported more than 250 crashes, while Virginia had more than 100. Hundreds of crashes were reported in Tennessee starting Friday. Hundreds of flights were canceled, from Atlanta to airports farther north. \n At least one fatality \u2014 a man whose pickup truck went off a snow-slickened Kentucky road Thursday \u2014 has been blamed on the weather. Motorist deaths in North Carolina and Maryland as the storm blew in were investigated to see if they were caused by the weather. \n Power outages had grown to about 25,000 in North Carolina alone, according to a news release from the governor. Nearly half were in the Charlotte area and adjacent Union County, according to Duke Power. \n In Cornelius, north of Charlotte, Matt Thomas said he used a ruler to measure nearly 6 inches of snow and sleet that had piled up on the back of his pickup truck. He planned to spend the weekend enjoying the snow and watching television. A plow passed through his neighborhood, but the road still looked slippery. \n \"The sleet started first, so there's definitely a layer of ice under the snow,\" he said by phone. \"I'm staying home.\" \n The unpredictable storm left some areas with much different outcomes than neighboring counties. Unofficial totals from the National Weather Service showed that much of Raleigh and Charlotte had 2 inches or less of precipitation \u2014 much of it sleet \u2014 while areas to the north of both cities got several inches of snow. \n In Atlanta and parts of Georgia, people who were expecting a couple of inches of snow instead woke up to a thin coat of ice. Still, it didn't stop children from sliding down slick grassy hills in what is a once- or twice-a-year icy occurrence. \n Some took to social media to complain that they didn't have anything to sled in, prompting an apologetic Tweet from one well-known Raleigh weatherman. \n \"To all my detractors, more than 24 hours ago I began talking about how this snow event could go up in smoke. I try to be honest-all I can do,\" WRAL-TV chief meteorologist Greg Fishel said early Saturday. \n A blizzard warning for southeast Virginia accompanied forecasts of high winds and up to 9 inches of snow there. The National Weather Service had already measured nearly 6 inches of snow at its post in Wakefield on Saturday. \n Even with snow coating Virginia Beach roads, diners and staff made it to the popular breakfast spot Citrus. \n \"When there's bad weather, people come out,\" manager Tara Junke said. \"I've worked in restaurants for 20 years in Hampton Roads and we've never shut down for snow.\" \n Chris Turner, 58, a health care analyst sitting at the counter with a mug of tea, said he drove 7 miles to his usual breakfast spot, aided by four-wheel drive. \n \"It's fun to enjoy mother nature in all her glory,\" he said. \"I'd rather be out.

Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, Saturday, Jan. 7, 2017, the day after a shooting in the baggage area. \n FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. >> Dan and Janice Kovacs and their two children were passing through airport security when the gunfire erupted. They were shoeless \u2014 with wallets, passports and carry-on items chugging along a conveyer belt \u2014 when they sprang into the mass of people running to safety. \n Now they're among stranded travelers at Fort Lauderdale trying to recover what the airport director says are 25,000 pieces of luggage, cellphones and other belongings separated from their owners during Friday's shooting rampage. \n \"We have no IDs, we have no passports, no money,\" Janice, 39, said Saturday afternoon, wearing sandals borrowed from a brother-in-law. \"We just had to leave our stuff and run.\" \n \"All our stuff is being processed. We might not even get that until Monday. I have an 11-year-old who is freaking out. This has been traumatic for her,\" she said. \n The shooting Friday afternoon, which killed five people and wounded six, also stranded about 12,000 outgoing and incoming travelers, many returning from cruises or arriving ahead of the usual Saturday departures of the massive ships based in the tourism hub's Port Everglades terminal. \n Some travelers were kept on planes for more than seven hours while police put the airport on lockdown; others scrambled to protected corners or were hustled out onto the tarmac. The Kovacs, on the way back from a Caribbean cruise, went out onto that rough surface barefoot. \n The Florida Highway Patrol sent computer-equipped buses to the airport Saturday afternoon to issue temporary ID cards to help travelers get out of state and even abroad. \"We are doing what we can to help,\" Sgt. Mark Wysocki said. \n Sydney Rivera, a 21-year-old Purdue University student, received a temporary Florida identification card that is nearly identical to the state's driver's license. On Friday, she had been about to board a flight home to Indianapolis in another terminal when people scattered over false fears of a second shooter. \n \"This will make it a lot easier to get through security,\" Rivera said as she rushed to finally catch a flight. \n Gov. Rick Scott said cruise ship companies were asked to accept travelers with provisional IDs. Once authorities began allowing travelers to depart the airport Friday evening, buses took thousands of them to the cruise terminal. \n Airport spokesman Greg Meyer said most bags won't be available until Monday. The airport hired an outside firm to collect discarded bags and sort them by where they were found so they can be identified by their owners. Those with lost luggage were told to call a toll-free number. \n Richard Lanbry, his wife and 15-year-old daughter were about to board a plane home for Montreal when the shooting began. Amid the commotion, he was separated from the other two and frantically searched for them for about an hour. \n \"I was pushed down, my wife was pushed down too. It was violent \u2026 people screaming, people crying, old and young. It was very scary,\" said the 61-year-old, who was vacationing in Pompano Beach. \n On top of that, they now have no luggage, no keys to their home and no coats or sweaters to wear once they arrive in chilly Montreal, only the T-shirts they we wearing the day before. \n Larry and Joy Edwards were about to board their flight home to Columbus, Ohio, after a Caribbean cruise. They ran out the skyway and down stairs onto the tarmac, where they were told to drop their carry-on bags and dash out to the runway. They eventually were taken to a hangar and bused to Port Everglades. That's where they spent most of the night. \n \"The Red Cross came. They gave us food and blankets and pillows. Everybody did what they could,\" Joy Edwards said. \n At 4:30 a.m., they were bused to a Miami motel. They had come back to the airport in an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve their luggage, which contained their passports, medicine and other essentials. \n Larry Edwards, a retired electric lineman, said they won't be able to get home until Monday and pointed to the clothes they had put on Friday morning. \n \"All we have is this and our smelly selves,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "IDs, phones, bags among 25K items lost in airport rampage"}

{"date": "January 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. addresses the crowd gathered at his election victory celebration in Louisville Ky. Paul says President-elect Donald Trump \"fully supports\" repealing President Barack Obama's health law only when there's a viable alternative to replace it. \n WASHINGTON >> A Republican senator who challenged Donald Trump for the White House nomination says the president-elect \"fully supports\" repealing President Barack Obama's health law only when there's a viable alternative to replace it. \n Republican leaders in the GOP-controlled Congress are moving toward a vote on repeal legislation in coming weeks, but they anticipate a transition period of months or years to a replacement. Some Republican lawmakers are expressing reservations about scrapping the law, which now covers 20 million people, without a near-term replacement. \n Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who clashed with Trump during the GOP primary, said in a tweet late Friday that the two had a conversation and that Trump agreed with Paul's approach. \n \"I just spoke to realDonaldTrump and he fully supports my plan to replace Obamacare the same day we repeal it,\" Paul tweeted. \"The time to act is now.\" \n Trump aides did not immediately respond questions about the conversation and how it had come about. \n Nothing about revamping the nation's $3 trillion-a-year health care system will come easy, but GOP leaders want congressional committees to have legislation dismantling much of Obama's overhaul ready by late January. They're hoping Congress can quickly send a measure to the incoming president that would phase out the law, perhaps a couple of months later. \n Crafting a GOP replacement probably will take more time, thanks to Republican divisions and solid Democratic opposition. It would be a political nightmare for Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act and then fail to pass a new version of the law. \n Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., told reporters Friday that Republicans might find themselves in a \"box canyon\" if they erase the law without a substitute in hand. \n One part of Obama's law Republicans are eager to repeal is its tax increases on higher-earning people and segments of the health care industry that help finance expanded coverage. Corker said that if those taxes are voided but Republicans temporarily continue subsidies to help people buy coverage, \"that means Republicans would have to vote for a tax increase\" to pay for them \u2014 usually a non-starter for the GOP. \n Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said Friday that if he had his way, \"I would start bringing up those elements that start repairing the damage and I would start taking votes on those right now.\" \n Johnson also expressed concern that Democratic opposition could scuttle the effort. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said that if Republicans void Obama's bill, Democrats won't help them pass alternative legislation. \n Republicans probably will need just a simple Senate majority to approve their repeal bill, but for procedural reasons, later replacement legislation likely will need 60 votes. Republicans now hold a 52-48 edge in the Senate. That means a need for at least eight Democratic votes, though there will be pressure on 10 Democrats facing re-election next year from states Trump won in November. \n \"I take Minority Leader Schumer at his word that if we do this we're not going to get any Democratic support. In order to actually pass a replacement, we need Democratic support,\" Johnson told reporters. \n After repeatedly trying to repeal Obama's law since its 2010 enactment, Republicans are under tremendous pressure from their voters to annul it swiftly. \n But GOP leaders have talked about their repeal not taking effect for perhaps two or three years. They're discussing providing some type of revenue during that period to maintain coverage for people and perhaps for insurers so they won't immediately abandon markets. \n Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also called this week for a simultaneous effort to erase the health care law and rewrite it. \n \"I don't think we can just repeal Obamacare and say we're going to get an answer two years from now,\" Cotton said Thursday on MSNBC. \n He added, \"We haven't coalesced around a solution for six years, in part because it is so complicated. Kicking the can down the road for a year or two years isn't going to make it any easier to solve.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Colvin reported from New York. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Richard Lardner contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Paul: Trump backs health repeal, replacement at same time"}

{"date": "January 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Donna Dye, who is unemployed and whose husband is disabled, sits outside her home in Minnie, Ky. \n MINNIE, Ky. >> Donna Dye saw the coal truck come barreling over the horizon. Her head started spinning with that familiar, desperate urge to end it all. \n She thought of the disconnect notices, the engagement ring she pawned to keep the lights on, the house she loved and would probably lose. Life insurance was the only bill up to date; this way, she thought, it might look like an accident. \n Months had passed since the letter arrived from the Social Security Administration. \"We are suspending your disability benefits,\" it said. \n She thought of her husband, a proud man with a body broken from 26 years' mining coal, and the fights over money they never had \u2014 until now. \"Fraud,\" the agency had written. The humiliation consumed them. \n She thought about veering across the yellow line and slamming head-on into that truck. \n For more than a year, Dye's family and hundreds of others in the coalfields have been fighting the federal government to keep their disability checks. They have one thing in common: They hired attorney Eric C. Conn, a flamboyant master marketer who billed himself \"Mr. Social Security.\" \n Now federal officials allege he funneled $600 million in fraudulent claims to this impoverished pocket of Appalachia, and the government turned off the spigot. It suspended disability payments to hundreds of Conn's former clients, propelling them into a yearlong battle with the government. They must prove once again that they deserved disability years ago, or their checks stop coming. \n Critics call Social Security Disability a secret welfare program that morphed over the decades from serving the truly disabled to aiding the unemployable: the uneducated, the frail, who live in places where a rotting economy relies on back-breaking labor. \n But many in these crumbling corners of blue-collar America have few options. The mass suspensions laid bare their absolute dependence on disability. \n Three people killed themselves. Others caught themselves in quiet moments wondering whether they'd be better off dead. \n Dye didn't crash her car into the truck. She pulled over and sat an hour, her temples pulsing. Disability had been her family's safety net; now there was nothing to save them from flailing toward impact. \n \"It's like sitting in a tub of water, floating, nothing's wrong,\" she said. \"And then somebody pulls the cork, you get sucked out and everything's gone.\" \n Eric C. Conn opened his law practice 23 years ago in a trailer in his hometown of Stanville, Kentucky, population 500. There, he built the third most lucrative disability firm in the nation. \n He paid women called \"Conn's hotties\" to attend events with his 1-800 number printed across their tank tops. He erected a 19-foot replica of the Lincoln Memorial in the parking lot of his law complex. In an ad, he bragged he sent a local boy with cancer to Disney World, and closed with a preacher's benediction giving thanks for Conn's kindness. \n Dye hurt his back in the mines years ago; a car wreck in 2008 aggravated his injuries. He resisted applying for disability, his wife said, until it got to where he couldn't push in the clutch in his truck or bend over to tie his shoes. \n His initial application was denied. He hired Conn. \n About three-quarters of initial claims are rejected. If they win on appeal, applicants are entitled to payments dating back to when they became unable to work, and lawyers get a cut. Conn racked in more than $20 million in fees. \n Former U.S. Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, led an investigation into Conn's firm in 2013. It described an elaborate system in which Conn paid doctors and a judge to rubber-stamp disability claims, using phony medical evidence. Years passed. \n Donna Dye and her husband were unaware of any improprieties \u2014 they took him their records, went to the appointments he arranged and trusted he took care of the rest. \n But in May 2015, 11 months before Conn was indicted, the Social Security Administration sent the letters to hundreds of his clients, alleging fraud and warning of suspensions. \n A band of 150 volunteer attorneys now representing Conn's former clients say the deck is stacked against them: The agency is assuming fraud without having to prove any of them committed it. They're expected to recall doctors' names from years ago. \n Of the hundreds initially suspended, about half were cut off. Their cases are entangled in lawsuits. They're left to live with no income. \n The Dyes got behind on the electric bill and a man came to switch off the lights. He gave them enough time to get to the pawn shop, cash in her engagement ring and pay the bill. \n Dye signed up for food stamps. But her husband's too proud to spend them. To him, disability was earned; food stamps are welfare. \n He started working in the mines at 17. He thought when he hired Conn 26 years later, he was collecting what he was due. \n They raised their kids in a hollow nearby in a rickety house with no heat. When Tim was still working, about 10 years ago, they bought this place for $85,000 and thought it meant they'd made it to the middle class. His wife said it was one of her happiest days. She got a big dining room table, with eight chairs, to have family over for dinners. \n The mortgage got behind by three months, and she panicked. She put a sign in her yard. \"Open house, everything must go.\" Her neighbors picked through her belongings. A woman offered her $20 each for five of her eight dining room chairs. \n \"I'm almost out of stuff to pawn,\" she said and slumped into one of the three chairs left. \n Donna Dye looked in the mirror not long ago and was stunned by the bags under her eyes, the frayed edges of her ponytail. \n Just a year ago, she wouldn't have left the house without fixing her hair and makeup. \n Somewhere along the way, she ran out of pride. Maybe it was on a trip to the pawn shop. Or when her mother gave her all she could \u2014 four piggy banks, labeled \"quarters,\" \"dimes,\" \"nickels,\" \"pennies.\" \n She told herself to resign to a life of poverty and move back to that old house in the hollow. \n She fixates now on the dents in the drywall, the peeling paint, the cracks in the porch. She trained herself to hate this house she had loved so much. She won't weep when the bank comes to take it away. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tangled in fraud probe, hundreds face loss of disability checks"}

{"date": "January 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Several of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet choices have not completed a full review to avoid conflicts of interest, the government's ethics office says, even as Republican senators move quickly to hold at least nine confirmation hearings next week. \n In a letter to Senate leaders, the director of the Office of Government Ethics described the current status of several nominees, some of whom are billionaires and millionaires, in the ethics process and expressed concern about the lack of ethics reviews just days from committee hearings. \n The Associated Press obtained a copy of Walter Shaub's letter. \n \"During this presidential transition, not all of the nominees presently scheduled for hearings have completed the ethics review process. In fact, OGE has not received even initial draft financial disclosure reports for some of the nominees scheduled for hearings,\" Shaub wrote to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \n A copy of the letter also was provided to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \n Republicans are intent on getting as many of Trump's choices through the arduous confirmation process as quickly as possible so his team will be in place soon after Trump takes the oath of office on Jan. 20. Democrats have complained that the GOP is moving too fast and that they lack information about some of the wealthiest Americans to serve a president. \n Schumer said in a statement Saturday that the letter \"makes crystal clear that the transition team's collusion with Senate Republicans to jam through these cabinet nominees before they've been thoroughly vetted is unprecedented.\" \n The forms in question are financial disclosures certified by the ethics office and also written ethics agreements between the nominee and the office that identify potential conflicts of interest and the ways in which the nominee will resolve those conflicts. They are required by the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, passed after the Watergate scandal. \n One of the committees that hasn't yet received the forms is the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which has scheduled a hearing next week for Betsy DeVos, Trump's pick to lead the Education Department. \n Committee aides said the panel held hearings for former Education Secretary Roderick Paige and former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao before they received the same forms in 2001, and that they received the documents days after each of those hearings. Both were confirmed to serve in President George W. Bush's Cabinet. \n That committee's rules state that the committee cannot hold a vote on the nominee without the ethics form. In a statement, the committee chairman, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said the committee is going to \"follow the Golden Rule and use the same procedures for these nominees that we did in 2001 for President Bush's nominees and in 2009 for President Obama's nominees.\" \n Aides to the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees said they had received the ethics forms for Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, and Rex Tillerson, Trump's choice for secretary of state. A spokeswoman for the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee said they had also received the forms for Chao, whom Trump has picked as his transportation secretary. \n Shaub did not list which of Trump's Cabinet choices hadn't turned in their disclosures. But other confirmation hearings next week include Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., for director of the Central Intelligence Agency; retired Marine Gen. John Kelly for homeland security secretary; Ben Carson for housing secretary; Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary; and retired Gen. James Mattis for defense secretary. \n Committees handling those nominations did not return a request for comment on the records. \n In the letter, Shaub said the lack of disclosure has left some of the nominees \"with potentially unknown or unresolved ethics issues\" just before their scheduled hearings. \n He said the intensive process of checking nominees and creating the agreements has been complicated by the packed Senate hearing schedule and Trump's announcements of his future nominees before consulting the office for evaluation of ethics issues. Traditionally, a president or president-elect's picks have not been announced until the office has already cleared the nominees, Shaub said. \n \"In the past, the ethics work was fully completed prior to the announcement of nominees in the overwhelming majority of cases,\" Shaub wrote. \n Shaub was appointed by President Barack Obama to a five-year term in 2013 to lead the office, which is an independent agency within the government. He had worked at the office for several years before that, including during the Republican Bush administration. The office attracted attention in November when it tweeted congratulations to Trump for a \"total divestiture\" that he had not promised. \n Under divestiture, an incoming federal official can sell off massive investments, defer paying capital gains and house the proceeds in Treasury bonds or diversified mutual funds. \n But Trump had not then confirmed \u2014 and still hasn't \u2014 that he will turn over any assets as part of a divestiture. \n Trump is expected to discuss the future of his business at a news conference Wednesday, the same day as many of the confirmation hearings. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ethics reviews incomplete for several of Trump's picks"}

Authorities don't know why he chose his target and have not ruled out terrorism. \n Santiago was charged with an act of violence at an international airport resulting in death \u2014 which carries a maximum punishment of execution \u2014 and weapons charges. \n \"Today's charges represent the gravity of the situation and reflect the commitment of federal, state and local law enforcement personnel to continually protect the community and prosecute those who target our residents and visitors,\" U.S Attorney Wifredo Ferrer said. \n Authorities said during a news conference that they had interviewed roughly 175 people, including a lengthy interrogation with the cooperative suspect, a former National Guard soldier from Alaska. Flights had resumed at the Fort Lauderdale airport after the bloodshed, though the terminal where the shooting happened remained closed. \n Santiago spoke to investigators for several hours after he opened fire with a Walther 9mm semi-automatic handgun that he appears to have legally checked on a flight from Alaska. He had two magazines with him and emptied both of them, firing about 15 rounds, before he was arrested, the complaint said. \n \"We have not identified any triggers that would have caused this attack. We're pursuing all angles on what prompted him to carry out this horrific attack,\" FBI Agent George Piro said. \n Investigators are combing through social media and other information to determine Santiago's motive, and it's too early to say whether terrorism played a role, Piro said. In November, Santiago had walked into an FBI field office in Alaska saying the U.S. government was controlling his mind and forcing him to watch Islamic State group videos, authorities said. \n \"He was a walk-in complaint. This is something that happens at FBI offices around the country every day,\" FBI agent Marlin Ritzman said. \n On that day, Santiago had a loaded magazine on him, but had left a gun in his vehicle, along with his newborn child, authorities said. Officers seized the weapon and local officers took him to get a mental health evaluation. His girlfriend picked up the child. \n On Dec. 8, the gun was returned to Santiago. Authorities wouldn't say if it was the same gun used in the airport attack. \n U.S. Attorney Karen Loeffler said Santiago would have been able to legally possess a gun because he had not been judged mentally ill, which is a higher standard than having an evaluation. \n Santiago had not been placed on the U.S. no-fly list and appears to have acted alone, authorities said. \n The attack sent panicked witnesses running out of the terminal and spilling onto the tarmac, baggage in hand. Others hid in bathroom stalls or crouched behind cars or anything else they could find as police and paramedics rushed in to help the wounded and establish whether there were any other gunmen. \n Mark Lea, 53, had just flown in from Minnesota with his wife for a cruise when he heard three quick cracks, like a firecracker. Then came more cracks, and \"I knew it was more than just a firecracker,\" he said. \n Making sure his wife was outside, Lea helped evacuate some older women who had fallen, he said. Then he saw the shooter. \n \"He was just kind of randomly shooting people,\" he said. \"If you were in his path, you were going to get shot. He was walking and shooting.\" \n Over the course of about 45 seconds, the shooter reloaded twice, he said. When he was out of bullets, he walked away, dropped the gun and lay face down, spread eagle on the floor, Lea said. \n By that time, a deputy had arrived and grabbed the shooter. Lea put his foot on the gun to secure it. \n Lea went to help the injured and a woman from Iowa asked about her husband, who she described. Lea saw a man who fit his description behind a row of chairs, motionless, shot in the head and lying in a pool of blood, he said. The man, Michael Oehme, was identified as one of the dead victims on Saturday. \n Bruce Hugon, who had flown in from Indianapolis for a vacation, was at the baggage carousel when he heard four or five pops and saw everyone drop to the ground. He said a woman next to him tried to get up and was shot in the head. \n \"The guy must have been standing over me at one point. I could smell the gunpowder,\" he said. \"I thought I was about to feel a piercing pain or nothing at all because I would have been dead.\" \n Santiago had been discharged from the National Guard last year after being demoted for unsatisfactory performance. Bryan Santiago said Saturday that his brother had requested psychological help but received little assistance. Esteban Santiago said in August that he was hearing voices. \n \"How is it possible that the federal government knows, they hospitalize him for only four days, and then give him his weapon back?\" Bryan Santiago said. \n His mother declined to comment as she stood inside the screen door of the family home in Puerto Rico, wiping tears from her eyes. The only thing she said was that Esteban Santiago had been tremendously affected by seeing a bomb explode next to two of his friends when he was around 18 years old while serving in Iraq. \n Santiago, who is in federal custody, will face federal charges and is expected to appear in court Monday, Piro said. \n It is legal for airline passengers to travel with guns and ammunition as long as the firearms are put in a checked bag \u2014 not a carry-on \u2014 and are unloaded and locked in a hard-sided container.

The FBI on Jan. 6, 2017 released 100 pages of heavily censored documents related to its agreement with a mysterious vendor to hack into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters, but it did not identify who it paid to perform the work or how much it cost. \n WASHINGTON >> The FBI has released 100 pages of heavily censored documents related to its agreement with an unidentified vendor to hack into an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters, but it did not identify whom it paid to perform the work or how much it cost. \n The records were provided Friday in response to a federal lawsuit filed against the FBI by The Associated Press, Vice Media and Gannett, the parent company of USA Today. \n The media organizations sued in September to learn how much the FBI paid and who it hired to break into the phone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who along with his wife killed 14 people at a holiday gathering of county workers in December 2015. The FBI for weeks had maintained that only Apple Inc. could access the information on its phone, which was protected by encryption, but ultimately broke or bypassed Apple's digital locks with the help of an unnamed third party. \n The FBI, in its records release Friday, censored critical details that would have shown how much the FBI paid, whom it hired and how it opened the phone. The files had been marked \"secret\" before they were turned over under the lawsuit. \n The files make clear that the FBI signed a nondisclosure agreement with the vendor. The records also show that the FBI received at least three inquiries from companies interested in developing a product to unlock the phone, but none had the ability to come up with a solution fast enough for the FBI. \n The FBI also said in contracting documents that it did not solicit competing bids or proposals because it thought widely disclosing the bureau's needs could harm national security. \n The lawsuit was filed months after the FBI's sudden announcement in March that it had purchased a tool from an unidentified third party to open Farook's phone. The disclosure aborted a court fight that began when a federal judge had directed Apple to help the FBI break into the phone. \n The suit by the media organizations argued there was no legal basis to withhold the information and challenged the adequacy of the FBI's search for relevant records. It also said the public had a right to know whether the vendor has adequate security measures, is a proper recipient of government funds and will act only in the public interest. \n In refusing to provide the records, the FBI said the records had been compiled for law enforcement purposes and might interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, even though at the time the shooters were both dead and there were no indications others were involved. \n It was the third lawsuit the AP has filed against the Obama administration under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "FBI deletes details about hacking effort in document release"}
