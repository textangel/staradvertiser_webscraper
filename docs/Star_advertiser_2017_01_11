{"date": "January 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Jan. 4. \n WASHINGTON >> Congress is poised to complete its initial step toward dismantling President Barack Obama's health care law, as Republicans divided over how to replace it face pressure from Donald Trump for quick action. \n \"We have a responsibility to step in and provide relief from this failing law,\" Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters today. \"And we have to do it all at the same time so that everybody sees what we're trying to do.\" \n But at the same time, Ryan said there were no \"hard deadlines\" for a GOP replacement in tandem with the repeal effort, underscoring the difficulty for Congress despite the president-elect's call to both repeal the law and replace it with legislation to \"get health care taken care of in this country.\" \n That action will be almost impossible to fulfill in the complicated web of Congress, where GOP leaders must navigate complex Senate rules, united Democratic opposition and substantive policy disagreements among Republicans. \n By a near party-line 51-48 vote early today, the GOP-run Senate approved a budget that eases the way for action on subsequent repeal legislation as early as next month. The Republican-controlled House planned to complete the budget on Friday, despite misgivings by some GOP lawmakers. \n Republicans are not close to agreement among themselves on what any replacement would look like. \n The 2010 law extended health insurance to some 20 million Americans, prevented insurers from denying coverage for existing conditions and steered billions of dollars to states for the Medicaid health program for the poor. Republicans fought the effort tooth and nail, and voter opposition to the law helped carry the GOP to impressive victories in 2010, 2014 and last year. \n Today's Senate procedural vote will set up special budget rules allowing the repeal vote to take place with a simple majority in the 100-member Senate, instead of the 60 votes required to move most legislation. \n That means Republicans, who control 52 seats, can push through repeal legislation without Democratic cooperation. They're also discussing whether there are some elements of a replacement bill that could get through at the same time with a simple majority. But for many elements of a new health care law, Republicans are likely to need 60 votes and Democratic support, and at this point the two parties aren't even talking. \n Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, unhappy that the measure endorsed huge budget deficits, was the sole Republican to vote against it. \n Increasing numbers of Republicans have expressed anxiety over obliterating the law without a replacement to show voters. \n Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she wants at least to see \"a detailed framework\" of a GOP alternative health care plan before voting on repeal. She said Republicans would risk \"people falling through the cracks or causing turmoil in insurance markets\" if lawmakers voided Obama's statute without a replacement in hand. \n Collins was among a handful of Republicans to occasionally break ranks to support some Democratic amendments aimed at supporting such things as rural hospitals and a mandate to cover patients with existing medical conditions. They were all shot down by majority Republicans anyway. \n Ryan and other GOP leaders appeared confident that the measure would easily clear the House. In the House, both conservatives and moderates wanted to get more of a guarantee that they would have a greater sense of what a GOP substitute would look like \u2014 or putting some elements of the replacement measure in the repeal bill. \n \"We need to be voting for a replacement plan at the same time that we vote for repeal,\" said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., an influential conservative. \n Some more moderate House Republicans were unhappy, too, including Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., a leader of centrists in the House Tuesday Group. He said he would oppose the budget because there was too little information about the replacement, including whether people receiving expanded Medicaid coverage or health care subsidies under the existing law would be protected. \n \"We're loading a gun here,\" MacArthur said. \"I want to know where it's pointed before we start the process.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Congress presses ahead on dismantling health care law"}

His predecessor provided the Legislature an opinion in 2011 that the state law does not allow doctors help terminally-ill patients to die. \n Radcliffe, Miller and Compassion & Choices was scheduled to announce Thursday their legislative strategy for providing terminally-ill patients the option of obtaining a doctor's prescription for medication they can decide to take if their suffering becomes unbearable. \n The 2017 Hawaii Legislature is scheduled to convene next Wednesday. \n So-called death with dignity, or physician-assisted suicide legislation, have failed in the past on religious and moral grounds.

{"date": "January 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Hawaii state Rep. Chris Lee talked today about a bill he's proposing to require presidential candidates to release tax returns. \n Lawmakers in Hawaii and several other states want to prevent presidential candidates from appearing on their states' ballots unless the candidates release their tax returns. \n They're responding to President-elect Donald Trump's decision to not release his tax returns during the presidential campaign, breaking decades of precedent. \n The Hawaii bill would require candidates to release five years of federal and state tax returns to qualify for the ballot, state Rep. Chris Lee said Wednesday. Similar proposals are circulating in California, Massachusetts and New Mexico. \n \"It's a reasonable step since every modern president has released their tax returns and put their assets into a blind trust to make sure the only interest they have is the interest of our country and its people,\" Lee said. \"I think we're in a very dangerous climate in which that could change.\" \n Lee consulted with lawyers who assured him it's legal, and if the bill passes it will undergo a thorough review from the state attorney general, he said. \n Lee is still working out details on the Hawaii bill, but he plans to include a way to make the tax returns public. In the Massachusetts bill, that state's Secretary of State would be required to make the tax returns public within a month of each vote. \n \"If even one or two states take action, it changes the game,\" Lee said. \n Trump has interests in 500 companies in about 20 countries, according to a disclosure document released in May. \n California state Sens. Scott Wiener and Mike McGuire are planning to introduce similar legislation, saying financial information should be made available to voters to build critical public trust. \n Nationwide, about two-thirds of registered voters said it's somewhat or very important for presidential candidates to release their tax returns, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll in September. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hawaii lawmaker wants to require presidential candidates to release tax returns"}

He gave no final statement. \n Wilkins had explained to jurors at his capital murder trial in 2008 how and why he killed his friends in Fort Worth three years earlier, saying he didn't care if they sentenced him to death. \n Wilkins shot Willie Freeman, 40 and Mike Silva, 33, after Freeman and an unidentified drug supplier duped Wilkins into paying $20 for a piece of gravel he thought was crack cocaine, according to court records. \n Freeman was killed on Oct. 28, 2005, after he laughed about the scam and Silva was shot because he was there, Wilkins said. Wilkins' fingerprints were found in Silva's wrecked SUV and a pentagram matching one of Wilkins' numerous tattoos had been carved into the hood. \n Wilkins also testified that the day before the shootings, he shot and killed another man, Gilbert Vallejo, 47, outside a Fort Worth bar in a dispute over a pay phone, and about a week later used a stolen car to try to run down two people because he believed one of them had taken his sunglasses. \n \"I know they are bad decisions,\" Wilkins told jurors of his actions. \"I make them anyway.\" \n Wes Ball, one of Wilkins' trial lawyers, described him as \"candid to a degree you don't see,\" and had hoped his appearance on the witness stand would have made jurors like him. \n \"It didn't work,\" Ball said. \n While awaiting trial, authorities discovered he had swallowed a handcuff key and fashioned a knife to be used in an escape attempt. \n \"This guy is the classic outlaw in the model of Billy the Kid, an Old West-style outlaw,\" said Kevin Rousseau, the Tarrant County assistant district attorney who prosecuted Wilkins. \n Twenty convicted killers were executed in the U.S. last year, the lowest number since the early 1980s.

{"date": "January 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump, accompanied by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, spoke during a news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York today. \n NEW YORK >> In a combative and freewheeling news conference, President-elect Donald Trump said for the first time today that he accepts Russia was behind the election year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. Looking ahead, he urged Congress to move quickly to replace President Barack Obama's signature health care law and insisted anew that Mexico will pay the cost of a border wall. \n The hour-long spectacle in the marbled lobby of Trump's Manhattan skyscraper was his first news conference since winning the election in early November, and the famously unconventional politician demonstrated he had not been changed by the weight of his victory. \n He defiantly denied reports that Russia had collected compromising personal and financial information about him, lambasting the media for peddling \"fake news\" and shouting down a journalist from CNN, which reported on the matter. His family and advisers clapped and cheered him on throughout. \n Trump's transition has been shadowed by U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia not only meddled in the election, but did so to help him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. After spending weeks challenging that idea, Trump finally accepted at least part of the intelligence conclusions. \n \"As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,\" Trump said, quickly adding that \"other countries and other people\" also hack U.S. interests. Still, he kept needling the intelligence agencies, saying it would be a \"tremendous blot\" on their record if officials were leaking information from his classified briefings. \n Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in a statement later that he had spoken with Trump Wednesday evening and told him he does not believe any leaks came from the intelligence community. \n One U.S. official told The Associated Press Tuesday night that intelligence people had informed Trump last week about an unsubstantiated report that Russia had compromising personal and financial information about him. Some media outlets reported on the document, which contains unproven information alleging close coordination between Trump's inner circle and Russians, as well as unverified claims about unusual sexual activities by Trump. The AP has not authenticated any of the claims. \n Clapper said Wednesday he had told Trump the intelligence community \"has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable.\" \n Wednesday's news conference was initially billed as a chance for Trump to answer questions about his plans for distancing himself from his sprawling, family-owned real estate and licensing business. Lawyer Sheri Dillon stepped to the lectern midway through the event to announce that the president-elect was relinquishing control of the Trump Organization to his adult sons and an executive, as well as putting his business assets in a trust. While new international business deals will be banned, the company will be allowed to start new projects in the U.S. \n The move appears to contradict a previous pledge by the president-elect. In a tweet last month, Trump said that \"no new deals\" would be done while he was in office. \n With dramatic flair, Trump aides piled stacks of manila folders on a table next to the lectern \u2013 in front of 10 American flags \u2013 before the news conference began. Trump said the folders contained documents he had signed formalizing the new business arrangements, though journalists were not able to view and independently verify the materials. \n Some 250 journalists crammed into the Trump Tower lobby for the news conference, which was not only Trump's first since the election, but his first since July. Journalists shouted for his attention. At times, he skipped past questions he appeared to not want to answer, including an inquiry about whether he would keep in place sanctions Obama slapped on Russia in retaliation for the election-related hacking. \n Until Wednesday, Trump had spent most of his two months as president-elect doling out policy pronouncements, attacks on critics and boasts about his victory in 140-character increments on Twitter. His preferred mode of communication has left some of his positions vague \u2013 an approach that is often by Trump's design. \n The president-elect set some concrete policy markers Wednesday, though specifics continued to be in short supply on some of his major campaign promises. \n He promised that a replacement for Obama's sweeping health care overhaul would be offered \"essentially simultaneously\" with a congressional vote to repeal the measure. The complexity of the policy changes makes quick passage of a new health care law virtually impossible, and Trump is yet to detail what he wants included. He said his team would send a plan to Congress after Rep. Tom Price, his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, is confirmed. \n Turning to his plans to build a wall along the nation's southern border, Trump vowed that Mexico would \"reimburse\" the cost of the project through an unspecified tax or payment. He said that while his administration would begin negotiating with Mexico after his Jan. 20 inauguration, he did not want to delay the work until an agreement was reached, raising the prospect that U.S. taxpayers could ultimately bear the costs. \n \"I want to get the wall started,\" he said. \"Mexico will pay for the wall, but it will be reimbursed.\" \n Following Trump's remarks, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said his country \"of course will not pay\" for a border wall. \n Trump also moved to complete his Cabinet picks, announcing his intention to nominate David Shulkin to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, elevating him from his current role as VA undersecretary. He suggested that Shulkin may work with major private hospitals to help address issues that have plagued veterans' health care. \n Trump said he would move quickly to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. He said he had been interviewing candidates and seeking input from conservative groups and planned to name someone about two weeks after the inauguration. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Ken Thomas in Washington, Jonathan Lemire in New York and Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Combative Trump concedes Russia's role in election hacking"}

The front lines of the battle against the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline are shifting away from the dwindling encampment in North Dakota. \n BISMARCK, N.D. >> The front lines of the battle against the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline are shifting away from the dwindling encampment in North Dakota, with main opposing groups asking for activism to be spread around the U.S., a call heeded when a banner was unfurled during an NFL game on New Year's Day. \n The message also has evolved from a struggle against a single four-state pipeline to an effort to advance the rights of Native Americans, the leader of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says. \n \"The opportunity to build awareness started at Standing Rock, and it's spreading out to other communities, other areas of the United States,\" tribal Chairman Dave Archambault told The Associated Press. \"It's something that the United States, corporate America, the government has taken for granted \u2014 the original occupation of Native lands, all the wrongs of the past.\" \n The protest actions that have popped up, other than the banner drop at a Minnesota Vikings game, include a demonstration at the Jan. 2 Rose Parade in California, bank protests from New York to California and protests of other pipelines in Texas, Florida and Louisiana. \n It's a strategy that sociology professors who study protest movements say is advantageous and possibly allows for innovative ways to draw attention to the issue. A decentralized effort also heeds Archambault's and other protest groups' requests for protesters to leave the once-sprawling campsite during the winter months for their safety. \n \"Those are all examples of what we're calling for, and some of those things we coordinated,\" said Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network . \"The fight isn't over \u2014 it's just the front line is transitioning to a new place, and that's a national campaign.\" \n The demonstrations in other states are examples of how Dakota Access protests are helping highlight other regional issues and broader issues of concerns to Native Americans, such land rights under old treaties with the federal government and the need for state and federal governments to better consult with tribes when it comes to infrastructure projects that affect them, Goldtooth said. The Standing Rock tribe is even considering forming a tribal utilities commission to govern such projects. \n Goldtooth's group, as well as Honor the Earth and the International Indigenous Youth Council , issued a statement Dec. 9 urging people to stop traveling to the camp \"and instead take bold action in your local communities.\" Since then, the camp's population has dwindled to between 500 and 800, according to the Morton County Sheriff's Office, and clashes between protesters and police have dropped off; only 17 arrests since Dec. 9, compared to 568 in the preceding four months. \n The pipeline that's to carry North Dakota oil to a shipping point in Illinois skirts the Standing Rock reservation to the north, where Texas-based developer Energy Transfer Partners plans to lay pipe under a Missouri River reservoir. The tribe and its supporters believe the project threatens drinking water and cultural sites, which ETP denies. The crossing under Lake Oahe is the last remaining chunk of construction, but work is stalled while ETP battles the federal government in court. The Army Corps of Engineers wants more study of alternate routes, potential for a leak and tribal treaty rights. \n An aggressive pipeline opposition group known as the Red Warrior Society left the camp last month but remains active orchestrating protests at banks they say have investments in the pipeline and other events in various states including Utah, California, Arizona, New Mexico and South Dakota. \n \"Energy Transfer Partners will push this pipe through unless there is a diversity of tactics,\" the group said last month. \n A centralized massive protest has its advantages, according to University of Wisconsin-Madison sociology professor Pamela Oliver. \n \"(Media) rarely get interested unless an action is either very, very large \u2026 or disruptive, or especially, violent,\" she said. \n However, large encampments can't be sustained indefinitely, and diversifying targets can be helpful, said Oliver, who has written extensively about social movements. She notes that \"in a practical sense, it is reasonable to look for tactics people can use where they live, and that are consistent with also holding jobs.\" \n James Jasper, a sociology professor at The Graduate Center of the City University of New York who has written several books about social movements, says \"you never know what might work,\" including \"innovative ones that take advantage of the media already present, as at football games.\" \n That protest involved two people climbing into the rafters of U.S. Bank Stadium during a Jan. 1 game between the Vikings and Chicago Bears and unfurling a protest banner. Charges are pending against three people, including Karl Zimmermann Mayo, who told the media \"this pipeline is not ethical.\" \n Groups protesting the pipeline emphasize they're not backing down, saying in December that \"this fight is escalating\" \u2014 though for the time being, not in North Dakota. \n \"We really are seeing this message materialize, to nationalize this fight,\" Goldtooth said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Patchwork of Dakota Access protests across U.S. encouraged"}

{"date": "January 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump took questions from members of the media during a news conference, today, in New York. The news conference was his first as President-elect. \n NEW YORK >> Donald Trump's business will continue to pursue deals in the United States, though not abroad, while he is president, and he will relinquish control of the company, a lawyer who worked with the Trump Organization on the plan said today. \n Trump will put his business assets in a trust and take other steps to isolate himself from his company, according to Sheri Dillon of Morgan Lewis, who spoke at Trump's first news conference since his Nov. 8 election. \n The announcement appears to contradict what Trump had said a tweet last month \u2014 \"no new deals\" while in the White House. \n The plan also falls short of what some government ethics experts have urged Trump to do \u2014 sell his assets and put the cash in a blind trust overseen by an independent manager, as many recent presidents have done. \n Dillon said that was not practical, and that Trump \"should not be expected to destroy the company he built.\" \n Also, some ethics experts had worried that a complete divestment would take too much time and prove too complicated given that much of Trump's wealth is tied up in real estate that can't be sold quickly and that his business interests are so sprawling. Trump has stakes in 500 companies in about 20 countries. \n Under the plan intended to help allay concerns about conflicts of interest, Trump will hand managerial control of his company to his two adult sons and a longtime business executive. Dillon also said that the Trump Organization will appoint an ethics adviser to its management team who must approve deals that could raise concerns about conflicts. \n Trump plans to donate money spent by foreign governments at his hotels to the U.S. Treasury, Dillon said. \n Trump's new hotel in the nation's capital, not far from the White House, has been under the spotlight since he opened it late last year. There were news reports that diplomats were choosing to stay at the hotel and throw parties there in an apparent attempt to curry favor with the president-elect. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump business will pursue U.S. deals, but not foreign ones"}

{"date": "January 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump paused during a news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov listened for a question during a May 2016 news conference at the ASEAN Russia summit, in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russia. A spokesman for President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday denied allegations that the Kremlin has collected compromising information about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, deriding the claim as a \"complete fabrication and utter nonsense.\" \n NEW YORK >> Defiant and unyielding, President-elect Donald Trump today adamantly denied reports that Russia had obtained compromising personal and financial information about him, calling it a \"tremendous blot\" on the record of the intelligence community if it had released such material. \n The incoming president, in his first news conference since late July, firmly pushed back on the media reports and chided news organizations for publishing the material late Tuesday night. His extraordinary defense, coming just nine days before Trump's inauguration, dominated a highly anticipated press conference in which the future president also announced a new Cabinet member and his plans to disentangle himself from his sprawling global business empire. \n \"I think it's a disgrace that information would be let out. I saw the information, I read the information outside of that meeting,\" he said, a reference to a classified briefing he received from intelligence leaders. \"It's all fake news, it's phony stuff, it didn't happen,\" Trump said. \"It was gotten by opponents of ours.\" \n Asked about his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump called it \"an asset, not a liability\" and an improvement over what he called America's current \"horrible relationship with Russia.\" \n \"If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what, folks, that's called an asset not a liability. I don't know if I'm going to get along with Vladimir Putin \u2014 I hope I do \u2014 but there's a good chance I won't.\" \n Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer denounced the reports about Russia's influence on Trump and the incoming president said the report should never have been released. He thanked some news organizations for showing restraint. \n A U.S. official told The Associated Press on Tuesday night that intelligence officials had informed Trump last week about an unsubstantiated report that Russia had obtained compromising personal and financial information about him. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not allowed to publicly discuss the matter. \n Trump and President Barack Obama were briefed on the intelligence community's findings last week, the official said. \n Media outlets reported on the document late Tuesday and Trump denounced it on Twitter before his news conference as \"fake news,\" suggesting he was being persecuted for defeating other GOP presidential hopefuls and Democrat Hillary Clinton in the election. \n The dossier contains unproven information about close coordination between Trump's inner circle and Russians about hacking into Democratic accounts as well as unproven claims about unusual sexual activities by Trump among other suggestions attributed to anonymous sources. The Associated Press has not authenticated any of the claims. \n Pence said the decision by some media to publish the reports could \"only be attributed to media bias\" and an attempt to \"demean\" Trump. \n Only days from his inauguration as the nation's 45th president, Trump announced that he would nominate David Shulkin to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, elevating him from his current role as VA undersecretary. \n Trump also announced his plans for the future of the Trump Organization, bringing to the podium attorney Sheri Dillon of Morgan Lewis, who worked with the Trump Organization on the arrangement. \n Dillon said the Trump Organization would continue to pursue deals in the U.S., though Trump will relinquish control of the company to his sons and an executive, put his business assets in a trust and take other steps to isolate himself from his business. She said Trump \"should not be expected to destroy the company he built.\" \n The move appears to contradict a previous pledge by the president-elect. In a tweet last month, Trump vowed to do \"no new deals\" while in office. \n The lawyer who advised Trump also said that the Trump Organization will appoint an ethics adviser to its management team who must approve deals that could raise concerns about conflicts. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Defiant Trump denies reports on Russia ties: 'a disgrace'"}
