To reduce the risk of fire from spontaneous combustion, poultry experts are warning farmers that piles 6\u00bd- to 7-feet high are high enough. One pile caught fire in western Arkansas this week, triggering a wildfire that destroyed a mobile home. \n \"This hit the sweet spot,\" said Karl VanDevender, a professor and extension engineer for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture, after describing the mix of moisture, texture and decomposition needed to produce a burning pile of waste. \n Normal composting at 130 to 145 degrees will kill pathogens, but extra moisture in the stack can help drive temperatures over 170 degrees, raising the risk of a fire, he said. \n \"If you see smoke, it's kind of iffy. If you break in, you may introduce oxygen and set it off. Have water nearby,\" he said. \"If you have litter stored and stacked, keep an eye on it.\" \n Charleston Mayor Sherman Hiatt, who is also his town's assistant fire chief, said the manure stack that caught fire Wednesday was 8 or 9 feet high. It set nearby hay ablaze and then flames jumped a highway and raced away on a steady 25 mph wind. It took about four hours to douse the flames; no one was injured. \n \"I think most farmers are pretty diligent in their methods, but sometimes freak things happen,\" said Hiatt, himself a cattle farmer who worked a poultry waste fire at another farm two years ago. \n Arkansas is among the nation's leading poultry-producing states, with Georgia and Maryland. Agriculture schools in chicken country have published brochures on how to store chicken litter, and the University of Maryland goes so far as suggesting having the fire department on hand if farmers intend to move a smoldering pile of waste. \n VanDevender said that because so many factors go into igniting a waste pile, it's difficult to predict when one might catch fire. \n \"With biological processes, we throw precision out the window,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Experts warn of spontaneous combustion of chicken manure"}

While campaigning for president, Donald Trump promised to undo those protections, putting the immigrants at risk of deportation, although he said last month he hoped to \"work something out\" to help them. \n Ryan didn't detail what Congress and Trump would do about the program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. But when questioned on a CNN town hall by a woman who identified herself as a DACA recipient with a young daughter, Ryan told her he did not want to see her deported. \n \"I can see you love your daughter, you are a nice person who has a great future ahead of you, and I hope your future is here,\" Ryan said. \n \"What we have to do is find a way to make sure that you can get right with the law, and we've got to do this in a good way so that the rug doesn't get pulled out from under you and your family gets separated.\" \n Host Jake Tapper pointed out that Trump, during the campaign, promised a \"deportation force\" to round up the more than 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. Ryan dismissed that idea. \n \"I'm here to tell you in Congress it's not happening.\" \n Instead, Ryan said Trump has asked lawmakers to focus on two priorities with respect to illegal immigration: securing the border and deporting immigrants who are violent, repeat criminals. \n House GOP lawmakers and aides have also said recently they're working on how to pay for border security to make good on Trump's promise of building a wall on the border with Mexico, although at least initially taxpayers would foot the bill \u2014 not Mexico, as Trump promised. \n DACA has extended work permits and temporary deportation relief to more than 700,000 immigrants brought illegally to this country as youths since its creation in 2012. Trump has said it and other Obama executive actions are unconstitutional, since they involved going around Congress, a position Ryan repeated Thursday. \n DACA permits need to be renewed every two years, so Trump could cancel out the program over time by ordering agencies to stop processing new applications and renewals. There is high anxiety in immigrant communities about what he will do. \n \"We have to figure out how to have a humane solution to this very legitimate, sincere problem and respect the rule of law,\" Ryan said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ryan says GOP, Trump working on solution for immigrant kids"}

{"date": "January 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A Jeep Grand Cherokees appeared on display at a Fiat Chrysler dealership in Doral, Fla., in 2015. \n WASHINGTON >> The U.S. government accused Fiat Chrysler on Thursday of failing to disclose software in some of its pickups and SUVs with diesel engines that allows them to emit more pollution than allowed under the Clean Air Act. \n The Environmental Protection Agency issued a \"notice of violation\" to the company that covers about 104,000 vehicles including the 2014 through 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram pickups, all with 3-liter diesel engines. The California Air Resources Board took similar action. \n \"Failing to disclose software that affects emissions in a vehicle's engine is a serious violation of the law, which can result in harmful pollution in the air we breathe,\" said Cynthia Giles, EPA assistant administrator for enforcement and compliance. \n Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne denied any wrongdoing, saying the EPA was blowing the issue out of proportion. \"We have done in our view nothing that is illegal,\" he said Thursday on a conference call. \"We will defend our behavior in the right environment.\" \n Marchionne said he was told by company lawyers that the Justice Department is investigating the company in concert with the EPA, raising the likelihood of an ongoing criminal probe. He said the company halted production of Grand Cherokees and Rams with diesel engines in September, but will continue to sell models manufactured before then that are still on dealers' lots. \n The company said it intends to present its case to the incoming Trump administration. \"We will work with the new leadership to get this issue through,\" Marchionne said. \n A spokesman for President-elect Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House said Thursday that EPA makes enforcement decisions independently and that outgoing President Barack Obama wasn't involved in the decision to cite the company. \n If found liable, Fiat Chrysler could face more than $4.5 billion in potential fines for violations of the Clean Air Act. \n EPA said it will continue to investigate the \"nature and impact\" of the eight software functions identified through an intensive testing program launched after Volkswagen was caught in a 2015 cheating scandal involving its \"Clean Diesel\" line of vehicles. Regulators were not yet defining the software found in the Fiat Chrysler vehicles as so-called \"defeat devices\" intended to cheat on government emissions tests. \n However, the agency said that numerous discussions with Fiat Chrysler over the past year had not produced any suitable explanation for why the company had failed to disclose the software, which regulators said caused the vehicles to emit less pollution during testing than during regular driving. \n \"This is a clear and serious violation of the Clean Air Act,\" Giles said. \"When companies break the law, Americans depend on EPA to step in and enforce.\" \n On Thursday California regulators also announced they were citing Fiat Chrysler for 11 violations under that state's strict air quality standards. \n Fiat Chrysler said in a statement that its emissions control systems \"meet the applicable requirements\" and that it spent months giving information to the EPA to explain its emissions technology and proposed a number of actions including software changes to address the agency's concerns. \n Regulators said owners of the affected models do not yet need to take any action and that they should continue driving their vehicles. \n Fiat Chrysler shares tumbled 20 percent $9.12 Thursday morning as the EPA action was reported, wiping out about $3 billion of the company's market value. The shares recovered a bit to $9.91 by early afternoon but still were down nearly 11 percent. \n Shares of Cummins Inc. also fell just over 2 percent to $137.59. Though the company manufactures some diesel engines for Fiat Chrysler, the company said Thursday it did not make the engines in the Jeep and Ram models cited by the EPA. \n The announcement comes one day after Fiat rival Volkswagen pleaded guilty in federal court to criminal charges related to widespread cheating involving emissions tests, agreeing to pay a record $4.3 billion penalty. Six high-ranking VW executives have been charged in the scandal, which prompted a nationwide recall of more than a half-million affected cars and SUVs. \n In the Volkswagen case, prosecutors alleged that top officials at the company approved of the cheating scheme, repeatedly lied to U.S. regulators and then orchestrated a mass attempted cover-up that included deleting computer files and emails. \n EPA regulators made no such allegations against Fiat Chrysler on Thursday, though they said their investigation is in the early stages and is ongoing. \n This isn't the first time the company has run afoul of a federal agency. In 2015, Fiat Chrysler was slapped with $175 million in penalties by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for mishandling recalls and failing to report safety data. \n Marchionne, who clearly was agitated on a conference call with reporters, expressed confidence that the EPA will find no evidence of an illegal \"defeat device\" in the Jeeps and Rams. He said some of the computer software on the engines was not disclosed because it's standard among automakers and disclosure wasn't previously required. But he said the EPA changed the rules after the Volkswagen case. \n Marchionne said there is no comparison between his company and VW because there was no intent by Fiat Chrysler to deceive the EPA or cheat on emissions tests. \n \"There's not a guy in this house that would even remotely attempt to try something as stupid as that,\" he said. \"And if I found a guy like that I would have hung him on a door.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Krisher reported from Detroit.

{"date": "January 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama spoke at the Grand Theater of Havana, Cuba, on March 22, 2016. \n WASHINGTON >> President Barack Obama announced today he is ending a longstanding immigration policy that allows any Cuban who makes it to U.S. soil to stay and become a legal resident. \n The repeal of the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy is effective immediately. The decision follows months of negotiations focused in part on getting Cuba to agree to take back people who had arrived in the U.S. \n \"Effective immediately, Cuban nationals who attempt to enter the United States illegally and do not qualify for humanitarian relief will be subject to removal, consistent with U.S. law and enforcement priorities,\" Obama said in a statement. \"By taking this step, we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries. The Cuban government has agreed to accept the return of Cuban nationals who have been ordered removed, just as it has been accepting the return of migrants interdicted at sea.\" \n The Cuban government praised the move. In a statement read on state television, it called the signing of the agreement \"an important step in advancing relations\" between the U.S. and Cuba that \"aims to guarantee normal, safe and ordered migration.\" \n Obama is using an administrative rule change to end the policy. Donald Trump could undo that rule after becoming president next week. He has criticized Obama's moves to improve relations with Cuba. But ending a policy that has allowed hundreds of thousands of people to come to the United States without a visa also aligns with Trump's commitment to tough immigration policies. \n President Bill Clinton created \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy in 1995 as a revision of a more liberal immigration policy that allowed Cubans caught at sea to come to the United States become legal residents in a year. \n The two governments have been negotiating an end to \"wet foot, dry foot\" for months and finalized an agreement Thursday. A decades-old U.S. economic embargo, though, remains in place, as does the Cuban Adjustment Act, which lets Cubans become permanent residents a year after legally arriving in the U.S. \n Under the terms of the agreement, Cuba has agreed to take back those turned away from the U.S., if the time between their departure from Cuba and the start of deportation hearings in the U.S. is four years or less. Officials said the timeframe is required under a Cuban law enacted after Congress passed the Cuban Adjustment Act. \n \"For this to work, the Cubans had to agree to take people back,\" said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser. \n Administration officials called on Congress to repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act. \n Officials said the changes would not affect a lottery that allows 20,000 Cubans to come to the U.S. legally each year. But Rhodes cast the shift as a necessary step toward Cuba's economic and political development. \n \"It's important that Cuba continue to have a young, dynamic population that are clearly serving as agents of change,\" he said. \n Rhodes also cited an uptick in Cuban migration, particularly across the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 an increase many have attributed to an expectation among Cubans that the Obama administration would soon move to end their special immigration status. \n Since October 2012, more than 118,000 Cubans have presented themselves at ports of entry along the border, according to statistics published by the Homeland Security Department, including more than 48,000 people who arrived between October 2015 and November 2016. \n Relations between the United States and Cuba were stuck in a Cold War freeze for decades, but Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro established full diplomatic ties and opened embassies in their capitals in 2015. Obama visited Havana last March. Officials from both nations met Thursday in Washington to coordinate efforts to fight human trafficking. \n Obama said the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, which was started by President George W. Bush in 2006, is also being rescinded. The measure allowed Cuban doctors, nurses and other medical professionals to seek parole in the U.S. while on assignments abroad. The president said those doctors can still apply for asylum at U.S. embassies around the world. \n \"By providing preferential treatment to Cuban medical personnel, the medical parole program \u2026 risks harming the Cuban people,\" Obama said. \n People already in the United States and in the pipeline under both \"wet foot, dry foot\" and the medical parole program will be able to continue the process toward getting legal status. \n Reaction to the announcement in Havana was muted Thursday afternoon. \n \"This was bound to happen at some point,\" said taxi driver Guillermo Britos, 35. \"It could impose a more normal dynamic on emigration, so that not so many people die at sea, but it could also take an escape valve away from the government, which was getting hard currency from the emigrants.\" \n Anti-Castro Cubans in Miami were mixed in their responses, with some expressing anger at Obama for what they called another betrayal of ordinary Cubans. Others said they thought the measure would increase pressure for change in Cuba. \n \"People who can't leave, they could create internal problems for the regime,\" said Jorge Gutierrez, an 80-year-old veteran of the Bay of Pigs invasion. But he added, \"From the humanitarian point of view, it's taking away the possibility of a better future from the people who are struggling in Cuba.\" \n Rep. Illeana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican who emigrated from Cuba as a child, decried the elimination of the medical parole programs, calling it a \"foolhardy concession to a regime that sends its doctors to foreign nations in a modern-day indentured servitude.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Matthew Lee and Kevin Freking in Washington, Gisela Salomon and Michael Weissenstein in Miami, Bill Barrow in Atlanta and correspondent Andrea Rodriguez in Havana contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014 \n Follow Alicia A.

{"date": "January 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Marine Le Pen, far-right leader and candidate for next spring's presidential election, delivered her New Year's address to the media in Paris on Jan. 4. \n PARIS >> France \u2014 as envisioned by far-right leader Marine Le Pen \u2014 should be its own master and have no globalization issues, European Union membership or open borders. \n It would join the United States and Russia in a global battle against Islamic militants. Francs, not euros, would fill the pockets of French citizens. Borders would be so secure that illegal immigration would no longer fuel fears of terror attacks or drain public coffers. \n It's a vision that holds increasing appeal for voters once put off by the image of Le Pen's anti-immigration party as a sanctuary for racists and anti-Semites. It has made Le Pen a leading candidate in France's presidential election this spring. \n A series of deadly extremist attacks, 10 percent unemployment and frustration with mainstream politics in France have helped make the party she has worked to detoxify a potentially viable alternative. \n Early polls place her as one of the top two contenders. The other is former Prime Minister Francois Fillon, a conservative who would slash the ranks of civil servants and trim state-funded health care \u2014 an untouchable area for Le Pen, whose campaign slogan is \"In the Name of the People.\" \n Le Pen believes her chance of victory has been bolstered by Britain's decision to leave the European Union and by Donald Trump's U.S. presidential victory. She speaks with confidence of winning, saying \"I will\" change France. \n \"This page in the history of the world is turning. We will give back to nations reasoned protectionism, economic and cultural patriotism,\" she said. \n On Thursday, Le Pen showed up at Trump Tower in New York and was seen sipping coffee in a basement coffee shop, leading to speculation she was looking to create a bond with the U.S. president-elect. However, no such meeting was on his agenda. \n Trump Tower resident George Lombardi, who said he's been friends with Le Pen for over 20 years and is a friend of Trump's, said the French politician attended a private gathering on Wednesday evening at his residence. \n She was joined by entrepreneurs, industrialists and diplomats \u2014 people she might be able to raise money from and \"that have the possibility to help her with the campaign in France,\" Lombardi said. \n \"We did not reach out to the Trump campaign. We did not reach out to Mr. Trump,\" he said. \"We did not go begging for any interview with anybody on the transition team because she was here to meet other people.\" \n Like Trump, Le Pen, 48, a mother of three and lawyer by training, envisions improved relations with Russia, which she and other National Front officials have visited. But she takes it further. \n \"I want an alliance to emerge between France, the United States and Russia to fight Islamic fundamentalism, because it's a gigantic danger weighing on our democracies,\" she said last week. \n For Le Pen and her supporters, \"massive migration,\" notably from Muslim North Africa, is supplanting French civilization and is at the root of many France's modern woes. \"On est chez nous\" (\"We're in our land\") is a mantra at National Front rallies. \n Le Pen insists she has no problem with followers of Islam, but wants people who espouse radical political ideas in the guise of religion to be put on trial and expelled before they install Sharia, or Islamic law, in France. \n Traditional Muslim dress, which many in France consider a gateway to radicalization, could disappear from public view should Le Pen win the presidency. The National Front's No. 2, Florian Philippot, says Le Pen's platform calls for extending a 2004 law banning \"ostensible\" religious symbols like Muslim headscarves from French classrooms to include the streets. \n Le Pen took over leadership of the National Front in 2011 from her father, party co-founder Jean-Marie Le Pen. Her make-over included sidelining him. His party membership was revoked last year after he repeated an anti-Semitic reference that had drawn a court conviction. \n But the slogan \"French First\" \u2014 coined by the elder Le Pen in 1985 \u2014 remains alive under Marine Le Pen. \n Newcomers to France would have to spend several years paying a stipend before availing themselves of free school and health care, Le Pen has said, benefits she considers a draw for immigrants. \n Nonna Mayer, a leading expert on the party, said Le Pen has \"gone half-way in changing the party,\" ridding it of its long-time anti-Semitic image but making Islam the enemy. \n \"At the heart of the party of Marine Le Pen \u2026 there is something which is not really compatible with the values of democracy,\" she said. \"It's the idea that one must keep housing, social benefits, family stipends, employment to the French.\" \n Le Pen emphatically rejects the label of extremist, proudly calling herself \"a patriot.\" The words \"democracy\" and \"democratic\" roll off her tongue. \n Yet her entourage includes one-time members of an extreme-right movement once noted for its violence. A former leader of the hard-core Identity Bloc in Nice, Philippe Vardon, joined National Front ranks and quickly won a councilor spot. \n Under Le Pen, the National Front was France's big winner in 2014 European Parliament election, taking more seats than any other French party. But she wants to do away with the 28-nation EU, which she claims has stolen national sovereignty, and ditch the euro currency, which she describes as a \"knife in the ribs\" of nations, ruining economies. \n Her EU exit formula is \"very simple:\" Try immediately to negotiate a return of borders, national currency and \"economic patriotism\" to protect French jobs and industry and allow the French to pass laws unadulterated by directives from Brussels. \n Six months later, she would call a referendum and counsel remaining in a \"new Europe\" if negotiations are fruitful, or advise bailing out as Britain has done. \n \"My program cannot be put into place if we remain subjugated by European diktats,\" she said. \"I see the grand return of nationalism.\" \n Le Pen is expected to present her full presidential agenda during a Feb. 4-5 convention. But she set the tone with her New Year's greeting, a \"wish of combat\" to defeat political adversaries that she contends represent the interests of banks, finance and the media. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Jill Colvin in New York contributed. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Le Pen's world: French nationalism at heart of her campaign"}

{"date": "January 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A boat carrying a recovery team rode on the shoreline of Lake Erie, on Jan. 3, in Cleveland. Now two weeks after the crash, crews are concentrating today on four spots within a football field sized-section near Cleveland's lakefront where divers already have found the business jet's cockpit voice recorder, seats, part of the fuselage and the remains of one passenger. \n More human remains have been recovered in the search for wreckage of a corporate jet carrying six people that crashed in Lake Erie two weeks ago, authorities said today. \n Cuyahoga County's medical examiner, Dr. Thomas Gilson, said DNA testing will be required to identify the remains found Wednesday. Officials have said remains found Jan. 6 on a seat pulled from the lake were those of a male. \n Searchers today also found more debris believed to be from the plane, officials said. \n Divers have found the jet's cockpit voice recorder, seats, part of the fuselage, an engine cover and the left wing, in addition to the human remains. A box that records mechanical information on the plane \u2014 but isn't crash-proof \u2014 also was found and sent to federal investigators. \n The plane was carrying a Columbus businessman, his wife, their two teenage sons, a neighbor and the neighbor's daughter, a University of Wisconsin-Madison nursing student. They were returning to Columbus after making the trip to a Cleveland Cavaliers game. \n The slow-going search \u2014 hampered by ice, high winds and murky waters that limit visibility along the lake bottom \u2014 shows just how difficult it is to find the wreckage of a plane in water or a remote area despite the use of emergency beacons and high-tech equipment. \n WEATHER IMPACT \n The weather on the shallowest of the Great Lakes has been a hindrance for searchers since the night of Dec. 29 when the plane vanished from radar. \n High waves and blustery conditions stopped some U.S. Coast Guard boats from going out in the early hours. Snow squalls and darkness caused more problems. \n All that was known was that the plane took off from a small airfield in downtown Cleveland and turned north across the lake before suddenly losing altitude about 2 miles out. \n With no exact location to guide them, search planes and boats covered 128 square miles before the Coast Guard determined the next day that it was a recovery mission. \n WATER SEARCHES \n It's not unheard of for searches to stretch for a week or more, but most of those have been in larger bodies of water. \n Several weeks passed before crews found most of the wreckage of a plane that crashed off the Mississippi coast in 2015. And the hunt is still on for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that vanished over the Indian Ocean in March 2014. \n The initial search in Lake Erie included boats equipped with sonar that track underwater images, and signals thought to be from the plane's emergency beacon helped narrow the area to 12 square miles. \n But it wasn't until an underwater locator beacon received transmissions from the cockpit voice recorder that searchers found what is believed to be the crash site. The recorder and a seat with human remains were pulled from the water the next day \u2014 eight days after the plane disappeared. \n RECOVERY EFFORTS \n Despite being close, finding the rest of the plane has been difficult. Investigators believe it broke apart on impact, scattering the debris. All six people aboard are presumed dead. \n Recovery crews have been contending with an ice-covered surface and freezing conditions that limit divers to two hours in the water at a time. Along the bottom, they can see only a few inches. They're feeling their way through the water, guided by crew members at the surface using sonar. \n \"When you're down there you don't know which way is north, south, east or west,\" said Tom Gouin, who works with Great Lakes Diving & Salvage in Gaylord, Michigan, but is not part of the recovery effort in Lake Erie. \n \"All you can do is look for the bubbles because they always go up,\" he said. \"It's all a guessing game pretty much.\" \n Associated Press researcher Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "More human remains found in search for plane in Lake Erie"}

In a report released, Wednesday, by the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, the federal advisory panel took a comprehensive look at what's known about the benefits and harms of marijuana and is calling for a national effort to learn more about the drug. \n NEW YORK >> It can almost certainly ease chronic pain and might help some people sleep, but it's also likely to raise the risk of getting schizophrenia and might trigger heart attacks. \n Those are among the conclusions about marijuana reached by a federal advisory panel in a report released today. \n The experts also called for a national effort to learn more about marijuana and its chemical cousins, including similarly acting compounds called cannabinoids. \n The current lack of scientific information \"poses a public health risk,\" said the report , released by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. Patients, health care professionals and policy makers need more evidence to make sound decisions, it said. \n Several factors have limited research. While the federal government has approved some medicines containing ingredients found in marijuana, it still classifies marijuana as illegal and imposes restrictions on research. So scientists have to jump through bureaucratic hoops that some find daunting, the report said. \n A federal focus on paying for studies of potential harms has also impeded research into possible health benefits, the report said. The range of marijuana products available for study has also been restricted, although the government is expanding the number of approved suppliers. \n Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for a variety of medical uses, and eight of those states plus the district have also legalized it for recreational use. \n The report lists nearly 100 conclusions about marijuana and its similarly acting chemical cousins, drawing on studies published since 1999. \n It found strong evidence, for example, that marijuana can treat chronic pain in adults and that similar compounds ease nausea from chemotherapy, with varying degrees of evidence for treating muscle stiffness and spasms in multiple sclerosis. \n Limited evidence says marijuana or the other compounds can boost appetite in people with HIV or AIDS, and ease symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, the report concluded. But it said there's not enough research to say whether they're effective for treating cancers, irritable bowel syndrome, epilepsy, or certain symptoms of Parkinson's disease, or helping people beat addictions. \n There may be more evidence soon: a study in Colorado is investigating the use of marijuana to treat PTSD. \n Turning to potential harms, the committee concluded: \n \u2014 Strong evidence links marijuana use to the risk of developing schizophrenia and other causes of psychosis, with the highest risk among the most frequent users. \n \u2014 Some evidence suggests a small increased risk for developing depressive disorders, but there's no evidence either way on whether it affects the course or symptoms of such disorders, or the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder. \n \u2014 There's strong evidence that using marijuana increases the risk of a traffic accident, but no clear indication that it promotes workplace accidents or injuries, or death from a marijuana overdose. \n \u2014 There's only weak evidence for the idea that it hurts school achievement, raises unemployment rates or harms social functioning. \n \u2014 For pregnant women who smoke pot, there's strong evidence of reduced birthweight but only weak evidence of any effect on pregnancy complications for the mother, or an infant's need for admission to intensive care. There's not enough evidence to show whether it affects the child later, like sudden infant death syndrome or substance use. \n \u2014 Some evidence suggests there's no link to lung cancer in marijuana smokers. But there's no evidence, or insufficient evidence, to support or rebut any link to developing cancers of the prostate, cervix, bladder, or esophagus. \n \u2014 Substantial evidence links pot smoking to worse respiratory symptoms and more frequent episodes of chronic bronchitis. \n \u2014 There's weak evidence that suggests smoking marijuana can trigger a heart attack, especially for people at high risk of heart disease. But there's no evidence either way on whether chronic use affects a person's risk of a heart attack. \n \u2014Some evidence suggests a link between using marijuana and developing a dependence on or abuse of other substances, including alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "The good, bad and unknown about marijuana's health effects"}

Abe arrived Thursday for a two-day official visit that includes a visit to Duterte's hometown of Davao city in the southern Philippines. \n MANILA >> Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday pledged $8.7 billion worth of business opportunities and private investments along with speedboats and other counterterrorism equipment to the Philippines, whose president has boosted ties with China. \n Following talks with President Rodrigo Duterte in Manila, Abe welcomed the Philippine leader's efforts to improve Manila's ties with Beijing \"in light of the arbitral award,\" referring to the Philippines' victory in an arbitration ruling declaring China's claims to the South China Sea invalid. \n China has refused to recognize the July 12 arbitration decision and has warned the United States and other countries not involved in the territorial row not to meddle in the disputes, which Beijing wants to be settled through one-on-one negotiations with other rival claimant countries like the Philippines. \n Abe, however, said \"the issue of the South China Sea is linked directly to regional peace and stability and is a concern to the entire international community.\" \n His two-day visit to Manila aims to further solidify relations with the Philippines at a time when Duterte is cozying up to China and Russia while taking a hostile stance toward Tokyo's main ally, the United States. Japan is among the top trading partners of the Philippines and one of its largest aid providers. \n The Philippines is Abe's first stop in a four-nation swing as he presses efforts to boost Japan's trade and security engagements amid China's rise to Asian dominance. He will later travel to Australia, Indonesia and Vietnam. \n Accompanied by his wife and a business delegation, Abe is the first head of state to visit since Duterte took office in June. It's an important affirmation of Duterte's leadership at a time when he faces domestic and international criticism for a brutal crackdown on illegal drugs that has claimed more than 6,000 lives. \n Japan will help the Philippines fight illegal drugs by helping formulate treatment programs and improve facilities, Abe said. \n In a bid to foster Philippine development, he said Japan \"will create business opportunities through Official Development Assistance and private sector investments which, together, will be in the order of one trillion yen ($8.7 billion) over the next five years.\" \n Abe and Duterte witnessed the signing of a number of agreements and the exchange of documents, including a Japanese grant of 600 million yen ($5 million) for boats and other counterterrorism equipment for the Philippine coast guard. \n At the start of their talks, Duterte thanked Abe for Japan's help to strengthen the Philippine coast guard and said he was looking forward for the delivery of additional Japanese assistance. \n After Manila, Abe will travel to southern Davao city, Duterte's hometown, where Philippine officials said the president may host breakfast for the Japanese premier at his home. \n China has backed Duterte's bloody crackdown on drug users and pushers, and a Chinese real estate magnate financed the construction of the biggest drug rehab center in the country, drawing praises from the president. \n While Duterte has cozied up to China and Russia, he has railed at President Barack Obama's outgoing administration for raising alarm over human rights concerns. The brash-talking Duterte has repeatedly vowed to scale back joint military exercises and other defense engagements with the U.S., his country's treaty ally, but has walked back on many of his threats. \n Duterte visited Japan in October when he and Abe agreed to cooperate in promoting regional peace and stability and acknowledged the importance of their alliances with Washington. \n About two dozen activists led by four Filipina women who were forced into sexual slavery by Japanese troops in World War II protested outside the Japanese Embassy, demanding justice for their sufferings in a call that has largely been muted by the blossoming relations of the Asian neighbors. \n Narcisa Claveria, 87, said she and other former sex slaves were treated \"like pigs\" by Japanese troops during the war, lamenting that many of her fellow victims had died without getting justice. \n \"Shinzo Abe, end the issue of women now,\" Claveria said at the protest. \"You are meeting again with the president, will you bring forces of aggression here again? Are you going to make women here like pigs again?\" \n It's not clear if the demand by the former sex slaves were raised by Duterte in his talk with Abe. \n A survey released Thursday by independent pollster Pulse Asia shows most Filipinos trust Japan and the United States while a majority distrust China and Russia. \n The survey found 76 percent of adult Filipinos trust the U.S. while 70 percent expressed trust for Japan. Sixty-one percent said they lacked trust in China and 58 percent distrust Russia.

Mike Pompeo, a four-term, conservative Republican from Kansas, made the comments in testimony prepared for his appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee. If confirmed by the Senate as CIA director, Pompeo could be caught in the role of mending relations between Trump and intelligence officials after a testy standoff over suspected Russian meddling during the 2016 election. \n Pompeo served on the partisan House committee set up to investigate the deadly attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. \n Trump has for the most part been dismissive of intelligence agencies' findings that Russia, specifically President Vladimir Putin, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election with the goal of electing Trump. The CIA is one of three main intelligence agencies that came to that conclusion. \n On Wednesday, Trump acknowledged Russia was responsible but speculated that intelligence agencies might have leaked to news organizations details about a classified briefing with him that included unsubstantiated allegations about his ties to Russia. \n Pompeo graduated first in the Class of 1986 at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He served in the Army at a time when the Soviet Union was America's main adversary. \n Pompeo has been critical of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran, which granted Tehran sanctions relief for rolling back its nuclear weapons program. And he has said that Muslim leaders are \"potentially complicit\" in terrorist attacks if they do not denounce those made in the name of Islam. He has also called for the government to increase surveillance to counter terrorists, not roll it back, and he wants Congress to play a larger role in overseeing intelligence agency activity. \n The congressman also supports the use of waterboarding to elicit information from suspected terrorists. \n Pompeo initially backed Sen.

A new study in France shows that baboons can make human-like vowel sounds, and its authors say the discovery could help scientists better understand the evolution of human speech. \n PARIS >> Baboon grunts and mating calls may hold secrets about human speech, according to a new study suggesting that the origins of human language could reach back as much as 25 million years. \n The barks, yacks and wa-hoos of the Guinea baboons reveal distinct human-like vowel sounds, according to the study published Wednesday in the journal Plos One by scientists from six universities in France and Alabama. \n The authors, led by Dr. Louis-Jean Boe of Grenoble Alpes University, studied the acoustics of 1,335 baboon sounds and the animals' tongue anatomy. \n They cast doubt on theories that language developed only after the appearance of humanoids with a low larynx. Instead, they say their research suggests that the human vocal system developed from abilities already present in ancestors such as the Guinea baboon. \n They also found similar muscles in baboon tongues as human tongues \u2014 which are key to our ability to make vowel sounds. \n \"Language is a key difference between humans and the rest of the natural world, but the origin of our speech remains one of the greatest mysteries of science,\" the scientists wrote. \n \"The evidence developed in this study does not support the hypothesis of the recent, sudden, and simultaneous appearance of language and speech in modern Homo sapiens,\" the study says. \"It suggests that spoken languages evolved from ancient articulatory skills already present in our last common ancestor \u2026 about 25 million years ago.\" \n The authors say the findings \"reveal a loose parallel between human vowels\" and baboon vocalizations produced in such communications as sounding alarm or calling to copulate. \n A similar study on monkeys published last year also identified five vowels suggesting a link to the origins of human language. \n Professor Scott Moisik of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the new study, said its findings fit with other research \u2014 and his own experience listening to primates in zoos and online animal videos. \n \"When I hear a cat on YouTube produce a vocalization that very much sounds like 'oh long Johnson,' or the 'no no no' cat, or a dog that gets pretty-darned close in imitating 'I love you' \u2026 I am led to believe that, to use the words of Boe and company, 'speech precursors' (however rudimentary or limited) go back further than 25 million years ago,\" he said in an email to The Associated Press. \n He and colleague Dan Dediu noted that vowels are just part of the equation \u2014 and called for more research on tougher-to-make consonants. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Scientists hear voice of ancient humans in baboon calls"}

College graduates, on average, earned 56 percent more than high school grads in 2015, according to data compiled by the Economic Policy Institute. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Asia Howard posed, on Oct. 20, for a photo at St. Johns River Park at sunrise, in Jacksonville, Fla. Howard was stuck in mostly retail and fast-food jobs after graduating high school, unable to get a job in banking, a profession she prized for its steady hours. After further developing her career and computer skills, she landed a job in mortgage lending that paid nearly double what she earned in previous jobs. \n WASHINGTON >> Americans with no more than a high school degree have fallen so far behind college graduates in their economic lives that the earnings gap between college grads and everyone else has reached its widest point on record. \n The growing disparity has become a source of frustration for millions of Americans worried that they \u2014 and their children \u2014 are losing economic ground. \n College graduates, on average, earned 56 percent more than high school grads in 2015, according to data compiled by the Economic Policy Institute. That was up from 51 percent in 1999 and is the largest such gap in EPI's figures dating to 1973. \n Since the Great Recession ended in 2009, college-educated workers have captured most of the new jobs and enjoyed pay gains. Non-college grads, by contrast, have faced dwindling job opportunities and an overall 3 percent decline in income, EPI's data shows. \n \"The post-Great Recession economy has divided the country along a fault line demarcated by college education,\" Anthony Carnevale, director of Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce, said in a report last year. \n College grads have long enjoyed economic advantages over Americans with less education. But as the disparity widens, it is doing so in ways that go beyond income, from homeownership to marriage to retirement. Education has become a dividing line that affects how Americans vote, the likelihood that they will own a home and their geographic mobility. \n The dominance of college graduates in the economy is, if anything, accelerating. Last year, for the first time, a larger proportion of workers were college grads (36 percent) than high school-only grads (34 percent), Carnevale's research found. The number of employed college grads has risen 21 percent since the recession began in December 2007, while the number of employed people with only a high school degree has dropped nearly 8 percent. \n Behind the trend is a greater demand for educated workers, and the retirement of older Americans, who are more likely to be high school-only graduates. \n The split is especially stark among white men. For middle-age white men with only high school degrees \u2014 the core of President-elect Donald Trump's support \u2014 inflation-adjusted income fell 9 percent from 1996 through 2014, according to Sentier Research, an analytics firm. By contrast, income for white men in the same age bracket who are college graduates jumped 23 percent. \n Long after the recession ended, many young college graduates struggled to find well-paying jobs in a slowly recovering economy, and stories about graduates working as coffee shop baristas abounded. But data collected by the New York Federal Reserve suggests that trend has faded as the economy has improved. \n Yet few experts think the solution is simply to send more students to four-year colleges. Many young people either don't want to spend more years in school or aren't prepared to do so. Already, four in every 10 college students drop out before graduating \u2014 often with debt loads they will struggle to repay without a degree. \n Rather, labor economists say, many high school grads would benefit from a more comprehensive approach to obtaining skills, especially involving technology, that are increasingly in demand. \n \"If the only path you offer them is a traditional college path, they're not going to be successful,\" says Harry Holzer, an economist at Georgetown University. \n Helping lift high school graduates' skill levels is critical, given the many ways they are lagging behind their college-educated peers: \n \u2014 They're less likely to have a job. Just two-thirds of high school-only grads ages 25 through 64 were employed in 2015, down sharply from 73 percent in 2007. For college graduates in the same age group, employment dipped only slightly from 84 percent to 83 percent. \n \u2014 Less likely to be married. In 2008, marriage rates for college-educated 30-year olds surpassed those of high-school-only grads for the first time. And women with college diplomas enjoy an 8-in-10 chance of their first marriage lasting 20 years, according to the Center for Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics. That's double the odds for women with just high school degrees. \n \u2014 Home ownership. High school-only grads are less likely to own homes: Sixty-four percent are current homeowners, down from 70 percent in 2000. By contrast, three-quarters of bachelor's degree holders are homeowners, down slightly from 77 percent in 2000, according to real estate data firm Zillow. \n \u2014 Union membership. A college-educated worker is now more likely to belong to a labor union than a high-school-only worker is, according to Pew Research Center. Unions have played a key role in raising pay for members. Yet just 6 percent of workers with only a high school degree now belong to one. Public employee unions, which often represent teachers and others with college educations, have generally maintained staying power while large industrial unions have deteriorated. \n \u2014 Retirement savings. College grads are more likely than high school-only graduates to contribute to a 401(k)-style retirement plan , according to research by Christopher Tamborini of the Social Security Administration and Changhwan Kim, a sociology professor at the University of Kansas. College grads contributed 26 percent more even when members of both groups had similar incomes and access to such plans, their research found. \n Participation in 401(k)-style plans requires decisions \u2014 whether and how much to contribute and how to invest \u2014 that can become barriers for the less educated. That contrasts with traditional pensions, which automatically enrolled everyone eligible and provided defined benefits. But traditional pensions have been rapidly phased out. \n \u2014 Mobility. College graduates are more likely to move to find work than high-school-only workers are, says Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Companies tend to recruit more broadly for high-skilled jobs than for low-skilled work. \n \"College graduates are essentially in a nationwide labor market,\" Moretti said. \n All of this contributed to a sharp political split in the presidential election. College graduates favored Hillary Clinton by 9 percentage points. Non-college grads chose Donald Trump by 8 points, according to exit polls. That was the largest disparity between the two groups on record since 1980, according to the Pew Research Center. \n \"These are some of the largest (demographic) shifts in recent years,\" said Jocelyn Kiley, an associate director at Pew. \n The gap is most pronounced among whites: Nearly two-thirds of white non-college grads voted for Trump, compared with just 45 percent of whites with college degrees. \n Some of these trends might eventually reverse themselves if more high school grads acquire the skills needed for higher-paying work. Though many middle-income jobs don't require college, nearly all require some post-high school education or training. \n What Holzer calls the \"new middle\" includes such health care jobs as X-ray technicians and phlebotomists, as well as computer-controlled manufacturing and some office occupations, like paralegals. \n A typical X-ray technician, for example, earns nearly $60,000 a year and needs only a two-year degree, according to government data. \n And these \"new middle\" positions are typically the same jobs for which employers have complained that they can't find enough qualified people to fill. Labor experts say the U.S. educational system is failing to help young people acquire such skills. \n If they know where to look, high school graduates can choose from among numerous options for vocational skills training \u2014 from two-year programs to online courses to for-profit schools. Yet many aren't likely to get much help from high school guidance counselors. \n Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School, says counselors increasingly focus on things like substance abuse, discipline, and standardized testing, rather than on career advice. \n Nor do U.S. high schools funnel students into the kind of on-the-job apprenticeships that exist in some countries. Instead, Fuller says, U.S. apprentices are typically older workers upgrading their skills in areas like construction. The average age of an apprentice in Germany is 17, he notes; in the United States, it's 27. \n \"We have a very limited vision of how to get people from their graduation in high school onto a path that's going to lead them to have a successful, independent life,\" Fuller said. \n Asia Howard, 26, of Jacksonville, Florida, is navigating that path right now. She was stuck in mostly retail and fast-food jobs after graduating high school, unable to get a job in banking, a profession she prized for its steady hours. A friend told her about a nonprofit called Year Up, which teaches such career skills as resume writing, interview techniques and time management. \n Year Up participants also typically receive internships, which Howard spent at Everbank. She also took classes to upgrade her computer skills. Early last year, she began a job in mortgage lending at PNC Financial that pays nearly twice what she earned in previous jobs. She saw many people lose homes during the financial crisis. Now, she helps people buy them. \n \"It gives me a chance to see what that side of life is like,\" Howard said. And unlike in her previous jobs, \"I can see a lot of room to grow.\" She is also studying for an associate's degree in business administration at Florida State College at Jacksonville. \n The driving force for many of these changes was the recession, which reshaped the job market in ways that left far fewer opportunities for workers like Howard. Many routine jobs were replaced by computers or robots or were outsourced overseas. \n There are nearly 1.5 million fewer office administrative and clerical jobs now than there were before the recession, according to an analysis by Georgetown's Center on Education and the Workforce. That narrowed a long-time path to the middle class for high school graduates, particularly women. \n Manufacturing employment is also 1.5 million lower than when the recession began in 2007. The construction industry had offered a lifeline to many high-school educated workers, particularly men, during the housing boom in the 2000s. Yet construction now employs 840,000 fewer people than it did nine years ago. \n Since the recession, the fastest-growing industry for high school-only grads has been a mostly low-paying sector that includes restaurants, hotels, and amusement parks, according to Georgetown's analysis. \n Those are the types of jobs that Crystal Thompson, 35, of Seattle, has held since she finished high school. She has worked at Domino's Pizza for seven years. \n \"The only jobs that are out there are pretty much minimum wage jobs \u2014 coffee shops, restaurants, things like that,\" she said. \"I'm pretty much stuck in fast food for now.\" \n Her raises have come from minimum wage increases. She went on strike twice during Seattle's recent \"Fight for $15\" campaign, which led the City Council to approve a citywide $15 minimum wage. \n Thompson, who has three children, wants to return to school to become a translator. She is mostly fluent in Spanish. Yet she has found it hard to do so in part because her work schedule can fluctuate and is typically distributed just a day in advance. \n The closest community college lacks the classes in medical and legal translation she needs. Those classes are offered at another community college a half hour away, so she needs to buy a car to attend them. \n \"It's definitely one of my goals, to get some kind of career going,\" she says. \"I want to be a productive member of society.\" \n AP Writer Collin Binkley contributed to this story from Boston. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pay gap between college grads, everyone else hits record"}
