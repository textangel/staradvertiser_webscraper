But a police union said the officer who fatally shot the boy \"did nothing wrong that day.\" \n Disciplinary charges recommended against Officers Timothy Loehmann, who shot Tamir, and Frank Garmback, who was driving their cruiser, were sent to the city's safety director, police Chief Calvin Williams said. The director will determine what action might be taken regarding the disciplinary charges, which city officials didn't specify during a Friday evening news conference. Disciplinary hearings will be held. \n The two officers went to the recreation center in November 2014 after a man drinking beer and waiting for a bus there called 911 to report a \"guy\" was pointing a gun at people. The caller told the 911 dispatcher the guy was probably a juvenile and the gun might be \"fake,\" information never relayed to the officers. \n Loehmann shot Tamir within seconds of the police cruiser skidding to a stop near the boy. The officers told investigators Loehmann had shouted three times at Tamir to raise his hands. \n The killing became part of a national outcry about minorities, especially black boys and men, dying at the hands of police. \n The Cuyahoga County prosecutor announced in December 2015 that Loehmann and Garmback wouldn't be indicted after telling a grand jury there wasn't evidence to support criminal charges. \n The Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association said Friday it was \"encouraged\" that Loehmann wasn't charged with any wrongdoing regarding his response to the events of Nov. 22, 2014, which it called \"tragic.\" \n \"Nevertheless, all agree that Officer Loehmann was not wrong in reacting the way he did,\" union president Stephen S. Loomis said in a statement. \"It appears that the actual charges are created to discipline him, and perhaps discharge him, despite the fact that he did nothing wrong that day.\" \n The union said it was \"disappointing\" that Garmback was charged with \"making a tactical error on his approach, when it is apparent that the car slid in the ice and mud well beyond what he intended.\" \n The union said it was reviewing the disciplinary charges and would prepare appropriate defenses for the officers. It said there would be no comment from the officers. \n A Rice family attorney had called for the firings of the two officers. The attorney, Subodh Chandra, sent a letter to the police chief on Jan. 3 questioning why they hadn't been fired or disciplined. \n Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, settled a federal civil rights lawsuit with the city for $6 million. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Disciplinary charges against 2 officers in Tamir Rice case"}

Clark said an 8-year-old girl who had helped rescue her younger brothers was in \"good shape.\" \n At the small, tight-knit charter school where the two eldest girls were students, families said they were devastated Friday. \n \"We're a family here,\" said Renata Seergae, Chloe's mother. \"It happened on such a large scale, there was no doubt in anyone's mind that we are all going to get our kids through it and help out this family as much as we can.\" \n Chloe described her friend as kind, caring and fun. She loved Hamilton, the Broadway musical, and celebrated the Founding Father's birthday each year just as she had done on Jan. 11, one day before the fire. \n \"She likes to laugh a lot,\" Chloe said. \"She was very nice to everyone; everyone was her friend. You could never get mad at her, because she was always so nice.\" \n Chloe said her friend was close to her siblings, and sometimes brought family photos to school to show to classmates. \n Firefighters encountered heavy flames on all three floors when they were called to the home about 12:30 a.m. Thursday, Clark said. The firefighters had to attack the blaze from outside, he added, noting the third floor collapsed and the second floor partially collapsed from the fire. \n Robert Spencer said he often saw children playing on the porch of the home, located across the street from his. When he looked out the window early Thursday, the home was in flames. Though he ran toward the fire, it was so big and hot he couldn't help. \n \"I heard the kids crying. My daughter heard them.

He, however, believed that U.S commitments to the region will not change. \n \"Shift in our administrations in Washington is not going to alter or fundamentally undermine the commitments of the United States to prosperity and stability and security of the Asia-Pacific,\" he said, adding that \"our friendship doesn't depend on individuals or personalities.\" \n White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama had dedicated a significant portion of his last term to TPP, which he said would allow the U.S. to impose higher labor, environmental and human rights standards and protection for intellectual property as well as give U.S. businesses access to some of the fastest growing economies. \n The deal would have slashed 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on American goods and services, he said. \n \"But unfortunately, Congress did not take action on the agreement that the Obama administration negotiated, and that's unfortunate because early indications are that other countries are prepared to move forward without the United States,\" Earnest told reporters in Washington. \"It means that other country's products are going to be cheaper for some countries to import, and that's going to put U.S. businesses at even greater disadvantage.\" \n Kerry said that the U.S. and Vietnam have shared support for security and freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, which Vietnam along with China and four other government claims in whole or in part. \n \"We believe all countries in the region, whether big or small, that they all refrain from provocative acts that add to tensions or might lead to greater militarization of the area,\" he said. \n He also repeated the U.S. opposition to coercion or threat of force \"by any state to assert its claim over another\u2026 and I'm confident that the next administration will continue to adhere with the same good faith to that policy.\" \n China claims virtually the entire South China Sea. The U.S. has challenged Beijing's assertiveness and the construction of islands in the disputed waters by sending warships close to the man-made features. \n Kerry, a Vietnam War veteran, also praised relations with his former foes, saying two-way trade had jumped from just $451 million 20 years ago, when U.S.-Vietnamese ties were normalized, to more than $45 billion. \n The number of Vietnamese students studying in the U.S. also has increased from 800 to 21,000, while American visitors to the communist country rose from 60,000 to half a million. \n Kerry, however, urged greater respect for human rights in Vietnam. \n The U.S and some European governments often criticize Vietnam for arresting or jailing people who peacefully express their views. Hanoi has said it only jails law breakers. \n Kerry and Sen. John McCain, who was held prisoner of war when his Navy jet was shot down over Hanoi during the war, were key participants in the efforts to normalize relations in 1995. \n Earlier Friday, Kerry held separate meetings with Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc and acting Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son. \n He is scheduled Saturday to tour the Mekong delta province of Ca Mau, where he fought almost 50 years ago. \n Kerry then travels to Paris to attend a conference on Middle East peace and to London, where he will meet Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to discuss Syria. \n The most traveled top diplomat in U.S history ends his trip by attending the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos on Jan. 18, just two days before Trump is sworn in with former oilman Rex Tillerson nominated as Kerry's replacement. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Kerry defends trade pact on last trip as top U.S. diplomat"}

It allows EU exporters to ship their goods to any EU country free of tariffs. \n Losing that freedom is a particular concern for the many foreign firms in London who use the British capital not only as a financial hub but as an entry point into the EU. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lawmakers urge British PM May to clarify Brexit intentions"}

Kealoha and her husband, outgoing Honolulu Police Chief Louis Kealoha, have been embroiled in a grand jury investigation into alleged conspiracy and corruption that centers around them and several police officers. \n According to Breiner, the investigation's special prosecutor, Michael Wheat, issued a subpoena Thursday for Katherine Kealoha to turn over two of her work laptops. However, Honolulu Prosecutor Keith Kaneshiro and Breiner each objected, he said.

He needed permission to use the internet or watch television shows that might arouse him. \n Protesters had welcomed his arrest in August. Cheryl Holbrook, who said she was raped as a teen, though not a Hubbart victim, had shed tears of relief at the news he was in custody. \n Holbrook was glad Loftus committed him today to spend more time in the mental hospital, but she was frustrated it wasn't longer. \n \"He needs to rot in there and never come out,\" Holbrook said. \"He failed his polygraph.

John Lewis says he's doesn't consider Donald Trump a \"legitimate president,\" blaming the Russians for helping the Republican win the White House. \n The Georgia congressman and leader in the civil rights movement of the 1960s said he will skip next week's inauguration of Trump at the Capitol, joining several other Democrats who have decided to boycott the historic event. \n \"You know, I believe in forgiveness. I believe in trying to work with people. It will be hard. It's going to be very difficult. I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president,\" Lewis said in an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that will air on Sunday. \n \"I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton,\" Lewis said. \n U.S. Intelligence agencies have said Russia meddled in the election to help Trump win. After spending weeks challenging that assessment, Trump finally accepted that the Russians were behind the election-year hacking of Democrats that roiled the White House race. However, he also emphasized that \"there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.\" \n Lewis explained his decision to stay away from the inauguration as \"you cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right.\" \n He said it will be the first inauguration he has missed in three decades, a time that includes Democrats and Republicans taking the oath of office. \n The 16-term congressman testified earlier this week against Trump's choice of Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general, citing the Alabama Republican's record on ensuring minorities have the right to vote. Lewis was beaten and bloodied during the fight for civil and voting rights. \n Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, who met with Trump Friday, said he considered Lewis a friend and great man, but \"the idea of constantly looking for ways to delegitimize the results of an election, no matter how unhappy you are about it, isn't the best example we set.\" \n Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona said Friday on the House floor that he, too, would be staying home. He said the move is not motivated by disrespect for the office. He said he is staying home to protest what he called \"disrespect\" shown to Americans by the incoming administration and by the actions being taken in Congress.

Best known for Disneyland, and long a hothouse of conservatism in a blue state, it was the largest county in the country to flip. \n The shift was expected eventually. Orange County's citrus groves turned to tract housing decades back to welcome a mostly white influx from Los Angeles and Midwestern states. Today, though, Santa Ana's quinceanera shops reflect a county that is a third Latino. One in five Orange Countians is Asian. \n The hopes and anxieties stirred by Trump's inauguration spotlight even more complicated tensions. \n Most Vietnamese traditionally voted for Republicans, viewed as opponents of communism. But many of their adult children, also refugees, see Trump as rejecting American ideals and people like them. \n Local Republicans, who once embraced the John Birch Society and recently erected a statue of Ronald Reagan in the park where he launched two White House bids, long espoused a muscular conservatism. Most voted for Trump, but not without soul-searching. \n At Jimmy Camp's house, a \"No Trump\" sign made by Camp's son still hangs in the window. Heading out to feed his family's goat and potbellied pig, Camp recalls his start in Republican politics three decades ago \u2014 knocking on doors for candidates to earn cash. \n Camp played guitar in a rock band then and embraced platforms calling for government to stay out of people's lives. He'd always loved the outdoors in a county that stretches from the ocean to the Santa Ana Mountains. After meeting county native Richard Nixon, he read up on the disgraced president's often forgotten chartering of the Environmental Protection Agency. \n Camp became one of the state's busiest Republican political consultants. Then, last summer he emailed fellow Republicans, renouncing his party membership because of his disgust with Trump. \n \"If you go through and look at everything Jesus said in the Bible, this guy is opposite of it,\" says Camp, 52, a pastor's son. \n Camp, who has friends from Iran and Egypt, cringes at a president who would castigate Muslims as supposedly tied to terrorists, though he doubts Trump will fulfill his most extreme rhetoric. \n \"I hope he doesn't drive us off a cliff,\" Camp says. \"I hope that we survive the next four years. I think we will.\" \n Others voice confidence in Trump. \n Gloria Pruyne says her family had reservations about Trump's morality early on. But the conservative activist ended up knocking on more than 500 doors to get out the vote. Now Pruyne, 78, says she wants Trump to install a conservative Supreme Court justice, revoke an Affordable Care Act she blames for a $500 increase in her family's monthly insurance bill, and back Israel. \n \"We're looking forward to a radical change with this president,\" she says. \n With the inauguration approaching, Ron Brindle has no plans to remove the 5-foot-square portrait of Trump from his oil well fronting a main road in Huntington Beach. Brindle bought this land for his tree nursery business more than 40 years ago. Today, it is surrounded by tract homes, many owned by Asian families. \n \"Now I don't have anything against any of them, but what happened to the country?\" Brindle says. \n The first thing Trump should do, he says, is close the border so Americans no longer have to foot the bill to care for foreigners. But Brindle also hopes that Trump will reach out to skeptics. \n Steven Mai is ready to listen. Mai, a 42-year-old registered Republican, rejected Trump for criticizing the Muslim parents of a slain American soldier. \n But Trump will be his president, Mai says. \n Still, if Trump really wants to lead, he should come to places like Orange County, says Mai's wife, Tammy Tran. He could work in a sandwich shop for a few hours, or see what it's like to care for an elderly person.

John Thune, R-S.D., and Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, listen to a question during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Ascendant Republicans drove a budget through Congress today that gives them an early but critical victory in their crusade to scrap President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. \n The vote trains the spotlight on whether they and Donald Trump can deliver on repeated pledges to not just erase that statute but replace it. \n Demonstrating the GOP's willingness to plunge into a defining but risky battle, the House used a near party-line 227-198 roll call to approve a budget that prevents Senate Democrats from derailing a future bill, thus far unwritten, annulling and reshaping Obama's landmark 2010 law. The budget, which won Senate approval early Thursday, does not need the president's signature. \n \"The 'Unaffordable' Care Act will soon be history!\" Trump tweeted in a dig at the statute's name, the Affordable Care Act. Trump takes the presidential oath next Friday. \n But the real work looms in coming months as the new administration and congressional Republicans write binding legislation to erase much of the health care law and replace it with a GOP version. Republicans still have internal divisions over what that would look like, though past GOP proposals have cut much of the existing law's federal spending and eased coverage requirements while relying more on tax benefits and letting states make decisions. \n Today's final vote was preceded by debate that saw hyperbole on both sides and underscored how the two parties have alternate-universe views of Obama's overhaul. Democrats praised it for extending coverage to tens of millions of Americans, helping families afford policies and seniors buy prescriptions, while Republicans focused on the rising premiums and deductibles and limited access to doctors and insurers that have plagued many. \n House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said the health care law was \"so arrogant and so contrary to our founding principles\" and had not delivered on Obama's promises to lower costs and provide more choice. \n \"We have to step in before things get worse. This is nothing short of a rescue mission,\" Ryan said. \n \"Our experimentation in Soviet-style central planning of our health care system has been an abject failure,\" said freshman Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas. \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Ryan was peddling \"mythology\" and said the GOP was moving toward making things worse for health care consumers. \n \"They want to cut benefits and run. They want to cut access and run,\" she said of Republicans. \n \"This is a sad day in the history of this country as Republicans begin the process of destroying health care in America,\" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who said the GOP has no replacement in hand. \n \"All you have is smoke and mirrors, and the American people are getting ready to get screwed,\" he said. \n Approval of the budget means Senate Democrats won't be allowed to filibuster the future repeal-and-replace bill \u2014 a pivotal advantage for Republicans. They control the Senate 52-48, but it takes 60 votes to end filibusters, which are endless procedural delays that can scuttle legislation. \n Congressional Republicans have made annulling Obama's law and replacing it a top goal for the past seven years. GOP rifts and an Obama veto prevented them from achieving anything other than holding scores of votes that served as political messaging. \n Trump also made targeting Obama's statute a primary target during his campaign. At his news conference Wednesday, Trump \u2014 who's supplied few details of what he wants \u2014 said his emerging plan will be \"far less expensive and far better\" than the statute. \n Despite their conceptual unity, plenty of Republicans have shown skittishness in recent days about the political repercussions of charging into a battle that, with Trump in the White House, puts enacting new laws within reach. \n Many congressional Republicans expressed opposition to leaders' initial emphasis on first passing a repeal bill and then focusing on a replacement \u2014 a process that could produce a gap of months or longer. Trump has also pushed Congress to act fast. \n Twenty million Americans are covered by Obama's expansion of Medicaid or by policies sold on exchanges, and millions of others have benefited from the coverage requirements It has imposed on insurers. Many Republicans have insisted on learning how their party will re-craft the nation's $3 trillion-a-year health care system before voting to void existing programs. \n There are internal GOP chasms over Republican leaders' plans to use their bill to halt federal payments to Planned Parenthood and pare Medicaid coverage. There are also disagreements over how to pay for the GOP replacement, with many Republicans leery of Ryan's proposal to tax part of the value of some health insurance provided by employers. \n Even with their disputes, the GOP's rallying behind their budget spotlighted the political imperative facing Republicans to deliver on a battle cry that has sustained them for years. \n Moving ahead on the budget was \"a bottom-line, party survival vote,\" said Thomas P. Miller, a health care authority at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "In early GOP win on health care repeal, Congress OKs budget"}

At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. \n Under the deal, Takata will pay a $25 million criminal fine, $125 million to individuals injured by the air bags and $850 million to automakers that purchased the inflators. \n A federal judge will be asked to appoint attorney Kenneth Feinberg to distribute restitution payments. \n Payments to individuals must be made soon. Money due to automakers must be paid within five days of Takata's anticipated sale or merger. Takata is expected to be sold to another auto supplier or investor sometime this year. \n \"Automotive suppliers who sell products that are supposed to protect consumers from injury or death must put safety ahead of profits,\" said Barbara McQuade, the U.S. Attorney in Detroit, whose office worked on a two-year investigation into the company. \"If they choose instead to engage in fraud, we will hold accountable the individuals and business entities who are responsible.\" \n The Justice Department was criticized for failing to charge any individuals in earlier high-profile cases against automakers General Motors and Toyota. Now it's done so twice in one week. Prosecutors disclosed the indictment of six Volkswagen executives Wednesday when they announced a settlement of a criminal probe into the German car company's emissions-cheating scheme. \n Today, prosecutors unsealed a Detroit federal grand jury indictment of three former Takata executives, Shinichi Tanaka, Hideo Nakajima and Tsuneo Chikaraishi. All were suspended by the company last year. Takata, based in Japan, has its U.S. headquarters in the Detroit suburb of Auburn Hills, Michigan. \n According to an indictment, as early as 2000 the trio falsified and altered reports to hide from automakers tests that showed the inflators could rupture or otherwise fail to meet specifications. They were charged with six counts of conspiracy and wire fraud. Takata was charged separately with one count of wire fraud. All three worked in Japan and at Takata's U.S. operations. \n \"Defendants commonly referred to the removal or alteration of unfavorable test data that was to be provided to Takata customers as 'XX-ing' the data,\" the indictment says. In June 2005, Nakajima said in an email that \"they had no choice but to manipulate test data, and that they needed to 'cross the bridge together.'\" \n Tanaka served as executive vice president of inflator global operations, while Nakajima was director of engineering in the automotive systems laboratory and Chikaraishi was chief of Japan-Asia inflator operations, according to prosecutors. \n All three are now in Japan, and McQuade said her office will work with authorities there to extradite them to the U.S. for trial. \"Extradition is not automatic. It is discretionary with Japan,\" she said. But she added that her office has had success in extraditing Japanese executives in automotive parts price-fixing cases. \n As of 2015, Takata was the second-largest supplier of air bags in the world, accounting for 20 percent of the air bags sold. \n The government said Takata had minimal internal controls and failed to notice its executives' misconduct for years. It alleged that Takata falsified test data to deceive automakers that used its inflators in their vehicles. Once senior Takata executives did learn that employees had falsified air bag reports, in 2009, they failed to take disciplinary action against those employees until 2015. \n McQuade said Takata wanted to make profits on air bags \"knowing that they were creating a risk for the end user, soccer moms like me who drives around in my Ford Edge with my kids, who at any moment could get involved in a fender-bender and send a metal projectile into my face,\" McQuade said. \"The risk that they allowed to happen is really reprehensible.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1 billion for hiding defect"}

Rafting companies and their employees sought lost income and wages because they couldn't take visitors on river trips. Some homeowners sought damages because they said their wells were affected. \n \"We had direct revenue losses of $50,000-plus,\" said Alex Mickel, owner of Mild to Wild Rafting in Durango, Colorado. \n Mickel said the EPA had left him with the impression it would compensate for economic losses. \n \"That just amazes me that they would do just a complete reversal,\" he said in an interview. Mickel said he would consult with his attorney on his next move. \n The August 2015 spill at the Gold King Mine in southwestern Colorado released 3 million gallons of wastewater tainted with iron, aluminum, manganese, lead, copper and other metals. The Animas and San Juan rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah were polluted, with stretches of waterway turning an eerie orange-yellow. \n Some of the affected rivers pass through Indian reservations. \n Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye said the nation would keep pushing for compensation. \n \"It was devastating to both the Navajo Nation and to the farmers,\" he said. \"Even today, people still question if the water is clean enough for farming, livestock or human consumption.\" \n The EPA has said water quality in the rivers has returned to pre-spill conditions. \n Members of Congress expressed anger and disappointment at the EPA decision. New Mexico Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich and Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, all Democrats, accused the agency of reneging on a pledge. \n \"We are outraged at this last-ditch move by the federal government's lawyers to go back on the EPA's promise to the people of the state of New Mexico \u2014 and especially the Navajo Nation \u2014 that it would fully address this environmental disaster that still plagues the people of the Four Corners region.\" \n Members of Colorado's congressional delegation said they would introduce legislation to repay economic damage. \n \"When the law allows the government to hide from those whom it has harmed, the law must change,\" Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner said. \n An EPA-led contractor crew triggered the spill while doing exploratory excavation work at the mine entrance in advance of a possible cleanup. The Gold King is one of hundreds of inactive mines in the Colorado mountains that continuously spew polluted water into rivers or have the potential to do so. \n The EPA has designated the area a Superfund site to pay for a broad cleanup. Initial research is underway. \n State, federal and tribal officials have been harshly critical of the EPA for causing the spill and for its handling of the aftermath, including the costs. The Navajo Nation and the state of New Mexico have already sued the agency in federal court, and other lawsuits are likely after Friday's announcement. \n Last month, the EPA said it would pay $4.5 million to state, local and tribal governments to cover the cost of their emergency response to the spill, but the agency rejected $20.4 million in other requests for past and future expenses, again citing federal law. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "EPA says it can't pay economic damages from mine spill"}

He had remained on the NYPD's payroll as a detective until his death, but he was best known as an international voice for peace and a source of support for other wounded police officers. \n McDonald was on patrol on July 12, 1986, when he spotted bicycle thief Shavod \"Buddha\" Jones and two other teenagers in Central Park. When he moved to frisk one of them, the 15-year-old Jones shot McDonald three times, with one bullet piercing the officer's spinal column and leaving him paralyzed from the neck down. \n About six months later, with McDonald still struggling to recover, he made a statement about Jones through his wife that defined the rest of his life: \"I forgive him and hope he can find peace and purpose in his life.\" \n His son, Conor \u2014 who is the same age his dad was when he was shot and now a fourth-generation officer \u2014 was interrupted by three ovations as he described his father as a \"real Superman.\" He could count on his father to call him at 5 a.m. every day to check in before his son would go on patrol, he said. \n \"He was the greatest man I could ask to be my father,\" he said. \n McDonald was also a die-hard hockey fan who gave powerful speeches at ceremonies for a New York Rangers award named in his honor, said former player Adam Graves. \n \"I want to make one thing clear: Steven McDonald meant more to the New York Rangers and our fans than we could ever mean to him,\" Graves said. \n Pallbearers removed the officer's casket from St. Patrick's to the sound of church bells and the salutes of hundreds of uniformed officers.

{"date": "January 13, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Tax form 8962 is seen in Washington. If you haven't signed up for health insurance this year, you may be getting a nudge from the taxman. \n WASHINGTON >> If you haven't signed up for health insurance, you may soon be getting a not-too-subtle nudge from the taxman. \n The IRS is sending personalized letters to millions of taxpayers who might be uninsured, reminding them that they could be on the hook for hundreds of dollars in fines under the federal health care law if they don't sign up soon. It's an unusual role for a revenue-collection agency. \n Fines are one of the most unpopular parts of the 2010 health overhaul, and there's a high likelihood they'll get repealed by Republicans, even if other parts of \"Obamacare\" survive. The administration is counting on IRS reminders to help sign up as many people as possible before open enrollment ends Jan. 31. That's soon after officials hand off President Barack Obama's signature program to a Trump administration committed to \"repeal and replace.\" \n Letters bearing the IRS logo will be sent to an estimated 7.5 million people who either claimed an exemption from the law's requirement that most Americans carry health insurance, or who paid a penalty for being uninsured during the 2015 tax year. The coverage requirement was included in the law as a way to get healthy people into the insurance pool, helping to keep premiums in check. \n The penalty for this year could be $2,085 or more, depending on family size and income, says one draft version of the IRS letter. Another draft takes a somewhat different approach, leaving a blank space for the IRS to provide an individualized estimate of what the particular uninsured taxpayer might owe. \n The drafts were obtained by The Associated Press. Although the administration has made no secret of the IRS role in open enrollment this year, officials have not responded to requests for copies of the actual letters. \n Republicans say the whole thing is a waste of money. The campaign will cost about $4 million, say congressional aides. \n \"People receiving these letters have already made up their minds about Obamacare when they applied for an exemption or paid a penalty,\" said House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas. \"They don't want stock letters. They want better health care choices and lower costs.\" \n Supporters of the health care law say research has shown that many people who remain uninsured are still unaware that they can go to HealthCare.gov and qualify for government subsidies to help pay their premiums. Those subsidies were designed as tax credits, bringing the IRS into the picture. The IRS letters make the pitch: \n \"Most people who enroll in a plan through HealthCare.gov can find plans for $75 a month or less after financial help,\" the letters say. \"At HealthCare.gov, you can compare plans to find one that meets your needs and budget.\" \n While such low-cost plans are available, many people actually pay more, and the $75 figure doesn't take into account deductibles and copayments. The average monthly premium last year for HealthCare.gov customers was $106, after financial help, according to the government. The administration has not released a comparable premium estimate for this year. Insurers raised their sticker prices significantly, but the law's subsidies should cushion the impact for most HealthCare.gov customers. \n About 800,000 letters went out after Thanksgiving, and an additional 6.7 million are going out now, according to congressional aides. \n Last year about 6.5 million people paid fines for being uninsured, averaging $470, according to recent IRS data. The amount is generally deducted from a taxpayer's anticipated refund. The fines started small in 2014, but are now fully phased in, starting at about $700. \n The administration has a goal of signing up 13.8 million people for coverage this year and is looking for a strong finish to open enrollment season. Although the Affordable Care Act has reduced the nation's uninsured rate to a historic low, it remains politically divisive. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Personalized IRS letters nudge uninsured to get coverage"}

{"date": "January 13, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED RPESS \n President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower. \n LONDON >> Christopher Steele, the one-time British spy who has compiled an explosive dossier on President-elect Donald Trump, is a well-regarded operative who wouldn't make up stories to satisfy his clients, according to diplomatic and intelligence experts who know him. \n Steele, 52, worked for MI6, Britain's overseas intelligence agency, and served in Moscow in the early 1990s. After leaving the agency, he and a partner started Orbis Business Intelligence Ltd. in 2009. The firm provides strategic advice, gathers intelligence and conducts cross-border investigations, according to its website. \n \"I know him as a very competent, professional operator who left the secret service and is now operating his own private company,\" Andrew Wood, Britain's ambassador to Russia from 1995 to 2000, told the BBC on Friday. \"I do not think he would make things up. I don't think he would, necessarily, always draw correct judgment, but that's not the same thing.\" \n The dossier was reportedly produced as opposition research for the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and was being discussed in Washington as early as October, even though its details weren't widely reported until this week. The report contains unproven information on close coordination between Trump's inner circle and the Russians about hacking into Democratic accounts \u2014 as well as unproven claims about unusual sexual activities by Trump attributed to anonymous sources. The Associated Press has not authenticated any of the claims. \n Wood said U.S. Sen. John McCain asked him about the document during a security conference in November because of Wood's relationship with Steele. After their conversation, McCain made arrangements to get a copy of the report, Wood told the BBC. \n Wood is now an associate fellow at the think tank Chatham House and is a consultant for companies with interests in Russia. \n Three British intelligence officers interviewed by The Associated Press described Steele as well regarded in the intelligence community, with excellent Russian skills and high-level sources. \n Although Steele wasn't a senior figure in MI6, one of the officials said because of Steele's experience on the Russia desk and the high-level contacts he had during his time in Moscow, he was brought in to help with the case of Alexander Litvinenko, the former Russian secret service officer and Kremlin critic who was poisoned in 2006 in London by polonium-210, a radioactive substance. The official, who worked primarily on Eastern Europe, said he had no other details of Steele's involvement in the case. \n James Nixey, the head of Chatham House's Russia and Eurasia program, told the AP that parts of the document created by Steele \"read exactly as reports from the secret services that we have been allowed to see before.\" \n \"Some of the practices which we know and which are confirmed to have happened during Soviet and post-Soviet times are reported in this dossier,\" Nixey said, adding that Russia's denials were also part of a Cold War pattern in which the Kremlin \"would outright deny something which is quite plainly true.\" \n All three of the former intelligence officials, however, cast doubt on whether the material in the report and its level of detail would have come from active sources within Russia. The material, they said, was more likely to have come from conversations with third parties. \n Wood said it seems unlikely that Russian operatives intentionally lied to Steele. He added that it is not surprising that he has gone into hiding. \n \"Russia would certainly like to know where he got his information from, assuming his information is basically true and he hasn't just made it up, which I don't think for a moment,\" Wood said. \"And they're accustomed to take action.\" \n Still, British and Russian intelligence agents have a long history of spying on one another and setting traps. \n James Hudson, Britain's former deputy counsel in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, resigned in 2009 after a film emerged showing him with two women thought to be prostitutes. More recently, Britain was involved in a diplomatic flap after a former official under then-Prime Minister Tony Blair admitted that British authorities had rigged up a fake rock in Moscow to spy on Russians. \n Nixey said Moscow is unlikely to have changed its habits \"for the simple reason that the Russians believe they are at war with the West.\" Anyone, he said, with a \"considerable degree of involvement with Russia, goes there frequently on business, is going to be looked at, to a greater or lesser extent.\" \n Russians have even coined a word for this type of compromising material: kompromat. \n \"The point about kompromat \u2014 the Soviet tradition of having compromising information on individuals \u2014 is that it's more powerful if it is not used than if it is. Once you've used it, it's gone. The person may have been destroyed but the game is over,\" Nixey said. \"But when you've still got it in your back pocket, then it is most powerful, like weapons.\" \n Steele was posted by MI6 to Moscow in 1990. Within months, the Soviet Union was collapsing and change was afoot under soon-to-be Russian President Boris Yeltsin. \n \"The work was hard, the times were tough and there was constant harassment from the KGB,\" a family friend wrote in a eulogy posted by Steele after his first wife died in 2009. \"On one occasion, they even stole Laura's favorite shoes \u2014 from their flat \u2014 just before an official dinner.\" \n On the day in 1991 when Yeltsin stood on a tank outside the Russian parliament to defy a coup against Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms, the friend called Steele's wife in Moscow. \n \"Characteristically she told me that Chris was fine, because he'd been sent on the streets to find out what was going on,\" he said in the eulogy. \"'What about you' I asked?

Williams is a suspect in the kidnapping of a baby girl in Jacksonville, Fla., 18 years ago. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n State Attorney Florida's 4th Judicial Circuit Melissa Nelson, answered questions as Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams listened during a news conference, today, in Jacksonville, Fla., where it was announced they found Kamiyah Mobley was alive and well in South Carolina. Mobley was kidnapped from a Jacksonville hospital as a newborn 18 years ago. \n WALTERBORO, South Carolina >> Stolen from a hospital just hours after she was born, an 18-year-old woman finally learned her true identity and was reunited today with her birth family, by video chat. The woman she thought was her mother was charged with her kidnapping. \n Thanks to DNA analysis, the 18-year-old now knows her birth name: Kamiyah Mobley. She's in good health, but understandably overwhelmed, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said at a news conference. \n Police arrested Gloria Williams, 51, in Walterboro, South Carolina, where Mobley was raised in a small house with white vinyl siding and black trim, about 200 miles from the hospital where she was born. She will be extradited to Florida on charges of kidnapping and interference with custody, authorities said. \n In Jacksonville, the young woman's birth family cried \"tears of joy\" after a detective told them their baby had been found. Within hours today, they were able to reconnect by video chat. \n \"She looks just like her daddy,\" her paternal grandmother, Velma Aiken of Jacksonville, told The Associated Press after they were able to see each other for the first time, on FaceTime. \"She act like she been talking to us all the time. She told us she'd be here soon to see us.\" \n Mobley was only eight hours old when she was taken from her young mother by a woman posing as a nurse at University Medical Center. A massive search ensued, with helicopters circling the hospital and the city on high alert, and thousands of tips came in over the years, but she had disappeared. \n All that time, Kamiyah's neighbors in Walterboro knew her as Gloria William's daughter, Alexis Manigo. \n \"She wasn't an abused child or a child who got in trouble. But she grew up with a lie for 18 years,\" Joseph Jenkins, who lives across the street, told the AP. \n Some months ago, the young woman \"had an inclination\" that she may have been kidnapped, the sheriff said. Authorities didn't say why she suspected this, or how her case came to the attention of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. \n But the center soon reached out to the cold case detectives at the sheriff's office, and Mobley provided a swab of her cheek for DNA analysis that proved the match, the sheriff said. \n The center has tracked 308 infant abductions since 1983 by nonfamily members in the U.S. Of those cases, 12 were still missing at the end of last month. That's now one number smaller. \n \"She's taking it as well as you can imagine. She has a lot to process,\" the sheriff said. \"I can't even begin to comprehend it.\" \n The woman has been provided with counseling, the sheriff said. Meanwhile, Aiken is thrilled to know that they can speak with each other as much as they want. \n \"I always prayed, 'Don't let me die before I see my grand baby',\" said Aiken. \"My prayer was answered.\" \n The family never forgot the little girl ripped from her mother's arms that day in 1988. \n Her mother, Shanara Mobley, told the Florida Times-Union newspaper on the 10th anniversary of the kidnapping that on every one of Kamiyah's birthdays, she wrapped a piece of birthday cake in foil and stuck it in her freezer. \n \"It's stressful to wake up every day, knowing that your child is out there and you have no way to reach her or talk to her,\" Mobley told the paper in 2008. \n News moved quickly through the community of about 5,100 people early today after police cars swarmed Williams' home. Joseph Jenkins said he awoke to see officers searching the house and the shed around back. \n \"At the fish market, the hair dresser, the gas station, they're all talking about it,\" said Ruben Boatwright, who said he's known Williams for about 15 years. \n Lakeshia Jenkins, Joseph's wife, said Williams and the girl would often come over for cookouts in the yard, or join their family at a nearby water park. Kamiyah seemed to be well cared for, and \"Ms. Williams, she seemed like a normal person,\" Jenkins said. \n \"She went to work, came back here and went to church every Sunday,\" she said. \n Williams also worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs' hospital in Charleston, volunteered in the area for Habitat for Humanity and lead the youth program at a Methodist church, she said. \n \"She's very intelligent, smart as a whip,\" Boatwright said. \"All I can say are good things about her.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Woman kidnapped as newborn 18 years ago from Florida hospital is alive"}

{"date": "January 13, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Thousands of demonstrators march along Wilshire Boulevard during an immigration protest near MacArthur Park in Los Angeles. Immigrant rights advocates are planning demonstrations at dozens of rallies around the country this weekend in what they are calling \"the first salvo\" against President-elect Donald Trump's pledged hard line on immigration. \n WASHINGTON >> Immigrant rights advocates are planning demonstrations at dozens of rallies across the country this weekend in what they are calling a \"first salvo\" against President-elect Donald Trump's pledged hard line on immigration. \n Union leaders and young immigrants are organizing more than 50 protests and cultural events from Philadelphia to Phoenix on Saturday with an aim toward highlighting the power of the immigrant rights movement. Immigrants living in the country illegally also hope the events will make it clear to the incoming administration that they don't plan to leave the country despite Trump's calls for a border wall, tougher immigration enforcement and mass deportations. \n \"This is our first salvo to what may be a long, drawn out campaign,\" said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, spokesman for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. \n The protests mark the latest chapter in a movement that has evolved considerably since 2006, when more than a million people took to the streets to protest a Republican-backed immigration bill that would have made it a crime to be in the country illegally. The bill was widely viewed as overly harsh and sparked a backlash that culminated in massive May Day marches across the country. \n The crowds this weekend are expected to be nowhere near as big as then, including rallies at a church in Washington and teachers' union hall in Chicago. In Los Angeles and San Jose, California, groups are holding cultural events to show their support of immigrants and opposition to Trump's proposals. \n Times have clearly changed since 2006. The protests born of anger and frustration a decade ago with the immigration bill haven't been repeated in recent years as the playbook evolved and advocacy groups started making direct appeals to lawmakers and the president. \n After multiple proposals failed in Congress, President Barack Obama in 2012 launched an executive effort to protect some young immigrants from deportation. \n The creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, aimed at helping one of the loudest and most sympathetic immigrant groups, was heralded as a good first step by advocates who hoped it would be a prelude toward overhauling immigration laws. \n But that didn't happen, and Republican-led states pushed back against Obama's plans to expand the program. \n Now the focus is on the next administration, and the future of the movement seems as uncertain as Trump's plans. \n As a candidate, Trump promised his supporters stepped-up deportations and a Mexican-funded border wall, but it is unclear which plans the celebrity businessman will act on first, and when. And many immigrants are fearful of the campaign rhetoric but less motivated to protest in the absence of specific actions. \n \"Right now, all we have is these vague kinds of promises,\" said Chris Zepeda-Millan, a professor of ethnic studies at University of California, Berkeley. \"Attacks have to occur for people to mobilize.\" \n One factor that could influence what actions immigrant activists take going forward \u2014 and how much support they draw \u2014 is how Trump handles the group of more than 750,000 young immigrants covered by Obama's DACA program. Many are college-educated and politically savvy and have been willing to hold sit-ins and risk arrest to push for immigration changes. \n They are also factoring prominently in many of Saturday's events. Instead of protests, a coalition of immigration groups in Phoenix will have a news conference and information clinic where young immigrants will deliver personal testimony about how Obama's program changed their lives. A separate event includes a panel with immigration attorneys and experts on how to prepare for changes under Trump. \n What is certain is that the immigration rights movement has come a long way since its most public stand in 2006. And the days of nearly everyone staying entirely in the shadows are likely over. \n \"Coming forward as undocumented and unafraid has been really a hallmark\" of the movement in recent years, said Cecilia Munoz, who heads Obama's Domestic Policy Council and was a top official with the National Council of La Raza during the early days of immigration protests. \"The immigration rights movement has developed enormously \u2026 and 2006 was a moment in which people came forward and decided, 'We are not invisible anymore.'\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Immigrant groups to rally against Trump's planned crackdown"}

The Department of Justice is poised to release its report detailing the extent of civil rights violations committed by the Chicago Police Department. \n CHICAGO >> The Justice Department today laid bare years of civil rights violations by Chicago police, blasting the nation's second-largest department for using excessive force that included shooting at people who did not pose a threat and using stun guns on others only because they refused to follow commands. \n The report was issued after a yearlong investigation sparked by the 2014 death of a black teenager who was shot 16 times by a white officer. The federal investigation looked broadly at policing and concluded that officers were not sufficiently trained or supported and that many who were accused of misconduct were rarely investigated or disciplined. \n The findings come just a week before a change in administration that could reorder priorities at the Justice Department. Under President Barack Obama, the government has conducted 25 civil rights investigations of police departments, including those in Cleveland, Baltimore and Seattle. President-elect Donald Trump's position on the federal review process is unclear. His nominee for attorney general has expressed reservations about the system, especially the reliance on courts to bring about changes. \n Asked about the investigation's future, outgoing Attorney General Loretta Lynch said talks between Chicago and the government would go on regardless \"of who is at the top of the Justice Department.\" \n The federal government's recommendations follow an especially bloody year on Chicago streets. The city logged 762 homicides in 2016, the highest tally in 20 years and more than the combined total of the two largest U.S. cities \u2014 New York and Los Angeles. \n The Chicago department, with 12,000 officers, has long had a reputation for brutality, particularly in minority communities. The most notorious example was Jon Burge, commander of a detective unit on the South Side. Burge and his men beat, suffocated and used electric shock for decades starting in the 1970s to get black men to confess to crimes they did not commit. \n Chicago officers endangered civilians, caused avoidable injuries and deaths and eroded community trust that is \"the cornerstone of public safety,\" said Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department's civil rights division. \n The investigation began in December 2015 after the release of dashcam video showing the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Laquan McDonald, who was walking away from police holding a small folded knife. The video, which the city fought to keep secret, inspired large protests and cost the city's police commissioner his job. \n Friday's report \"confirms what civil rights lawyers have been saying for decades,\" said attorney Matt Topic, who helped lead the legal fight for the release of the McDonald footage. \"It is momentous and pretty rewarding to see that finally confirmed by the U.S. government.\" \n Investigators described a class for officers on the use of force that showed a video made 35 years ago \u2014 before key U.S. Supreme Court rulings that affected police practices nationwide. When instructors spoke further on the topic, several recruits did not appear to be paying attention and at least one was sleeping, the report said. \n Justice Department agents who questioned Chicago officers found that only 1 out of 6 who were in training or who just completed the police academy \"came close to properly articulating the legal standard for use of force,\" the report said. \n Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the results of the investigation were \"sobering\" and pledged to make changes beyond those already adopted. Federal authorities and city officials have signed an agreement that offers a broad outline for reform, including commitments to improved transparency, training and accountability for bad officers. \n The report alluded to racial bias but did not center on it. A Department of Justice statement issued with the report said investigators \"identified serious concerns about the prevalence of racially discriminatory conduct by some CPD officers and the degree to which that conduct is tolerated.\" \n Black Lives Matter activists said they do not trust Emanuel to make real changes. \n \"I don't believe him any more than I believed him when he said that he never saw the Laquan McDonald video before the public saw it,\" said Arewa Karen Winters, who said she was the great aunt of 16-year-old Pierre Loury, who was fatally shot by police last year. \n Kofi Ademola said he was heartened by many of the government's conclusions. But with the Trump administration taking over, \"we have no idea how this is going to play out.\" \n Chicago has spent more than half a billion dollars to settle claims of police misconduct since 2004. But in half of those cases, police did not conduct disciplinary investigations, according to the federal report. Of 409 police shootings that happened over a five-year period, police found only two were unjustified. \n The Justice Department criticized the city for failing to investigate anonymous complaints or those submitted without a supporting affidavit and for having a \"pervasive cover-up culture.\" \n Investigators said that witnesses and accused officers were frequently never interviewed, that evidence went uncollected and that witnesses were routinely coached by union lawyers. \n \"The procedures surrounding investigations allow for ample opportunity for collusion among officers and are devoid of any rules prohibiting such coordination,\" the report said. \n Misconduct investigations are \"glacially slow,\" with discipline often \"unpredictable and ineffective,\" said Gupta, who described how police used stun guns on people for no other reason than they did not obey officers' verbal commands. \n She also said officers do not get enough support to help them deal with the trauma of their jobs. \n Trump's pick for attorney general, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, expressed concerns at his confirmation hearing this week about the process favored under Obama that relies on intense scrutiny by federal courts. He said he was concerned that such legal action risks smearing entire police departments and harming officer morale. \n The head of Chicago's police union said the Justice Department hurried the investigation to release its findings before Trump takes office. Fraternal Order of Police President Dean Angelo questioned whether the investigation was compromised because of its timing. \n The mayor said Friday that the city has already made some of the recommended changes, citing de-escalation training and stricter use-of-force polices. Emanuel also addressed the Justice Department's concern that officers do not have nearly enough supervision. He pointed to his decision to increase the number of lieutenants and other supervisors. \n The McDonald video showed officer Jason Van Dyke shooting the teen even after he slumped to the ground. Not until the video was released more than a year later was Van Dyke charged with murder. He has pleaded not guilty. Police reports suggested a possible cover-up by other officers who were at the scene. \n Associated Press Writer Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Report says Chicago police violated civil rights for years"}

Ledesma, 28, says her parents owned a house and were raising kids by her age. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Andrea Ledesma spread sauce on pizza dough, Jan. 9, at Classic Slice restaurant in Milwaukee. The 28-year-old has a four-year degree and quit a higher paying job because it made her miserable. \n SOUTH MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin >> Baby Boomers: your millennial children are worse off than you. \n With a median household income of $40,581, millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. \n The analysis being released today gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. \n The generational gap is a central dilemma for the incoming presidency of Donald Trump, who essentially pledged a return to the prosperity of post-World War II America. The analysis also hints at the issues of culture and identity that divided many voters, showing that white millennials \u2014 who still earn much more than their blacks and Latino peers \u2014 have seen their incomes plummet the most relative to boomers. \n Andrea Ledesma, 28, says her parents owned a house and were raising kids by her age. \n Not so for her. Ledesma graduated from college four years ago. After moving through a series of jobs, she now earns $18,000 making pizza at Classic Slice in Milwaukee, shares a two-bedroom apartment with her boyfriend and has $33,000 in student debt. \n \"That's not at all how life is now, that's not something that people strive for and it's not something that is even attainable, and I thought it would be at this point,\" Ledesma said. \n Her mother Cheryl Romanowski, 55, was making about $10,000 a year at her age working at a bank without a college education. In today's dollars, that income would be equal to roughly $19,500. \n Romanowski said she envies the choices that her daughter has in life, but she acknowledged that her daughter has it harder than her. \n \"I think the opportunities have just been fading away,\" she said. \n The analysis of the Fed data shows the extent of the decline. It compared 25 to 34 year-olds in 2013, the most recent year available, to the same age group in 1989 after adjusting for inflation. \n The home ownership rate for this age group dipped to 43 percent from 46 percent in 1989, although the rate has improved for millennials with a college degree relative to boomers. \n The median net worth of millennials is $10,090, 56 percent less than it was for boomers. \n Whites still earn dramatically more than Blacks and Latinos, reflecting the legacy of discrimination for jobs, education and housing. \n Yet compared to white baby boomers, some white millennials appear stuck in a pattern of downward mobility. This group has seen their median income tumble more than 21 percent to $47,688. \n Median income for black millennials has fallen just 1.4 percent to $27,892. Latino millennials earn nearly 29 percent more than their boomer predecessors to $30,436. \n The analysis fits into a broader pattern of diminished opportunity. Research last year by economists led by Stanford University's Raj Chetty found that people born in 1950 had a 79 percent chance of making more money than their parents. That figure steadily slipped over the past several decades, such that those born in 1980 had just a 50 percent chance of out-earning their parents. \n This decline has occurred even though younger Americans are increasingly college-educated. The proportion of 25 to 29 year-olds with a college degree has risen to 35.6 percent in 2015 from 23.2 percent in 1990, a report this month by the Brookings Institution noted. \n The declining fortunes of millennials could impact boomers who are retired or on the cusp of retirement. Payroll taxes from millennials helps to finance the Social Security and Medicare benefits that many boomers receive \u2014 programs that Trump has said won't be subject to spending cuts. And those same boomers will need younger generations to buy their homes and invest in the financial markets to protect their own savings. \n \"The challenges that young adults face today could forecast the challenges that we see down the road,\" said Tom Allison, deputy policy and research director at Young Invincibles. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Millennials are falling behind their boomer parents"}

{"date": "January 13, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Defense Secretary-designate James Mattis testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. \n WASHINGTON >> The Republican-led Congress is moving swiftly to clear the way for retired Gen. James Mattis to run the Pentagon, winning support from Democrats who believe he'll be a bulwark to a president-elect they fear will carry his impulsive, bombastic style into the White House. \n The support underscores concerns over Donald Trump's dearth of military and foreign policy experience as well as the bipartisan respect Mattis cultivated on Capitol Hill during his 44 years in the military. \n The House on Friday is expected to pass legislation that would override a legal barrier preventing Mattis from becoming Trump's defense secretary. The bill would then be sent to the White House. \n It was unclear if President Barack Obama would sign the legislation, or if it would fall to Trump after his inauguration. \n The Senate cleared a similar measure easily, 81-17, after 30 Democrats including Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico backed the bill. The legislation is separate from a Senate confirmation vote on Mattis, but it signals there will be no real hurdle to approving Trump's choice shortly after the president-elect is sworn in next week. \n Heinrich said Thursday that lawmakers needed to consider \"the temperament of the incoming White House team\" in deciding whether to grant an exception to the law that bars former service members who have been out of uniform for less than seven years from holding the top Pentagon job. The restriction is meant to preserve civilian control of the military. Mattis retired from the Marine Corps in 2013. \n Heinrich asked Mattis during his Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing to assure lawmakers he would provide \"sound policy and guidance\" to Trump, especially regarding the possible use of nuclear weapons. \n Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the committee's top Democrat, also backed the waiver legislation because Mattis would act as a \"counterbalance\" to Trump. Reed said many Americans are rightly concerned about how Trump may respond when he is tested by Russia, Iran or North Korea, or faces a cyberattack from an unknown source. \n Reed called Mattis a \"generational exception.\" \n Mattis faced no hostile questions during the hearing. He called Russia the nation's No. 1 security threat and accused its leader, President Vladimir Putin, of trying to \"break\" NATO. \n He described Iran as a major destabilizing force, called North Korea a potential nuclear threat and said the U.S. military needs to be larger and more ready for combat. \n \"We see each day a world awash in change,\" Mattis said. \"Our country is still at war in Afghanistan and our troops are fighting against ISIS and other terrorist groups in the Middle East and elsewhere. Russia is raising grave concerns on several fronts, and China is shredding trust along its periphery.\" \n Mattis portrayed Russia as an adversary and said the history of U.S.-Russian relations is not encouraging. \n \"I have very modest expectations for areas of cooperation with Mr. Putin,\" he said, delivering an assessment very different from that of his potential commander in chief. Trump has repeatedly praised Putin, even as U.S. intelligence agencies have accused the Russian leader of orchestrating a campaign of interference in the 2016 U.S. election. \n \"He is trying to break the North Atlantic alliance,\" Mattis said of Putin. \n He said he has explained to Trump his views on Russia, which include a deep worry that Moscow is determined to use intimidation and nuclear threats to create a sphere of unstable states on its periphery. \n Mattis, who has served in numerous senior military positions, including commander of U.S. Central Command in charge of all American forces in the Middle East, said he supports the Obama administration's moves to reassure European allies after Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and military activity in eastern Ukraine. \n While the U.S. should remain open to working with Russia, Mattis said, the prospects for cooperation were narrowing even as areas of disagreement grow larger. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Choice of Mattis to run Pentagon wins support from Democrats"}

{"date": "January 13, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n CIA Director-designate Rep. Michael Pompeo, R-Kan. testifies Thursday in Washington at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. \n WASHINGTON >> The lack of fireworks surrounding Senate consideration of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks may reflect a belief by minority Democrats that the people chosen are more reasonable than Trump. \n It could also be the residue of a surprising number of statements by Trump's Cabinet choices contradicting the billionaire businessman's oft-stated positions on issues running the gamut from Russia and NATO to nuclear weapons and Muslims. \n This week's confirmation hearings produced an odd political chemistry where, for instance, one of the harshest examinations of a Trump Cabinet choice came from one of Trump's fellow Republicans, presidential campaign rival Sen. Marco Rubio. \n Despite Democrats' dismay over some of Trump's selections, the first week of nomination hearings was relatively tranquil, with Democrats generally restrained in questioning even the more contentious picks. The reason, according to a few Democrats: The nominees are proving more palatable than Trump himself. \n \"As I meet members of the Cabinet I'm puzzled because many of them sound reasonable,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. \"Far more reasonable than their president.\" \n That could change in weeks to come, because some of the most potentially explosive hearings are still pending, including the scrutiny of former Goldman Sachs partner Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary. \n Several of Trump's Cabinet selections this week made statements this week that seemingly or directly contradicted positions and policy announcements by their soon-to-be-boss. \n Sen. Jeff Sessions, picked for attorney general, said he's against any outright ban on immigration by Muslims, in contrast to Trump's onetime call to suspend admittance of Muslims until U.S. officials could learn more about nature of the threat of extremism. \n His secretary of state candidate, Rex Tillerson, took a relatively hard line on Washington's dealings with Russia, even though Trump has been talking about improving relations between Washington and Moscow and held out for days before saying he accepted the intelligence community's conclusion that Moscow meddled in the U.S. election process. \n Tillerson demurred, however, when one senator tried to lure him into calling President Vladimir Putin, whom he knows, a \"war criminal,\" although he emphasized support for NATO commitments that Trump had questioned. \n Some of the toughest questioning of Tillerson came not from Democrats but from Rubio, who grilled the Exxon Mobil executive on human rights issues. \n As Mnuchin's confirmation hearing approaches, Democrats have set up a website to solicit stories from the thousands of people whose homes were foreclosed on by OneWest Bank while he headed a group of investors who owned the bank. They hope to use Mnuchin's nomination hearing to attack Trump's populist appeal with working-class voters and cast themselves as defenders of the middle class. \n Thus far, though, Republicans are congratulating themselves for generally smooth sailing. And overall, the lack of drama may also be due to the decision by Democrats while in the Senate majority to lower the vote threshold for Cabinet nominees and others from 60 votes to 50, allowing Republicans to ensure approval as long as they can hold their 52-seat majority together. \n \"The purpose of confirmation hearings is to examine the record and views of potential nominees and I think that's what these hearings are doing,\" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. \"I think it's likely that all of the Cabinet nominees are going to be confirmed, I think the hearings have gone quite well this week.\" \n A hearing Thursday for neurosurgeon Ben Carson to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development featured some pointed questioning from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but also warm exchanges between Carson and other committee Democrats. Afterward Carson thanked the panel and said that it \"was actually kind of fun.\" \n Sessions was denied confirmation once before by the Senate, but that was three decades ago for a federal judgeship. This time around the Alabaman is a sitting senator and was treated gently, for the most part, by his colleagues, even when Democrats brought up the racial issues that brought him down him last time around. There was potential for drama as Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., broke with Senate tradition to testify against his colleague, but it came on the second day of the hearing after Sessions had finished testifying, so he was not even in the room. \n Tillerson had the rockiest outing thus far, with Rubio pressing him on Russia and Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon confronting him about climate change and other issues. With Rubio and others undecided on supporting Tillerson, his ultimate confirmation is in question. But even with Tillerson, Democrats seemed to pull their punches at times. \n \"I don't want to argue with you,\" Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico remarked at one point, seeming to speak for several colleagues. \n And it was practically bipartisan lovefests at the hearings for the choices for Central Intelligence Agency, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo; retired Gen. James Mattis for Defense; and retired Gen. John Kelly for Homeland Security. \n \"Pompeo's very popular, Mattis, Kelly \u2014 these are popular selections,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. \n The hearings seemed to underscore some emerging dynamics of Trump's relations with Capitol Hill. Despite his highly unconventional approach, and his lack of Capitol Hill experience, many of his appointees and aides could have been selected by any other Republican, and the Senate is responding accordingly. \n And even where Trump's surprising approach raises the potential for problems, congressional Republicans are working overtime to paper them over, not highlight them. \n \"We are in complete sync,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., insisted Thursday in a discussion about a different topic, health care. \n That could change in weeks to come, as the Senate holds hearings on Mnuchin and other more divisive selections. These include conservative Rep. Tom Price for Health and Human Services; Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a vocal denier of climate change science, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency; and fast-food executive Andrew Puzder to head the Labor Department. \n Still, given that it's the Senate, not daytime TV, there may be a limit to the potential for conflict, said Ben Marter, Durbin's communications director. \"You have to adjust your excite-o-meter down a little bit, because it's a Senate hearing. It's not Maury Povich.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Week 1: Dems find Trump's picks more reasonable than Trump"}
