We cannot stop. We have to work. I know that in our pursuit of a brighter future, we still face headwinds. We still face oppositions. We see it. Waves of hatred, waves of intolerance and injustice that are still blowing in this country, and they seem to grow stronger the more that we achieve, Lynch said. \n Lynch took the pulpit of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church for a celebration ahead of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The church was the site of a 1963 Ku Klux Klan bombing that killed four girls just weeks after King delivered his \"I Have A Dream\" speech. The Obama administration this week named the church and other Birmingham civil rights landmarks as a national monument. \n Lynch drew parallels between the church bombing that killed the four girls and the massacre of nine people at a Bible study at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. \n \"Fifty years after that we still see our fellow Americans targeted simply because of who they are \u2013 not only for their race, but for their religion, sexual orientation and gender identity, as well,\" Lynch said. \n She said 50 years after the victories of the civil rights movement there are \"new attempts to erect barriers to the voting booth.\" \n Lynch praised the work of the Obama administration and the Justice Department fight voting restrictions and prosecute hate crimes and to urge community policing tactics. \n Lynch said the justice department has when, deemed necessary, investigated law enforcement departments for unconstitutional practices and policies and worked for reforms \"because every American deserves to see law enforcement as a guardian, not a threat.\" \n In an interview with The Associated Press Thursday, Lynch, who championed a repair of relations between police and communities, said the federal government must continue to hold police accountable. \n Some in the predominantly African-American congregation and crowd said they were openly mourning the end of the Obama presidency. \n \"I cried. I cried. I never thought in my lifetime I would live to see the day that there was an African-American president,\" Tara Banks said. \n Banks brought her granddaughter Kimorah Thomas to the church on her eighth birthday to learn about King's legacy and hear Lynch, the first female African-American to hold the post of U.S. attorney general. \n Lynch said she recognized the anxiety that some have about what is ahead, referencing Trump without saying his name. \n \"And I have seen the concerns that the voting booth will be moved out of reach, that our hearts will close along with our borders, that a prayer in a different tongue or posture will place one at deadly risk. I have seen the fear that, with the turn of the electoral wheel, so many of us will be seen as children of a lesser God,\" Lynch said. \n But Lynch added she has also seen the determination of men and women dedicated to the future of the country. \n \"Yes, these are challenging times and yes, we undoubtedly have more challenges to come. But many of our greatest strides, in equal rights, in human rights and civil rights have come after some of our most heartbreaking losses. \u2026.

Known as the \"Zimmermann Telegram,\" it was intercepted and decoded by Britain then forwarded to the United States revealing Germany wanted to get Mexico to join its side during World War I by offering it territory in the United States. \n NEWPORT, R.I. >> In a secret telegram a century ago, Germany tried to get Mexico to join its side during World War I by offering it territory in the United States. Britain intercepted, deciphered and shared the \"Zimmermann Telegram.\" \n Historians, seeing parallels to today, say there's a lot to be learned. \n They gathered at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, last week and discussed how a foreign government hacked a secret communication and used the information to sway American public opinion and policy. When it was released, there was a heated debate over whether it was real or what we now call \"fake news.\" \n The message's publication \u2014 and Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare \u2014 was the culmination of a series of events that drew the United States into the war. \n Fast-forward a century. Today, the U.S. intelligence community says Russia hacked Democratic groups during the presidential campaign to help Republican Donald Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. President-elect Trump says the DNC was \"totally open to be hacked\" and praises his future chief of staff for ordering \"hacking defense\" at the Republican National Committee. \n \"The greatest strategic threat the U.S. faces is the general ignorance of the past and how the past is with us every day,\" said David Kohnen, interim executive director at the U.S. Naval War College Museum. \n German foreign minister Arthur Zimmermann sent the telegram in January 1917 to the German representative in Mexico. Germany would resume sinking vessels without warning and Mexico could ally itself to reconquer Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, he wrote. \n Germany wanted to keep the United States busy fighting Mexico so it couldn't send troops and supplies overseas. \n The British waited to share the information to avoid compromising their intelligence-gathering methods. But once the \"German plot\" appeared in headlines, President Woodrow Wilson had few options, said Kohnen, the conference organizer. The United States declared war April 6, 1917. \n Retired Rear Adm. Samuel Cox, current director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, said he sees parallels with Russia's recent actions, but stressed that England wasn't trying to diminish U.S. influence in the world by discrediting its values and democracy. \n Cox focused on how many people refused to accept the telegram's authenticity because it didn't fit with their preconceived notion of reality, which he said is a reminder of the importance of driving misinformation and rumor out of political debate. \n \"If you have an environment where the truth becomes optional, like we're kind of facing today, once you're in that environment it becomes difficult to break out of it,\" he said. \"People refuse to believe the truth because they can't tell the difference.\" \n Other historians pondered the consequences of the Germans' overconfidence in their abilities to encode messages. Cryptographers get too arrogant\u2014 they think no one will get into \"my system,\" said David Hatch, a National Security Agency historian. \n \"It was true in 1917 and it's certainly true today,\" he said at the conference. \n Cox has sent a memo to naval leaders about the significance of the Zimmermann Telegram so the lessons learned could prove useful. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Secret WWI telegram holds lessons for today, historians say"}

He was 73. \n Attorney Robert Kirwan II said Snuka was taken Sunday to the home near Pompano Beach so that he could spend his last moments there. The family informed him shortly after 1 p.m. Sunday to say he had died, Kirwan said. \n Lehigh County Judge Kelly Banach on Jan. 3 dismissed the murder case against the retired WWE star after the defense said he had dementia, was in hospice care in Florida and had six months to live. \n Snuka's daughter, Tamina Snuka, also a WWE wrestler, tweeted Sunday afternoon: \"I LOVE YOU DAD\" with a hashtag #RestWell. \n Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, also a WWE star, called it \"sad news\" in a post on his Twitter page. \n Snuka was charged in 2015 with third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Nancy Argentino, whose body was found more than three decades earlier in their Whitehall Township hotel room. Prosecutors allege she was beaten, while Snuka maintained she died from a fall. \n Authorities reopened the investigation after The Morning Call newspaper raised questions about the case in 2013. \n Banach had first ruled last summer that Snuka was not competent to stand trial after his attorney argued the ex-athlete suffers from dementia, partly due to the head trauma sustained over a long career in the ring. Prosecutors countered that Snuka's brain shows normal signs of aging and suggested he might be feigning symptoms. \n At a hearing last month to re-evaluate Snuka's mental fitness, Snuka's wife told the judge that the family struggles to keep him from leaving home during bouts of psychosis in which he thinks he's late for a wrestling match.

The rally was one of a number of rallies Democrats staged across the country to highlight opposition to the repeal efforts. \n WARREN, Mich. >> Thousands of people showed up in freezing temperatures on Sunday in Michigan where Sen. Bernie Sanders called on Americans to resist Republican efforts to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law, one of a number of rallies Democrats staged across the country to highlight opposition. \n People lined up four abreast to get to the rally in the parking lot of Macomb County Community College in the Detroit suburb of Warren. Labor unions were a strong presence and people also carried signs including \"Save our Health Care,\" and \"Michigan Stands.\" \n Lisa Bible, 45, of Bancroft, Michigan, came to show support for the law. She said that she has an auto immune disease and high cholesterol. She says the existing law has been an answer to her and her husband's prayers, but she worries that if it's repealed her family may get stuck with her medical bills. \n \"I'm going to get really sick and my life will be at risk,\" she said. \n President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to overturn and replace the Affordable Care Act and majority Republicans in Congress this week began the process of repealing it using a budget maneuver that requires a bare majority in the Senate. \n \"This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. It is time we got our national priorities right,\" Sanders told the rally. \n He has been one of the strongest advocates for the law, which has delivered health coverage to about 20 million people but is saddled with problems such as rapidly rising premiums and large co-payments. \n Sanders made several visits to the state last year during the Michigan primary and defeated Hillary Clinton in the state. But in a major surprise, Michigan narrowly voted for Trump on Nov. 8, the first Republican presidential candidate to carry the state since 1988. \n Mark Heller, 45, a civil rights, immigration and labor attorney who drove to the rally from Toledo, Ohio, said that stopping Republicans from repealing the law may take more than attending rallies. \n \"I think that it's going to take civil disobedience to turn this around because they have the votes in both the Senate and the House, and the president,\" he said. \n The health law has provided subsidies and Medicaid coverage for millions who don't get insurance at work. It has required insurers to cover certain services such as family planning and people who are already ill, and has placed limits on the amount that the sick and elderly can be billed for health care. \n Republicans want to end the fines that enforce the requirement that many individuals buy coverage and that larger companies provide it to workers. They'd like to expand health savings accounts, erase the taxes Obama's law imposed on higher-income people and the health care industry, eliminate the subsidies that help people buy policies and pare back its Medicaid expansion. \n But they face internal disagreements on how to pay for any replacement and how to protect consumers and insurers during a long phase-in of an alternative. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Thousands attend Sanders health care rally in Michigan"}

{"date": "January 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting with Russian prosecutors in Moscow, Russia. \n MOSCOW >> With eager anticipation, the Kremlin is counting the days to Donald Trump's inauguration and venting its anger at Barack Obama's outgoing administration, no holds barred. \n Careful not to hurt chances for a thaw in U.S.-Russia relations, President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials have deferred questions about their plans for future contacts with Trump and any agenda for those talks until he takes office on Friday. \n Trump's open admiration of Putin has brought wide expectations of improved Moscow-Washington relations, but Trump has not articulated a clear Russia policy. His Cabinet nominees include both a retired general with a hawkish stance on Russia and an oil executive who has done extensive business in Russia. \n At the same time, Russian officials are blasting the outgoing U.S. administration in distinctly undiplomatic language, dropping all decorum after Obama hit Moscow with more sanctions in his final weeks in office. \n Moscow calls Obama's team a \"bunch of geopolitical losers\" engaged in a last-ditch effort to inflict the maximum possible damage to U.S.-Russia ties to make it more difficult for Trump to mend the rift. \n In a clear effort to avoid risking a rapprochement with Trump, Putin showed remarkable restraint when the U.S. expelled 35 Russian diplomats over accusations of meddling in the U.S. election campaign. Instead of a usual tit-for-tat response, Putin invited U.S. diplomats' children to a New Year's party at the Kremlin. \n Trump's national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and Russia's ambassador to the U.S. were in frequent contact in recent weeks, including on Dec. 29, the day Obama hit Moscow with sanctions in retaliation for election-related hacking, according to a senior U.S. official. \n Moscow similarly refrained from retaliation when the White House last week added five Russians, including the chief of Russia's top state investigative agency, to the U.S. sanctions list. \n On Sunday, Vice President-elect Mike Pence insisted the Trump presidential campaign had no contacts with Russia and denied that the incoming national security adviser spoke with Russian officials in December about sanctions. He added that such questions were part of an effort to cast doubt on Trump's victory. \n While Putin and his lieutenants hope Trump will open up to Russia, they know any attempt to fix ties will face massive obstacles, including possible strong resistance in the U.S. Congress. \n \"Any future contacts will have to be prepared quite accurately and thoroughly, as they would follow a tense period,\" Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \n Fyodor Lukyanov, chair of the Council for Foreign and Defense Policies, a group of Russian foreign policy experts, said Syria is one area where a U.S.-Russian rapport is likely. \n During the call with Flynn, the Russian ambassador invited U.S. officials to a conference on Syria in Kazakhstan later this month, according to a transition official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. \n In an interview Friday with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said he might do away with Obama's sanctions if Russia works with the U.S. on battling terrorists and achieving other goals. \n The Kremlin would be eager to embrace a U.S. offer of cooperation on Syria. Obama's administration had refused to coordinate action against the IS with Russia, saying Moscow was bent on shoring up Syrian President Bashar Assad. \n The complexity of the conflict in Syria \u2014 where opposition groups backed by regional players are pitted against Assad's troops and often fight each other \u2014 makes hopes for quick progress elusive. \n \"Russia and the United States are important players (in Syria) but not the only ones,\" Lukyanov said. \n He noted that nuclear arms control is another possible area where Moscow and Washington could try to find common ground. While new arms control treaties are unlikely, the two countries may try to find ways to increase global stability, Lukyanov said. \n Putin has pushed for the U.S. to recognize Moscow as an equal global heavyweight and to acknowledge that Russia's ex-Soviet neighbors are in its sphere of \"vital interests\" \u2014 demands rejected by the West. Many in Russia hope that Trump could be more inclined to strike a \"grand bargain\" with Putin, carving up spheres of influence and helping cement Russia's role as a global power. \n Alexander Lebedev, a multimillionaire Russian owner of Britain's Evening Standard and Independent newspapers, believes that Putin wants a \"big deal\" that would envisage cooperation in Syria and possible cooperation in other spheres. \n \"$1 trillion a year is stolen by global banks and companies and moved offshore,\" Lebedev said, adding that Russia and the U.S. could launch a worldwide crackdown on corrupt business practices. \n U.S.-Russian relations have sunk to a post-Cold War low over Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and support for a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine. A 2015 peace deal helped end large-scale battles in eastern Ukraine, but clashes have continued. The U.S. and the European Union have slapped Russia with economic sanctions and made their lifting contingent on the Ukraine peace deal's progress. \n While the Kremlin counts on Trump to roll the sanctions back, many observers are skeptical. \n \"In the current atmosphere, it's very difficult to imagine how Trump could start canceling the sanctions,\" Lukyanov said. \n U.S. allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. election top the list of irritants. \n U.S. intelligence officials' accusations that Russian hackers \u2014 acting on Putin's orders \u2014 interfered into the vote to help Trump win have put the U.S. president-elect in a difficult position. Trump has grudgingly conceded that Russia was likely responsible for hacking the Democratic National Committee, but emphasized there was no evidence that hacking affected the U.S. election results. \n The Kremlin has rejected the hacking accusations and also hotly denied reports that it has collected compromising information about Trump. \n Aware that an open show of support for Trump would only make it more difficult for him to restore ties, Russian officials have mostly focused on blasting Obama's administration. \n Konstantin Kosachev, the head of foreign affairs committee in the upper house of parliament, described the White House's decision to expel Russian diplomats as an \"agony of not even lame ducks, but political corpses.\" \n Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova went further. \n \"If 'Russian hackers' hacked anything in America, there were two things: Obama's brain, and, of course, the report about 'Russian hackers,'\" she wrote on Facebook. \n Zakharova charged that \"Obama and his illiterate foreign policy team have dealt a crushing blow to America's prestige and leadership\" and described his administration as \"a bunch of geopolitical losers, enraged and shortsighted.\" \n Obama's administration still has a few days left to \"destroy the world,\" Zakharova wrote. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Julie Pace in Washington, D.C., contributed to this story. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Kremlin counts days to Trump's inauguration, blasts Obama"}

{"date": "January 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A new study co-authored by California Supreme Court Justice Goodwin Liu, a prominent Asian American judge, finds Asian Americans are well-represented among the nation's attorneys, but still missing from leadership positions in the legal profession. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> When Goodwin Liu joined the seven-member California Supreme Court in 2011, he became its fourth sitting member of Asian descent. The number is remarkable. \n The other state supreme courts in the U.S. combined have a handful of Asian-American justices. And Asian-American representation on other state courts, the federal bench and among the country's top prosecutors is similarly scant. \n Those findings emerged from a new study by Liu and law students at Yale University that provides a portrait of Asian-Americans in the legal profession. The conclusion: They are well-represented among the nation's attorneys but still missing from some of the highest posts. \n \"They have a foot in the door in virtually every sector of the legal profession,\" Liu said during a recent interview. \"The question now is how wide that door's going to swing open for them.\" \n For Liu, the study is personal. His parents were doctors who came to the U.S. in the late 1960s from Taiwan. Nothing in his childhood was a conduit for a legal career. His parents encouraged him to study math and science. He didn't know any attorneys growing up and almost became a doctor. \n Liu said the difference for him was mentorship. He had two Asian-American leaders as role models: U.S. Rep. Bob Matsui and former Yale Law School Dean Harold Koh. \n Liu became a law professor and associate dean at the University of California, Berkeley, before President Barack Obama nominated him in 2010 for a prestigious federal appeals court seat. \n His name was even mentioned as a potential U.S. Supreme Court candidate, but Republicans derailed his nomination to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. They called him a liberal ideologue and took exception to his outspoken opposition to Samuel Alito's 2006 appointment to the high court. \n Liu withdrew his name. Soon afterward, California Gov. Jerry Brown swore him in for a seat on the state Supreme Court. \n Liu said the Asian-American representation on the California high court does not carry through to lower courts in the state. As of 2015, only two of 97 appellate court judges were Asian-American. The California Supreme Court now has three Asian-American justices after one of those of Asian descent retired in 2014. \n \"People may have certain perceptions of what a judge should look like, and Asian-Americans being fairly new to this field are bursting that mold,\" Liu said. \n Asians are the nation's fastest-growing racial group and make up more than 5 percent of the population. They make up an even larger percentage of law school students, with a significant number graduating from top institutions. \n But Liu said their ranks in leadership positions are disconcerting, seen in some of the numbers the study compiled from research in recent years: \n \u2014 Three of the 94 U.S. attorneys and four of the country's nearly 2,500 elected state prosecutors were Asian-American. \n \u2014 There were 26 active Asian-American judges among more than 850 federal judicial positions. Two percent of almost 10,300 state trial and appellate court judges who were surveyed were Asian-American. \n \u2014 Asian-Americans were the largest minority group at major law firms but had the highest attrition rates and lowest ratio of partners to associates among all racial groups. \n \"Now we understand what's happening,\" said Charles Huang, a California prosecutor who co-founded the National Asian Pacific Islander Prosecutors Association. \"We don't know what's causing it, but we know what the empirical results are.\" \n The study surveyed more than 600 Asian-American lawyers, and their responses pointed to factors that may serve as barriers. \n A relatively small percentage had a parent who was a lawyer. Those who expressed a desire to change their careers said getting a job as a judge or prosecutor was low on the list. \n More than 80 percent reported experiencing implicit bias in the workplace. Many respondents said Asian-American attorneys were considered hard-working and responsible, but far fewer said the legal profession associated them with empathy, creativity or assertiveness. \n Liu encourages law students to develop their confidence and identity through public speaking and \"break from what came\" before them, though he warns that the weight of stereotypes might not go away. \n Liu said he still struggles with how people might perceive him as an Asian-American judge. \n \"I think for people who feel like they are going into places that are unfamiliar to them and who defy what perhaps is conventional expectation, you always feel like you're an impostor,\" he said. \"There's always that feeling like, 'Oh, one day they're going to find me out.'\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Few Asian Americans hold top legal jobs, new study says"}

{"date": "January 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Migrants gather in St. Peter's Square to attend the Angelus noon prayer delivered by Pope Francis at the Vatican. \n VATICAN CITY >> Pope Francis demanded today that \"every possible measure\" be taken to protect young refugees, as search and rescue efforts continued off Libya's coast following the latest deadly Mediterranean migrant shipwreck. \n Italy's coast guard said only four people survived the sinking of a migrant ship carrying around 100 people that went down 30 miles (49 kilometers) off the Libyan coast on Saturday. Only eight bodies have been recovered. \n In his noon blessing, Francis recalled that the theme of the church's World Day of Migrants concerned the particular vulnerability of young migrants \u2014 \"our young brothers\" who often flee home alone and face \"so many dangers.\" \n \"We must adopt every possible measure to guarantee young migrants protection and defense, as well as integration,\" he said. \n The U.N. refugee agency has reported a sharp increase in the number of unaccompanied minors reaching Italy: 25,846 last year, more than double the previous year. Aid groups say if these young people survive the crossing, they are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse by land-based traffickers once they reach Europe. \n The International Organization of Migration, meanwhile, says it recorded 4,576 deaths in 2016 among migrants making the central Mediterranean crossing to Italy. The total number of dead is unknown, given that many bodies are never recovered. \n Two dead reached Italian shores on Sunday as the rescue ship Aquarius pulled into port in Messina, Sicily with some 300 migrants from rescue operations Friday. Two coffins were offloaded for family members to claim, UNHCR said. \n Usually, bad weather and rough seas deter Libyan-based smugglers from launching overloaded boats full of migrants bound for Italy.

Seven survivors were handed over to Spanish authorities. \n The rescue service says the coast is being patrolled for survivors on another drifting boat that reportedly departed from neighboring Morocco. Six African migrants who drowned are thought to have been on the boat, which may have shipwrecked. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pope demands protection for migrants as sea search continues"}

{"date": "January 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Jeanette Finicum speaks with reporters during a rally at the Utah State Capitol, in Salt Lake City. \n SALEM, Ore. >> Leaders of an armed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge in rural Oregon were driving to a public meeting a year ago when police shot and killed one of them at a roadblock. \n Now, LaVoy Finicum's widow and their children are planning to hold that meeting later this month in the same town, John Day. Speakers are slated to talk about the Constitution, property rights and other issues. \n \"It is the anniversary of my husband's death. We want to continue with his mission,\" Jeanette Finicum told The Associated Press. \"The people within counties and states should decide how to use those properties, not the federal government.\" \n LaVoy Finicum was the spokesman for several dozen occupiers during the 41-day takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and has become a martyr for the movement to transfer ownership of federal lands to local entities. The U.S. government owns nearly half of all land in the West, compared with 4 percent in other states, according to the Congressional Overview of Federal Land Ownership. \n Finicum's cattle brand, an L connected to a V with a floating bar, adorns bumper stickers, black flags and T-shirts seen at conservative gatherings. \n Jeanette Finicum has become something of a cause celebre in the year since her husband's death. She spoke at a rally on the steps of Utah's capitol. The Tri-State Livestock News, based in South Dakota, recently ran a story describing her dispute with the Bureau of Land Management over grazing fees. The agency administers 245 million acres of public lands and manages livestock grazing on 155 million acres of those lands. \n \"It's been a horrific year,\" Jeanette Finicum said in a phone interview from her Cane Beds, Arizona, home. \"There's been so much going on that most people don't have to deal with when they lose a loved one, like we did.\" \n She met LaVoy at a barn dance. He told her he was a bad dancer. \n \"He was right. He had no rhythm,\" Jeanette Finicum said with a laugh. They got married 14 days later. \n \"There isn't anyone like him that I met in my lifetime, and I don't expect there will be anyone else who will measure up,\" she said, choking up with emotion. \n She was a stay-at-home mom all 23 years they were married. \n \"With him gone, all of the responsibilities have fallen to me,\" she said. \"I spent the year rounding up, branding and calving.\" \n Oregon State Police shot LaVoy Finicum three times on Jan. 26, 2016, after he exited a vehicle at a police roadblock in the snowy Malheur National Forest, held up his hands and then reached toward his jacket. \n Authorities concluded the officers were justified because they thought Finicum was going for his pistol. But at least one FBI Hostage Rescue Team operator fired two shots at Finicum's vehicle \u2014 shots that were not disclosed during the investigation. \n In March, the inspector general of the U.S. Justice Department began investigating possible FBI misconduct and whether there was a cover-up. The inspector general's office declined to discuss the investigation last week. The U.S. attorney's office in Portland said it was ongoing. \n Jeanette Finicum insists her husband was not a threat and that he was murdered. Her lawyer has said the family plans a wrongful-death lawsuit, and Finicum said she will release more details during the Jan. 28 meeting. \n It's being held at the fairgrounds in Grant County, which neighbors the county containing the refuge. \n Public lands make up 66 percent of Grant County's 4,529 square miles. Jeanette Finicum bristled when asked if those attending the meeting might be inspired to take over federal sites. \n \"That's a ridiculous question,\" she said. \"We will peacefully demonstrate, peacefully teach and stand for liberty.\" \n Fairgrounds manager Mindy Winegar said local logger Tad Haupt rented a pavilion for the meeting that seats up to 500 people. Haupt, a vocal opponent of U.S. Forest Service management practices, is the one who invited the occupation leaders to speak in John Day, a town of about 1,700, on Jan. 26, 2016. \n The FBI expressed no concern about the upcoming meeting. \n \"Everyone has a constitutional right to assemble, and to free speech,\" spokeswoman Beth Anne Steele said. \n Grant County Judge Scott Myers granted permission for the fairgrounds, a county facility, to be used for the event, saying rejecting the request could have had more repercussions than allowing it to happen. \n Myers said he doubts it will pose a threat but then added, \"I have steadfastly tried to convince myself that over the past few months.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Widow of slain Oregon standoff leader carries on his mission"}

{"date": "January 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n CIA Director John Brennan testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, before the Senate Intelligence Committee. \n WASHINGTON >> The outgoing CIA director charged today that Donald Trump lacks a full understanding of the threat Moscow poses to the United States, delivering a public lecture to the president-elect that further highlighted the bitter state of Trump's relations with American intelligence agencies. \n John Brennan's pointed message on national television came just five days before Trump becomes the nation's 45th president amid lingering questions about Russia's role in the 2016 election even as the focus shifts to the challenges of governing. \n \"Now that he's going to have an opportunity to do something for our national security as opposed to talking and tweeting, he's going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that U.S. and national security interests are protected,\" Brennan said on \"Fox News Sunday,\" warning that the president-elect's impulsivity could be dangerous. \n \"Spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests,\" Brennan declared. \n Trump, who has unleashed a series of aggressive tweets against the U.S. intelligence community and his political rivals in recent weeks, did not respond to Brennan's criticism. \n But later today, he retweeted a journalist's remark that the intelligence community owes Trump an apology for briefing him on a document that contains unverified financial and personal information that could be damaging to the president-elect. \n \"Media should apologize also\" for reporting on the document and the briefing, Trump wrote. The Associated Press has not been able to verify the contents of the document. \n The president-elect remained behind closed doors in his Manhattan high rise. His team worked to answer questions about his plans at home and abroad once he's sworn into office on Friday. \n Among Trump's immediate challenges: the United States' complicated relationship with Russia, crafting an affordable health care alternative that doesn't strip coverage from millions of Americans, and growing questions about the legitimacy of his presidency. \n Civil rights legend Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., is among several Democrats in Congress who vowed to skip Trump's inauguration, charging that Russian interference in the 2016 election delegitimizes his presidency. \n \"There will be many more members who join us in this decision,\" Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., wrote Saturday on his Facebook page. \n Trump's lieutenants pushed back hard in a round of television interviews. \n \"I think it's incredibly disappointing and I think it's irresponsible for people like himself to question the legitimacy of the next United States president,\" incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said of Lewis on ABC's \"This Week,\" insisting that Republicans did not question the legitimacy of President Barack Obama's victory eight years ago. Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he hopes Lewis will change his mind and attend. \n Priebus later acknowledged that conservatives \u2014 led by Trump himself \u2014 spent years questioning Obama's eligibility to serve as president, suggesting he was not born in the United States. \n Trump has done little to encourage unity in recent days, instead inflaming tensions with his critics through a series of tweets. The incoming president tweeted Saturday that Lewis should pay more attention to his \"crime ridden\" Atlanta-area district, adding that the civil rights leader was \"all talk.\" \n Lewis suffered a fractured skull when he led a march in Selma, Alabama, more than a half century ago and has devoted his life to civil rights. \n The current White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough, said \"Lewis has literally fought, bled and gone to jail\" during what he called his \"remarkable life.\" He encouraged the incoming president to move past Lewis' criticism. \n \"That would be the kind of thing that would not only send a message to the American people that we're prepared to work together, but would also send a message to the Russians that we are united,\" McDonough said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \n Questions about Trump's relationship with Russia have dominated the days leading up to his inauguration. \n Ret. Gen. Michael Flynn, who is set to become Trump's national security adviser, has been in frequent contact with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. in recent weeks, including on the day the Obama administration hit Moscow with sanctions in retaliation for the alleged election hacking, a senior U.S. official said. \n After initially denying the contact took place, Trump's team publicly acknowledged the conversations. \n \"The conversations that took place at that time were not in any way related to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia or the expulsion of diplomats,\" said Vice President-elect Mike Pence, also in an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \n Repeated contacts just as Obama imposed sanctions would raise questions about whether Trump's team discussed \u2014 or even helped shape \u2014 Russia's response. Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly did not retaliate against the U.S. for the sanctions or the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats, a decision Trump quickly praised. \n Trump has repeatedly called for a better relationship between the U.S. and Putin's government. He suggested in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Friday that he'd consider easing the latest sanctions on Russia. \n \"I think he has to be mindful that he does not have a full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road,\" Brennan said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Outgoing CIA chief rips into Trump over tweets, Russia"}

{"date": "January 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCAITED PRESS \n Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Donald Trump's election has propelled Warren into an even sharper partisan spotlight as she embraces her role as a top Democratic foil to the Republican president-elect. \n BOSTON >> Donald Trump's election has propelled Sen. Elizabeth Warren into an even sharper partisan spotlight as she embraces her role as a top Democratic foil to the Republican president-elect. \n In just the past few weeks, Warren has penned a scathing 16-page critique of Trump's nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos; grilled his pick for housing secretary, Ben Carson; co-sponsored legislation requiring the president and vice president to disclose and divest any potential financial conflicts of interest; and signed onto legislation to block the creation of a federal religious registry. \n The Massachusetts Democrat is leaning on every lever of power she has \u2014 from her fundraising prowess to her social media accounts \u2014 to position herself as a leading voice of a party in political exile. \n \"My priorities haven't changes since the day I got into office,\" Warren said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"I see my job as making sure the voices of ordinary people aren't drowned out in Washington by those who have money and power.\" \n Her list of grievances with Trump is long and growing longer. \n But in a shift from the campaign, when Warren lobbed Twitter grenade after Twitter grenade to get under Trump's skin, she says her criticism is now more focused on her top priority: the economic well-being of middle- and working-class families. \n She has excoriated Trump's pick for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, saying he profited from the foreclosure crisis; called out Trump's Department of Labor nominee, fast food entrepreneur Andrew Puzder, after hearing from workers who said they were underpaid, had their wages stolen, and were forced to work in unsafe conditions; and vowed to fight to protect President Barack Obama's health care law and preserve the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she helped create. \n \"The Republicans have put us on the path to repealing the ACA (Affordable Care Act), and that will make a profound difference in the lives of millions of Americans,\" Warren told the AP. \"I'm all for making the ACA better, but not for throwing it out. What the Republicans are doing is irresponsible and cruel.\" \n Warren is taking the political long view. \n She is an aggressive fundraiser, and through her political action committee \u2014 PAC for a Level Playing Field \u2014 she has doled out hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past two years to Democratic candidates and committees in the hope of strengthening the party's hand in future elections. \n \"The Democrat's agenda is the American people's agenda,\" she said. \n Warren won't say whether she is prepping for a possible 2020 run for president, although she has announced plans to run for re-election in 2018, making the case for a second term in part by again pointing to \"Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers\" in an email to supporters. \n Massachusetts Republicans have labeled Warren a \"hyperpartisan bully more interested in scoring political points than delivering actual results.\" \n But among voters in her home state where she remains popular, the reaction to Warren's spikes-up approach is more nuanced. \n \"I'm just tired of all the fighting,\" said Tim James, 26, of Newton, who works in macroeconomics. \"I don't agree with a lot of the things that Trump had to say \u2026 but we've had about eight years or so of gridlock in Washington, and I think that it's important for us to try to put some of the more divisive rhetoric to the side.\" \n Jay Fiset, a 30-year-old chef from Somerville, also said that while Trump and Warren may be political polar opposites, it's time to ditch the campaign. \n \"They're going to butt heads,\" he said. \"But I think that they should come together and try and figure out the problems rather than pinpointing who's doing what wrong.\" \n Others see a reason to applaud every Warren missive. \n \"She should definitely keep going hard after him because he hasn't admitted to anything yet. He hasn't apologized for anything,\" said Dencis Pena, 37, of Boston, who works in the insurance industry. \"Until he changes and shows he actually understands the facts, people should not let him off the hook.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Warren embraces her role as a top Democratic foil to Trump"}

{"date": "January 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Migrants wait to board the MV Aquarius, as 193 people and two corpses are recovered Friday Jan. 13, 2017, from international waters in the Mediterranean Sea about 22 miles north of Sabrata, Libya. \n VALLETTA, Malta >> Tens of thousands of people seeking better lives are expected to trek across deserts and board unseaworthy boats in war-torn Libya this year in a desperate effort to reach European shores by way of Italy. \n More than 181,000 people, most so-called \"economic migrants\" with little chance of being allowed to stay in Europe, attempted to cross the central Mediterranean last year from Libya, Africa's nearest stretch of coast to Italy. About 4,500 died or disappeared. \n Hundreds already have taken to the sea this month, braving the winter weather. In the latest reminder of the journey's perils, more than 100 people were missing off Libya's coast over the weekend after a migrant boat sunk. \n Some European leaders are warning of a fresh migration crisis when sea waters warm again and more people choose to put their lives in the hands of smugglers. \n \"Come next spring, the number of people crossing over the Mediterranean will reach record levels,\" Malta Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, whose country holds the European Union's presidency, predicted. \"The choice is trying to do something now, or meeting urgently in April, May\u2026and try to do a deal then.\" \n The 28-nation EU already has a controversial deal to stem the flow of migrants from Turkey, which has agreed to try to stop the number of migrants leaving the country and to take back thousands more. In exchange, Turkey is supposed to receive billions of euros, visa-free travel for its citizens, and fast-tracked EU membership talks. \n Now, the EU wants to adapt this outsourcing pact to the African nations that migrants are leaving or are jumping off from to reach Europe, despite criticism that the agreement sends asylum-seekers back to countries that could be unsafe for them. \n The bottom line is that the Turkey deal works. The number of people arriving in the Greek islands, for instance, plunged over the last year despite political wrangling over whether Turkey's government was meeting the conditions for securing the visa-free travel incentive. \n And EU nations have even fewer scruples about turning away migrants who take the central Mediterranean route to Italy since they mostly are job seekers who would be ineligible for asylum. \n Niger, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mauritania, Mali and Chad are all on the EU's radar, and dealing with them is proving expensive. But the bloc's arrangement with Turkey has shown that the best way of stemming migrant flows is to stop people taking to the sea. Libya and Egypt are the main migrant departure points, and pacts with them would probably have the biggest immediate impact. \n Muscat wants to build on a deal Italy is trying to reach with Libya by adding EU funds and other support. He also thinks the EU's anti-smuggler naval mission, Operation Sophia, should be extended into Libyan territorial waters to stop people in unsafe boats from reaching open water. \n Easier said than done. The EU has been unable to secure United Nations backing for such a move, and Libya has no central authority with the reach or stability to negotiate a long-term agreement with the Europeans. \n \"The reality of Libya right now is that there is no unified government controlling all parts of the country, and no end of groups willing to upend things if there is an advantage in it for them,\" Carlo Binda, a Libya expert with Malta-based political and development advisers Binda Consulting International. \n Libya's neighbor Egypt appears a more viable option. Many people have set out for Europe from Egypt in recent months, mainly migrants from the Horn of Africa trying to avoid dangerous Libya and increasingly Egyptians themselves, according to the EU's border agency Frontex. \n Despite some instability, President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, a former general who led the 2013 military removal of an elected Islamist president, is a man with whom the Europeans feel they can do business. Sissi also wields plenty of influence in Libya. \n Egypt's economy has been battered by unrest since the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak. If there is one thing the world's biggest trading bloc does well, it is raise funds to pay for its problems. \n \"Egypt is the country with which one could come to some sort of agreement,\" Maltese Foreign Minister George Vella said. \"There is stability to a certain extent, and they are interested because even they themselves have got their own problem with migration.\" \n Time is of the essence. The EU has for several years tried to cobble together migration polices while people died at sea. \n The refugee emergency \u2014 Europe's worst since World War II \u2014 also has raised tensions among EU member countries. Some countries have erected anti-migrant fences or reintroduced border controls amid deep disagreement over how to manage the challenge. \n \"Things are getting complicated. I would rather face the music now,\" Muscat said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Crisis warnings sound as EU gears up for new migrant wave"}

{"date": "January 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Stephanie Hurd chats with her father Paul Hensley while visiting him at the Comfort Haven of Lacey memory care center in Lacey, Wash. \n OLYMPIA, Wash. >> The holidays are a time for family gatherings, and it's a good bet that at many of them, a couple of the adult \"kids\" huddled together and asked, \"Do you think it's time for mom and dad to live somewhere else?\" \n The percentage of older residents in Thurston County is increasing. People ages 65 and older made up 13 percent of the population in 2010, according to the Census. By 2015, that number was 15.9 percent, slightly higher than the statewide average. \n As baby boomers enter or approach their own retirement, their parents need more support for their physical and cognitive needs. \n They are the first generation to live long enough to need widespread, years-long care, and many haven't planned for it, said David Robinson, a geriatric care manager in Thurston County. \n \"It's the rare person who decides they want to get ahead of change,\" Robinson said. But making a change before it's a crisis is the goal, he said. \n Stacy Johnson, community relations director at Olympics West Retirement Inn in Tumwater, said part of the problem is there are misconceptions about assisted living and other housing options. Olympics West offers a range from independent living to assisted living and into end of life, if possible. \n \"I'm most often contacted by adult children,\" Johnson said, adding it's very rare to be contacted by potential residents. \"The population of 80-plus thinks assisted living is a nursing home. They're afraid to even consider it as an option.\" \n It's the fear of the unknown, Johnson said. \n \"It's like a new kid on the first day of school. Once they get here and realize 'I don't have to cook. I don't have to clean. I don't have to eat alone, I get driven to the store and the casino,' they settle in.\" \n A triggering event \n A number of circumstances can trigger a change of need, Robinson said. \n On the physical side, a stroke or broken hip can suddenly make a home unusable. Or children may notice a parent having trouble keeping track of bills, appointments or medications, Robinson said. \n \"Most people prefer to age in their own homes, and every effort should be made to keep them there,\" Robinson said. \n For the Hensley family of Olympia, the first sign that their father needed help was his reluctance to travel from his retirement home in Arizona. \n \"Dad traveled almost a third of the time for his work,\" his daughter, Stephanie Hurd, said. But he began making excuses for not coming back to the Northwest to visit. \n In hindsight, she said, there was a lot of confusion about how to deal with situations he used to be able to handle, like traffic. \n The four children convinced their parents to return to the Olympia area and settled them into a condominium. The next step was convincing their mother to accept in-home help with their father. \n After finding a caregiver whom both parents liked, the couple was able to manage in their smaller home for about 2 1/2 years. \n \"We became aware that it was time to look for a residential solution,\" Hurd said. \n As their father's dementia increased, the family first moved him into a memory care center and then into an adult family home. \n In addition to their father's increasing symptoms, their mother's health was declining. \n \"She still struggles with 'I should be able to take care of him,' \" said daughter Stacia Hensley. \n \"We all miscalculated how hard it was going to be for mom physically and emotionally,\" Hurd said. \"She's declined and depressed.\" \n Their mother now has moved into residential housing. Brother Tim Hensley has taken on many responsibilities for his mother, including helping her manage her finances. \n Between them, the Hensley children spend about 30 hours a week or more visiting, caregiving and supporting their parents. \n The Hensely family found support through their close sibling relationship and the Lewis-Mason-Thurston Area Agency on Aging, which offers resources and support groups. The LMTAAA mission includes assisting \"individuals and families in making the right choices for them when confronted with the realities of loss and change,\" according to its website. Caregiver newsletters offer information and a schedule of programs and training. \n Stephanie Hurd said her advice is for people to reach out for resources. \n \"You need help,\" she said. \n Making a change for yourself \n For seniors who are making the decision on their own, options range from simple downsizing, to a spectrum of senior communities, to facilities that offer increasing levels of care. \n Some developers offer smaller, accessible homes in active senior communities. Another option, continuum of care, is offered at communities such as Panorama in Lacey. There, people can purchase a home or apartment where they live independently, then add services or move into more assisted housing options in the community as they age. \n \"What we're finding the last 10 years is that residents are coming sooner and are younger and more active,\" said Howard Burton, director of marketing for Panorama. \n Dale and Georgia Vincent of Olympia decided in their 60s that it was time to leave their two-level, five-bedroom house near Olympia High School. They'd lived there more than 30 years, moving in when their son was 5. \n \"We looked around, not very aggressively,\" Dale Vincent said. \"Now and then we looked at condos. Surprisingly they were mostly two level.\" \n They were at the nearby Fred Meyer to buy some Mariners tickets when they decided to drop by Panorama. After looking at more than 30 homes, they ended up with a two-bedroom, two-bath duplex. That was eight years ago. \n Burton said that boomers and active older people seek experiences instead of things, and the community expresses that. \n Panorama has buy-in fees starting at $80,000 for a one-bedroom unit, he said, with a monthly rent of about $1,125 that includes utilities and taxes. But at least 20 percent of residents fall below the community's low-income standard, Burton said. \n People considering Panorama should be to the point of wanting to sell their home, and have a \"decent pension or monthly income,\" he said. Residents pay for their own meals and other expenses. Costs increase with larger living units or moving into higher levels of care. \n \"If you look at the financial side, if you add up all of the things that you pay for (now) that you won't have to pay for at Panorama, I'm not sure it's any more expensive,\" Vincent said. \"In the winter, it's wonderful not to have to pay for heat.\" \n A step for many is assisted living, which is apartment living that includes housekeeping, meals and on-site nursing care. \n Olympics West, for example, offers independent living for people who need very little assistance with daily activities, but want the security of quick emergency response and the convenience of communal meals. It also offers assisted living, which includes 24-hour access to assistance. \n \"It can be as simple as assistance with medications or intermittent assistance with bathing,\" Johnson said. \n The cost starts at $3,000 a month and tops at $5,400, depending on level of care, Johnson said. \n Factors to consider \n At some point, families need to have a conversation about senior housing options and what is needed, Robinson said. \n \"If you're meeting with a lot of resistance, just plant some seeds,\" he said as advice to adult children. \"The default position feels safe and predictable, even if it doesn't meet needs.\" \n An easy entry point can be a short-term stay, or respite care, at a senior housing complex, Robinson said. \n Johnson agrees. \"I will regularly counsel people trying to convince mom or dad to come in, to talk to mom, see if you can get them in for 30 to 90 days.\" She said respite care rentals are month to month, and she recommends 60 to 90 days so the resident has a chance to settle in. \n \"In four years at this building, only one person left after 90 days,\" she said. \n Some things to consider to determine the right fit: \n ? Medical condition: Do you or your loved on have a condition that will worsen? Do you need daily help? \n ? Location: If you are completely independent, it may not matter how far your home is from shopping, but for someone who can no longer drive, or may be limiting driving to short distances and daylight hours, consideration of how far it is to the store, doctor, church and social activities is important. Is public transit available? \n ? Accessibility: Can your home be modified to accommodate a walker or wheelchair? Are there stairs to important parts of the house, or to get in and out of the house? Is the yard too much to maintain? According to the 2010-14 American Community Survey data, approximately 31,000 people in Thurston County \u2014 about 12.3 percent of the total population \u2014 had a disability. Of these disabled individuals, more than 40 percent were 65 years of age or older, according to the Thurston Regional Planning Council. \n ? Social life: Do you like being around people? Are there hobbies you enjoy that you do outside the home? \n ? Caregiving support: Do you have family nearby? Are family members available to help? If so, how much? Family support can be crucial, but is not always available, and family members may not be able to provide all the physical and medical support you may need. \n ? Finances: Services in your home frequently cost considerably more than the same level of service in senior housing. If you have long-term care insurance, check what it provides, in what circumstances, how many hours a day and what the cap is on coverage. \n ? Professional assessment: An objective assessment of your situation might be the best option. Geriatric care managers or agencies such as Area Agency on Aging can provide guidance and assist in placement. \n Levels of care \n Once you have a good idea of your needs, try to match them with the options available. \n ? Senior retirement community: The first step from the family home might be a senior or retirement community where people own their homes. The community may offer amenities such as small yards, maybe with contracted maintenance, and a community hall with some organized activities. \n Individuals must hire any housekeeping or caregiving, if it is wanted. \n Residents are similar in age and income, and it's a place to develop friendships, Robinson said. \n Costs per month depend on mortgage payment and contracted services. \n ? Senior retirement living: This next step is generally rented apartments, with meals available (as well as kitchens), and often some planned activities. Small pets are often allowed. Personal care is still the responsibility of the individual. \n Cost per month is about $2,500. \n ? Assisted living: The biggest change between \"retirement living\" and \"assisted living\" is having a 24-hour caregiver present, a nurse on staff, and help managing medications and bathing. Meals are provided. Individuals may have the option of light cooking in their apartment or eating communally. Activities are available. \n Cost ranges from $3,000 to $6,000 a month. \n \"In assisted living, care is good up to a point, if the need is predictable,\" Robinson said. \"Once needs are unpredictable, assisted living is no longer sufficient.\" \n ? Memory care: For people with dementia and other cognitive impairments, more supervision and higher staffing and services in a memory-care facility may be more appropriate, especially if they are mobile. \n Costs are higher than assisted living. \n ? Adult family home: State-licensed and privately owned, these homes meet much of the need that in the past would have been provided in a nursing home. They provide housing and care for about six residents and have a high staff-resident ratio. Some adult family homes are appropriate for people with dementia. \n Cost is approximately the same as assisted living. \n ? Nursing homes: These facilities are now used primarily for rehabilitation before patients move into another form of housing. They are set up to provide heavier care and more supervision and are covered to an extent by Medicare and Medicaid. \n ? Continuum of care: Some retirement communities, such as Panorama in Lacey, provide a continuum, from independent living to nursing care. Residents pay their membership buy-in, and pay monthly rent for their homes or apartments. Residents who meet financial requirements are guaranteed to have their needs met as they age. \n A different future \n The next generation of retirees will likely be more proactive about planning their own living arrangements as they age, Robinson and Johnson agreed. \n \"If I had a nickel for every time an adult child said, 'Forget mom, I'm moving in,' \" Johnson said. \n One newer option is creating \"villages\" of like-minded people, who live in a neighborhood, share resources such as yard maintenance or caregiving, and have a common interest, like travel or art. \n The village concept can be casual or very organized. \n One example of senior co-housing is Silver Sage Village in Boulder, Colorado. There are 16 homes, each with a common dining area and guest rooms. It is not assisted living, but residents may opt to hire helpers. Residents also serve on committees to run the community. \n Some senior living villages have an emphasis on pet ownership, with services that make it easier for residents to keep their dogs. \n Another group is the Village Movement, which started in Boston more than 15 years ago. Villages are membership-based and self-governing to help the community address the challenges of aging. \n There are 19 villages in various stages of development between Portland and Bellingham. \n \"It will definitely get easier, I think, as boomers continue to age and need this kind of setting,\" Johnson said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Boomers and their parents face need for support, care"}
