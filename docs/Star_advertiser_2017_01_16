(AP Photo/Frank Augstein) \n LONDON >> Britain will make a clean break from the European Union and not seek to remain \"half-in, half-out,\" Prime Minister Theresa May will say Tuesday, disappointing businesses and voters who want the country to stay in the bloc's single market. \n In her most detailed speech on the U.K.'s exit strategy, May will promise to forge \"a new and equal partnership\" with the EU. \n \"Not partial membership of the European Union, associate membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us half-in, half-out,\" she plans to say, according to excerpts released by her office. \n \"We do not seek to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries. We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave.\" \n May's speech appears to rule out the sort of close ties adopted by non-EU members Switzerland or Norway. It's likely to be another shock for the beleaguered pound, which hit a three-month low below $1.20 Monday amid hints that May would signal an economy-roiling \"hard Brexit.\" \n Sterling has lost about a fifth of its value since Britain voted in June to leave the EU. \n May has said she rejects both the \"hard Brexit\" label and its opposite, a compromise \"soft Brexit\" \u2014 but wants a new relationship in the interests of both Britain and the EU. \n \"We want to buy your goods, sell you ours, trade with you as freely as possible, and work with one another to make sure we are all safer, more secure and more prosperous through continued friendship,\" she'll say. \n In a bid to alleviate fears that Brexit will mean a more insular Britain, May will say she wants the country to be \"stronger, fairer, more united and more outward-looking than ever before.\" \n In an attempt to symbolize the U.K.'s outward-facing aspirations, May will deliver her speech to an audience of British civil servants and international diplomats at London's Lancaster House, a Georgian mansion that has hosted international summits over the decades. \n May's speech signals that Britain will quit the EU's single market in goods and services in order to gain control over immigration \u2014 a key issue for many voters who backed Brexit. EU leaders say Britain can't stay in the single market without allowing free movement of people from the bloc. \n The prospect of losing single-market access alarms many in Britain's huge financial services sector, which relies on an ability to do business seamlessly across the 28-nation bloc. \n It also worries the many foreign firms that use London not only as a financial hub but as an entry point into the EU. \n \"We now have to assume May will prioritize immigration controls, and the price to pay will be to exit the single market,\" said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital. \"That could send the pound a lot lower still, perhaps towards $1.10 in the coming weeks.\" \n The pound recovered to above $1.20 Monday after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's comment in an interview with The Times of London that a U.S.-U.K. trade deal could be done \"very quickly\" once he takes office this week. \n May says she will invoke Article 50 of the EU's key treat by March 31, to formally begin a two-year process of negotiating Britain's departure. \n But she has until now refused to reveal details about the government's goals or negotiating strategy, arguing that to do so would weaken Britain's hand. \n Some details have now begun to emerge. \n British Treasury chief Philip Hammond fueled speculation that Britain will play hardball in Brexit negotiations, telling the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag that the U.K. hoped to retain single-market access but would be willing to \"change our economic model to regain competitiveness\" if that was cut off. \n Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Hammond of threatening a \"trade war with Europe\" and seeking to turn Britain into a tax haven. \n May spokeswoman Helen Bower said the prime minister and Hammond both want Britain \"to remain in the mainstream of a recognizable European-style taxation system.\" \n \"But if we are forced to do something different because we can't get the right deal, then we stand ready to do so,\" she said. \n Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London, said that May was well advised to use her speech to bring clarity about Britain's intentions \u2014 even if many people won't like the message. \n \"I think ruling out membership of the single market \u2026 is in some ways the clarity people are looking for,\" Bale said. \"Yet were she to do that, it would be a massive blow to many sectors of the economy. But if that's really what she's going to do, and it's not simply a negotiating stance on her part, it might be better to do it sooner rather than later.\" \n May will also use her speech to appeal for reconciliation between the 48 percent of British voters who wanted to stay in the EU and the pro-Brexit 52 percent. But the gap between \"remainers\" and \"leavers\" appears as wide as ever. \n In London's financial district, the City, many worry about the future of their global businesses and international workforce once Britain is out of the EU fold. \n \"I feel like we should be heading towards more world cooperation generally speaking and this feels like a very retrograde step,\" recruitment firm employee Christopher Devine said. \n A few miles to the east in working-class Romford, where a large majority voted to leave, many say Brexit can't come soon enough. \n \"I think it could happen a little bit quicker,\" said Tony Geary, who sells clothes in Romford market. \"Theresa May now needs to sort of get her finger on the button and make sure everything is in place so by the end of this financial year she is in a position to make things happen.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Raf Casert in Brussels and Jo Kearney in London contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "UK's May signals EU clean break: no 'half-in, half-out'"}

Turkish media reports say police have caught the alleged gunman. \n ISTANBUL >> A gunman suspected of killing 39 people during a New Year's attack on an Istanbul nightclub has been caught in a police operation, Turkish media reports said today. \n The suspect was captured in a special operations police raid on a house in Istanbul's Esenyurt district, private NTV television reported. The broadcaster said he had been staying in the house belonging to a friend from Kyrgyzstan. \n The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the nightclub massacre, saying the attack in the first hours of Jan. 1 was in reprisal for Turkish military operations in northern Syria. The man identified as the suspect had been on the run since the attack. \n Hurriyet newspaper and other media have identified the gunman as Abdulkadir Masharipov, an Uzbekistan national. The suspect was to undergo medical checks before being taken to police headquarters for questioning, the paper said in its online edition. \n Dogan news agency published what it said was the first image of the attacker. It showed a bruised, black-haired man in a grey, bloodied shirt being held by his neck.

{"date": "January 16, 2017", "text": "SAN ANTONIO >>U.S. Air Force investigators have determined that post-traumatic stress disorder and the unraveling of a distinguished military career led an airman to fatally shoot his commander last year at a San Antonio base before killing himself, according to Air Force documents. \n The April shooting at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland prompted a lockdown and officials to abruptly end a nearby military training parade with thousands of spectators. \n Investigators determined Tech. Sgt. Steven Bellino confronted Lt. Col. William Schroeder before the two struggled and Schroeder was shot multiple times. Both men were veterans of U.S. Special Operations Command. \n Investigators believe Bellino, 41, resented the outcome following a remarkable military career that included repeated tours in Afghanistan and Iraq and time as an Army Ranger and Green Beret. He also had served as an FBI agent and was a CIA contractor before enlisting in the Air Force and attempting to join the elite unit. \n Friends say Bellino was idealistic and a man of exacting fairness, according to the newspaper. He lived up to the letter of the law and expected it of others, even once accusing a sergeant major of lying in front of a roomful of soldiers. But a series of perceived slights and violations of his sense of honor had accumulated long before he arrived at Lackland. \n \"I do not like this world, and I do not want to be a part of it any longer,\" Bellino wrote in August 2015, the month he quit the pararescue program and then went home to Ohio and was charged with being absent without leave. \"I've searched for many years to find a home consistent with my ethics and such a place does not exist.\" \n His comments came in a note that investigators found in a flash drive and they were written about the time his PTSD symptoms appeared to intensify. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Air Force: PTSD, other factors led airman to kill commander"}

{"date": "January 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n US Navy Commander and Astronaut for the upcoming Apollo 17, Eugene Cernan, is pictured in his space suit. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former astronaut Neil Armstrong, left, is congratulated by fellow ex-astronaut Gene Cernan following the dedication ceremony of the Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. NASA announced that former astronaut Gene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon, died surrounded by his family. He was 82. \n Former astronaut Gene Cernan, the last of only a dozen men to walk on the moon who returned to Earth with a message of \"peace and hope for all mankind,\" has died. He was 82. \n NASA announced that Cernan died Monday surrounded by his family. NASA spokesman Bob Jacobs confirmed the death but had no immediately details. \n Cernan, commander of NASA's Apollo 17 mission, set foot on the lunar surface in December 1972 during his third space flight. He became the last person to walk on the moon on Dec. 14, 1972, tracing his only child's initials in the dust before climbing the ladder of the lunar module the last time. It was a moment that forever defined him in both the public eye and his own. \n \"Those steps up that ladder, they were tough to make,\" Cernan recalled in a 2007 oral history. \"I didn't want to go up. I wanted to stay a while.\" \n Cernan called it \"perhaps the brightest moment of my life. \u2026 It's like you would want to freeze that moment and take it home with you. But you can't.\" \n Decades later, Cernan tried to ensure he wasn't the last person to walk on the moon, testifying before Congress to push for a return. But as the years went by he realized he wouldn't live to witness someone follow in his footsteps \u2014 still visible on the moon more than 40 years later. \n \"Neil (Armstrong, who died in 2012) and I aren't going to see those next young Americans who walk on the moon. And God help us if they're not Americans,\" Cernan testified before Congress in 2011. \"When I leave this planet, I want to know where we are headed as a nation. That's my big goal.\" \n On Dec. 11, 1972, Cernan guided the lander, named Challenger, into a lunar valley called Taurus-Littrow, with Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt at his side. He recalled the silence after the lunar lander's engine shut down. \n \"That's where you experience the most quiet moment a human being can experience in his lifetime,\" Cernan said in 2007. \"There's no vibration. There's no noise. The ground quit talking. Your partner is mesmerized. He can't say anything. \n \"The dust is gone. It's a realization, a reality, all of a sudden you have just landed in another world on another body out there (somewhere in the) universe, and what you are seeing is being seen by human beings \u2014 human eyes \u2014 for the first time.\" \n Three days earlier, Cernan, Schmitt and Ronald Evans had blasted off atop a Saturn rocket in the first manned nighttime launch from Kennedy Space Center. Evans remained behind as pilot of the command module that orbited the moon while the other two landed on the moon's surface. Cernan and Schmitt, a geologist, spent more than three days on the moon, including more than 22 hours outside the lander, and collected 249 pounds of lunar samples. \n \"In that whole three days, I don't think there's anything that became routine,\" Cernan recalled. \"But if I had to focus on one thing \u2026 it was just to look back at the overwhelming and overpowering beauty of this Earth.\" \n \"To go a quarter of a million miles away into space and have to take time out to sleep and rest \u2026 I wished I could have stayed awake for 75 hours straight. I knew when I left I'd never have a chance to come back.\" \n Completing their third moon walk on Dec. 14, Schmitt returned to the lunar module and was followed by Cernan. \n \"We leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind,\" Cernan said. \n He later acknowledged that he had grasped for words to leave behind, knowing how the world remembered Neil Armstrong's \"giant leap for mankind\" on stepping on the moon in 1969. \n Before heading home, Cernan said he drew the letters \"TDC\" \u2014 the initials of his then 9-year-old daughter, Teresa Dawn \u2014 with his finger on the dusty gray lunar surface. He said he imagined someone in the distant future would find \"our lunar rover and our footprints and those initials and say, 'I wonder who was here? Some ancient civilization was here back in the 20th century, and look at the funny marks they made.'\" \n Eugene A. Cernan was born in 1934 in Chicago and graduated from Indiana's Purdue University in 1956 with a degree in electrical engineering. (Armstrong also was a Purdue grad.) \n He had been a Navy attack pilot and earned a master's degree in aeronautical engineering when NASA selected him in October 1963 as one of 14 members of its third astronaut class. \n Cernan had the looks of an astronaut from central casting. \"He's your classic sort of handsome debonair flyboy,\" said space historian Roger Launius, associate director of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. \n In 1966, he was pilot of Gemini 9, a three-day flight with command pilot Tom Stafford where they used different techniques to rendezvous with a docking adapter that was previously launched. On the flight, Cernan became the second American to walk in space, spending more than two hours outside the Gemini spacecraft. \n Cernan would later call the mission, \"that spacewalk from hell.\" \n \"It was very serious,\" said Launius, the historian. \"He lost all kinds of water, his equipment did not work effectively. He overheated. His visor glossed over with water, he could barely see. He barely got back in the spacecraft.\" \n Cernan's sweat so much he lost 13 pounds. The space agency was forced to go back to the drawing board. \n \"That was a really important learning experience,\" Launius said. \"The difficult thing about that is they put an astronaut's life at great risk there. They learned the lesson.\" \n With the Apollo program under way, Cernan flew on Apollo 10 in May 1969. It was a dress rehearsal for the lunar landing on the next flight and took Cernan and Stafford, aboard the lunar module Snoopy, to within 9\u00bd miles of the moon's surface. \n The mission was marked by a glitch when the wrong guidance system was turned on and the lunar module went out of control before Stafford righted it by taking manual control. \n Cernan often joked that his job was to paint a white line to the moon that Armstrong and the rest of the Apollo 11 crew could follow. Yet Cernan was one of only three people to voyage twice to the moon \u2014 either to its surface or in moon orbit. James Lovell and John Young are the others. \n In 1973, Cernan became special assistant to the program manager of the Apollo program at Johnson Space Center in Houston, assisting in planning and development of the U.S.-Soviet Apollo-Soyuz mission. He was senior U.S. negotiator with the Soviets on the test project. \n He retired from NASA three years later. He worked for a Houston energy firm, Coral Petroleum, then in 1981 began his own aerospace consulting company. He eventually became chairman of an engineering firm that worked on NASA projects. He also worked as a network television analyst during shuttle flights in the 1980s. \n A documentary about his life, \"The Last Man on the Moon\" was released in 2016. \n Teresa was Cernan's only child with his wife Barbara. The couple married in 1961 and divorced 20 years later. In 1987, he married again, to Jan Nanna, and they lived in Houston. \n In all, Cernan logged 566 hours and 15 minutes in space, more than 73 hours of them on the moon's surface. \n \"I can always walk on Main Street again, but I can never return to my Valley of Taurus-Littrow, and that cold fact has left me with a yearning restlessness,\" he wrote in his 1999 autobiography, also entitled \"The Last Man on the Moon.\" \n \"It was perhaps the brightest moment of my life, and I can't go back,\" he said. \"Enriched by a singular event that is larger than life, I no longer have the luxury of being ordinary.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Gene Cernan, last astronaut on the moon, dies at 82"}

No one did. \n At the time, police believe, Grace's adoptive mother and the mother's boyfriend were plotting to kill her. \n Grace, who moved a lot and had a learning disability, looked out for the lonely kids at school. She befriended Jackie Horst's autistic son, eating lunch with him at Abington Junior High. \n \"She showed patience for him and kindness toward him, and he thought she was really pretty and so nice,\" said Horst, whose son gave Grace flowers on Valentine's Day. \"(She) didn't really mind about some of his quirks.\" \n But the friends couldn't see each other outside school in Glenside, near Philadelphia. Horst tried reaching out to Grace's mother, but Sara Packer never responded. The ninth-grader had described the adults at home as \"mean\" but never said more to Horst's son. \n Yet she had endured a lifetime of pain and loss, from sex abuse allegations that led her birthparents to lose custody when she was 3, to the indecent assault that sent her adoptive father to prison when she was 10, to the unimaginable rape-murder fantasy that prosecutors say led Sara Packer and boyfriend Jacob Sullivan to kill Grace in July. \n They are due in court Friday for a preliminary hearing. \n Despite her home life, Grace's list of favorite things echoed those of dreamy young girls everywhere: the colors purple and pink, butterflies, signing \"Gracie\" with a heart in place of the dot. \n \"She was kept isolated,\" said Nadine Barnett, one of the Abington parents who organized a public memorial for Grace on Monday. \"(But she) was a really good friend to people who needed her.\" \n Grace was born Susan Hunsicker on Aug. 14, 2001, to a poor, low-functioning couple living with family in a crowded house in Norristown. Her parents fought to keep their three children, but a Berks County judge terminated their parental rights over reports that other adults were abusing them. \n Sara Packer, a Northampton County adoption worker, and her husband, David, took in the two youngest as foster children, then adopted them and renamed the 3-year-old Grace. The Packers would go on to foster 30 children as they hopscotched around northeast Pennsylvania for a decade. \n That came to a halt in 2010 when a foster teen told authorities she had seen pictures on David Packer's phone of him having sex with another foster child. \n The 18-year-old victim eventually told Allentown police that the sex had been ongoing since she was 15, and that Sara Packer knew of it by the end. Police also determined that 9-year-old Grace had been molested over several years. Sara Packer lost her job as an adoption supervisor, and David Packer, who had worked at a paintball facility, went to prison for five years. \n By 2015, Sara Packer was living with Sullivan, a draftsman, and working at a call center. \n Grace had been sent to North Carolina to live with a relative in January 2015. Photos posted on a memorial Facebook page show breezy summer memories as Grace holds hands with a friend in the ocean, tries miniature golf and bounces off a diving board. \n But the relative's situation changed, and Grace returned to her mother that November. \n \"They wanted to ship her out, and when that failed, they plotted to kill her,\" said Bucks County Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Schorn. \n Grace was last seen at a Fourth of July picnic last year. Four days later, Sara Packer watched as Sullivan \u2014 after taking Viagra \u2014 raped her daughter, police said. \n They sedated Grace and left her to die, bound and gagged, in their sweltering attic of a new rental in Quakertown, according to a police affidavit. When they found her alive the next day, Sullivan strangled her, police said. Sara Packer reported Grace missing July 11, but failed to drop off a photo to Abington police or give them her new address. \n According to the affidavit, the couple left her body in the Quakertown house for several months packed in cat litter. \n When police tracked them down that fall, they got to work disposing of the body, the affidavit said. They removed the girl's limbs and dumped the body upstate, where hunters found it on Halloween, authorities said. \n As police closed in on them last month, Sara Packer and Sullivan forged a suicide pact, authorities said. They were found unconscious from an apparent drug overdose Dec. 30.

They came out against any plan by Trump to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and warned that it could ratchet up tensions with the Arab world. \n \"It is very important for us all to refrain from unilateral actions,\" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said. \"We hope that there can be reflection on consequences of any move that is taken,\" she said. \n Although Trump had made similar statements about NATO during his election campaign, his recent comments still came as a bit of a surprise since his choice for defense secretary, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, stressed his support for the NATO military alliance in his U.S. congressional confirmation hearing last week. \n Trump's views, in an interview published Monday with German daily Bild and The Times of London, contradict Mattis, Steinmeier said. \n \"If one compares the positions of the designated president and the future foreign and defense ministers, then one can't discern a common foreign policy line among the new U.S. government,\" he said. \n There have even been fears the U.S. military commitment to Europe would wane under Trump. A German newspaper group reports that Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite has urged Trump to continue meeting the U.S.'s financial obligations toward the alliance. \n \"Since World War II, the presence of U.S. troops has been a prerequisite for rebuilding the continent, safeguarding peace and ensuring security,\" she told the RND network of some 30 German papers. \n \"We expect continuity from the new U.S. administration. Trump must maintain this leadership role, to ensure security, stability and peace,\" she was quoted as saying. \n Trump indicated he was indifferent to whether the EU stays together or not, a sharp break from the Obama administration, which encouraged British people to vote to remain in the EU in the June referendum. \n \"I believe others will leave \u2026 I do think keeping it together is not gonna be as easy as a lot of people think,\" Trump said in the interview. \n The British exit from the EU would \"end up being a great thing,\" he said. \n British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it's \"very good news that the United States of America wants to do a good free trade deal with us and wants to do it very fast.\" \n Trump was less kind to German industry officials, saying car manufacturers including BMW could face tariffs of up to 35 percent if they set up plants in Mexico instead of in the U.S. and try to export the cars to the U.S. \n Such tariffs would make the American auto industry \"worse, weaker and more expensive,\" Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's economy minister, told Bild. \n Gabriel suggested Europeans should exhibit more self-confidence in dealing with Trump. \"We're not weak and inferior,\" he said. \n Whatever his goal, Trump's comments were strong enough to make him the talk of the town in European capitals. \n \"It is clear that we are discussing this issue all the time,\" Czech Foreign Minister Lubomir Zaoralek said at the EU meeting in Brussels. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Defiant EU nations ready themselves for Trump presidency"}

{"date": "January 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A U.S. law enforcement official says the FBI has arrested the wife of the Orlando nightclub shooter. The official says Noor Salman was taken into custody Monday, Jan. 16, 2017, in the San Francisco area and is due in court Tuesday in California. \n WASHINGTON >> The wife of the Orlando nightclub shooter, who was extensively questioned by federal agents in the days after the massacre, was arrested today by the FBI in connection with the attack, authorities said. \n Noor Salman was taken into custody in the San Francisco Bay Area and is facing charges in Florida, including obstruction of justice. She will make her initial court appearance Tuesday morning in Oakland, according to a Twitter post from the United States attorney's office. \n After her husband, Omar Mateen, was killed in a shootout with SWAT team members during the June 12 massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Salman, 30, moved back to California, where she had grown up. \n FBI agents repeatedly questioned Salman in the aftermath of the shooting about whether she had advance knowledge of her husband's plans. Salman told The New York Times in an interview published last fall that she knew her husband had watched jihadist videos but that she was \"unaware of everything\" regarding his intent to shoot up the club. She also said he had physically abused her. \n \"Noor Salman had no foreknowledge nor could she predict what Omar Mateen intended to do that tragic night,\" her attorney, Linda Moreno, said in a statement. \n \"Noor has told her story of abuse at his hands. We believe it is misguided and wrong to prosecute her and that it dishonors the memories of the victims to punish an innocent person,\" Moreno said. \n Mateen was the only shooter, and by the time a three-hour standoff with law enforcement had ended, 49 patrons were killed and another 53 people required hospitalization. \n Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a 911 call to emergency officials during the standoff. He also made a series of Facebook posts and searches before and during the attack. \n Salman grew up in Rodeo, a small Bay Area community northeast of San Francisco. The FBI in San Francisco said she was arrested there though jail records where she is being held say she was arrested about 30 miles away in Dublin. \n She wed Mateen in 2011 after the two met online. They lived in Fort Pierce, Florida, at the time of the shooting. Last month, Salman filed a petition in a California court to change the name of the son she had with Mateen. \n \"We said from the beginning, we were going to look at every aspect of this, of every aspect of this shooter's life to determine not just why did he take these actions \u2014 but who else knew about them? Was anyone else involved?\" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in an MSNBC interview. \n The Times first reported on the arrest. \n Orlando Police Chief John Mina said in a statement that Salman was facing accusations of obstruction of justice and \"aiding and abetting by providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization.\" \n \"Nothing can erase the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones,\" Mina said. \"But today, there is some relief in knowing that someone will be held accountable for that horrific crime.\" \n Florida Gov. Rick Scott said he hoped the arrest \"provides some comfort to the families who are mourning their loved ones,\" he added. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. official says Orlando shooter's widow has been arrested"}

{"date": "January 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n James R. Johnson handed out programs before the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday commemorative service at Ebenezer Baptist Church, today, in Atlanta. \n ATLANTA >> As Americans celebrate the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., civil rights leaders and activists are trying to reconcile the transition from the nation's first black president to a president-elect still struggling to connect with most non-white voters. \n King's daughter today encouraged Americans to fight for the slain civil rights leader's vision of love and justice \"no matter who is in the White House.\" \n In Atlanta, Bernice King addressed more than 2,000 people gathered at her father's Ebenezer Baptist Church four days before Donald Trump's presidential inauguration. She spoke hours before her brother, Martin Luther King III, is scheduled to meet with the president-elect at Trump Tower in New York. \n Trump won fewer than 1 out of 10 black voters in November after a campaign of racially charged rhetoric, and tensions have flared anew with his recent criticism of civil rights icon John Lewis, whom the president-elect called \"all talk\" and \"no action.\" \n Bernice King avoided a detailed critique of Trump, but said the nation still has a choice between \"chaos and community,\" as her father once said. \n \"At the end of the day, the Donald Trumps come and go,\" Bernice King said. But, she added \"we still have to find a way to create\" what her father called \"the beloved community.\" \n Sen. Bernie Sanders, a failed presidential candidate, brought the Ebenezer assembly to its feet with his reminder that the slain civil rights leader was not just an advocate for racial equality, but a radical proponent for economic justice \u2014 a mission that put him at odds with the political establishment. \n \"If you think governors and senators and mayors were standing up and saying what a great man Dr. King was, read history, because you are sorely mistaken,\" Sanders roared from the Ebenezer dais. \n Sanders, who struggled to attract black voters in his Democratic primary fight with Hillary Clinton, recalled King opposing the Vietnam War as exploiting the poor. He also noted King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, where he'd gone to rally striking sanitation workers, white and black. \n Truly honoring King, Sanders said, means bringing that \"spirit and courage into the arena in 2017.\" \n The Rev. Raphael Warnock, Ebenezer's senior pastor, didn't call Trump by name, but blasted the president-elect for his treatment of Lewis, now a Georgia congressman whose Atlanta-based congressional district includes Ebenezer. \n Lewis angered Trump when he told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he views Trump as an \"illegitimate president\" because of alleged Russian interference in the campaign. Trump retorted Saturday on Twitter that Lewis is \"all talk\" and said his district is \"falling apart\" and \"crime infested.\" \n \"Anybody who suggests that John Lewis is all talk and no action needs a lesson in American history,\" Warnock said. As a young man, Lewis was arrested many times and beaten by authorities as he demonstrated for civil and voting rights for black Americans. Warnock called him \"the hero of Bloody Sunday and the conscience of the Congress.\" \n Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed piled on, quoting Trump when he was in Lewis's district a decade ago to open a Trump Tower project that would later fail. Trump, recalled the mayor, said Atlanta, at least then, was doing \"a great job\" and he was \"glad to be here.\" \n \"I don't know what changed,\" Reed said mockingly before praising Lewis as a personal hero. \n Lewis was in Miami at King Day events. \n Warnock, meanwhile, praised outgoing President Barack Obama as a model for the office. \"Thank you, Barack Obama. I'm sad to see you leave,\" he said. But, he said, Trump's inauguration will mean \"one less brother experiences racial profiling.\" \n Some Republicans have defended Trump's criticism of Lewis, arguing it is inappropriate for a congressman to question an incoming president's legitimacy. \n Clara Smith, an Atlanta resident who came today to Ebenezer, scoffed at any GOP indignation, remembering that Trump for years questioned whether President Barack Obama was a \"natural-born citizen,\" as required by the Constitution to serve as president. \n \"He carried on with that knowing full well what he was doing\" to the nation's first black president, Smith said. \n Smith, 66, recalled joining sit-ins and lunch counters of segregated restaurants in her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. She said she tries to \"ignore\" Trump and \"his foolishness with the Twitter,\" but \"with everything that's happening around us\" she said \"we have to pass along that history.\" \n Susan Minsk, 48, came to Ebenezer with her 17-year-old daughter Sophie from Sandy Springs, a Republican-leaning suburb just outside of Atlanta and Lewis's district. As the white mother and daughter waited outside, unsure if they'd be able to get in, Sophie said she worries that Trump's rhetoric will make social tensions worse. \n \"He just burns so many bridges,\" she said. \"Why make everyone feel more segregated than they do already?\" \n There are celebrations around the country to honor the slain civil rights leader. \n In Memphis, Tennessee, residents of the city where King was killed are honoring his legacy with neighborhood clean-up events and a daylong celebration at the National Civil Rights Museum. \n Bicyclists in Detroit have marked the day by pedaling to sites connected to a historic visit the slain civil rights leader made to the city. \n About 300 bicyclists participated in today's free 10-mile ride, which took in such sites as downtown Detroit's Cobo Center. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "King Day highlights transition from Obama to Trump"}

He said the shooting erupted when security personnel tried to stop a man from entering the Blue Parrot club with a gun. \n Three of those killed were part of the security detail at the 10-day BPM electronic music festival, Pech said.

He said 20 bullet casings from three different pistols were found at the scene, but it was unclear if the security detail was armed or fired any of the weapons. \n Pech said the gunman himself apparently escaped, though three people had been detained nearby. It was not known if they had been involved in the shooting. \n \"We know of another shooting incident that occurred near the nightclub, but we are investigating whether that is related\" to the nightclub shooting, Pech said. \n He told local media that authorities were investigating a potential dispute over control of territory by drug dealers or extortion as possible motives. \n Quintana Roo Gov. Carlos Joaquin attributed the shooting to \"the intolerance and conflict of interests between two people,\" but did not specify what those conflicts were. He said the two exchanged gunfire. \n The government of the township that includes Playa de Carmen referred in a statement to \"attackers who fired shots,\" but did not provide further details. \n Rodolfo Del Angel, director of police in Quintana Roo, told Milenio TV that the shooting was the result of \"a disagreement between people inside\" the nightclub and said security guards came under fire when they tried to contain the dispute. \n Playa del Carmen has largely been spared the violence that has hit other parts of Mexico. \n The state tourism department said the shooting was an \"isolated act of violence\" and stressed that \"the situation in Playa del Carmen is under control and Mexican and foreign tourists can feel protected and safe.\" \n Without providing nationalities, the state government gave the names of three of those killed.

Trump is continuing to lash out at critics in the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress who are vowing to skip his swearing-in ceremony. \n NEW YORK >> His inauguration days away, President-elect Donald Trump is continuing to lash out at critics in the intelligence community and Democrats in Congress who are vowing to skip his swearing-in ceremony. \n The tough-talking Republican questioned whether the CIA director himself was \"the leaker of fake news\" in a Sunday night tweet. \n The extraordinary criticism from the incoming president came hours after CIA chief John Brennan charged that Trump lacks a full understanding of the threat Moscow poses to the United States, delivering a public lecture to the president-elect that further highlighted the bitter state of Trump's relations with American intelligence agencies. \n \"Now that he's going to have an opportunity to do something for our national security as opposed to talking and tweeting, he's going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that U.S. and national security interests are protected,\" Brennan said on \"Fox News Sunday,\" warning that the president-elect's impulsivity could be dangerous. \n Trump shot back in a Twitter post Sunday, saying: \"Oh really, couldn't do much worse \u2013 just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes. Not good! Was this the leaker of Fake News?\" \n The president-elect remained behind closed doors in his Manhattan high-rise for the weekend as his team worked to answer questions about his plans at home and abroad once he's sworn into office on Friday. \n Among Trump's immediate challenges: the United States' complicated relationship with Russia, crafting an affordable health care alternative that doesn't strip coverage from millions of Americans and dealing with an assertion by Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon, that his election was not legitimate. \n Without providing details, Trump promised his plan to replace the nation's health care law would provide universal coverage, according to a Washington Post interview published late Sunday. \n \"We're going to have insurance for everybody,\" he said. \"There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it. That's not going to happen with us.\" \n In a separate interview with the Times of London, Trump indicated that he could lift sanctions imposed on Russia for its military intervention in Ukraine in exchange for a nuclear arms deal. The suggestion met a frosty reception in Moscow. \n Meanwhile, a growing number of Democrats in Congress have vowed to skip Trump's inauguration. \n \"We cannot normalize Donald Trump, and we certainly cannot turn our heads and ignore such a threat to the institutions and values of our democracy,\" Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York said today in a statement. \n Trump's lieutenants pushed back hard, particularly against Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a civil rights legend who said Russian interference in Trump's election delegitimizes his presidency. \n \"I think it's incredibly disappointing and I think it's irresponsible for people like himself to question the legitimacy of the next United States president,\" incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said of Lewis on ABC's \"This Week,\" insisting that Republicans did not question the legitimacy of President Barack Obama's victory eight years ago. Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that he hopes Lewis will change his mind and attend. \n Priebus later acknowledged that conservatives \u2014 led by Trump himself \u2014 spent years questioning Obama's eligibility to serve as president, suggesting he was not born in the United States. \n Trump has done little to encourage unity in recent days, instead inflaming tensions with his critics through a series of tweets. The incoming president tweeted Saturday that Lewis should pay more attention to his \"crime ridden\" Atlanta-area district, adding that the civil rights leader was \"all talk.\" \n Questions about Trump's relationship with Russia have dominated the days leading up to his inauguration. \n Michael Flynn, who is set to become Trump's national security adviser, has been in frequent contact with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. in recent weeks, including on the day the Obama administration hit Moscow with sanctions in retaliation for the alleged election hacking, a senior U.S. official said. \n After initially denying the contact took place, Trump's team publicly acknowledged the conversations on Sunday. \n \"The conversations that took place at that time were not in any way related to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia or the expulsion of diplomats,\" said Pence. \n Repeated contacts just as Obama imposed sanctions would raise questions about whether Trump's team discussed \u2014 or even helped shape \u2014 Russia's response. Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly did not retaliate against the U.S. for the sanctions or the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats, a decision Trump quickly praised. \n Trump has repeatedly called for a better relationship between the U.S. and Putin's government. He suggested in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Friday that he'd consider easing the latest sanctions on Russia. \n \"I think he has to be mindful that he does not have a full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road,\" Brennan said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Inauguration in sight, Trump continues Twitter assault"}

{"date": "January 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The company flag of Samsung Electronics flutters next to the South Korean national flag in Seoul, South Korea, Monday, Jan. 16, 2017. Prosecutors requested the arrest Monday of the de facto head of Samsung, South Korea's biggest company, on bribery and other charges in the influence-peddling scandal that led to the impeachment of the country's president. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> A request by South Korean prosecutors to arrest Lee Jae-yong, the 48-year-old vice chairman and de facto leader of Samsung Electronics, has added to the troubles for the country's most valuable company after a spate of recalls last year. \n Lee faces allegations he offered $36 million in bribes to a friend of President Park Geun-hye, who has been impeached. Prosecutors say they also suspect him of embezzlement and lying under oath. A Seoul court will review the request for his arrest Wednesday and will likely decide on it within this week. \n Here is what you need to know about the entanglement of the world's largest smartphone maker in the scandal: \n ___ \n SAMSUNG'S LINK TO THE SCANDAL \n Samsung is alleged to have made substantial donations to nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi Soon-sil, a confidante of Park's who has been jailed and is on trial for allegedly using her connections with the president to extort money and favors from companies and unlawfully interfere with government affairs. \n South Korean prosecutors say the company agreed to pay more than $18 million to a company Choi set up to finance equestrian training of her daughter in Germany. It also helped pay for a winter sports center run by Choi's niece. Of four Samsung executives prosecutors have questioned Lee is the only one they have asked to arrest. The prosecutors say they plan to summon Park for questioning as a possible suspect. \n The company has said it never made donations to win favors. \n __ \n LEADERSHIP SUCCESSION \n Since Lee Jae-yong's father suffered a heart attack in May 2014, the company has been trying to accelerate a leadership succession from the 72-year-old father to his son. \n The younger Lee has held various executive positions at Samsung Electronics but owned less than a 1 percent stake in the company in 2014. Inheriting his father's 3-percent stake would cost him billions of dollars in inheritance taxes. To strengthen his control over the company without having to lay out a fortune in either taxes or share purchases, the Samsung group chose in 2015 to merge two of its member companies, Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries. \n Lee was the biggest shareholder in Cheil. The merger made him the biggest shareholder in Samsung C&T, increasing the share of Samsung Electronics shares that he effectively controls to about 5 percent. \n Minority shareholders of Samsung C&T, including the U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management, opposed the merger, saying it benefited the Lee family at their expense. \n Prosecutors have indicted a former health minister, Moon Hyung-pyo, for allegedly abusing his power in asking the national pension fund to support the Samsung merger plan at Park's request. \n __ \n EXPOLDING PHONES AND WASHERS \n Just weeks before Samsung was dragged into the political scandal, the company discontinued its flagship smartphone, the Galaxy Note 7, after finding it was prone to overheat and catch fire. The recalls began shortly after the smartphone was launched in August. \n Samsung has estimated the total cost of the recall at at least $5.3 billion and slashed its third-quarter profit forecast. \n The recalls and safety concerns stung, and company officials say they plan to soon announce a definitive conclusion on why the phones were overheating. \n In another upset, about a month after the Note 7 was discontinued, nearly 3 million Samsung washing machines were recalled in the U.S. following several reports of injuries \u2014 including a broken jaw \u2014 due to \"excessive vibration.\" \n ___ \n PROFIT MACHINE \n Samsung has postponed the personnel reshuffle it usually announces every December. An arrest for Lee also might slow decision making on big investments and long-term strategy. But Lee is not involved in day-to-day management, so the company's smartphone and chip sales would be unlikely to suffer much immediate damage from his absence. \n The company remains a profit machine thanks to its formidable business in making microchips for computers and mobile devices. Earlier this month, Samsung said its October-December operating profit jumped 50 percent to $7.8 billion, its best performance in more than three years. It is due to give more details on its earnings in a conference call scheduled for Jan. 24. \n Before prosecutors requested Lee's arrest, Samsung Electronic's share price had been setting record highs, with shareholders anticipating generous dividends. On Monday, it fell 2 percent. \n ___ \n Follow Youkyung Lee: \n www.twitter.com/YKLeeAP \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "South Korea's Samsung in rough patch with arrest request, recalls"}
