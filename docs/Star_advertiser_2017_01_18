The 39-year-old inmate was put to death with the sedative midazolam, followed by rocuronium bromide to halt breathing, and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. \n Gray showed no emotion as he was walked into the execution chamber wearing blue jeans and handcuffs. Asked if he had any final words, Gray responded, \"Nope.\" \n Gray was condemned to death in 2006 for the murders of 9-year-old Stella Harvey and 4-year-old sister Ruby, and sentenced to life in prison for the slaying of their parents, Bryan and Kathryn Harvey. \n The family was getting ready to host friends for a chili dinner when Gray and his nephew, Ray Dandridge, were looking for a home to rob when they spotted the open door. Court records show they tied up the family in the basement and Gray slashed their throats and bashed their heads with a hammer before setting their home on fire and fleeing with a computer, a wedding ring and a basket of cookies. \n The well-known family's slaying rocked Virginia's capital city and was followed by the killing of another Richmond family less than a week later. Kathryn Harvey was co-owner of a popular Richmond toy store, the World of Mirth, and Bryan Harvey was a guitarist and singer for a rock duo, House of Freaks. \n Gray also confessed to participating in the slaying of 21-year-old Ashley Baskerville, her mother Mary Baskerville-Tucker and stepfather Percyell Tucker days after the Harvey deaths, but wasn't tried in that case. Gray and Dandridge said Ashley Baskerville had served as a lookout for them during the Harvey slayings. \n Dandridge pleaded guilty to the Tucker-Baskerville slayings and is serving a life sentence. \n Elizabeth Peiffer, an attorney for Gray, said that while his death may provide a measure of retribution for some, it also took \"from the world a man trying to make amends and make life better for others.\" \n Prison officials closed a blue curtain at 8:54 p.m., shielding Gray from view. That is typically when officials insert the IV and place heart monitors before starting the injection. The curtain remained closed for more than 30 minutes before it was opened and the lethal injection began, which Pfeiffer said was significantly longer than usual and concerning. \n Lisa Kinney, a Virginia Department of Corrections spokeswoman, said she could not explain why the curtain was closed that long. \n The lethal injection began around 9:28 p.m. For several minutes, Gray's appeared to be breathing heavily and snored loudly several times. At 9:33 p.m. he stopped moving. \n Gray was the first Virginia inmate executed since convicted serial killer Alfredo Prieto received a lethal injection in October 2015. Just six inmates remain on Virginia's death row. No other execution dates have been set. \n Virginia obtained the midazolam and potassium chloride from a compounding pharmacy whose identity is secret under a new state law. \n Midazolam has come under fire after several problematic executions in other states, with critics arguing it causes inmates to suffer a painful death because it cannot reliably render them unconscious. Gray's attorneys had said the fact that the drug was obtained from a compounding pharmacy rather than a typical manufacturer magnifies the risk of problems. \n But the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly upheld the use of midazolam in 2015 and the high court earlier today rejected Gray's bid to stay the execution so he could challenge the planned use of the compounded version of the drug. \n Gray's attorneys had unsuccessfully appealed to Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe to spare his life, saying Gray's actions arose from drug use aimed at numbing years of sexual abuse by his older brother when he was a child. Gray says he was high on PCP at the time of the Harvey slayings and doesn't remember much. \n Several death penalty opponents and some relatives of Gray held a vigil outside the prison as he was executed, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Virginia man convicted of 2006 slaying of family is executed"}

The commission members seen in this photo taken today are, from left, Loretta Sheehan, Marc Tilker, corporation counsel (unidentified), chairman Max Sword, vice chairwoman Cha Thompson, Luella Costales, and Steven Levinson. \n The Honolulu Police Commission today agreed to allow Police Chief Louis Kealoha to leave his job with a settlement package worth $250,000, ending a rocky seven-year term and marking a new chapter for a Honolulu Police Department that has been engulfed in scandal. \n The effective date of the retirement is March 1. Kealoha must return the $250,000 if he is convicted of a felony. In exchange for the payout, the city is released from claims by the chief arising from the terms and conditions of his job. \n In addition to the settlement, Kealoha will receive the standard pension and post-employment health insurance and other benefits that come with having served on the force for 33 years. \n As chief, Kealoha's salary is $182,088 annually. \n Commission Chairman Max Sword told reporters after today's four-hour meeting that besides hiring and firing the chief, the seven-member panel has a duty to do what's best for the people and community of the city. \n \"The department has been under a dark cloud for the last two years with all this federal investigation and we believe that the police department needs to move on to get out from under that cloud,\" Sword said. \"We also are responsible in my view, and the commission's view, that the morale and welfare of the police department is incumbent on what we do because it affects how they act or how they cover or support the community.\" \n The commission voted 5-1 to approve the agreement. Commission member Loretta Sheehan said she was the lone dissenting vote \"because I believe it's expensive, unnecessary and very likely undeserved.\" Sheehan said that the commission should have conducted a for-cause hearing \"to examine the issues that have been raised regarding his leadership and management abilities.\" The commission could have then made a decision on whether to remove Kealoha, she said. \n Commission member Eddie Flores did not attend today's meeting. \n Kealoha's departure comes just as a federal investigation into alleged wrongdoing by the chief, his wife, and others are beginning to come into focus. \n A grand jury is looking into the allegations of civil rights abuses and corruption over allegations that Kealoha and his wife, Katherine Kealoha (a deputy city prosecutor), framed her uncle for the theft of the Kealoha's home mailbox in a dispute over family finances. \n A retired officer involved in the mailbox case pleaded guilty to conspiracy and four other officers have received target letters from the FBI. FBI agents on Friday raided the Honolulu Prosecutor's Office. \n Kealoha announced on Dec. 20 that he had put himself on \"restriction of police authority\" (ROPA) status, essentially paid leave, after the FBI sent him a letter informing him that he is the target of a criminal investigation. Kealoha had said for months that he would not step down because he had done nothing wrong. \n Sword announced on Jan. 6 that the seven-member panel and the chief had reached a tentative agreement for him to retire, but that additional details had yet to be hashed out. \n Kealoha was a captain when he first became chief in 2009. He was given a second, five-year term in 2014 that was to have run through Nov. 27, 2019. \n ", "author": "By Gordon Y.K.

{"date": "January 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n An electric vehicle charging station awaits a vehicle in the parking lot at the Hawaii State Legislature. Renewable energy advocates in Hawaii are pushing a bill to urge the transportation sector to get all its energy from renewable sources in 2045. \n Hawaii has the most aggressive renewable energy targets in the nation, aiming for its utilities to get 100 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2045. \n Now advocates want to extend that goal to the transportation sector to urge all forms of ground transportation to fuel up using renewable sources by 2045. \n \"The majority of our fossil fuel goes into transportation, and that's a challenge that we have to solve, and we currently don't have a vision for what that future looks like,\" said Jeff Mikulina, executive director of the Blue Planet Foundation, which is pushing the bill. \n But Hawaii officials aren't planning to make everyone get rid of their fuel-powered cars \u2014 at least not yet. \n \"Nobody wants to step in and force people to get rid of cars that they might love now,\" said state Rep. Chris Lee, chairman of the Energy and Environment committee. \n The goal represents a steep climb for the auto industry in a state where there are about 5,000 electric vehicles, out of an estimated 1 million cars on the road. \n \"Our ability to achieve it is really going to be dependent on what happens throughout the entire automotive industry,\" said Hugh Baker, managing director of HD Baker & Co., an energy consulting company. \"We can say we want 100 percent clean transportation technology, but the market in Hawaii is not nearly big enough by itself to move the whole global automotive industry. It will really take more than just Hawaii.\" \n Unlike Hawaii's groundbreaking 100 percent renewable goal for electricity, where utilities in the state will be fined if they don't comply by deadline, the proposed transportation goal isn't a mandate. \n With 1 million cars on the roads, hundreds of auto dealerships and multiple counties with fleets of vehicles, it's unclear how the state could enforce a renewable fuels mandate, advocates said. Beyond the vehicle stakeholders, there are cyclists and pedestrians in the mix, making it challenging for the state to even measure what percentage of the state's transportation fuel comes from renewables. \n The bill is being introduced in the Hawaii Legislature, which began Wednesday. If passed, Hawaii would be the first in the nation to set such a high goal for its transportation sector. Vermont also has an aggressive goal for renewable fuel in transportation, but most states don't have such targets in place. \n \"That's a huge, huge transformation,\" said Hawaii Gov. David Ige in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"We are the most isolated community on the planet, and we import virtually all of the oil we use today.\" \n Details of the bill are still being worked out, but it's undecided whether it will come with funding, Lee said. \n The state recently created a new position in the Department of Transportation to work on renewable fuels in transportation, and it is planning to build infrastructure to increase electric vehicle charging stations at work locations in Honolulu's urban core using state funds, he said. \n Lawmakers also are introducing a bill to boost the required number of electric vehicle charging stations, which is currently 1 station per 100 spaces, so that commuters can charge electric vehicles during the day when more energy from the sun is pumping into the grid. \n Encouraging more electric vehicles \u2014 or \"batteries on wheels\" \u2014 could help Hawaii meet its renewable electricity goals. \n \"It's easier to manage more renewable energy when we have electric vehicles on the grid that can suck up that excess and hopefully in the future put some energy back on the grid,\" Mikulina said. \n Auto dealers in Hawaii support the transition to renewable energy, but they believe it will take a massive advertising campaign by the state to encourage people to buy vehicles powered by alternative fuels, said David Rolf, executive director of the Hawaii Automobile Dealers Association. \n \"I'm passionate about this goal, but I'm also realistic,\" Rolf said. \n Hawaii's residents ranked second in the nation in 2015 with 2.94 electric vehicles for every 1,000 residents, just behind California, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. \n Tackling the fossil fuels used in air travel \u2014 which is critical to Hawaii's tourism-driven economy \u2014 will have to wait. \n About a quarter of the 36 million barrels of oil Hawaii imported in 2015 was used for commercial aviation. But the long flights require energy in a dense form, and with today's technology that's generally only available in fuels, energy experts said. \n \"They need to go so far between recharge opportunities that they really need something with a higher energy density than batteries, and it's just not even physically possible for an airplane to carry enough batteries to go where it needs to go,\" said Matthias Fripp, an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hawaii bill aims for 100 percent renewable transportation"}

{"date": "January 18, 2017", "text": "DENNIS ODA / DODA@STARADVERTISER.COM \n The Hawaii House of Representatives opens the 2017 Legislative Session today. \n Several hundred people gathered at the state Capitol in downtown Honolulu Wednesday morning to kick off the opening of this year's legislative session in which lawmakers are expecting spirited debates on issues of rail financing, \"death with dignity,\" overcrowded jails and the state's ongoing homeless problem. \n Senate President Ron Kouchi and House Speaker Joe Souki delivered opening remarks in their respective chambers amid the aroma of leis, followed by local musical performances. \n Senate and House leaders, as well as Gov. David Ige, briefed the media afterwards about some of this year's top legislative priorities, which will have to be implemented amid lower than expected tax collections.  \n Foremost on the minds of legislators was Honolulu's rail project. The price tag has soared from $5.26 billion as recently as 2012 to as much as $9.5 billion today. \n Two years ago, the Legislature extended the general excise tax by five years so that it would expire at the end of 2027 in order to cover mounting costs, but only after Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell weathered intense questioning over the project's financials. The mayor will have to make his case again to the Legislature this year. \n Both Souki and Kouchi have signaled their support for the project, but it remains to be seen what type of tax extension or hike lawmakers might ultimately sign off on. \n \"Rail in one way or another is going to come to a conclusion in this legislative session and that will be certainly occupying much of the time during the session,\" Kouchi said during opening remarks. \"I personally have supported rail. I hope we find a path, but we are not close to finding that path yet. And we certainly need a lot more information for us to be able to make our final judgment on the rail issue.\" \n Souki said he supports plans to make the excise tax surcharge for the rail project permanent to help finance construction of the rail line, but said he wants to reduce the half-percent tax rate of the excise surcharge. To make up the difference, Souki said the city should also help finance construction from its own treasury. \n \"It does come at a high cost, but make no mistake, rail is the key to the future of Oahu,\" Souki said. \n Souki also urged his colleagues to approve a \"death with dignity\" measure, although he recently acknowledged in an interview that it may take more than one year to convince the 76-member Legislature to approve the idea. \n Souki promised to introduce a bill for what some describe as \"compassionate choices\" in dying, meaning establishing a legal way to provide medical aid in dying for people who are terminally ill and mentally capable. \n John Radcliffe, a longtime lobbyist who is supporting the death-with-dignity proposal, sat in the front row on the floor of the state House and applauded when Souki made his remarks.

{"date": "January 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Tradition suggests it's time for Trump to set aside the say-anything speaking style that got him elected and rise to the inaugural moment. But bucking tradition, or ignoring it all together, is what got Trump to his inaugural moment. \n WASHINGTON >> Tradition suggests it's time for Donald Trump to set aside the say-anything speaking style and rise to the inaugural moment. \n But bucking tradition, or ignoring it altogether, is what got Donald Trump to his inaugural moment. \n When Trump stands on the west front of the Capitol on Friday and delivers his inaugural address, all sides will be waiting to see whether he comes bearing a unifying message for a divided nation or decides to play up his persona as a disrupter of the established order. \n How Trump tends to that balancing act, in both style and content, will be a telling launch for his presidency. \n \"The inaugural is an address that is meant for the ages,\" said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor and director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. \"In particular, it's important when you've had a divisive election. You need to become president of all of the people, including those who vehemently opposed your election.\" \n Trump seems to get that. \n He's spoken admiringly in recent weeks about the speeches of past presidents Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy, and is said to be deeply involved in preparing his address. \n \"This is something very personal to him,\" spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday, estimating the speech will run about 20 minutes. \"He wants to talk about his vision, where he sees this country and where we are right now.\" \n Trump told Fox on Tuesday that he'll start his address with words of thanks to \"everybody,\" including President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, for being \"so gracious.\" \n The president-elect showed he can deliver a straight-forward, prepared address at the Republican convention, where he largely stuck to a script and shut down anti-Hillary Clinton chants of \"lock her up\" from the crowd of GOP loyalists. \n But that address was strikingly dark in tone, sketching a portrait of an America in crisis, and he later embraced that chant from supporters at his freewheeling campaign rallies. \n The inaugural address, by contrast, needs to be \"an inherently aspirational speech,\" said Michael Gerson, who wrote speeches for President George W. Bush and is a frequent Trump critic. \"It has to be about the future and about your vision.\" \n Veteran speechwriters have plenty of other advice for Trump and his chief wordsmith, Stephen Miller. Keep it short. Don't overdo the gravitas. Don't gloat, the victory tour is over. No deviations from script. \n Oh, and don't undo a successful inaugural address with an intemperate tweet \u2014 or two or three \u2014 a few hours later. \n While Trump used his victory speech on Election Night to sound a call to \"come together as one united people,\" his tweets since then have featured name calling, score settling and petulance. \n Wayne Fields, a Washington University expert on presidential rhetoric, said Trump is in an awkward situation, going into his inaugural address as a man who seems to regard precise language with contempt \"rather than respect.\" \n After all, this is a candidate who reveled in taking juvenile potshots during the campaign, labeling his rivals \"stupid,\" \"dumb\" and \"bad.\" \n \"I know words,\" he declared at one rally. \"I have the best words. But there's no better word than stupid, right?\" \n Even if Trump delivers a statesmanlike speech that hits all the right notes, Fields says, \"nobody would know how to receive it or who it was coming from or how seriously to take it. It's a huge challenge.\" \n Any reframing of Trump's tone for the presidency \u2014 if he wanted to do that \u2014 would require a consistent, longer-term shift, Fields said. \n Trump does go into the speech with the benefit of low expectations: His off-the-cuff and often inflammatory style has long been a big part of his appeal. The soaring rhetoric of Obama, for example, simply wouldn't ring true. \n \"Because of the high level of attention and the low expectations, he's far more likely to exceed expectations,\" Jamieson said. \n At the same time, Gerson cautions, Trump faces an extra hurdle in his inaugural address because he won the election by dividing the country. \n \"The method that he won creates the initial challenge of his presidency, which is to rally people broadly around his agenda and vision,\" he said. \n Trump also knows his audience will include plenty of supporters who elected him to challenge the status quo. An address that doesn't offer any flavor of Trump-the-disruptor could disappoint those eager for a sea change in the ways of Washington. \n Beyond Friday, there is the larger question of how Trump will adjust his speaking style over the next four years. His past pledges to \"act more presidential\" when the time is right are coming due. \n \"Any president is going to have to learn how to make use of good speeches,\" said Gerson, noting that presidents may have to speak at three public events in a given day. \"That may be different from anything he's ever experienced before, because the campaign rewarded spontaneity and being extemporaneous. There are huge portions of the presidency where that can't be the case.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Inaugural speech is Trump's time to rise to the moment"}

{"date": "January 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Federal Railroad Administrator Sarah Feinberg leaves office Friday after a two-year tenure as the nation's chief railroad regulator, championing safety and technology initiatives that remain a work in progress. \n PHILADELPHIA >> Sarah Feinberg was on the job as the nation's chief railroad regulator for just three weeks when a packed commuter train slammed into an SUV stopped on tracks north of New York City, killing six people. \n The February 2015 crash highlighted a problem that has plagued the railroad industry since the invention of the automobile: the potential for danger wherever tracks and roads meet. \n Feinberg, a 39-year-old former Obama White House adviser whose lack of railroad industry experience initially drew criticism, sought a new approach. The signs, gates, bells and lights at rail crossings were fine, but what about using technology to empower motorists and keep them away from harm? \n Feinberg, whose tenure as the Federal Railroad Administrator ends with Donald Trump's inauguration as president on Friday, embraced her outsider status in the entrenched, slow-to-evolve world of railroading. \n That meant not getting bogged down in past practice, she said, and not shying away from holding railroads accountable for wrongdoing. During Feinberg's tenure, the Federal Railroad Administration has aggressively policed safety violations, closing cases at a higher rate and collecting more fine money per year than her predecessors. \n \"There were a lot of potential improvements that would only come to fruition if the industry chose to embrace technology and safety improvements, and if the regulator chose to force their hand a bit,\" Feinberg said in a recent interview. \"That's the moment we walked into.\" \n U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who criticized the FRA under previous administrators as a \"rogue agency\" beholden to the railroad industry, praised Feinberg's \"fresh approach\" to the role. \n \"She demonstrated a true willingness to work together and focused much-needed attention on the problem of dangerous grade crossings,\" said Blumenthal, a Democrat representing Connecticut. \n Three months after the New York crash, when an Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia, killing eight people, Feinberg pressed the railroads to hasten the installation of automated speed controls that had been available for years. \n When the industry asked Congress to postpone the installation deadline until the end of 2018, Feinberg fought back and said she would not accept further delays. To keep the pressure up, she had the Federal Railroad Administration post quarterly updates to its website on each railroad's progress. \n As oil trains continued to derail and catch fire, Feinberg again turned to technology, championing modern electronic braking systems. And, with a link between recent commuter train crashes and sleep apnea becoming clearer, Feinberg issued a safety advisory urging railroads to test engineers for the dangerous, fatigue-inducing disorder. \n \"The most important development that we've seen over the last few years is there's now a public expectation for safety improvements in the rail industry,\" Feinberg said. \n Now, as she leaves office, the safety initiatives she championed are a work in progress, with her yet-to-be-named successor left to shape the future of rail travel. There's the looming, $120 billion redesign of the busy Northeast Corridor, planned high-speed service in Florida, Texas and California and aging infrastructure that'll need billions in repairs. \n Trump, a Republican, has proposed spending $1 trillion on infrastructure, but his transition team has not discussed specifics about how that will apply to rail travel. At her confirmation hearing, Trump's Transportation Secretary nominee, Elaine Chao, was non-committal on the deadline for installing speed controls saying she needed a briefing on the technology before answering. \n Patrick Warren, the FRA's acting executive director, will become acting administrator until Trump appoints a replacement for Feinberg. \n As she leaves office, Feinberg had made progress on rail crossings. At the agency's urging, technology companies have started to add grade-crossing warnings to their GPS devices and mapping applications. \n \"That just seemed like common sense,\" Feinberg said. \"It's a good example of, even when safety challenges and problems have been with us for a long time, you have to think about them in new and creative ways.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Exiting rail safety chief looks to technology to save lives"}

Nikki Haley declared her support for moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a shift firmly endorsed by Donald Trump but one that could trigger increased violence in the Middle East. \n Haley, Trump's pick to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that she \"absolutely\" backs the embassy move because that's what Israel and congressional Republicans want. But a spokesman for Jordan's government recently told The Associated Press that the embassy move would be a \"red line\" for Amman and \"inflame the Islamic and Arab streets.\" \n Jordan serves as custodian of a major Islamic shrine in east Jerusalem and the Palestinians seek a capital there. \n Congress ordered the embassy relocation more than 20 years ago, but presidents ever since, Republican and Democrat, have refused to comply. Several Republican senators have proposed legislation that would withhold 50 percent of the State Department's 2017 budget until the embassy move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is completed. \n During a confirmation hearing that lasted nearly three-and-a-half hours, Haley took a tougher stance against Russia than Trump, who will be sworn in Friday, and agreed with a Republican senator who said Syria is committing genocide against its people. \n Haley said she believes Russia committed war crimes by bombing Syrian civilians in the city of Aleppo. Rex Tillerson, Trump's choice for secretary of state, declined to make that accusation during his confirmation hearing last week. \n While Trump has said he believes Russia can be a partner, Haley said she doesn't think Moscow can be trusted right now. She said she's opposed to lifting existing sanctions against Russia unless it changes its behavior in Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere. Cooperation with Russia in such areas as counterterrorism, Haley said, depends on Moscow altering course. \n \"The problem is there are no boundaries with Russia,\" said Haley, who added that the U.S. needs to let Moscow know \"we are not OK\" with Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its incursions into eastern Ukraine. \n Haley assailed the Obama administration for failing to block a U.N. Security Council resolution that condemned Israel's settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank. She pledged to reject future measures that she said unfairly targeted the Jewish state, if the Senate confirms her nomination. \n Haley said she won't go to U.N. headquarters in New York and \"abstain when the U.N. seeks to create an international environment that encourages boycotts of Israel.\" She told the committee the U.N. resolution was \"a terrible mistake\" that makes a peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians harder to achieve. \n Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, thanked Haley in a statement issued during the hearing for her \"unequivocal support and her clear statement regarding the U.N.'s discrimination against Israel.\" \n Haley acknowledged she is new to international diplomacy. But she said while the U.N. has had many successes, citing health and food programs that have saved millions of lives, \"any honest assessment also finds an institution that is often at odds with American national interests and American taxpayers.\" \n The United States contributes 22 percent of the organization's budget, and Haley questioned whether such a sizable investment is worthwhile. \n \"We are a generous nation,\" Haley said. \"But we must ask ourselves what good is being accomplished by this disproportionate contribution. Are we getting what we pay for?\" \n Haley said she would focus on \"fixing\" the U.N. and agreed that money should not continue to be funneled into programs that don't work. But she said she's not in favor of a \"slash and burn\" strategy in which American dollars are used as leverage. She said she doesn't agree with conservative lawmakers who want to withhold any U.S. financial contributions to the U.N. until the Security Council resolution is repealed. \n Last December, Israel and its supporters lashed out at Obama for his decision to abstain and allow the U.N. Security Council to approve the resolution, which called the Israeli settlements \"a flagrant violation under international law.\" \n But Secretary of State John Kerry defended the decision in a speech last month, saying the U.S. was standing up for a two-state solution when it abstained on the resolution. He criticized Israel for settlement building and blamed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for dragging Israel away from democracy. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Haley supports moving U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem"}

{"date": "January 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama speaks during his final presidential news conference. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Army, Pfc. Chelsea Manning poses for a photo wearing a wig and lipstick. \n WASHINGTON >> President Barack Obama firmly defended his decision to cut nearly three decades off convicted leaker Chelsea Manning's prison term Wednesday, arguing in his final White House news conference that the former Army intelligence analyst had served a \"tough prison sentence\" already. \n Taking questions on many topics two days before his presidency ends, Obama also warned that the \"moment may be passing\" for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, pushing back on criticism over his recent move to put pressure on the Jewish state over settlement-building. Turning his attention to President-elect Donald Trump, Obama said he reserves the right to speak out as ex-president if Trump violates America's \"core values.\" \n Obama said he granted clemency to Manning because she had gone to trial, taken responsibility for her crime and received a sentence that was harsher than other leakers had received. He emphasized that he had merely commuted her sentence, not granted a pardon, which would have symbolically forgiven her for the crime. \n \"I feel very comfortable that justice has been served,\" Obama said. \n Manning was convicted in 2013 of violating the Espionage Act and other crimes for leaking more than 700,000 classified documents while working as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad. Formerly known as Bradley Manning, she declared as transgender after being sentenced to 35 years in prison. She had served more than six years before Obama commuted her sentence on Tuesday, with a release date set for May. \n \"The notion that the average person who was thinking about disclosing vital, classified information would think that it goes unpunished, I don't think would get that impression from the sentence that Chelsea Manning has served,\" Obama said. \n Obama's defense of controversial decisions came as he prepares to exit the presidency after eight years marked by major victories on health care, the economy and climate change, along with disappointments over his inability to achieve his goals on immigration, gun control and closing the Guantanamo Bay prison. He also wound down wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but wrestled with other security threats posed by the Islamic State group and the Syria civil war he was unable to resolve. \n Even many of Obama's proudest achievements, like the \"Obamacare\" health care overhaul, stand to be rolled back or undermined by President-elect Donald Trump, a shadow that hangs over Obama's legacy as he leaves office. The formal end comes Friday when Obama and Trump will motorcade together to the Capitol for Trump's swearing-in before Obama, then an ex-president, flies with his family to California for a vacation. \n Reflecting on his legacy as the first black president, Obama disputed the notion that race relations had worsened. And he dismissed as \"fake news\" the idea that there is widespread voter fraud in the U.S., a notion that Democrats say is used to justify restrictions that make it harder for African-Americans to vote. \n Appearing one last time in front of the White House seal, Obama said he was \"significantly worried\" that the growth of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories would \"increasingly make a two-state solution impossible.\" He stood behind his decision to allow a U.N. Security Council resolution to pass criticizing Israel over the settlements, though he conceded Trump might pursue a different approach. \n \"If you do not have two states, then in some form or fashion you are extending an occupation,\" Obama said. \n He defended his administration's rapprochement with Cuba and his eleventh-hour move to end the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy that lets any Cuban who makes it to U.S. soil stay and become a legal resident. Ending the visa-free path was the latest development in a warming of relations that has included the easing of the U.S. economic embargo and the restoration of commercial flights between the U.S. and the small island nation. \n \"That was a carry-over of an old way of thinking that didn't make sense in this day and age, particularly as we're opening up travel between the two countries,\" Obama said of the \"wet foot, dry foot\" policy. \n After leaving office, Obama plans to write a book, raise money to develop his presidential library, and work on a Democratic initiative to prepare for the 2020 round of congressional redistricting. Yet he said he plans to assume a low profile in the months after he leaves office, and to avoid commenting on politics on a daily basis. \n \"I want to be quiet a little bit, and not hear myself talk so darn much,\" Obama said. \n Yet he carved out room for potential exceptions. Obama was insistent that he wouldn't stay silent of Trump tried to deport children brought to the U.S. illegally, a group Obama has sought to protect though executive action. \n \"That would merit me speaking out,\" Obama said. \n Although Obama had long intended to take one last round of questions before leaving office, White House officials said that in recent days, Obama became intent on using the occasion to draw a symbolic contrast with Trump on issues of accountability and press freedoms. Trump's team has said it's considering changes to the traditional daily press briefing and to the location of news conferences, stoking concerns among journalists that their ability to cover the presidency may be scaled back. \n Obama alluded to those concerns in his opening remarks, noting the role the press plays in American democracy. \n \"It doesn't work if we don't have a well-informed citizenry, and you are the conduit,\" Obama said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama defends decision to commute Chelsea Manning's sentence"}

{"date": "January 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Environmental Protection Agency Administrator-designate, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Donald Trump's choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency said today that climate change is real, breaking with both the president-elect and his own past statements. \n In response to questions from Democrats during his Senate confirmation hearing, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt said he disagreed with Trump's earlier claims that global warming is a hoax created by the Chinese to harm the economic competitiveness of the United States. \n \"I do not believe climate change is a hoax,\" Pruitt said. \n The 48-year-old Republican has previously cast doubt on the extensive body of scientific evidence showing that the planet is warming and man-made carbon emissions are to blame. In a 2016 opinion article, Pruitt suggested that the debate over global warming \"is far from settled\" and he claimed that \"scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.\" \n At the hearing before the Senate Energy and Public Works Committee, Pruitt conceded that human activity contributes \"in some manner\" to climate change. He continued, however, to question whether the burning of fossil fuels is the primary reason, and refused to say whether sea levels are rising. \n Pruitt's testimony came shortly after NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a joint statement affirming that 2016 was officially the hottest year in recorded history. Studies show the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass, while the world's oceans have risen on average nearly 7 inches in the last century. \n Pressed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to answer in detail about his beliefs about climate change, Pruitt responded that his personal opinion was \"immaterial\" to how he would enforce environmental laws. \n In his current post, Pruitt joined a multistate lawsuit opposing the Obama administration's plan to limit planet-warming carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Pruitt also sued over the EPA's recent expansion of water bodies regulated under the Clean Water Act. It has been opposed by industries that would be forced to clean up polluted wastewater. \n Pruitt said that if were confirmed by the GOP-run Senate, he would work with states and industry to return the federal watchdog to what he described as its proper role. \n \"Environmental regulations should not occur in an economic vacuum,\" Pruitt said. \"We can simultaneously pursue the mutual goals of environmental protection and economic growth.\" \n Pruitt has a history of criticizing and suing the agency he is in line to lead. Environmentalists opposing his nomination cite his cozy relationships with oil and gas industry executives who have donated to his political campaigns. \n As the hearing got underway, shouting could be heard from people who were not allowed in. The room accommodated fewer than 100 people; most seats were taken by congressional staff, reporters and others who were allowed in early. Only a few seats remained for the public. \n One woman was quickly wrestled out of the room by three police officers as she pulled out a roll of yellow crime scene tape and shouted \"We don't want EPA gutted!\" \n Later, a group of coal miners wearing hard hats were allowed in to show support for Pruitt. Trump has pledged to bring back tens of thousands of lost coal mining jobs once inaugurated, though he has not yet detailed how. \n Senate Republicans uniformly praised Pruitt what they described as his robust record of enforcing environmental laws \"when appropriate.\" Court records show scant evidence of Pruitt acting to protect the environment in years as a state regulator. \n Shortly after Pruitt took office in Oklahoma in 2011, he disbanded the unit responsible for protecting the state's natural resources. He reassigned his staff to file more than a dozen lawsuits challenging EPA regulations. \n Senate Democrats focused on Pruitt's record of siding with polluters in court as he collected campaign contributions from them. \n Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., pressed Pruitt on money he raised from energy companies such as Exxon Mobil and Devon Energy, as well as the corporate \"dark money\" raised by groups with which he is involved that are not required to disclose their donors. \n Earlier this month, Pruitt resigned from the board of the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a Washington-based group supporting the legal agendas of GOP attorney generals that Whitehouse described the group as \"a complete black hole into which at least $1 million goes.\" In his response, Pruitt declined to disclose whether the group's donors included fossil fuel companies or utilities with regulatory issues before EPA. \n Though Pruitt ran unopposed for a second term in 2014, public campaign finance reports show he raised more than $700,000, much of it from people in the energy and utility industries. \n Pruitt has also faced criticism from environmentalists for failing to take any action to help curb a dramatic spike in earthquake activity in Oklahoma that scientists have linked to the underground disposal of oil and gas wastewater. \n Pruitt said his support for legal positions advocated by oil and gas companies was in the best interest of Oklahoma, which is economically dependent on the fossil fuel industry. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Sean Murphy in Oklahoma City contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow AP environmental writer Michael Biesecker at Twitter.com/mbieseck \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "In break with Trump, EPA pick says climate change isn't hoax"}

Primates are heading toward an extinction crisis, a new international study warns. \n WASHINGTON >> Gorillas, monkeys, lemurs and other primates are in danger of becoming extinct, and scientists say it's our fault that our closest living relatives are in trouble, a new international study warns. \n About 60 percent of the more than 500 primate species are \"now threatened with extinction\" and 3 out of 4 primate species have shrinking populations, according to a study published in Wednesday's journal Science Advances . \n While scientists had tracked dwindling numbers of individuals and groups of primates in forests around the world, this is the first big-picture look. The result was \"a bigger wake-up call\" than previously thought, said researcher Paul Garber of the University of Illinois. \n \"The outlook is not very good,\" said Garber, who recently returned from the jungles of Brazil studying marmosets. \n The decline has been blamed on human activities including hunting, mining and oil drilling. Logging, ranching and farming have also destroyed precious habitat in Africa, Asia and South America. \n Primates, which include apes, monkeys and humans, have forward-facing eyes and grasping ability that set them apart from other mammals. Scientists study them to learn about human behavior and evolution. \n Much of the problems faced by primates are recent. For example, the Grauer's gorilla dropped from a population of 17,000 in 1995 to just about 3,800 now, mostly from bushmeat hunting and mineral mining, the study found. \n There are only about 14,000 Sumatran orangutans left in the world. The Hainan gibbon in China is down to just 25 individuals, while 22 out of the 26 primate species in China are endangered, Garber said. \n About 94 percent of the lemur species in the world are endangered, especially in Madagascar, which is one of hardest-hit places for primate population loss. \n \"We need to look at (population losses) almost as signals. They're telling us something about our future,\" Garber said. \"This is a critical world problem.\" \n While there's hope that some species can be protected, many will disappear in the coming decades, said co-author Eduardo Fernandez-Duque of Yale University. \n Emory University primate expert Frans de Waal called the work \"very detailed and timely and unfortunately correct.\" \n \"Primate populations are clearly moving in the wrong direction,\" said de Waal, who wasn't part of the study. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "World's primates facing extinction crisis, new report says"}

Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. on Capitol Hill in Washington, today, prior to the start of Price's confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Health and Human Services Secretary-designate, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., paused while testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington, today, at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \n WASHINGTON >> Offering reassurances, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for health secretary said Wednesday the new administration won't \"pull the rug out\" from those covered by \"Obamacare.\" Democrats were unimpressed, noting a lack of specifics. \n Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., also told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that Trump is \"absolutely not\" planning to launch an overhaul of Medicare as he tries to revamp coverage under President Barack Obama's signature health care law. He acknowledged that high prescription drug costs are a problem, but did not endorse the idea of government directly negotiating prices. \n Throughout the nearly four-hour hearing, Democrats peppered Price with questions about his stock trades. The sometimes confusing exchanges involved different transactions under distinct circumstances. Price, who has signed a government ethics agreement to sell his stock, was clearly annoyed by the suggestion that he profited from his official position. \"I'm offended by that insinuation,\" he told Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \n Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., lauded Price's performance, but ranking Democrat Patty Murray of Washington said she remains deeply concerned. No Democrats offered support for the 62-year-old nominee, an orthopedic surgeon-turned-legislator. \n Price said he wants to reopen a bipartisan dialogue on health care centered on practical solutions. \n \"One of my goals in this entire debate is to lower the temperature,\" said Price, speaking in even, measured tones. \"People need to know that no rug is going to be pulled out from under them.\" \n Alexander said he took that to mean that the Trump administration will follow his advice and not attempt to repeal the 2010 health care law without a replacement ready to go. The Affordable Care Act is providing coverage to about 20 million people, and government as well as private experts say repealing without a concrete substitute would throw millions off their coverage and spike premiums. \n But Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., Hillary Clinton's running mate, said, \"I don't think 'lowering the temperature' is consistent with rushing\" to repeal and replace. Trump has promised to unveil a plan when Price is confirmed. \n With coverage for millions at stake, Price faced pointed questions about Trump's evolving stance on health care. Trump campaigned on repealing Obama's law, but at times he's sounded more like a liberal. For example, he made recent comments about providing insurance for everyone and taking on the drug companies. \n In an interview aired Wednesday on Fox News Channel, Trump said his approach would offer coverage through private insurers for people who cannot afford it. \n \"Nobody is going to be dying on the streets with a President Trump,\" he said. He said his plan would \"probably\" turn Medicaid over to the states in the form of block grants to cover low-income people. Democrats reminded Price that approach could lock in big cuts. \n Price represents Atlanta's northern suburbs and until recently led the House Budget Committee. A budget hawk and a social conservative, he drafted his own plan to replace Obama's health law. It would have saved taxpayers money but covered fewer people, according to an outside analysis. \n Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pressed Price on whether Trump intends to keep promises repeatedly made during the presidential campaign not to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. \n \"I have no reason to believe he's changed his position,\" Price said. He expressed support for some provisions of the Obama health law, including allowing young adults to remain on parental coverage, protecting people with pre-existing medical conditions, and closing the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap. \n Questioned by Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., Price acknowledged there are \"certain areas where drug price increases seem to have little basis in rational actions.\" \n But pressed on whether he would support Trump's call for Medicare to negotiate with drug companies, Price tried to sidestep. If confirmed, Trump would be his boss, Price said, but he also suggested the idea of negotiations needs further study. He was supportive of requiring drugmakers to provide more public information about how they set prices. \n Democrats also challenged Price on his extensive stock portfolio. His investments have prompted questions about potential conflicts of interest and calls for a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of possible insider trading. \n Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., suggested Price got a special deal in the purchase of stock in an Australian drug company, Innate Immunotherapeutics. But Price insisted other investors also had the same option. \n \"I think our job is to avoid the appearance of conflict,\" Franken chastised. \"And you have not done that.\" \n Republicans bristled at such questions. \n \"To question whether you are honest is insulting,\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told Price. \n HELP is one of two Senate committees that will hold hearings on Price. The Finance Committee, which actually votes on reporting the nomination to the Senate floor, will conduct a hearing next week. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Price tries to reassure on health care; Dems not buying it"}

For the third straight year, Earth set a record for the hottest year, NOAA and NASA announced. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The sun set behind visitors to Liberty Memorial, on July 21, as the temperature hovered around 100 degrees in Kansas City, Mo. For the third straight year, Earth set a record for the hottest year, NOAA and NASA announced. \n WASHINGTON >> Earth sizzled to a third-straight record hot year in 2016, government scientists said today. They mostly blame man-made global warming with help from a natural El Nino, which has since disappeared. \n Measuring global temperatures in slightly different ways, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that last year passed 2015 as the hottest year on record. \n NOAA calculated that the average 2016 global temperature was 58.69 degrees \u2014 beating the previous year by 0.07 degrees. \n NASA's figures, which include more of the Arctic, are higher at 0.22 degrees warmer than 2015. The Arctic \"was enormously warm, like totally off the charts compared to everything else,\" said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute of Space Studies in New York, where the space agency monitors global temperatures. \n Records go back to 1880. This is the fifth time in a dozen years that the globe has set a new annual heat record. Records have been set in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2010 and 2005. \n The World Meteorological Organization and other international weather monitoring groups agreed that 2016 was a record, with the international weather agency chief Petteri Taalas saying \"temperatures only tell part of the story\" of extreme warming. \n \"This is clearly a record,\" NASA's Schmidt said in an interview. \"We are now no longer only looking at something that only scientists can see, but is apparent to people in our daily lives.\" \n Schmidt said his calculations show most of the record heat was from heat-trapping gases from the burning of oil, coal and gas. Only about 12 percent was due to El Nino, which is a periodic warming of parts of the Pacific that change weather globally, he said. \n \"Of course this is climate change, it's overwhelmingly climate change,\" said Corinne Le Quere, director of England's Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, who wasn't part of the NOAA or NASA teams. \"Warming (is) nearly everywhere. The Arctic sea ice is collapsing. Spikes in fires from the heat. Heavy rainfall from more water vapor in the air.\" \n According to NOAA, 2016 was 1.69 degrees warmer than the 20th Century average. The first eight months of 2016 all broke heat records. NASA has last year at 1.78 degrees warmer than their mid-20th Century average and about 2 degrees warmer than the start of the industrial age in the late 19th Century. \n The effects are more than just records, but actually hurt people and the environment, said Oklahoma University meteorology professor Jason Furtado. They're \"harmful on several levels, including human welfare, ecology, economics, and even geopolitics,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "For third-straight time, Earth sets hottest year record"}

{"date": "January 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama, accompanied by first lady Michelle Obama and daughters, Sasha Obama and Malia Obama, was sworn in, Jan. 2013, by Chief Justice John Roberts on the West Front of the Capitol in Washington. Donald Trump says his inauguration will have \"an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout.\" \n WASHINGTON >> Donald Trump says his inauguration will have \"an unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout.\" Organizers of a protest the next day call it the biggest demonstration in history to welcome a new president. \n Exactly how many people actually show up for both events will likely never be known. \n Counting the number of people at major public events is as much art as science, and there will be no official tally of how many people attend either Friday's inaugural festivities or the Women's March on Washington on Saturday. \n Here's a look at why crowd size is so mysterious. \n IT STARTS WITH THE MILLION MAN MARCH \n For decades, the National Park Service provided official crowd estimates for gatherings on the National Mall. That changed after the Million Man March in 1995, a gathering of black men meant to show renewed commitment to family and solidarity. The park service estimated 400,000 people attended the march, making it one of the largest demonstrations in history in Washington. \n But organizers believed they reached their goal of 1 million participants. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, one of the march organizers, threatened to sue the park service, arguing its count was motivated by \"racism, white supremacy and hatred for Louis Farrakhan.\" Researchers at Boston University did an independent analysis and said the crowd was much bigger, pegging it at more than 800,000. \n No lawsuit was filed, but the dispute was enough to get the park service out of the head-counting business. The following year, Congress passed an appropriations bill that barred the agency from spending money to count crowds. While that language didn't appear in subsequent budgets, refusing to count crowds became park service policy. \n The agency still estimates crowd size for its own planning purposes, but does not publicly reveal the figures. \n \"No matter what we said or did, no one ever felt we gave a fair estimate,\" U.S. Park Police Maj. J.J. McLaughlin, who had been in charge of coordinating crowd estimates, said in 1996 when the agency confirmed it would no longer count heads. \n HOW CROWDS ARE COUNTED \n Before it stopped, the park service came up with its crowd figures by studying aerial photographs. Using a grid system, the park service would divide the Mall into sections of equal square footage. Then it counted the number of people in each section of the grid by looking at how tightly packed the crowd was and assigning a number of people per square foot. \n Not much has changed since about the way crowds are estimated, said Steve Doig, a journalism professor at Arizona State University who specializes in measuring crowd sizes. \n The figure that corresponds to a \"loosely packed crowd,\" Doig said, is 10 square feet per person, \"which sounds like a lot but it's really not.\" That means people could reach out and touch those closest to them on all sides. \n \"A tighter crowd would get down to maybe 6 or 7 square feet per person,\" he said. \"A scary mosh pit crowd would be maybe 3 to 4 at most.\" \n Crowd estimates for events in Washington are difficult in general because the city's lack of tall buildings and security restrictions on aircraft make it tough to get comprehensive aerial images, Doig said. \n Christopher Geldart, the District of Columbia's homeland security director, has said consistently that he expects between 800,000 and 900,000 people to attend Trump's inauguration. He said he would use the tried-and-true grid method to provide his own crowd estimate on the Monday after the swearing-in. \n WOMEN'S MARCH \n The largest-ever demonstration in Washington, according to park service figures, was an anti-Vietnam War protest in 1969 that drew 600,000 people. The Mall can easily accommodate crowds in the hundreds of thousands; between 300,000 and 400,000 regularly attend the July Fourth fireworks. \n Organizers of Saturday's Women's March on Washington have received a permit from D.C. police for a gathering of 200,000 people. Geldart said he expects the number of participants to exceed that figure, based on data including bus, hotel and train bookings. He cautioned, however, that organizers have not yet told authorities to expect more than the permitted total. \n PAST INAUGURATIONS \n The park service did not dispute a widely reported estimate that 1.8 million people came to Washington for President Barack Obama's first inauguration in 2009, believed to be the largest inaugural crowd in history. The biggest crowd the park service counted at an inauguration was 1.2 million for Lyndon Johnson's 1965 swearing-in. \n Doig isn't sure about either of those figures. His analysis of aerial photographs led him to conclude that just 800,000 were on the Mall for Obama's first inauguration, though he did not include the parade route, where thousands more people waited all day to catch a glimpse of America's first black president. \n The estimate was difficult because the density of the crowd varied widely, he said, despite aerial photographs that appeared to show the Mall full of people between the Capitol and the Washington Monument. Further away from the Capitol, people huddled around television monitors, leaving big tracts of mostly empty space. \n Any time a crowd reaches into the hundreds of thousands, it's a noteworthy gathering, Doig said, but boosters will always try to politicize the turnout for their chosen cause. \n \"One of the things that aggravates me \u2026 is the need for it to be huge,\" he said. \"It sort of drives the numbers into areas where it just clearly is fiction and it undercuts the reality of what really is an amazing crowd.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "When it comes to inaugural crowds, does size matter?"}
