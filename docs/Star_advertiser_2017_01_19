{"date": "January 19, 2017", "text": "BRUCE ASATO / MAY 2015 \n Corey Rosenlee \n The state has offered public school teachers an annual 1 percent lump-sum bonus that the teachers union called an unacceptable and \"paltry\" offer in an internal email sent to members tonight. \n In the latest round of contract talks with the Hawaii State Teachers Association, negotiators for the state offered a 1 percent bonus to be paid out in October of each of the next two years, according to the email, which was obtained by the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. \n The proposed bonus would not amount to a raise because it would not be rolled into a teacher's base pay. The bonuses would be calculated individually, taking 1 percent of each teacher's salary to determine the amount. With the average teacher earning roughly $56,000, the average bonus would be around $500. \n Union officials contend bonuses at the proposed level would be offset by expected increases in health insurance premiums for the HSTA's 13,500 members. There has been no offer from the state to increase its share of the premiums, according to the HSTA. The cost split varies among plans for teachers, but under the most popular health plan, the state covers 59 percent of the premium. \n \"A 1 percent lump sum bonus for the average teacher would amount to approximately $550 per year. After taxes and rising health-care costs, most teachers would see a decrease in their take-home pay,\" HSTA President Corey Rosenlee said in the email. \"This is unacceptable. Even though Hawaii has a teacher shortage, the state last year reported a $1 billion surplus and teachers in Hawaii are paid anywhere from $4,000 to $25,000 less than the average of their mainland counterparts. This is the state's best offer?\" \n When reached by phone tonight, Rosenlee said the level of teacher salaries is contributing to the state's perennial teacher shortage. \n \"Hawaii has a teacher shortage crisis. Over 10,000 kids every day go to class and don't have a qualified teacher,\" he said. \"As a state, this needs to be a priority that we want to solve, and you can't solve a teacher shortage crisis when you basically have the lowest-paid teachers in the nation. So we're hoping that the leadership in Hawaii will take a stand and say, 'Yes, making sure that every child has a qualified teacher is a priority, and we are going to fund it.'\" \n Although the Department of Education had 96 percent of teaching positions filled \u2014 some 12,600 positions \u2014 by the first day of school in the fall, there were still 531 vacancies, including 126 unfilled special-education teaching positions. The DOE, which typically hires 1,100 to 1,200 new teachers annually, had to fill the gap with either instructors without credentials who are working toward a teaching degree, or with substitute teachers. \n The union recently shared with the Board of Education a study it conducted comparing Hawaii's teacher salaries with those of teachers in 10 cities where the cost of living is similar to Hawaii, including San Francisco; Oakland, Calif.; New York; and Washington, D.C. \n The HSTA analysis found Hawaii's starting salary of $46,601 for beginning licensed teachers ranks eighth lowest among 10 comparable school districts, while the state's highest salary of $85,488 for the most experienced teachers ranks ninth lowest \u2014 without adjusting for cost of living. \n \"We are deeply disappointed that the state is not taking our teacher shortage seriously. This crisis is hurting students in the classroom and we need to be able to attract and retain qualified teachers,\" Osa Tui, McKinley High School's registrar and chairperson of HSTA's negotiations committee, said in the union email. \n Diane Mokuau, a librarian at Molokai High and vice chair of the negotiations committee, added: \"When you factor in our high cost of living, Hawaii's public school teachers are the worst paid in the country. Giving them a 1 percent lump sum payment does not even begin to address the problem.\" \n By comparison, under HSTA's 2013-17 labor contract, the union secured annual raises of at least 3 percent through a combination of raises and pay grade step-ups in alternating years. The union used a so-called reopener clause to negotiate additional compensation for the last two years of the contract, including a one-time $2,000 bonus and a 1.8 percent raise that will take effect June 30, when the contract expires. \n The union is encouraging the public to show its support for teachers at a Feb. 13 event during Teacher Institute Day, when the HSTA will stage a march on the Capitol \"to demand a better contract for our teachers and for the schools our keiki deserve.\" \n Rosenlee said the 1 percent bonus offer was the first time money had been placed on the table. Union representatives and state negotiators met for about six hours today in their fourth bargaining session. \n The current contract, which teachers ratified in April 2013, ended a contentious two-year labor dispute. Teachers previously had been working under a \"last, best and final\" contract unilaterally imposed in 2011 under former Gov. Neil Abercrombie that hit teachers with pay cuts and a larger share of health insurance premiums. \n The teachers union isn't the only group in contract talks with the state. \n Labor negotiations are underway with 14 units of the state's public worker unions. Gov. David Ige did not, however, include money for raises in the proposed executive budget he unveiled in December. \n Ige's administration made presentations to the unions late last year, warning that a record-setting billion-dollar budget surplus was already spent and not available for collectively bargained benefits. The administration initially proposed that at least two unions \u2014 those representing firefighters and University of Hawaii faculty \u2014 accept no raises for the next two years. \n ", "author": "By Nanea Kalani nkalani@staradvertiser.com", "title": "State offers teachers 1% bonuses"}

{"date": "January 19, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Self-identified members of \"Bikers for Trump,\" in red, and foreground, stand between protesters and police outside the National Press Building ahead of the presidential inauguration on Thursday in Washington. \n On the eve of the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th president of the United States, thousands of protesters and a group of Hollywood celebrities took to the streets in New York City in what was meant to be a show of unity and a prelude to what organizers hoped would be a weekend of dissent around the country. \n In the days after Trump's election, protesters gathered night after night, often at the base of the Trump Tower in New York City. On Thursday, with his presidency hours from becoming reality, they rallied near Central Park, in the shadow of another one of the many skyscrapers bearing the Trump name. \n Many said they had a personal fear of the president-elect. \"Trump is a direct threat to me and my humanity,\" said Ravenne Reid, 19, a student at John Jay College, as the rally near the Trump International Hotel and Tower began. \"I'm worried about student loans and women's rights and a million other issues. I couldn't not be here.\" \n The rally was likely a sign of things to come over the next four years, with Trump-branded buildings in the president-elect's hometown making the perfect backdrop for opponents of his policies. \n To Reid, that seemed like an opportunity. \"You can't ignore what's outside your window,\" she said. \"I'm hoping the sight of all these people resonates with him personally.\" \n Mark Ruffalo, an actor and one of the organizers of the protest, said in a statement before the rally began that \"thousands of New Yorkers are coming together to stand up for one another, as we will do every day, to protect the values we hold dear \u2014 to fight for health care, criminal justice, immigrant rights, and action on climate change.\" \n As Trump was serenaded at a concert on the National Mall in Washington that featured performers like The Piano Guys, a YouTube sensation, and the percussionist DJ Ravidrums, Robert DeNiro took the stage in New York to mock Trump's Twitter habit. Later, Alec Baldwin reprised his Trump impersonation from \"Saturday Night Live,\" joking that he was heading over to the Russian Consulate, before calling for \"100 days of resistance\" from the crowd. \n Speaking backstage, Cher said that she took part because \"I want to show people the danger.\" She also said that she doubted Trump would find the White House to his taste. \"The Lincoln bedroom is fabulous,\" she said, \"but it's not big.\" \n The city's Democratic mayor, Bill de Blasio, also took part, telling the crowd, \"Tomorrow, Donald Trump will have power but tomorrow, you will have power as well. Donald Trump may control the agenda in Washington, but we control our destiny as Americans.\" \n Somewhat unexpectedly, the election of Trump has been a political boon to de Blasio, who campaigned for Hillary Clinton and disagrees strongly with most of the major policy proposals set forth by president-elect. \n In speeches and television appearances, de Blasio \u2014 who faces a re-election fight this year \u2014 has presented himself as a bulwark against the president-elect for New Yorkers who are fearful of what the incoming administration could bring about for immigrants, residents of public housing and other vulnerable groups. \n His public statements have been more oppositional than those of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, also a Democrat, who has similarly staked out a position as a Trump opponent, although somewhat less directly. Neither New York leader will attend the presidential inauguration, but only de Blasio planned to attend a rally like the one on Thursday night that, for many involved, might be better described as a protest. \n Indeed, outside Trump International Hotel and Tower near Columbus Circle, the voices were often anything but moderate. \n Nearly an hour before the rally even started, dozens of demonstrators had gathered to voice their discontent with the incoming administration. Joan Hirsch was among a group of organizers leading chants of \"No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.\" \n \"At this point, the only way to defeat Trump is mass resistance in the streets,\" said Hirsch, an organizer with Refuse Fascism, an anti-Trump group. \"Think Tahrir Square, think South Korea \u2014 that's what needs to happen in this country.\" \n Jawanza Clark, a professor at Manhattan College, also hoped that the rally would serve as a potent image of resistance to Trump. \"In some ways it's a symbolic gesture but it sends a message that we're not backing down,\" said Clark, 42, of the Bronx. He brought along his sons Jeremiah, 10, and Jordan, 5, because, he said, \"I wanted them to see the type of country they're living in.\" \n The New York rally was one of many in a protest movement that has rippled across the country for days preceding Trump's inauguration, culminating in the planned Women's Marches on Saturday in Washington and other cities. \n Caravans, buses and individual travelers have been trickling into Washington throughout the week, with protesters finding housing at local churches and on friends' couches. \n Refuse Fascism has also been holding daily marches this week throughout the capital starting on Saturday, when hundreds of protesters mixed with late night revelers on U Street. On Tuesday, tourists in the city's downtown area encountered activists carrying signs promising to \"Bring D.C. To A Halt!\" \n Late Wednesday night, protesters marched north to the temporary home of Vice President-elect Mike Pence to hold a Queer Dance Party. \n The protest, organized by Werk for Peace, brought hundreds of rainbow-clad dancers, bopping and shaking their hips to songs by Rihanna and Queen, waving rainbow flags and showering the streets with \"biodegradable\" glitter. Syncopated chants of \"We are here, we are queer, we will dance,\" erupted between songs. \n ", "author": "New York Times", "title": "Inauguration protests held at a trump hotel and elsewhere"}

{"date": "January 19, 2017", "text": "UNITED NATIONS >> Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says he is alarmed at reports that children may constitute a large part of the force recruited and used by al-Shabab Islamic extremists in Somalia. \n Guterres said it is estimated over half its force are children, citing as an example that at least 60 percent of al-Shabab \"elements\" captured in Somalia's semi-autonomous Puntland region in March 2016 were youngsters. Some of those children said they were approached with the promise of education and jobs, he said. \n Somalia has been trying to rebuild after recently establishing its first functioning central government since 1991, when warlords overthrew a longtime dictator and plunged the impoverished nation into chaos. But the country is riven by clan rivalries and threatened by al-Shabab extremists opposed to Western-style democracy. \n In a report to the Security Council circulated this week, the U.N. chief said al-Shabab used children in combat, with 9-year-olds reportedly taught to use weapons and sent to front lines. Children were also used to transport explosives, work as spies, carry ammunition or perform domestic chores, he said. \n While al-Shabab was the main perpetrator, the report said the Somali army and other groups also recruited and used children. \n According to the report, a task force in Somalia verified the recruitment and use of 6,163 children \u2014 5,993 boys and 230 girls \u2014 during the period from April 1, 2010 to July 31, 2016, with more than 30 percent of the cases in 2012. After a downward trend in 2013 and 2014, the number of youngsters recruited increased to 903 in 2015 and to 1,092 in the first six months of 2016, it said. \n Al-Shabab accounted for 70 percent \u2014 or 4,213 \u2014 of verified cases, followed by the Somali National Army with 920 children recruited, it said. \n Guterres said he is \"deeply troubled by the scale and nature of grave violations against children in Somalia and their increase since 2015.\" He urged all parties to stop recruiting children and committing violations against them and to abide by international humanitarian and human rights law. \n The report said al-Shabab targeted poor children who lacked opportunities, recruiting primarily in rural areas of southern and central Somalia, frequently at schools, madrasas, mosques and religious events. \"Teachers were often coerced into enlisting pupils,\" it said. \n Guterres cited reports of recruitment of children from madrasas in refugee camps in Kenya, of young boys disappearing en masse from al-Shabab-run madrasas and of entire villages forced to give up their children to the extremist group. \n \"Children recruited and used by al-Shabab were victims of or were exposed to other grave violations including killing and maiming during military operations and air strikes targeting al-Shabab, and subjected to arrest and detention by Somalia security forces during military or search operations,\" the report said. \n As for the Somali National Army, the report said, despite signing an action plan in 2012 to end child recruitment, it continues to recruit and use youngsters including as spies, checkpoint guards and bodyguards. It said al-Shabab has executed children suspected of spying for the army or the African Union peacekeeping force in Somalia. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.N. alarmed that most of al-Shabab's force in Somalia are kids"}

As Trump prepares to take the oath of office Friday, many Americans still can't quite believe that a presidency that still seems almost bizarrely improbable becomes a reality on Friday. \n \"I thought it was a joke.

The idea of the election of a white billionaire born of privilege feels implausible to many in very different ways \u2014 and that may say as much about the country as it does about Trump. \n When Trump announced his candidacy, Kayla Coursey recognized him as the developer who had tried and failed to build a golf course she'd opposed in her hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia. She recalled him as stubborn and resistant to pressure from local residents and officials. That, she said made his candidacy for president feel like a joke. Trump's election felt downright surreal, she said. \n In the weeks since, \"there was always the hope that things will somehow magically become better. However, now we know (Friday) at noon we're going to be welcoming President Trump, which is surreal in and of itself,\" said Coursey, a college student in Roanoke, Virginia. \n David Sawyers, a 42-year-old truck unloader from Grindstone, Pennsylvania, who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary before voting for Trump, said the big crowds that turned out for the candidate's rallies convinced him the billionaire could win. But he never felt certain, not when he recalled how Al Gore had won the popular vote in 2000, but lost the presidency to George W. Bush. \n \"You follow history,\" said Sawyers, who's happy with the outcome, \"and there are some points where you definitely know history is being made and tomorrow is one of those times.\" \n Sawyers will be working during Friday's inauguration, so he plans to record it and watch it later.

We're definitely loving the snow,\" he said. \n Californians endured snarled morning commutes, downed trees and heavy snow in the mountains. \n A storm system dumped nearly an inch of rain on San Francisco and more than 3 inches at some locations in the Napa-Sonoma wine country. \n In Southern California's Santa Monica Mountains, rain fell at rates of up to a half-inch an hour and a rockslide closed canyon roads near Malibu. \n In Sacramento, a windstorm with gusts topping 50 mph destroyed three historic trees Wednesday night that were planted at the California Capitol about 120 years ago to honor Civil War veterans. \n \"We lost three grand ones,\" said Democratic Assemblyman Ken Cooley. \n The National Weather Service in San Diego warned that five-day rainfall totals would likely be substantial and that mud and debris flows could occur as heavy rains fell on wildfire burn scars east of Los Angeles. \n In Phoenix, a hot air balloon festival was canceled due to a winter storm warning. Forecasters said winds could gust to 40 mph beginning Friday night. \n Architect Neil Davison, a 58-year-old sport balloonist, said he has been caught in windier weather. \n \"If you want to know what it's like, then get in your laundry basket and jump out of your car at 25 mph,\" the Phoenix resident said. \n Grand Canyon National Park closed some roads on the South Rim due to snow and unsafe driving conditions. \n The road woes were also felt to the north in Oregon. A 45-mile stretch of Interstate 84 between Troutdale and Hood River remained closed because of ice. \n The temperature in Hood River was expected to climb to slightly above freezing, melting some of the ice that has turned the highway into a skating rink. \n With snow and ice hanging around, schools were closed in several districts along with some state agency offices. \n Between 12 and 15 inches of fresh snow fell in southeastern Oregon overnight, closing parts of Interstate 84 north of Ontario. \n Washington transportation officials said conditions on Interstate 90 over Snoqualmie Pass had improved enough to allow crews to start clean-up efforts. They hoped to re-open the eastbound lanes later in the day. \n Crews were also working to break up and move 20 to 30 trees that came down onto the interstate during this week's ice storm, officials said. \n In California, two more storms were expected to arrive tonight and Sunday. \n Overall, California has seen a significant retreat from the once-statewide drought. About 58 percent of the state remains in moderate, severe, extreme or exceptional stages of drought. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Rain, snow storms pummel the West; more wet weather on way"}

Authorities are frustrated by the risks some people take near the river despite an angler being decapitated by a large crocodile at the crossing in 1987. \n \"The signs are saying not to swim or even go in the water at Cahill's Crossing. There's been a lot of media attention around that crossing.

{"date": "January 19, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2015 \n Brazil's Supreme Court Justice Teori Zavascki died in a plane crash today, according to his son. \n RIO DE JANEIRO >> A Supreme Court judge central to the huge corruption investigation roiling Brazil died in a plane crash today, casting doubt over the future of a probe that has reached to the top of the political and economic elite, threatening the president himself. \n Justice Teori Zavascki died when a plane carrying him and three others crashed outside Paraty, a popular coastal town about 155 miles (250 kilometers) west of Rio de Janeiro, according to his son and authorities. \n While the cause of the crash had not been determined, Zavascki held such an important role in the \"Car Wash\" investigation into a multibillion-dollar bribe scheme at the state oil company Petrobras that many Brazilians immediately voiced suspicious of possible foul play and demanded a full investigation. \n \"Justice Teori Zavascki had been strongly driving the #Carwash investigation in the Supreme Court. It's hard to believe this was a mere accident,\" tweeted Alan Mansur, director of the National Association of Prosecutors. \n Federal police said late today they were launching an investigation. \n Within an hour of the news of Zavascki's death, President Michel Temer, who has been named by suspects caught up in the Petrobras investigations, addressed the nation. \n Zavascki \"was a good man, and a (symbol of) pride for all Brazilians,\" said Temer, who called for three days of national mourning. \n The justice's son, Francisco Prehn Zavascki, was first to confirm that his father was killed in the afternoon crash. \"Dear friends, we have just received confirmation that my father has died. Thank you for all the strength,\" he wrote on his Facebook page. \n Authorities initially reported four people were on board but later raised the number to five and said three bodies had been recovered. The other two identified as deceased were businessman Carlos Alberto Filgueiras and pilot Osmar Rodrigues, according to the Brazilian military. The names and status of the remaining two were not released. \n Images on Globo showed rescue workers pulling part of a small white airplane from the sea. Witnesses speaking to Globo said it was raining hard in the afternoon, which is typical during summers in the Southern Hemisphere. \n Calls and emails to the firefighters overseeing the recovery were not returned. \n While the largest corruption probe in Brazil's history has been led by a team of prosecutors and Judge Sergio Moro in the southern city of Curitiba, Zavascki handled cases involving politicians. Under Brazilian law, only the Supreme Court can decide to charge or jail federal politicians. \n Most recently, Zavascki had been reviewing the dozens of plea bargains of former and current executives of the big Odebrecht construction company, which was one of the main players in the kickback scheme that investigators allege involved more than $2 billion in bribes over a decade. Over the last two years, dozens of politicians and businessmen have been jailed in the sprawling probe. \n Zavascki was expected to decide which of the Odebrecht plea bargains to validate by February. Validation would make them public, potentially implicating dozens of politicians in Brazil and several other countries where Odebrecht did business. \n It's not clear what will happen to the \"Car Wash\" cases that Zavascki was overseeing. They could be split among other justices on the court or possibly assigned to just one justice. \n Zavascki's replacement on the court will be appointed by Temer, who denies wrongdoing and has not been charged in the Petrobras case. \n The death will delay the probe \"but is unlikely to represent much of a blow,\" wrote risk consultancy Eurasia late today. \n About 100 politicians and business executives have already been arrested or are under investigation in Brazil for allegedly overcharging contracts with Petrobras and other state-run companies to pay for bribes and election campaigns. In addition to Temer, senior Cabinet members and close aides and allies of the president have been implicated in testimony from some of those arrested. \n Former Odebrecht director Claudio Melo Filho cited Temer 44 times, making accusations of illegal campaign financing. If his allegations should be confirmed by Brazil's top electoral court, Temer would be removed from the presidency and Congress would pick a successor. \n Moro, the Curitiba judge, issued a statement calling Zavascki a \"Brazilian hero.\" \n \"Without him, we would not have had the Carwash operation,\" Moro wrote. \"I hope that his legacy, of serenity and firmness in law enforcement, regardless of the powerful interests involved, is not forgotten.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Brazil judge overseeing corruption probe dies in plane crash"}

We love Hawaii and we want to be good members of the community and preserve the environment. We look forward to working closely with the community for years to come.\" \n The Honolulu Star-Advertiser first reported on Wednesday that the billionaire, through companies he controls, filed eight \"quiet title\" lawsuits on Dec. 30 in Circuit Court, seeking to force owners of 14 small properties to sell their stakes in their land at public auction. The 14 parcels are surrounded by roughly 700 acres on Kauai's north shore that Zuckerberg bought two years ago for about $100 million. Under Hawaii law, the owners of these parcels have rights to access their property through Zuckerberg's land.  \n Through the quiet title law, Zuckerberg aims to identify family members who share ownership of the 14 parcels. After a judge validates who the lawful owners are and their share of ownership, the judge can order that all the ownership shares be sold at auction because it wouldn't be possible to physically divide the land amongst all owners. In one of the lawsuits, it is alleged that ownership of four parcels totaling two acres is divided among more than a hundred members of one family. \n Zuckerberg aims to acquire these ownership interests at an auction. \n In his Facebook post, Zuckerberg said he worked with the majority owners of each property and reached a voluntary deal they thought was fair. \n \"As with most transactions, the majority owners have the right to sell their land if they want, but we need to make sure smaller partial owners get paid for their fair share too,\" he said. \"In Hawaii, this is where it gets more complicated. As part of Hawaiian history, in the mid-1800s, small parcels were granted to families, which after generations might now be split among hundreds of descendants. There aren't always clear records, and in many cases descendants who own 1/4 percent or 1 percent of a property don't even know they are entitled to anything. \n \"To find all these partial owners so we can pay them their fair share, we filed what is called a 'quiet title' action. For most of these folks, they will now receive money for something they never even knew they had. No one will be forced off the land.\" \n Some of the stories, written after the Star-Advertiser story was published, have suggested that Zuckerberg is kicking owners off their land, including a story in The Register, a technology publication in the United Kingdom, that was published with the headline \"Zuck off: Facebook's big kahuna sues Hawaiians to kick 'em off their land.\" \n ", "author": "By Andrew Gomes agomes@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Facebook's Zuckerberg responds to reports on his Kauai land dealings"}

According to Mexico's Foreign Ministry, Guzman has been extradited to the United States today. \n MEXICO CITY >> Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, Mexico's most notorious cartel kingpin who twice made brazen prison escapes and spent years on the run as the country's most wanted man, was extradited to the U.S. today to face drug trafficking and other charges. \n Mexico's Foreign Relations Department announced Guzman was handed over to U.S. authorities for transportation to the U.S. today, the last full day of President Barack Obama's administration and a day before Donald Trump is to be inaugurated. \n The U.S. Justice Department issued a statement confirming that Guzman was en route to the United States and expressed gratitude to Mexico for its cooperation. \n A senior U.S. official said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration took custody of Guzman in Ciudad Juarez, which is across the border from El Paso, Texas, and a plane carrying him departed for New York at 5:31 p.m. EST. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and agreed to give the information only if not quoted by name. \n The convicted Sinaloa cartel boss had been held most recently at a prison near Ciudad Juarez. He was recaptured a year ago after escaping from a second maximum-security prison through a tunnel dug to his cell. \n The 2015 escape was highly embarrassing for the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto, and Mexican officials were seen as eager to hand the headache off to the United States afterward. Guzman's lawyers have fought extradition since his recapture. \n Guzman, who is in his late 50s, faces the possibility of life in a U.S. prison under multiple indictments in six jurisdictions around the United States, including New York, San Diego, Chicago and Miami. \n A federal indictment in the Eastern District of New York, where Guzman is expected to be prosecuted, accuses him of overseeing a trafficking cartel with thousands of members and billions of dollars in profits laundered back to Mexico. It says Guzman and other members of the Sinaloa cartel employed hit men who carried out murders, kidnappings and acts of torture. \n He was first indicted by a U.S. federal grand jury in July 2009. A superseding indictment was issued in May charging him and Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada with a variety of drug, gun and money laundering charges as part of an ongoing criminal enterprise. \n The Mexican Foreign Relations Department's statement said a court had ruled against Guzman's appeal and found that his extradition would be constitutional. \n \"The criminal Joaquin Guzman Loera was extradited this afternoon to face his pending legal cases,\" Mexican Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong tweeted. \n Guzman's first prison break was in 2001. He spent more than a decade at large before being captured in 2014. The following year he broke out through the mile-long tunnel dug directly to the shower in his cell. \n It was while on the lam a second time, in fall 2015, that he held a secret meeting with actors Sean Penn and Kate del Castillo. The encounter was the subject of a lengthy article Penn published in Rolling Stone last January, right after Mexican marines re-arrested Guzman in the western state of Sinaloa. \n Guzman was initially returned to the Altiplano prison outside Mexico City where he escaped through the tunnel. Last May, officials abruptly moved him to the prison in the desert near Juarez. \n The White House, which was down to a skeleton staff hours before Trump takes office, said it had no immediate comment. \n ___ \n Associated Press writer Peter Orsi reported this story in Mexico City and AP writer Bradley Klapper reported from Washington.

The inauguration of Donald Trump leaves Democrats facing a stark power deficit, not only in Washington but in states around the country. Republicans control the White House, Congress, almost two-thirds of statehouses and 32 legislatures. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif. spoke during a Jan. 13 news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington. The inauguration of Donald Trump leaves Democrats facing a stark power deficit, not only in Washington but in states around the country. Republicans control the White House, Congress, almost two-thirds of statehouses and 32 legislatures. \n WASHINGTON >> Democrats begin the Donald Trump presidency in sad shape. They lack a clear power base, they've got no distinct national leader, and party brokers are searching for a formula to counter the new Republican-dominated government and figure out how to win again. \n It's a curious and dispiriting position for a party that has led the national popular vote six out of the past seven presidential elections. Yet Hillary Clinton lost the Electoral College count, while Republicans maintained their largest House majority since 1928 and kept control of the Senate \u2014 with 2018 advantages that offer the potential of a Senate supermajority in two years. \n Outside Washington, Democrats now have just 16 governors and run 14 state legislatures, compared to 33 Republican governors and 32 GOP-run legislative bodies. \n \"We haven't been in this shape in a while \u2026 but we will rebuild,\" insists interim Democratic Party Chairwoman Donna Brazile. \n And Republicans have their own challenges. \n Control means answering for everything from the economy to health care. Trump enters the Oval Office with the lowest approval ratings of any newly inaugurated president in more than a generation, and he's an unapologetic freelancer who sometimes flouts GOP orthodoxy. \n That leaves elected Democrats to decide how they will treat the new president as they try to woo middle-class voters \u2014 particularly whites \u2014 who were lost in November from President Barack Obama's winning coalitions. \n Party insiders will choose Brazile's DNC successor next month, a campaign that has revived fissures between the party's liberal and centrist factions. The next chairman will jockey with Congress' Democratic leaders and perhaps Obama as the party tries to settle on a national standard-bearer. \n Around the country, Democrats are quietly looking to the 2018 midterm elections, with a focus on governor races that will give the party its first tangible shot at climbing out of the present crater. Republicans will be defending more than two dozen seats, including in Democratic-leaning states like Massachusetts and Maryland. \n No clear consensus guides all those moving parts. \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California says Democrats must \"fight with more clarity\" on issues affecting average Americans, such as health care and laws covering wages. \n \"We've done it before, we know how to do it,\" she says of winning. \n Yet she adds that Democrats have a responsibility to work with Trump where there is common ground, such as infrastructure spending. \n That's a divergence from Republicans' near-absolute, eight-year opposition to Obama. It's also a seeming contrast to the man many top Democrats have endorsed for party chairman: Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota. \n \"This question of whether we fight back right away or not, that question has been answered,\" Ellison said in a DNC chairmanship debate this week. \"He has already started to institute a right-wing program, so of course we have to fight.\" \n Outgoing Labor Secretary Tom Perez, viewed as Ellison's stiffest competitor, offered slightly more nuance. He dubbed Trump \"a target-rich environment\" and said Democrats can \"hit him with a two-by-four.\" But, he added, \"What we can't do is go after him every time. You can't meet him tweet for tweet. I think we've got to be surgical.\" \n In Michigan, a key state in Trump's November victory, Obama campaign veteran Amy Chapman said the 2010 tea party movement gives Democrats a model. \n \"Fighting against something brings people together,\" she argued, adding that intense opposition doesn't have to conflict with some compromises that help Democrats avoid an \"obstructionist\" label. \n Steve Israel, a former New York congressman now advising the Democratic Governors Association, noted political fortunes are never as solidified \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 as predicted in the wake of elections. \n Republicans hailed the notion of a \"permanent majority\" after George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004. Eight years later, when Obama won a second term, Republicans fretted about their long-term prospects in an increasingly diverse country. And in November, Trump's Electoral College margin came by a cumulative margin of fewer than 100,000 votes in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. \n Given that, Israel said Democrats' best measure on strategy and tactics is simple: \"Does this win back Obama-Trump voters?\" \n Confirmation hearings for Trump Cabinet picks so far show that even Israel's standard isn't absolute. \n Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have sharply, even mockingly questioned multiple choices, whereas Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia introduced former Texas Gov. Rick Perry before his confirmation hearing for energy secretary. Manchin is one of 10 Democratic senators facing re-election in states where Trump won. \n But the seeming conflicts in the theater of confirmations may actually preview the right approach, according to some Democrats. \n Tessa Gould, chief of staff to North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, said politicians like her boss, up for re-election in 2018, must be given the space to work in a bipartisan manner. \"These 2018ers, they are really good about taking care of the politics back home,\" Gould said. \n Another Obama campaign veteran, Florida Democrat Steve Schale, agreed that Democrats must avoid a one-size-fits-all idea, even if voters rewarded Republicans for their opposition to Obama. \n \"Both parties have gotten themselves so narrowly cast that literally everything has to go right to win elections,\" he said. \n Thomas Beaumont contributed from Des Moines, Iowa. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Democrats in sad shape: Power deficit as Trump era begins"}

Washington braced for an onslaught of crowds and demonstrators \u2014 with all the attendant hoopla and hand-wringing. \n Trump was quickly taking on more of the trappings of the presidency, giving a salute to the Air Force officer who welcomed him as he stepped off the jet with wife Melania at Joint Base Andrews just outside Washington. And later, placing a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery. \n His first stop was a luncheon in a ballroom at his own hotel, where he gave a shout-out to GOP congressional leaders, declaring: \"I just want to let the world know we're doing very well together.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, he said, will finally have someone to sign legislation into law. Then Trump veered into the territory of the unknowable to boast his Cabinet selections had \"by far the highest IQ of any Cabinet ever.\" \n Just blocks away, the White House was quickly emptying out. President Barack Obama's schedule was clear beyond his daily briefing and his final weekly lunch with Vice President Joe Biden. He got in a few final official acts, though, cutting the sentences of 330 inmates and placing a call to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \n Vice President-elect Mike Pence, in a tweet, called Inauguration Eve \"a momentous day before a historic day,\" as security barricades and blockades went up around Washington in preparation for Friday's swearing-in ceremony. \n \"We are all ready to go to work,\" Pence said at a morning appearance. \"In fact, we can't wait to get to work for the American people to make it great again.\" \n Outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said he'd be putting on his \"favorite DHS jacket\" and taking to the streets to inspect security preparations for the inaugural festivities. \n He told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" that areas where inaugural crowds will congregate will be \"extra fortified this year with dump trucks, heavily armored vehicles to prevent anybody who's not authorized from being in the area from driving something in there.\" He said there was \"no specific credible threat\" related to the inauguration. \n Trump's public schedule for the inaugural celebration began at Arlington, where he and Pence stood at attention as a bugler paid taps at the Tomb of the Unknowns. It was a family affair, as Trump's children and grandchildren silently looked on. \n With that solemn moment, \"the rhetoric of a campaign moves aside,\" Tom Barrack, the head of Trump's inaugural committee told CNN. \"I think you're going to see a shift from candidate to world leader. I think he's feeling the weight of it.\" \n From there, Trump headed to a celebratory welcome concert on the steps of Lincoln Memorial. The two-hour concert was open to the public and featured country star Toby Keith, soul's Sam Moore, actor Jon Voight and The Piano Guys. \n Before departing for Washington, Trump announced his final Cabinet choice: former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue for agriculture secretary. Spokesman Sean Spicer said the president-elect was continuing to make \"edits and additions\" to the inaugural address he'll deliver at Friday's swearing-in. \n Never mind about Trump's gilded private plane: He arrived on a Boeing 757 that is part of the fleet of military planes that become Air Force One whenever the president is aboard. The president-elect, who flew to Washington without any press on his plane, was joined on the trip by a gaggle of his children, grandchildren and other members of his extended family.

{"date": "January 19, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Barack Obama spoke during his final presidential news conference, Wednesday, in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. In his last major act as president, Barack Obama cut short the sentences of 330 federal inmates convicted of drug crimes today, bringing his bid to correct what he's called a systematic injustice to a climactic close. \n WASHINGTON >> Barack Obama cut short the sentences of 330 federal inmates, including three from Hawaii, convicted of drug crimes today, bringing his bid to correct what he's called a systematic injustice to a climactic close. \n With his final offer of clemency, Obama brought his total number of commutations granted to 1,715, more than any other president in U.S. history, the White House said. During his presidency, Obama ordered free 568 inmates who had been sentenced to life in prison. \n \"He wanted to do it. He wanted the opportunity to look at as many as he could to provide relief,\" Neil Eggleston, Obama's White House counsel, said in an interview in his West Wing office. \"He saw the injustice of the sentences that were imposed in many situations, and he has a strong view that people deserve a second chance.\" \n (According to the White House, the three convicts from Hawaii are: \n >> Thaddeas Kulani Thomas Hall of Waipahu, who is serving 180 months in prison for a 2008 conviction of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, and possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime. Hall's sentence was commuted to expire on Jan. 19, 2019, conditioned upon enrollment in residential drug treatment. \n >> Alfred William Kemfort of Maui, who was convicted of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine; in 2006 and sentenced to 240 months in prison. His sentence was commuted to expire on Jan. 19, 2019, conditioned upon enrollment in residential drug treatment. \n >> Allan Aquino Lafuente of Kapolei, who was convicted in 2009 of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, distribution of five or more grams of methamphetamine, distribution of 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, and possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime. Lafuente's prison sentence was commuted to 180 months.) \n For Obama, it was the last time he exercised his presidential powers in any significant way. At noon on Friday, Obama will stand with President-elect Donald Trump as his successor is sworn in and Obama's chapter in history comes to an end. \n Even as Obama issued the commutations, the White House had been mostly cleared out to make way for Trump. In between carrying out their last duties, the few remaining staffers were packing up belongings as photos of Obama were taken down from the walls of the West Wing corridors. \n The final batch of commutations \u2014 more in a single day than on any other day in U.S. history \u2014 was the culmination of Obama's second-term effort to try to remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing requirements that he said had imprisoned thousands of drug offenders for too long. Obama repeatedly called on Congress to pass a broader criminal justice fix, but lawmakers never acted. \n For Bernard Smith, it's a long-awaited chance to start over after 13 years away from his wife and children. \n Smith was working at a restaurant in Maryland in 2002 when his brother asked him to obtain marijuana for a drug deal. Though it was his brother who obtained the crack cocaine that the brothers then sold along with the marijuana to undercover officers, Smith was charged with the cocaine offense, too. \n His 22-year sentence was far longer than his brother's, owing to what the court called Smith's \"extensive criminal history\" prior to the drug bust. Smith still had 10 years on his sentence when he was notified today that the president, on his last day in office, was giving him another chance. \n \"He's looking to turn his life around,\" said Michelle Curth, his attorney. \"He's a good person who, like so many people, got involved in something he's been punished for already.\" \n Curth said that Smith had learned his lesson and owned up to his crime \u2014 he asked for a commutation, she noted, not a pardon, which would have erased the original conviction. She said Smith hopes to get licensed in heating and air conditioning maintenance and has lined up family members to help with his adjustment. \n But freedom for Smith is still two years away. Rather than release him immediately, Obama directed that he be set free in January 2019 \u2014 two years after Obama has left office \u2014 and only if Smith enrolls in a residential drug treatment program. \n To be eligible for a commutation under Obama's initiative, inmates had to have behaved well in prison and already served 10 years, although some exceptions to the 10-year rule were granted. They also had to be considered nonviolent offenders, although many were charged with firearms violations in relation to their drug crimes. \n Obama personally reviewed the case of every inmate who received a commutation, often poring over case files in the evenings or calling his attorneys into his office to discuss specifics. Although a backlog of cases remains as Obama leaves office, his administration reviewed all applications that came in by an end-of-August deadline, officials said. \n Eggleston said Obama had been particularly motivated to grant clemency to inmates who had turned themselves around in prison. He said one inmate had trained and obtained a commercial driver's license through a prison program, despite having a life sentence that all but assured he'd never get to use it. \n \"The ones who really stuck home for the president and me are the ones who got their GED, they worked, they took courses in anger management, they took courses in getting over drug abuse issues, they remained in contract with their families,\" Eggleston said. \n Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With Obama's support, the Justice Department in recent years directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. \n Earlier in the week, Obama commuted most of the rest of convicted leaker Chelsea Manning's sentence, arguing the Army intelligence analyst had shown remorse and already served a long sentence. \n Yet Obama will leave office without granting commutations or pardons to other prominent offenders who had sought clemency, including accused Army deserter Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. He also declined to pardon former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. \n ", "author": "Associated Press & Star-Advertiser", "title": "Obama commutes 330 drug sentences, including 3 from Hawaii"}

{"date": "January 19, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A doctor held a vial of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil in his Chicago office on Aug. 28. A national estimate suggests that nearly half of U.S. men have mostly silent infections caused by the sexually-transmitted human papilloma virus, and that 1 in 4 has strains linked with several cancers. \n CHICAGO >> The first national estimate suggests that nearly half of U.S. men have genital infections caused by a sexually transmitted virus and that 1 in 4 has strains linked with several cancers. \n Most human papillomavirus infections cause no symptoms and most disappear without treatment. And most adults will get an HPV infection at some point in their lives. \n But high-risk HPV can cause cancer in the mouth and upper throat, cervical cancer in women and other cancers. Less harmful strains can cause genital warts. \n Vaccines can prevent infections but experts say vaccination rates in pre-teens and young adults are too low. High-risk HPV poses cancer risks to people who are infected and to their sexual partners, who can catch HPV even when the infections are silent. \n The study \"just underscores that you need to vaccinate boys as well as girls, \" said Debbie Saslow, an HPV specialist at the American Cancer Society. \n The new estimate comes from an analysis of a 2013-14 national health survey; nearly 2,000 men aged 18 to 59 were tested for HPV. Results were published today in the journal JAMA Oncology . The researchers say it's the first published estimate for genital HPV infections in men. The 45 percent rate is higher than previously reported rates for women, said Dr. Jasmine Han, the lead author and a cancer specialist at Womack Army Medical Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. \n HPV virus can also be found in the mouth at much lower rates in men and women. The new study involved only genital HPV. \n The new estimate provides a good baseline for measuring the effectiveness of HPV vaccinations in boys and young men, said Saslow. Routine vaccination was recommended for pre-teen boys and young men in 2011, five years after approval for girls. Few men in the new study had been vaccinated. \n Before the government eased recommendations last October, fewer than one-third of 13-year-old girls and boys were fully vaccinated. Now they need only two doses instead of three. \n HPV, the leading cause of cervical cancer, can be detected in women during routine Pap tests, which have led to a decline in cervical cancers and deaths. HPV-related mouth and throat cancers are becoming more common, especially among men, who are not routinely screened for the virus. \n Dr. Tanguy Seiwert, a head and neck cancer specialist at the University of Chicago, said the results show that doctors and parents need to step up efforts to vaccinate boys and young men and get over concerns that the HPV vaccine will lead to risky sexual behavior. \n \"Our society keeps talking about finding 'the cure for cancer.' Frankly, this is as close as it gets \u2014 it prevents cancer,\" Seiwert said. \n Online: \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "1 in 4 U.S. men have cancer-linked HPV genital infections"}

The group will enter the dome today and spend eight months together in the 1,200-square-foot research facility in a study called Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation (HI-SEAS). \n A group of NASA-funded researchers is poised to enter an isolated geodesic dome on a remote Hawaii volcano to study human behavior in long-term space exploration, including a planned voyage to Mars. \n The six scientists enter their new home today on the Big Island's Mauna Loa volcano for an eight-month stay. \n The team will have no physical contact with people in the outside world and will work with a 20-minute delay in communications, the time it would take for an email to reach Earth from Mars. \n The study will assess the psychological difficulties associated with living in isolated and confined conditions for an extended time. \n The project is designed to help the U.S. space agency send humans on long space voyages including to Mars by the 2030s. \n \"We're hoping to figure out how best to select individual astronauts, how to compose a crew and how to support that crew on long-duration space missions,\" principal investigator Kim Binstead, a University of Hawaii science professor. \n She said NASA's timeline is realistic unless the agency is \"directed to do something different by the new administration.\" \n Trump's transition team did not respond to an emailed request for comment on NASA's plan. \n Leading the crew is mission commander James Bevington, a freelance space scientist who has acted as a visiting researcher at the International Space University. The other team members include engineers, a computer scientist, a doctoral candidate and a biomedical expert. \n They were selected from a group of 700 applicants that went through cognitive and personality tests as well as extensive interviews. \n \"When I started, my biggest fear was that we were going to be that crew that turned out like Biosphere 2, which wasn't a very pretty picture,\" Bevington said. \n Biosphere 2 was a 1990s experimental greenhouse-like habitat in Arizona. It housed different natural ecosystems and a small crew in an effort to understand what would be needed for humans to live on other planets. \n The experiment quickly spiraled out of control as the habitat failed to maintain safe levels of carbon dioxide and the crew grew discontent. \n The latest HI-SEAS mission is the third round of research funded by NASA, which has dedicated over $2 million to the Hawaii project. Previous missions focused on food requirements and crew cohesion. \n \"Mars is one of the best places in the solar system to look for signs of past or current life,\" said Binstead, adding that would be the most significant scientific discovery \"of all time.\" \n Furthermore, man-made disasters or natural catastrophes such as an asteroid hit could force a human exodus from Earth, she said. \"Right now, all of our eggs for life are in one basket. I think it's a good overall strategy for us as a species to spread out further.\" \n The researchers will wear devices around their necks that measure their moods and proximity to other team members. They'll also use virtual reality devices to simulate familiar and comforting surroundings they wouldn't have access to while living on Mars. \n They will wear space suits whenever they leave the compound to conduct daily tasks including geological and mapping studies. The crew eats mostly freeze-dried foods that have a long shelf life.

A hotel in the mountainous region hit again by quakes has been covered by an avalanche, with reports of dead. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n An aerial view of the Rigopiano Hotel hit by an avalanche in Farindola, Italy, early today. A hotel in the mountainous region hit again by quakes has been covered by an avalanche, with reports of dead. Italian media say the avalanche covered the three-story hotel in the central region of Abruzzo, on Wednesday evening. \n PENNE, Italy >> Rescue workers on skis reached a four-star spa hotel buried by an avalanche in earthquake-stricken central Italy today, reporting no signs of life as they searched for around 30 people believed trapped inside. Three bodies were recovered as heavy vehicles struggled to get to the scene. \n Two people escaped the devastation at the Hotel Rigopiano, in the mountains of the Gran Sasso range, and called for help, but it took hours for responders to arrive at the remote zone. \n Days of heavy snowfall had knocked out electricity and phone lines in many central Italian towns and hamlets, compounded by four powerful earthquakes that struck the region on Wednesday. \n It wasn't immediately clear which if any of the quakes triggered the avalanche. But firefighters said the sheer violence of the snow slide uprooted trees in its wake and wiped out parts of the hotel, leaving only some structures standing and others down the mountainside. \n \"There are mattresses that are hundreds of meters (yards) away from where the building was,\" Luca Cari, firefighters' spokesman, told the ANSA news agency. \n The hotel in the Abruzzo region is about 45 kilometers (30 miles) from the coastal city of Pescara, at an altitude of about 1,200 meters (3,940 feet). The area, which has been buried under snowfall for days, is located in the broad swath of central Italy between Rieti and Teramo that was jolted by Wednesday's quakes, one of which had a 5.7 magnitude. \n Accounts emerged of hotel guests messaging rescuers and friends for help Wednesday, with at least one attempt at raising the alarm rebuffed for several hours. \n Giampiero Parete, a chef vacationing at the hotel, called his boss when the avalanche struck and begged for him to mobilize rescue crews. His wife Adriana and two children, Ludovica and Gianfilippo, were trapped inside, employer Quintino Marcella told The Associated Press. \n Parete had left the hotel briefly to get some medicine for his wife from their car, and survived as a result. \n \"He said the hotel was submerged and to call rescue crews,\" Marcella said, adding that he phoned police and the Pescara prefect's office, but that no one believed him. \"The prefect's office said it wasn't true, because everything was OK at the hotel.\" \n Marcella said he insisted, and called other emergency numbers until someone finally took him seriously and mobilized a rescue, starting at 8 p.m., more than two hours later. \n When rescuers on skis arrived at the hotel in Florindola in the early morning hours today, they found just two people alive: Parete and Fabio Salzetta, identified by Italian media as a maintenance worker at the hotel. There were no other signs of life, with rescue crews saying they yelled out but heard no replies, and were using rescue dogs. \n Parete was being treated for hypothermia at a hospital in Pescara. The Romanian foreign ministry reported three Romanian citizens missing in the hotel \u2014 an adult and two children; they were believed to be Parete's family. \n Video shot by teams entering the still-standing parts of the hotel showed huge piles of filthy snow and debris piled up inside the corridors, stairwells and the indoor pool area, having slammed through the outer walls of the building. The audio is silent except for the steps of the cameraman. The largest wall of snow shown was in the pool area, where plastic lounge chairs were flipped on their sides and Christmas decorations still dangled from the ceiling. \n The bar area appeared flooded, with nearby cracked skylights covered with snow outside. \n Aerial video shot by helicopter crews showed rescue workers on top of the snow-covered hotel, digging holes down to try to get in. \n Civil protection authorities said that around 30 people were missing. By this afternoon, three bodies had been removed. Civil protection officials said the risk of further avalanches was factoring into the search effort. \n Premier Paolo Gentiloni, arriving at the civil protection headquarters in the area at midday today, sought to deflect criticism of the rescue efforts and urged authorities to redouble efforts to reach people isolated by the quakes and snow, which had dumped as much as 3 meters (10 feet) in some places. \n Residents have been complaining for days that they have been without electricity and phone service and have been house-bound because of what Gentiloni called a \"record snowfall.\" \n \"I ask everyone if possible to multiply their efforts,\" Gentiloni said. \"I ask politicians to show sobriety respecting the difficulty of the situation and the commitment of civil and military crews who are responding.\" \n The buried hotel was just one of several rescues underway: Video footage from the Italian financial police force showed a gray-haired man being led to safety by rescuers through a path dug out of deep snow elsewhere else in the region. \n Snow continued to fall today with reports of people being isolated in many places. Daiana Nguyen, a resident of a town in the province of Teramo, told SKY TG24 that 3 meters (about 10 feet) of snow had fallen and that people were \"completely isolated.\" \n \"They talk about sending in the army: Thirty to 40 men came with shovels. We need heavy machinery!\" she said. \n The timing of the avalanche Wednesday remained unclear, but the hotel posted a notice on its Facebook page that its phones were down around 9 a.m. following the first of Wednesday's quakes. \n Marcella, a restaurant owner on the nearby coast, said he received the call from Parete, his chef, at around 5:30 p.m. He reported that all of the guests had checked out and were waiting for the roads to be cleared on Wednesday afternoon when the avalanche struck. Initially the road was to be cleared by 3 p.m., but that was delayed until 7 p.m. \n The mountainous region of central Italy has been struck by a series of quakes since August that destroyed homes and historic centers in dozens of towns and hamlets.
