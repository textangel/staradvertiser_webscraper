{"date": "January 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Sylvester Holt, bottom right, pleaded with officers while standing on the ledge of the Crescent City Connection. \n GRETNA, La. >> A man accused of killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend and a police officer was in critical condition after ending an hourslong standoff by shooting himself in the chest, the sheriff of a New Orleans suburb said today. \n During the hours when Sylvester Holt, 32, was threatening to jump from New Orleans' bridge over the Mississippi River, he admitted shooting Simone Veal and Westwego Officer Michael Louviere, both of whom lived in Marrero, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said. \n \"He indicated he had a pretty good idea they were dead,\" the sheriff said at a news conference tonight. \n Trooper Dustin Dwight said Holt was taken to University Medical Center, the area's Level 1 trauma center, after shooting himself once in the chest. \n If Holt survives, he will face first-degree murder charges in the deaths of Veal, 32, and Louviere, 26, plus a charge of feticide, Normand said. \n The late evening press conference capped a tumultuous day that began with a frantic 911 call from Veal to authorities saying that she'd just been shot and ended with the shooting suspect fleeing to the busy New Orleans bridge, holding traffic captive while he negotiated with police for hours before shooting himself. \n Normand said Holt, who was later identified as the shooter, had previously been romantically involved with Veal and had recently found out the woman was pregnant with a new boyfriend's child. \n Holt went this morning to Veal's house and an altercation ensued during which he shot her several times. \n Holt then looked for Veal's boyfriend as the woman fled in a car with Holt eventually catching up to her. \n \"Witnesses said Sylvester Holt was ramming his truck into Simone's car and firing shots into the car\" before the vehicles stopped at the intersection where Louviere found them, Normand said. \n The officer had just gotten off duty and was on his way home when he pulled over to help. Veal's car was significantly damaged and she was on the ground, Normand said. \n Holt shot then shot Louviere in the head as well, Normand said, praising the officer. \n \"He was doing the right thing for the right reasons at the right time,\" Normand said. \n Holt later fled the scene, and an intense manhunt ensued. Authorities later spotted Holt on a bridge spanning New Orleans' east and west banks. Louisiana State Police spokeswoman Melissa Matey says authorities spent hours negotiating with Holt. \n \"All those attempts failed. At approximately 5:30 Holt shot himself in the chest,\" she said. \n This was not Holt's first run-in with the law. He was the subject of restraining orders obtained by several women since 2012, Normand said. \n And he'd also been arrested in September after being accused of rape. But Jefferson Parish District Attorney Paul Connick Jr. said the rape charge was later dropped after the woman repeatedly told authorities she wanted to withdraw the charge, though she still alleged that he had raped her. Holt was released from jail on Jan. 7. \n Connick said Holt contended the sex was consensual. \n Louviere, a first-year officer who had led his recruit class, may have spoken to Holt before Holt pulled a gun, Normand said. \n Louviere is survived by his wife, and their daughter, 4, and son, 1. \n According to Westwego Police Chief Dwayne Munch, he had served with the Marines in Afghanistan and was a rising star likely bound for a job at a larger agency. \n \"We knew we wouldn't have him for long. We just didn't know he would be gone this soon,\" Munch said. \n Munch said he and a doctor broke the news to Louviere's wife at a hospital that her husband had died. \n \"That was probably the hardest thing I've ever had to do,\" the chief said. \n Today's shooting comes after a sharp increase last year in the number of police officers killed in the line of duty \u2014 including a pair of deadly ambushes in Louisiana and Texas. \n On July 7, a sniper in Dallas killed five law enforcement officers and wounded nine others at the end of what had been a peaceful rally against police brutality. Less than two weeks later, a lone gunman shot and killed three law enforcement officers and wounded three others in an attack outside a Baton Rouge, La., convenience store. \n On Wednesday, authorities arrested a man accused of fatally shooting an Orlando, Fla., police officer outside a Wal-Mart on Jan. 9. \n Munch, Westwego's police chief, said Louviere helped patrol Baton Rouge after the deadly shootings in that city and helped patrol neighboring Denham Springs after August's historic flooding. \n \"Typical Michael,\" the chief said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police: Suspect in New Orleans double slaying in critical condition"}

{"date": "January 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n High school and college student protesters marking Inauguration Day demonstrated at Seattle Central College today in Seattle. \n PORTLAND, Ore. >> Hundreds marched through Seattle and Olympia, Washington, Friday and a group in Portland burned several U.S. flags as activists protested the inauguration of President Donald Trump. \n The flag-burning occurred on Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square, called \"Portland's living room\" because it's a popular hangout for all types of people. \n On Friday afternoon, hundreds of anti-Trump protesters gathered there before the start of a march that was expected to draw thousands. \n They included a small group of flag-burners, many of them masked and clad in black. At first they had trouble because of the rain, but using lighter fluid they torched at least half a dozen flags. An ember briefly fell on the jacket of one participant but the fire was quickly put out. \n The crowd in Portland marched through downtown and Portland police said on Twitter officers had used pepper spray at times. Police also tweeted that some protesters were throwing ice balls and eggs at officers. \n Later, police announced the protest had become unlawful after some were seen armed with clubs and sticks and were throwing unknown liquid at officers. \n Police said protesters needed to disperse or they would be using \"crowd-control agents.\" \n Portland police said officers arrested a man protesting Friday evening who was wanted in connection with a November protest-turned-riot. When Billy Ellison, 18, was arrested he had a torch, knife and gas mask, police said. \n He was booked into jail on two counts of interfering with public transportation. \n In Seattle, anti-Trump protesters marched to the University of Washington where far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos (yuh-NAH'-poh-lihs) was speaking. \n Yiannopoulos writes for right-wing Breitbart News and is known for leading a harassment campaign that resulted in a lifetime ban from Twitter. \n The Seattle Fire Department tweeted a man was shot Friday night and was taken from campus to Harborview Medical Center. His injury could be life-threatening. No further details were given. \n Earlier in Seattle, protesters from Capitol Hill and Central District neighborhoods streamed downtown for an afternoon immigrant and refugee rights rally. Carrying signs that said \"Fight Racism & Sexism\" and \"Resist Trump,\" people from the earlier rallies met at Westlake Park downtown Friday afternoon. \n People rallied and listened to speeches before resuming a march Friday evening, blocking traffic in some downtown areas. \n Seattle officers at the park had confiscated wooden poles, heavy pipes and hammers, Seattle police said on Twitter. \n Police also said officers were investigating reports of people in the crowd with fireworks and rocks. \n About 200 protesters gathered on the Capitol steps in Olympia, carrying signs that included \"Resist Trump\" and \"Not My President.\" \n Later Olympia police reported that about 100 people marched through downtown, causing some traffic disruptions. \n In Portland, there was a student walkout at Portland State University a couple of hours before the flag-burning. \n Loren Ford and his wife, Judy Arter, stood watch with a sign that read \"Impeach Trump.\" \n The couple traveled to Portland from the small town of Lebanon, Oregon to protest because they felt Trump was not fit for office due to conflicts of interest and his rejection of intelligence community reports that Russia had been involved in influencing the election. \n \"I think he needs to be investigated right off the bat,\" Ford said. \n Patricia Elliott, of Portland, said she felt compelled to attend the march and could not bring herself to watch the inauguration earlier on TV. \n \"I'd feel like I was saluting to fascism, for example, and I don't want to participate in that at all.\" she said. \n Some businesses in Portland's downtown announced they would close early because of the anticipated crowds. Owners of some establishments boarded up windows to prevent damage. \n Portland protests after Trump's election last November turned violent when a small group of demonstrators smashed windows, spray-painted buildings and started small fires. The demonstration caused about $1 million in damage, police have said. \n The organizer of what is expected to be the largest protest on Friday said he met with newly elected Mayor Ted Wheeler to discuss how to keep the rally peaceful. \n The event's goal is aimed at Trump and at putting pressure on local elected officials to make Portland \"a sanctuary city, not just in the immigration sense of the word, but in every sense of the word,\" said Gregory McKelvey, the leader of Portland's Resistance. \n \"I probably wouldn't have had a meeting with the mayor if I couldn't put 10,000 people in the streets,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Portland Trump protesters burn flags; 1 shot in Seattle"}

{"date": "January 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Protesters, one wearing a Donald Trump mask and another with an Adolf Hitler mask, embraced as others display a #lovetrumpshate hashtag during a brief picket at the Trump Tower in Manila, Philippines. \n President Donald Trump's inaugural speech promised \"America first\" policy, but offered no specifics about America's place in the world. \n The billionaire businessman and reality television star \u2014 the first president who had never held political office or high military rank \u2014 promised to stir a \"new national pride\" and protect America from the \"ravages\" of countries he says have stolen U.S. jobs. \n \"This American carnage stops right here,\" Trump declared. In a warning to the world, he said, \"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it's going to be America first.\" \n A look at some reactions from around the world: \n SPEECH RESONATES IN MEXICO \n Perhaps no country was watching the speech more closely than Mexico. Trump has made disparaging remarks about immigrants who come to the United States illegally and sought to pressure companies not to set up shop in Mexico by threatening a border tariff on goods manufactured there and exported to the United States. \n So Trump's talk of \"protect(ing) our borders,\" \"America first\" and \"buy American and hire American\" had particular resonance in America's southern neighbor. \n Ricardo Anaya Cortes, president of the conservative opposition National Action Party, called for \"the unity of all Mexicans, unity in the face of this protectionist, demagogic and protectionist speech we just heard. Unity against that useless wall, against deportations, against the blockade of investment.\" \n \"The challenge is enormous. \u2026 We demand the federal government leave aside tepidity, that it tackle with absolute firmness and dignity the new relationship with the United States,\" Anaya said. \n The United States is by far Mexico's largest commercial partner, buying some 80 percent of its $532 billion in exports in 2015. Mexico is the second-largest market for U.S. exports. \n \"At least the word 'Mexico' was not heard in the speech. Nevertheless one can expect the United States to launch a hyper-protectionist project,\" said Ilan Semo Groman, a researcher at Iberoamericana University. \n If Trump truly moves to block or drive away U.S. investment in Mexico, Semo said Mexico should focus its commercial efforts on other countries. \n \"There are very clear possibilities,\" Semo said. \n Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto sent three tweets after Trump's inaugural speech Friday: \n \u2014 \"I congratulate realDonaldTrump on his inauguration. We will work to strengthen our relationship with shared responsibility.\" \n \u2014 \"We will establish a respectful dialogue with the government of President realDonaldTrump, to Mexico's benefit.\" \n \u2014 \"Sovereignty, national interest and the protection of Mexicans will guide the relationship with the new government of the United States.\" \n CONCERN IN TOKYO \n Some Tokyo residents are worried that Trump's \"America first\" policy will usher in an era of populism and protectionism at the expense of the rest of the world. \n Tadashi Gomibuchi, who works in the manufacturing industry, recorded Trump's inauguration speech overnight as he was keen to hear what the new president had to say. \n \"Trump is trying to make big changes to the way things are. Changes are good sometimes, but when America, the most powerful, loses stability \u2026 it's a grave concern,\" he said. \"If you take his words literally, it may destabilize the world going forward and I'm really worried. I hope things will lead to a soft landing.\" \n Retiree Kuninobu Inoue, who lived in the U.S. during the 1990s, is concerned about trade frictions between Japan and the U.S, citing Trump's decision to withdraw from the 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership. \n \"Japan-U.S. relations are not just about security. Our good relations rely so much on trade,\" he said. \n Protectionist policies such as the withdrawal from TPP and renegotiation of NAFTA will have a negative impact on the global economy including Japan's, said Akio Mimura, head of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \n \"These policies only enhance protectionist and populist movement spreading around the world, and could largely shake the free trade system that has supported global growth,\" he said. \n In his congratulatory message to Trump, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stressed the importance of the Asia-Pacific region as a source for growth but also tensions. \n \"In the 21st century, while the Asia-Pacific region is the source of the global economic growth, the security environment of the region is becoming more severe,\" he said. \n CHINA BRACES FOR TROUBLE AHEAD \n A Chinese state-run nationalist tabloid, the Global Times, says President Trump's inauguration speech indicates that the U.S. and China would inevitably face trade tensions. \n The newspaper said in a Saturday commentary following Trump's inauguration that \"dramatic changes\" lay ahead for the U.S. and the global economic order. \n \"Undoubtedly, the Trump administration will be igniting many 'fires' on its front door and around the world. Let's wait and see when it will be China's turn,\" it said. \n The paper noted that Trump blamed foreign trade policies for failing to put \"America first,\" and said trade tensions between the U.S. and China seemed \"inevitable within the four years ahead.\" \n The paper says it expects that the Trump administration, in seeking to bring factories back to the U.S. from China, will use the U.S. government's relations with Taiwan as \"merely a bargaining chip for them to put trade pressure on China.\" \n TAIWAN TWEETS \n Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen tweeted her congratulations to Trump, saying: \"Congratulations realDonaldTrump. Democracy is what ties Taiwan and the US together. Look forward to advancing our friendship & partnership.\" \n Trump didn't mention the self-ruled island in his speech, but he angered China and broke diplomatic protocol by talking by phone with Tsai shortly after winning November's election. \n He has said earlier that Washington's \"one China policy\" under which it recognized Beijing in 1979 was open to negotiation, and questioned why the U.S. should be bound by such an approach without China offering incentives. \n SOUTH KOREANS PUT SECURITY FIRST, WORRY ABOUT ALLIANCE, TRADE \n Some in South Korea worried that President Trump would ask Seoul to shoulder a bigger share of the cost of U.S. forces stationed in South Korea as a deterrent against aggression from North Korea, or that their country will be caught in a conflict between the U.S. and China. \n \"I think the biggest challenge is the national defense,\" said Park Geon-rok, a 30-year-old designer, adding that South Korea was \"heavily influenced by the U.S.\" \n In an editorial, the English-language JoongAng Daily said South Korea's relations with the U.S. under Trump will face a challenge as the new leader will likely ask Seoul to pay more for the cost of the U.S. military forces in the country, and renegotiate a bilateral free trade agreement. But the paper also notes it is \"fortunate\" that Trump has a strong position on North Korea's nuclear weapons. \n There were concerns about potential conflicts between the U.S. and China, South Korea's key business partner. Kim Kyung-jin, a spokesman for the opposition People's Party, said that the international economic order might collapse as the U.S. seeks its own economic interest. Kim urged Trump to ease such worries. \n \"There is a possibility of us becoming an innocent bystander who gets hurt in a fight,\" said Nam Hae-sook, a 62-year-old homemaker. \"Also, I think President Trump will be different from President-elect Trump. I think things will work out.\" \n In place of impeached President Park Geun-hye, Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn said in his congratulatory message to Trump that South Korea wishes to bolster the already close ties with the U.S. and cooperate on stopping North Korea's nuclear development. \n INDIANS FRET ABOUT IMMIGRATION PROSPECTS \n Among dozens of young, urban Indians who watched Trump's inauguration and speech at a club in a New Delhi, the 27-year-old Jigar Gorasia said getting work visas for professionals and green cards will become a problem. \n \"It is going to be a little bit challenging for those,\" said Gorasia, who studied and worked in Chicago before moving back to India last year. \n Divya Narayanan, a 21-year-old student of journalism, said that Trump as president worried her. \"Someone at the level of the U.S. president coming out and saying things which are bigoted, which are sexist, it sets a precedent for other people in the country, right?\" \n Indian newspapers highlighted Trump's protectionist policies in his speech. \"America First President,\" read the banner headline of The Indian Express newspaper. \n \"Protectionist Trumpet: Buy American, Hire American,\" was the headline of The Times of India newspaper. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "World reacts to Trump's 'America first' inaugural speech"}

{"date": "January 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2009 \n The Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. \n NEW YORK >> In the heart of bustling lower Manhattan sits one of the country's most secure federal lockups \u2014 and the new home of Mexican drug lord Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman. \n Guzman, who pleaded not guilty today to charges he ran one of the world's biggest drug-trafficking operations, can expect to be kept in a special unit inside the drab 12-story Metropolitan Correctional Center, where such other high-profile, high-risk inmates as Gambino crime family boss John Gotti and several former close associates of Osama bin Laden awaited trial. \n \"It's got extra security above and beyond what you would have in a restricted housing area,\" second only to the super-maximum security prison in Florence, Colo., said Catherine Linaweaver, who served as the lockup's warden for 15 months before retiring in 2014. \"There is no other unit in the Bureau of Prisons like the high-security unit in New York.\" \n To authorities, it's a setting befitting a man who twice escaped from maximum-security Mexican prisons. Federal prosecutors wrote in a court filing that \"it is difficult to imagine another person with a greater risk of fleeing prosecution\" than Guzman. \n The jail is sandwiched between federal prosecutors' offices and two federal courthouses and is protected by steel barricades that can stop a 7 1/2-ton truck. Cameras capable of reading a newspaper a block away are trained on the area. \n Inmates can be transported to court through corridors linked to both courthouses, though Guzman will be ferried to and from court in Brooklyn, a potentially risky job for the U.S. Marshals Service. \n In the 10th-floor Special Housing Unit, known by its acronym, the SHU, pronounced like \"the shoe,\" around a dozen prisoners spend 23 hours a day in 20-by-12-foot cells, prohibited from communicating with one another. Meals are eaten in cells, and exercise is in a recreation area specifically for these inmates. \n To reduce the risk that a wealthy inmate such as Guzman might try to corrupt jail staff, the number of jailers who have access to him will likely be limited and each will undergo extra screenings by top jail officials, Linaweaver said. \n The special unit's strict confinement drew criticism in 2011 from the human rights group Amnesty International, which expressed concern that the sparse cells, exercise restrictions and isolation \"amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\" \n The jail saw an audacious escape attempt in 1982, when two armed people in a hijacked sightseeing helicopter tried to pluck an inmate off a roof. Four years earlier, three prisoners broke out by cutting through window bars. \n Security there was tightened significantly after Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, described as a right-hand man to bin Laden and awaiting trial in a terrorism case, used a sharpened comb to stab a guard on Nov. 1, 2000. Salim, who later apologized for the stabbing, is serving a life sentence. \n Guzman's case doesn't mark the first time federal authorities have grappled with how to hang onto a member of his Sinaloa drug cartel. \n Authorities expressed concern that the cartel might attempt to break a son of one of Guzman's cartel partners out of a federal lockup in Chicago in 2011. Of particular concern in that case: A fenced rooftop recreation center officials feared could make a defendant susceptible to sniper fire. \n The son was moved to a more secure facility. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "El Chapo's new home: a jail that held mobsters, terrorists"}

{"date": "January 20, 2017", "text": "SANTA BARBARA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT VIA AP \n Rescued campers surveyed the scene at the El Capitan Canyon campground following flooding due to heavy rains. \n LOS ANGELES >> More than 20 people escaped injury today when a flood swept cabins and vehicles down a coastal canyon as the second in a trio of storms drenched California with heavy rain and brought more snow to the mountains. \n The dramatic scene about 115 miles northwest of Los Angeles came during a day of pounding rain in Southern California that caused flooding, rockslides and an avalanche warning. Trees were toppled, cars were stranded in surging water and five homeless people were rescued by helicopter when their encampment was swamped. \n The storm disrupted the first post-presidential vacation of Barack Obama and his family. Their plane had to be diverted from the Palm Springs airport to March Air Force Base 60 miles away. \n After years of dry weather, California has been buffeted by rain and snow this winter. Northern California has gotten the lion's share and most of that region has now emerged from drought. \n Another storm is expected during the weekend, and it's forecast to be fiercer than the previous two. A flash flood warning starting late Saturday has been issued for the San Francisco area. \n Friday's storm was stronger than expected in Southern California. \n A swollen creek lifted five cabins off their foundations at midmorning and swept 22 vehicles down El Capitan Canyon in Santa Barbara County, fire Capt. Dave Zaniboni said. \n About 20 people stuck in the canyon were rescued from the private campground above a state beach, officials said. \n \"The water kept getting higher, and higher and higher, and then all the debris kept backing up and took out all the bridges, overflowed the bank, took out a bunch of cabins, took out a bunch of cars,\" Todd Martin, who works at El Capitan campground, told the Santa Maria Times. \n Five of the vehicles and part of a cabin were found on the beach, officials said. \n By early afternoon more than 5 inches of rain had fallen in Refugio Pass in the Santa Ynez Mountains just to the northwest of El Capitan Canyon. \n A sheriff's helicopter returning to an airport after the canyon incident spotted a car swamped by water. A woman screaming for help from higher ground nearby was hoisted to safety, Zaniboni said. \n In downtown Los Angeles, five people were rescued from a homeless encampment that was flooded. And in the San Diego area, four students had minor injuries after they were hit by a toppled tree near Chula Vista Middle School. \n Inland mountains were blanketed with snow, and the LA County Sheriff's Department warned of avalanche danger in Wrightwood. \n Runoff and rockslides in the Santa Monica Mountains west of Los Angeles forced the California Highway Patrol to close all canyon roads in the Malibu area. \n Storm warnings were also posted up and down the Sierra Nevada after the second storm dropped nearly 2 feet of snow at higher elevations. \n Along the coast, big surf was rolling ashore, and forecasters said waves could build to 30 feet on the Central Coast. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "California flood sweeps cabins, cars down coastal canyon"}

{"date": "January 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A parked limousine burned during a demonstration after the inauguration of President Donald Trump today in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Protesters set fires and hurled bricks in a daylong assault on the city hosting Donald Trump's inauguration, registering their rage against the new president in a series of clashes that led to more than 200 arrests. Police used pepper spray and stun grenades to prevent the chaos from spilling into Trump's formal procession and evening balls. \n Several spirited demonstrations unfolded peacefully at various security checkpoints near the Capitol as police helped ticket-holders get through to the inaugural ceremony. Signs read, \"Resist Trump Climate Justice Now,\" \"Let Freedom Ring\" and \"Free Palestine.\" \n But about a mile from the National Mall, police gave chase to a group of about 100 protesters who smashed the windows of downtown businesses including a Starbucks, a Bank of America and a McDonald's as they denounced capitalism and Trump. Police in riot gear used pepper spray from large canisters to help contain the violence, which erupted periodically throughout the day. \n \"They began to destroy property, throw objects at people, through windows. A large percentage of this small group was armed with crowbars and hammers,\" said the city's interim police chief, Peter Newsham. \n Six officers suffered minor injuries, he said. \n The confrontation began an hour before Trump took the oath of office and escalated several hours later as the crowd of protesters swelled to more than 1,000, some wearing gas masks and with arms chained together inside PVC pipe. One said the demonstrators were \"bringing in the cavalry.\" \n When some crossed police lines, taunting, \"Put the pigs in the ground,\" police charged with batons and pepper spray, as well as stun grenades, which are used to shock and disperse crowds. Loud booms echoed through the streets about six blocks from where Trump would soon hold his inaugural parade. \n Some protesters picked up bricks and concrete from the sidewalk and hurled them at police lines. Some rolled large, metal trash cans at police. \n Later, they set fire to a limousine on the perimeter of the secured zone, sending black smoke billowing into the sky during Trump's procession. \n As night fell, protesters set a bonfire blocks from the White House and frightened well-dressed Trump supporters as they ventured to the new president's inaugural balls. Police briefly ordered ball goers to remain inside their hotel as they worked to contain advancing protesters. \n Police said they charged 217 people with rioting, said Newsham, noting that the group caused \"significant damage\" along a number of blocks. \n Before Inauguration Day, the DisruptJ20 coalition, named after the date of the inauguration, had promised that people participating in its actions in Washington would attempt to shut down the celebrations, risking arrest when necessary. \n Trump supporter Brett Ecker said the protesters were frustrating but weren't going to put a damper on his day. \n \"They're just here to stir up trouble,\" said the 36-year-old public school teacher. \"It upsets me a little bit that people choose to do this, but yet again, it's one of the things I love about this country.\" \n At one checkpoint, protesters wore orange jumpsuits with black hoods over their faces to represent prisoners in U.S. detention at Guantanamo Bay. Eleanor Goldfield, who helped organize the DisruptJ20 protest, said protesters wanted to show Trump and his \"misguided, misinformed or just plain dangerous\" supporters that they won't be silent. \n Black Lives Matter and feminist groups also made their voices heard. Outside the International Spy Museum, protesters in Russian hats ridiculed Trump's praise of President Vladimir Putin, marching with signs calling Trump \"Putin's Puppet\" and \"Kremlin employee of the month.\" \n Friday's protests spread across the nation. \n In San Francisco, thousands formed a human chain on the Golden Gate Bridge and chanted \"Love Trumps hate.\" In the city's financial district, a few hundred protesters blocked traffic outside an office building partly owned by Trump. \n In Atlanta, protests converged at City Hall and a few hundred people chanted and waved signs protesting Trump, denouncing racism and police brutality and expressing support for immigrants, Muslims and the Black Lives Matter movement. \n In Nashville, half a dozen protesters chained themselves to the doors of the Tennessee Capitol. Hundreds also sat in a 10-minute silent protest at a park while Trump took the oath of office. Organizers led a prayer, sang patriotic songs and read the Declaration of Independence aloud. \n In the Pacific Northwest, demonstrators in Portland, Oregon, burned U.S. flags and students at Portland State University walked out of classes. About 200 protesters gathered on the Capitol steps in Olympia, Washington, carrying signs that included the messages \"Resist Trump\" and Not My Problem.\" Olympia police reported about 100 marchers causing some traffic disruptions downtown, and protesters also marched in Seattle. \n The demonstrations won't end when Trump takes up residence in the White House. \n A massive Women's March on Washington is planned for Saturday. Christopher Geldart, the District of Columbia's homeland security director, has said 1,800 buses have registered to park in the city Saturday, which could mean nearly 100,000 people coming in just by bus. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fires, bricks mark daylong assault on inaugural festivities"}

{"date": "January 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n James Mattis, left, arrived for church service at St. John's Episcopal Church across from the White House in Washington earlier today. \n WASHINGTON >> The Republican-led Senate, taking little time to fill two critical national security posts, overwhelmingly confirmed a pair of retired Marine generals tapped by President Donald Trump to run the Pentagon and secure America's borders. \n A little more than an hour later, Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath of office to James Mattis to be defense secretary and John Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Mattis had been confirmed by a 98-1 vote and Kelly 88-11. \n Earlier in the day, during a luncheon following his inauguration, Trump said Mattis and Kelly were from \"central casting,\" referring to their reputations as tough-talking, no-nonsense commanders. \n \"If I'm doing a movie, I'd pick you, Gen. Mattis,\" Trump said. \n But Democrats succeeded in stalling until Monday action by the full Senate on Trump's pick for CIA director, Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan. Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Patrick Leahy of Vermont objected to what they said was a \"rushed confirmation\" and demanded more time for Pompeo's nomination to be \"vetted, questioned and debated.\" \n Republicans scolded Democrats for an unnecessary delay, noting that the move left the spy agency leaderless over the weekend. Being lectured on the speed of nomination approvals didn't sit well with Democrats, who reminded GOP lawmakers that they flatly refused to consider President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee for 11 months. \n In a statement issued by the White House, Trump said he was pleased with the Senate's confirmation votes and made clear he wanted more. \n \"I call on members of the Senate to fulfill their constitutional obligation and swiftly confirm the remainder of my highly qualified cabinet nominees, so that we can get to work on behalf of the American people without further delay,\" he said. \n Congress had to pave the way for Mattis to serve. Lawmakers last week passed legislation that Trump signed shortly after being sworn in that granted Mattis a one-time exception from the law that bars former U.S. service members who have been out of uniform for less than seven years from holding the top Pentagon job. The restriction is meant to preserve civilian control of the military. Mattis retired from the Marine Corps in 2013. \n Congress last allowed an exception to the law in 1950 for George Marshall, a former five-star Army general and secretary of state. Mattis replaces Ash Carter, who had been President Barack Obama's defense secretary since February 2015. \n GOP lawmakers pushed for a speedy and smooth transition at the Pentagon to ensure Mattis would be fully in charge should a national security crisis erupt in the hours and days after Trump's inauguration. During his Jan. 12 confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mattis described a world in tumult and a U.S. military that is not robust enough to deal with all the threats the country faces. \n Addressing the Defense Department after taking office, Mattis said \"it's good to be back\" and that he was confident all Pentagon personnel would do their part to serve the nation. \n \"Every action we take will be designed to ensure our military is ready to fight today and in the future,\" he said in a statement. \"Recognizing that no nation is secure without friends, we will work with the State Department to strengthen our alliances. Further, we are devoted to gaining full value from every taxpayer dollar spent on defense, thereby earning the trust of Congress and the American people.\" \n Mattis is highly regarded on Capitol Hill for his character and judgment \u2014 traits that many Democrats believe make the retired four-star officer an essential bulwark against Trump's propensity for bluster and impulsiveness. \n During a military career than lasted four decades, Mattis served in numerous senior military positions, including commander of U.S. Central Command, which is responsible for U.S. military operations in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. \n Kelly comes to the government's newest department with years of experience working with various Homeland Security agencies. \n Among Kelly's likely first assignments will be executing Trump's plans for the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program, which has protected more than 750,000 young immigrants from deportation. \n As the top officer at U.S. Southern Command, based in south Florida, Kelly routinely worked with the department to combat human trafficking networks and drug smuggling. The post included oversight of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Kelly clashed at times with the Obama administration, which pushed unsuccessfully to close the facility. \n If Trump follows through on promises to toughen immigration enforcement, Kelly's agency will be responsible for buttressing the screening of immigrants permitted to enter the U.S. He'll also have to come up with the resources for locating and then deporting people living here illegally. \n During his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Kelly told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that he's in favor of Trump's plan for a wall at the Mexican border. But he said a physical barrier alone won't be enough to secure the 2,000-mile frontier. \n \"Certainly it has to be a layered approach,\" Kelly said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Alicia A.

And it directs them to grant waivers, exemptions and delays of provisions in the Affordable Care Act that would impose costs on states or individuals, potentially including the law's penalties on people who remain uninsured \u2014 a key provision. The order also says federal agencies must allow states greater flexibility in carrying out the health care programs. \n \"It's a sign that the Trump administration is looking to unwind the law in every way it can administratively,\" said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for information and analysis about the health care system. \n It may take weeks or months to discern the full impact of Trump's directive on \"Obamacare.\" Departments like Health and Human Services and Treasury will have to issue policies that embody the new president's wishes. \n One distinct possibility is for the government to find new ways to grant exemptions from the law's unpopular requirement that people who remain uninsured pay fines, if deemed able to afford coverage. For example, GOP lawmakers in Congress have proposed an exemption for people in areas where only one insurer offers coverage \u2014 currently about a third of U.S. counties. \n The executive order may not have much impact for 2017, since government rules for this year have already been incorporated into contracts signed with insurance companies. \n But Levitt said broad exemptions from the law's coverage requirement could scare off insurers already on the fence about continuing to participate in 2018 and beyond. Insurers see the law's coverage requirement, or so-called individual mandate, as an essential tool to nudge healthy people into the coverage pool. Without it the companies and most independent experts believe premiums would spike, making HealthCare.gov's insurance markets unsustainable. \n \"It would create a significant amount of uncertainty and affect insurers' ability to participate for 2018,\" Levitt said. \n Trump made clear he is not unilaterally suspending the Affordable Care Act. It remains on the books, and his directive instructs agencies to act within \"the maximum extent permitted by law.\" \n Changing the underlying law would require Congress to act, but the Trump administration can rewrite regulations carrying out the legislation. New regulations cannot be issued overnight, but would have to follow a legally established process that requires public notice and an opportunity for interested parties to comment on the administration's changes. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump executive order first strike at ending at 'Obamacare'"}

A look at some of his assertions Friday: \n From July through September, the economy expanded at a 3.5 percent annual pace \u2014 fastest in two years. The Federal Reserve is so confident in the resiliency of the economy that it raised interest rates last month for only the second time in a decade. \n Still, Trump's talk of \"rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation\" rings true in communities that lost factories to low-wage competition from China and Mexico. And the jobless rate is low partly because so many Americans have stopped looking for work and are no longer counted as unemployed. \n Wage growth has been sluggish since the Great Recession ended in mid-2009. But declining unemployment and steady job growth are starting to force businesses to offer higher pay to find and attract new workers. \n And in 2015, the income for a typical household jumped 5.2 percent to an inflation-adjusted $56,516, the largest annual growth in nearly five decades, according to the Census Bureau. Average hourly pay rose last year at the fastest pace in more than seven years. \n The Pentagon says it does have additional needs, including more ships, a replenished air fleet and bigger training budgets to prepare for large-scale combat. \n A U.S.-led coalition began battling Islamic extremism even before 9/11. In Afghanistan alone, the coalition has fought for more than 15 years to prevent al-Qaida and other radical groups from regaining a safe harbor there. Getting the help of NATO allies might prove diplomatically challenging since Trump has called NATO \"obsolete\" and says European members aren't paying their fair share. \n The threat is only growing.

Bravo!\" rescue crews pulled survivors from the debris of an avalanche-crushed hotel in central Italy today, boosting spirits two days after massive snow slide buried some 30 people. Four children were among the 10 people found alive \u2014 and one asked for cookies when she got out.  \n The news buoyed rescue workers who had already located four bodies in the rubble of the luxury Hotel Rigopiano, 112 miles northeast of Rome, where the avalanche dumped 16\u00bd feet of snow on top of the resort. \n \"Today is a day of hope. There's a miracle under way,\" declared Ilario Lacchetta, mayor of the tiny town of Farindola, where the hotel is located. \n Relatives of the missing rushed from the rescue operations center in the mountains to the seaside hospital where the survivors were taken for treatment in hopes that their loved ones were among the lucky few to be found. \n First word of the discovery came around 11 a.m. Video released by rescuers showed a boy wearing blue snow pants and a matching ski jacket emerging through a tunnel dug in the snow. It was Gianfilippo Parete, the 8-year-old son of Giampiero Parete, a chef vacationing at the resort who had gone to his car when the avalanche struck and first sounded the alarm by calling his boss. \n Emergency crews mussed the boy's hair in celebration. \"Bravo! Bravo!\" they cheered. \n Next to emerge was his mother, Adriana Vranceanu, 43, wearing red snow pants and appearing alert as she told rescuers that her 6-year-old daughter, Ludovica, was still trapped inside. Mother and son were helped to a stretcher for the helicopter ride out. \n They were then reunited with Parete at a hospital in the coastal town of Pescara, suffering from hypothermia and dehydration but otherwise in good health, hospital officials said. \n \"They had heavy clothes,\" said Dr. Rossano di Luzio. \"They had ski caps to cover themselves. They remained away from the snow and cold, they were always inside the structure. That's why the hypothermia wasn't severe.\" \n Ludovica was later rescued and asked for cookies when she got out: Ringos, an Italian version of Oreos, said Quintino Marcella, the restaurant owner who rallied the rescue after getting the phone call from her father. \n About 30 people were trapped inside the hotel in the Gran Sasso mountain range when the avalanche hit Wednesday after days of winter storms that dumped nearly 10 feet of snow in some places. The region was also rocked by four earthquakes on Wednesday, though it was not clear if they set off the avalanche. \n As the rescue work continued, relatives of the missing gathered anxiously at the Pescara hospital waiting for word of their loved ones. \n \"I just hope that my niece and her boyfriend will make it out of there,\" said Melissa Riccardo. \"We came to see if she was here.\" \n A few erupted in frustration at an evening news conference. \n \"The only news I have has been from the internet. They haven't given me anything direct,\" said Domenico Angelozzi, awaiting news of his sister and brother-in-law. \n The number of survivors found and extracted evolved over the course of the day. \n \"We found five people alive. We're pulling them out. Send us a helicopter!\" a rescuer was heard saying over a firefighters' radio as Associated Press reporters made their way on foot to the site of the disaster. \n Late today, civil protection chief Fabrizio Cari said a total of 10 people had been found alive: Five who had been extracted, including four children. Rescuers were working to remove the rest, he said. \n \"A beautiful feeling. Wonderful. I can't describe it!\" marveled Simona Di Carlo, aunt of Edoardo Di Carlo, after hearing word that he was among the survivors. \"But I would like to see him.\" \n Rescue crews said one group of survivors was found in the hotel's kitchen area in an air pocket that formed when reinforced cement walls partially resisted the avalanche's violent power. \n \"It's probable that they realized the risk and took protective measures,\" firefighter Giuseppe Romano said. \n Those being rescued were in remarkably good condition, rescue workers said. Titi Postiglione, operations chief of the civil protection agency, said survivors would help rescuers try to locate others trapped in the hotel. \n Prosecutors opened a manslaughter investigation into the tragedy and were looking into whether the avalanche threat was taken seriously enough, and whether the hotel should have been evacuated earlier given the heavy snowfall and forecasts. \n \"That hotel, in that historic moment, should it have been open?\" prosecutor Christina Tedeschini was quoted by the ANSA news agency as saying. \"If the people wanted to leave, what prevented them from doing so?\" \n Parete, the survivor who sounded the alarm, said the guests had all checked out and were waiting for the road to be cleared so they could evacuate. But the snowplow never arrived and the avalanche hit around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday. \n In addition, pleas for a rescue team initially went unheeded by Italian authorities. Marcella, Parete's boss, said his call to the Pescara prefect's office was rebuffed because the hotel had informed it a few hours earlier that all was OK there. \n He persisted with other emergency responders and eventually someone took his information seriously and mobilized the rescue some two hours later. \n Tedeschini said the delay was \"a relevant theme that we will look into.\" \n The operation has also been hampered by fears of triggering new avalanches and building collapses onto possible survivors trapped in the rubble. \n Workers have been clearing a seven-kilometer (5.5-mile) road to bring in heavier equipment, but the mountain road can handle only one-way traffic and is covered with snow and fallen trees and rocks. \n Days of heavy snowfall had knocked out electricity and phone lines in many central Italian towns and hamlets, and the hotel phones went down early Wednesday, just as the first of the four powerful earthquakes struck. \n The force of the massive snow slide collapsed one wing of the hotel and rotated another off its foundation, pushing it downhill. \n Lacchetta, the Farindola mayor, said the hotel had 24 guests, four of them children, and 12 employees onsite at the time of the avalanche. \n An Alpine rescue team was the first to arrive at the hotel on cross-country skis after a seven-kilometer journey that took two hours. They found Parete and Fabio Salzetta, a hotel maintenance worker, in a car in the resort's parking lot. \n Parete was taken to a hospital while Salzetta stayed behind to help rescuers identify where guests might be buried and how crews could enter the buildings. \n The mountainous region of central Italy has been struck by a series of quakes since August that destroyed homes and historic centers in dozens of towns and hamlets. A deadly quake in August killed nearly 300 people. No one died in strong aftershocks in the region in October, largely because towns had already been evacuated. \n AP writer Nicole Winfield contributed from Rome. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'Miracle underway': Rescuers pull out avalanche survivors"}

Trump, Trump, he's really president,\" the mustachioed Tokarev sang on a tiny stage with the Russian and American flags hanging behind him. \n Across from the U.S. embassy compound in central Moscow, the Russian Army store put up a poster with Trump's picture, offering inauguration day discounts of 10 percent for Americans. \n There is a broad feeling in Russia's political and business elites that relations with Washington just can't get any worse. \n \"Russia hopes that under Trump there will be no ideology, no attempts to lecture about democracy, human rights and rights of smaller nations around its borders \u2026 but primarily deal with economic issues in a businesslike way and even tacitly divide spheres of influence,\" said Alexei Arbatov, a senior researcher with the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, a government-funded Moscow think-tank. \n \"Putin and Obama spoke different languages, they didn't understand one another. There is a hope that Trump and Putin will speak the same language, even though their positions may differ.\" \n Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov voiced hope that Trump will work together with Putin on solving the Ukrainian crisis and other problems, but warned against expectations of quick progress. \"Difficulties will remain,\" he said. \n Andrei Kuzyaev, a Russian oil tycoon who now heads ER Telecom, a leading broadband provider, said he expects Trump to \"switch from political propaganda to action.\" \n Leonid Slutsky, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of parliament, said in an opinion piece published today that \"constructive approach and pragmatism have practically disappeared from the Russia-U.S. agenda during Obama's presidency.\" \n Medvedev, who served as president in 2008-2012 when Putin had to shift into the premier's seat due to term limits, presided over a period of warmer ties during Obama's first term. He sharply criticized the outgoing administration for ruining relations with Moscow by attempting to treat Russia like a \"banana republic\" and relying on \"brute force and sheer pressure\" in its dealings with Moscow. \n \"Conclusion: The Obama administration has destroyed relations between the United States and Russia, which are at their lowest point in decades,\" Medvedev said. \n He denounced the sanctions the U.S. and its allies imposed on Russia over its action in Ukraine, saying that \"it doesn't get any dumber than restricting entry to the United States for the leadership of the Russian parliament, ministers, and businessmen, thus deliberately reducing the possibility of full-fledged contacts and closing the window to cooperation.\" \n State TV stations carried flattering reports about Trump today, chronicling his business achievements and describing his ritzy lifestyle. \n Senior Russian lawmakers spoke with disapproval about anti-Trump protests and criticized CNN for speculating about possible succession if Trump is assassinated in an attack on the inauguration day. \n \"That atmosphere shows us the flaws of Western democracy, particularly in the United States,\" flamboyant ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky said in parliament. \n Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow and Angela Charlton in Davos, Switzerland contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Russian political elites revel in Trump's inauguration"}

{"date": "January 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump danced with first lady Melania Trump at the Liberty Ball. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama talked, as they paused on the steps of the East Front of the U.S. Capitol as the Obama's depart, today, in Washington. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States by Chief Justice John Roberts as Melania Trump looked on during the 58th Presidential Inauguration at the U.S. Capitol in Washington today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President-elect Donald Trump pumped his fist as he arrived during the 58th Presidential Inauguration at the U.S. Capitol in Washington today. \n WASHINGTON >> Pledging emphatically to empower America's \"forgotten men and women,\" Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the United States today, taking command of a riven nation facing an unpredictable era under his assertive but untested leadership. \n Under cloudy, threatening skies at the West Front of the U.S. Capitol, Trump painted a bleak picture of the America he now leads, declaring as he had throughout the election campaign that it is beset by crime, poverty and a lack of bold action. The billionaire businessman and reality television star \u2014 the first president who had never held political office or high military rank \u2014 promised to stir a \"new national pride\" and protect America from the \"ravages\" of countries he says have stolen U.S. jobs. \n \"This American carnage stops right here,\" Trump declared. In a warning to the world, he said, \"From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it's going to be America first.\" \n Eager to demonstrate his readiness to take actions, Trump went directly to the Oval Office tonight, before the inaugural balls, and signed his first executive order as president \u2014 on \"Obamacare.\" \n The order notes that Trump intends to seek the \"prompt repeal\" of the law. But in the meantime, it allows the Health and Human Services Department or other federal agencies to delay implementing any piece of the law that might impose a \"fiscal burden\" on states, health care providers, families or individuals. \n \"This is a movement and now the work begins,\" Trump told supporters, before dancing with his wife, Melania, to Frank Sinatra's \"My Way\" at the first of three inaugural balls. \"We love you. We're going to be working for you and we're going to produce results.\" \n Trump also signed commissions for two former generals confirmed to Cabinet posts earlier by the Senate: James Mattis as secretary of defense and John Kelly to head the Department of Homeland Security. Vice President Mike Pence swore them in soon after. \n Mattis struck a different tone from his new boss in his first statement to his department: \"Recognizing that no nation is secure without friends, we will work with the State Department to strengthen our alliances.\" \n At the inauguration, the crowd that spread out before Trump on the National Mall was notably smaller than at past inaugurals, reflecting both the divisiveness of last year's campaign and the unpopularity of the incoming president compared to modern predecessors. \n After the swearing-in, demonstrations unfolded in the streets of Washington. Police in riot gear deployed pepper spray after protesters smashed the windows of downtown businesses, denouncing capitalism and the new president. \n Police reported more than 200 arrests by evening and said six officers had been hurt. At least one vehicle was set afire. \n Short and pointed, Trump's 16-minute address in the heart of Washington was a blistering rebuke of many who listened from privileged seats only feet away. Surrounded by men and women who have long filled the government's corridors of power, the new president said that for too long, \"a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost.\" \n His predecessor, Obama, sat stoically as Trump pledged to push the country in a dramatically different direction. \n Trump's victory gives Republicans control of both the White House and Congress \u2014 and all but ensures conservatives can quickly pick up a seat on the closely divided Supreme Court. Despite entering a time of Republican dominance, Trumpmade little mention of the party's bedrock principles: small government, social conservativism and robust American leadership around the world. \n He left no doubt he considers himself the product of a movement \u2014 not a party. \n Trump declared his moment a fulfillment of his campaign pledge to take a sledgehammer to Washington's traditional ways, and he spoke directly to the alienated and disaffected. \n \"What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people,\" he said. \"To all Americans in every city near and far, small and large from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again.\" \n But the speech offered scant outreach to the millions who did not line up behind his candidacy. \n Trump's call for restrictive immigration measures, religious screening of immigrants and his caustic campaign rhetoric about women and minorities angered millions. He did not directly address that opposition, instead offering a call to \"speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity.\" \n While Trump did not detail policy proposals Friday, he did set a high bar for his presidency. The speech was full of the onetime showman's lofty promises to bring back jobs, \"completely\" eradicate Islamic terrorism, and build new roads, bridges and airports. \n Despite Trump's ominous portrait of America, he is taking the helm of a growing economy. Jobs have increased for a record 75 straight months, and the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in December, close to a 9-year low. \n Yet Trump's victory underscored that for many Americans, the recovery from the Great Recession has come slowly or not at all. His campaign tapped into seething anger in working class communities, particularly in the Midwest, that have watched factories shuttered and the certainty of a middle class life wiped away. \n Randy Showalter, a 36-year-old diesel mechanic and father of five from Mount Solon, Virginia, said he felt inspired as he stood and listened to Trump's speech. \n \"I feel like there's an American pride that I've never felt, honestly, in my life,\" said Showalter, who donned Trump's signature \"Make America Great Again\" red hat. \n Trump's journey to the inauguration was as unlikely as any in recent U.S. history. He defied his party's establishment and befuddled the news media. He used social media to dominate the national conversation and challenge conventions about political discourse. After years of Democratic control of the White House and deadlock in Washington, his was a blast of fresh air for millions. \n At 70, Trump is the oldest person to be sworn in as president, marking a generational step backward after two terms for Obama, one of the youngest presidents to serve as commander in chief. \n In a show of solidarity, all of the living American presidents attended the inaugural, except for 92-year-old George H.W. Bush, who was hospitalized this week with pneumonia. His wife, Barbara, was also in the hospital after falling ill. \n But more than 60 House Democrats refused to attend Trump's swearing-in ceremony in the shadow of the Capitol dome. One Democrat who did sit among the dignitaries was Hillary Clinton, Trump's vanquished campaign rival who was widely expected by both parties to be the one taking the oath of office. \n At a post-ceremony luncheon at the Capitol, Trump declared it was an honor to have her attend, and the Republicans and Democrats present rose and applauded. \n While most of Trump's first substantive acts as president will wait until Monday, he signed a series of papers formally launching his administration, including official nominations for his Cabinet. Sitting in an ornate room steps from the Senate floor, the president who had just disparaged the Washington establishment joked with lawmakers, including House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, and handed out presidential pens. \n AP writers Vivian Salama and Nancy Benac contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014  \n Donald Trump Inaugural Address \n Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you. \n We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people. \n Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come. \n We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done. \n Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. \n Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another \u2013 but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People. \n For too long, a small group in our nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. \n Washington flourished \u2013 but the people did not share in its wealth. \n Politicians prospered \u2013 but the jobs left, and the factories closed. \n The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. \n Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation's Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. \n That all changes \u2013 starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you. \n It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. \n This is your day. This is your celebration. \n And this, the United States of America, is your country. \n What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. \n January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. \n The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. \n Everyone is listening to you now. \n You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. \n At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens. \n Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. \n These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public. \n But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. \n This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. \n We are one nation \u2013 and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. \n The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. \n For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; \n Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; \n We've defended other nation's borders while refusing to defend our own; \n And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. \n We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon. \n One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. \n The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world. \n But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future. \n We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. \n From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. \n From this moment on, it's going to be America First. \n Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. \n We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. \n I will fight for you with every breath in my body \u2013 and I will never, ever let you down. \n America will start winning again, winning like never before. \n We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams. \n We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation. \n We will get our people off of welfare and back to work \u2013 rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. \n We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American. \n We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world \u2013 but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. \n We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow. \n We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones \u2013 and unite the civilized world against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth. \n At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. \n When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. \n The Bible tells us, \"how good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.\" \n We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. \n When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. \n There should be no fear \u2013 we are protected, and we will always be protected. \n We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God. \n Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. \n In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. \n We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action \u2013 constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. \n The time for empty talk is over. \n Now arrives the hour of action. \n Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. \n We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. \n We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. \n A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions. \n It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag. \n And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator. \n So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: \n You will never be ignored again. \n Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. \n Together, We Will Make America Strong Again. \n We Will Make America Wealthy Again. \n We Will Make America Proud Again. \n We Will Make America Safe Again. \n And, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless America. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump takes charge as 45th U.S. president"}

{"date": "January 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Police deployed smoke and pepper grenades during clashes with protesters in northwest Washington today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Protesters burned signs outside the National Press Building ahead of the presidential inauguration, Thursday, in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Protesters registered their rage against the new president today in a chaotic confrontation with police who used pepper spray and stun grenades in a melee just blocks from Donald Trump's inaugural parade route. Scores were arrested for trashing property and attacking officers. \n Several spirited demonstrations unfolded peacefully at various security checkpoints near the Capitol as police helped ticket-holders get through to the inaugural ceremony. Signs read, \"Resist Trump Climate Justice Now,\" \"Let Freedom Ring,\" \"Free Palestine.\" \n But about a mile from the National Mall, police gave chase to a group of about 100 protesters who smashed the windows of downtown businesses including a Starbucks, a Bank of America and a McDonald's as they denounced capitalism and Trump. Police in riot gear used pepper spray from large canisters and eventually cordoned off protesters at 12th and L streets in northwest Washington. \n The confrontation began an hour before Trump took the oath of office and escalated several hours later as the crowd of protesters swelled to more than 1,000, some wearing gas masks and with arms chained together inside PVC pipe. One said the demonstrators were \"bringing in the cavalry.\" \n When some crossed police lines, taunting, \"Put the pigs in the ground,\" police charged with batons and pepper spray, as well as stun grenades, which are used to shock and disperse crowds. Loud booms echoed through the streets about six blocks from where Trump would soon hold his inaugural parade. \n Some protesters picked up bricks and concrete from the sidewalk and hurled them at police lines. Some rolled large, metal trash cans at police. \n Police said in a statement that the group damaged vehicles, destroyed property and set small fires while armed with crowbars and hammers. Peter Newsham, the interim police chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, said the group caused \"significant damage\" along a number of blocks and that more than 90 people were arrested and charged with rioting. \n Before Inauguration Day, the DisruptJ20 coalition, named after the date of the inauguration, had promised that people participating in its actions in Washington would attempt to shut down the celebrations, risking arrest when necessary. \n Earlier in the day, as guests were going in to the ceremony, lines for ticket-holders entering two gates stretched for blocks at one point as protesters clogged entrances. \n Trump supporter Brett Ecker said the protesters were frustrating but weren't going to put a damper on his day. \n \"They're just here to stir up trouble,\" said the 36-year-old public school teacher. \"It upsets me a little bit that people choose to do this, but yet again, it's one of the things I love about this country.\" \n At one checkpoint, protesters wore orange jumpsuits with black hoods over their faces to represent prisoners in U.S. detention at Guantanamo Bay. Eleanor Goldfield, who helped organize the Disrupt J20 protest, said protesters wanted to show Trump and his \"misguided, misinformed or just plain dangerous\" supporters that they won't be silent. \n Black Lives Matter and feminist groups also made their voices heard. \n Most Trump supporters walking to the inauguration past Union Station ignored protesters outside the train station, but not Doug Rahm, who engaged in a lengthy and sometimes profane yelling match with them. \"Get a job,\" said Rahm, a Bikers for Trump member from Philadelphia. \"Stop crying, snowflakes, Trump won.\" \n Outside the International Spy Museum, protesters in Russian hats ridiculed Trump's praise of President Vladimir Putin, marching with signs calling Trump \"Putin's Puppet\" and \"Kremlin employee of the month.\" \n More demonstrations were planned for later in the day. The \"Festival of Resistance\" march ran about 1.5 miles to McPherson Square, a park about three blocks from the White House, where a rally featuring the filmmaker and liberal activist Michael Moore was planned. \n Along the inaugural parade route, the ANSWER Coalition anti-war group planned demonstrations at two locations. \n Today's protests weren't the first of the inauguration. On Thursday night, protesters and Trump supporters clashed outside a pro-Trump event in Washington. Police used chemical spray on some protesters in an effort to control the unruly crowd. \n The demonstrations won't end when Trump takes up residence in the White House. A massive Women's March on Washington is planned for Saturday. Christopher Geldart, the District of Columbia's homeland security director, has said 1,800 buses have registered to park in the city Saturday, which could mean nearly 100,000 people coming in just by bus. \n Associated Press writers Alan Suderman, Matthew Barakat, Alanna Durkin Richer and Luis Alonso Lugo contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Confrontation near parade route escalates, pepper spray used"}
