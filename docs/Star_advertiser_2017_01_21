{"date": "January 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Rescuers worked at the avalanche-hit Rigopiano hotel today in Farindola, Italy. \n FARINDOLA, Italy >> The strain showed on Fabio Salzetta's face. \n The maintenance worker at the luxury Hotel Rigopiano who escaped being buried under the deadly avalanche because he had gone to check the boiler told Italian media Saturday that he called for hours to find survivors, but no one responded. The scene, he said, \"felt like it was a dream. It was a nightmare.\" \n One of the people buried inside, and among the 23 still missing, is his sister. His voice shaking, he said he last saw her in the kitchen. \n Five people have been confirmed killed, including two hotel waiters, while nine, including four children who had been on family vacations, have been pulled alive from the reinforced concrete structure buried beneath as many as eight meters of snow last Wednesday. \n Doctors at the hospital in Pescara said one of the adults underwent surgery for a crushed arm, and was in fair condition, but that all of the other patients were doing well. The children were being moved from intensive care to the pediatric ward. \n Buoyed by the rescues on Friday, more than two days after the disaster, search crews were intensifying their round-the-clock operation, fighting against the clock and deteriorating weather conditions including fresh snowfall and freezing temperatures. \n \"The research is difficult also because the site is in a precarious equilibrium, that's why the interventions are made very carefully and why we cannot intervene with big machineries risking to modify a very vulnerable situation,\" said Titti Postiglione of Italy's civil protection agency. \n Instead, workers pushed ahead using saws, shovels and gloved hands, listening for any sounds that might suggest more survivors. \n Dozens of friends and family members kept vigil at the hospital, some growing frustrated at the lack of news. \n In one family, elation that 9-year-old Edoardo Di Carlo had survived in good condition was tempered by news that his mother, Nadia Aconcciamessa, a nurse in the nearby town of Penne, was among the dead. The toll also includes two waiters at the hotel, Gabriele di Angelo and Alessandro Giancaterino. \n Postiglioni said the high number of people still missing was giving impetus to the search. They include Di Carlo's father and the parents of 6-year-old Samuel Di Michelangelo. \n The search included sending sound-sensitive instruments down into snow-crusted debris. Rescuers passed crates full of chunks of hardened snow and ice to colleagues as they tried to penetrate deeper into the wreckage, creating the rough equivalent of elevator shafts to allow searchers to descend into the smashed hotel. \n Searchers also used devices that could pick up any electronic waves emitted by cell phones of the missing, said Walter Milan, a spokesman for the alpine rescuers. \n That voices haven't been heard lately doesn't mean no one is still alive, he said, explaining \"we know that thick walls and snow isolates\" possible voices. \n Because of the continued avalanche risk, escape routes were planned for rescue crews and each participant was equipped with a tracking device in case they were buried under the snow. \n Snowfall higher than 3 meters (10 feet) thwarted the arrival of heavy equipment like cranes, said rescue spokesman Marco Bini, leaving the searchers to often rely on their hands or simple snow shovels to make progress. \n Salzetta has been spending time at the hotel rescue operation advising crews on the hotel's layout and guests' possible locations. \n Talking to reporters as he left the area, he recalled that the guests had gathered to go home, some shaken by the four quakes that day, but their departure was stymied by heavy snowfall that had made the road out impassable. \n \"In the end, they were calm. No one imagined that something like this could happen, after all the earthquakes that there have been,\" Salzetta said. \n The last thing he remembers of that night: \"The snow. Everything snow.\" \n \u2014\u2014 \n Barry reported from Pescara.

{"date": "January 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump pointed to a member of the audience after speaking at the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Va., today. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump's speech today at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency turned into the latest battle in, as he put it, his \"running war with the media.\" He had two central complaints: that the media misrepresented the size of the crowd at his inauguration and that it was incorrectly reported a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. was removed from the Oval Office. A look at those assertions: \n The president went on to say that one network \"said we drew 250,000 people. Now that's not bad. But it's a lie.\" He then claimed that were 250,000 right by the stage and the \"rest of the, you know, 20-block area, all the way back to the Washington Monument was packed.\" \n \"So we caught them,\" said Trump. \"And we caught them in a beauty. And I think they're going to pay a big price.\" \n Thin crowds and partially empty bleachers also dotted the inaugural parade route. Hotels across the District of Columbia reported vacancies, a rarity for an event as large as a presidential inauguration. \n And ridership on the Washington's Metro system didn't match that of recent inaugurations. \n As of 11 a.m. that day, there were 193,000 trips taken, according to the transit service's Twitter account. At the same hour eight years ago, there had been 513,000 trips. Four years later, there were 317,000 for Obama's second inauguration. There were 197,000 at 11 a.m. in 2005 for President George W. Bush's second inauguration. \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer later added to the misstatements. \n Spicer claimed that it was the first time white \"floor coverings\" were used to protect the grass on the National Mall and that it drew attention to any empty space. But the same tarp was used four years ago. \n Spicer also said it was \"the first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the Mall, preventing hundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had in inaugurations past.\" \n The Secret Service says that this was the first time security fencing was installed around the National Mall for an inauguration. To get onto the Mall, people were required to go through one of seven checkpoints where their bags were checked, but there were no magnetometers used at those checkpoints. \n A law enforcement official not authorized to publicly discuss the inauguration says officials were \"not aware of any issues with flow rate in and around the National Mall.\" \n Spicer then said, \"This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2014 period \u2014 both in person and around the globe.\" \n He offered no evidence and there is no immediate way to confirm such a claim. \n But photo taken during Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration showed substantially more people on the Mall. It is not known how many people watched the ceremony on television around the globe. In the U.S., Nielsen estimates 31 million viewers watched TV coverage, but that's less than Barack Obama's and Ronald Reagan's first inaugurations. \n The exact size of the crowd Friday may never be known. The National Park Service stopped providing estimates in the 1990s. \n \u2014\u2014 \n \"But this is how dishonest the media is,\" Trump said. \n \"Now, big story, the retraction was like, where?\" he asked. \"Was it a line or do they even bother running it?\" \n The error about the bust was first transmitted in a pool report distributed among reporters. The White House often uses a pool system when not all reporters who want to attend an event can be accommodated in a space. \n At 7:30 p.m., reporter Zeke Miller wrote a pool report saying, \"The MLK bust was no longer on display.\" \n Once Miller realized his error, an update was sent to the pool. \"The MLK bust remains in the Oval Office, in addition to the Churchill bust, per a WH aide. It was apparently obscured by a door and an agent during the spray. Your pool offers sincerest apologies.\" \n Miller also corrected the error on Twitter, and Time magazine corrected its story based on his report. \n \"Correction: An earlier version of the story said that a bust of Martin Luther King had been moved. It is still in the Oval Office,\" it reads. \n \u2014\u2014 \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fact check: Trump overstates crowd size; report wrong about missing MLK bust"}

{"date": "January 21, 2017", "text": "WASHINGTON >> In a global exclamation of defiance and solidarity, more than 1 million people rallied at women's marches in the nation's capital and cities around the world today to send President Donald Trump an emphatic message on his first full day in office that they won't let his agenda go unchallenged. \n \"Welcome to your first day, we will not go away!\" marchers in Washington chanted. \n Plenty of men joined in, contributing to surprising numbers everywhere from New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles to Mexico City, Paris, Berlin, London, Prague and Sydney. \n The Washington rally alone attracted over 500,000 people according to city officials \u2014 apparently more than Trump's inauguration drew on Friday. It was easily one of the biggest demonstrations in the city's history, and as night fell, not a single arrest was reported. \n The international outpouring served to underscore the degree to which Trump has unsettled people in both hemispheres. \n \"We march today for the moral core of this nation, against which our new president is waging a war,\" actress America Ferrera told the Washington crowd. \"Our dignity, our character, our rights have all been under attack, and a platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday. But the president is not America. \u2026 We are America, and we are here to stay.\" \n Turnout in the capital was so heavy that the designated march route alongside the National Mall was impassable. Protesters were told to make their way to the Ellipse near the White House by way of other streets, triggering a chaotic scene that snarled downtown Washington. Long after the program had ended, groups of demonstrators were still marching and chanting in different parts of the city. \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer had no comment on the march except to note that there were no firm numbers for turnout because the National Park Service no longer provides crowd estimates. \n Around the world, women brandished signs with slogans such as \"Women won't back down\" and \"Less fear more love.\" They decried Trump's stand on such issues as abortion, health care, diversity and climate change. And they branded him a sexist, a bully, a bigot and more. \n \"We want a leader, not a creepy tweeter,\" some marchers chanted in Washington. \n In Chicago, organizers canceled the march portion of their event for safety reasons because of an overflow crowd that reached an estimated 250,000. People made their way through the streets on their own anyway. In New York, well over 100,000 marched past Trump's home at glittering Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. More than 100,000 also gathered on Boston Common, and a similar number demonstrated in Los Angeles. \n In Miami, real estate agent Regina Vasquez, 51, brought a sign saying \"Repeal and Replace Trump.\" \n \"I believe that strength is in the numbers, and that we should all come out and not make Trump the new normal,\" she said. \n All told, more than 600 \"sister marches\" were planned worldwide. Crowd estimates from police and organizers around the globe added up to well over a million. \n \"I feel very optimistic even though it's a miserable moment,\" said Madeline Schwartzman of New York City, who brought her twin 13-year-old daughters to the Washington rally. \"I feel power.\" \n Retired teacher Linda Lastella, 69, who came to Washington from Metuchen, New Jersey, said she had never marched before but felt the need to speak out when \"many nations are experiencing this same kind of pullback and hateful, hateful attitudes.\" \n \"It just seemed like we needed to make a very firm stand of where we were,\" she said. \n As the demonstrators rallied alongside the National Mall, Trump opened his first full day as president by attending a prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral, a tradition for the day after inauguration, and later visited the CIA. As he traveled around town, his motorcade passed large groups of protesters that would have been hard to miss. \n The Women's March on Washington appeared to accomplish the historic feat of drawing more people to protest the inauguration than the ceremony itself attracted. \n It far surpassed the 60,000 people who protested the Vietnam War at Richard Nixon's inauguration in 1973. Before Saturday, that was thought to be the largest such demonstration in inaugural history. \n Christopher Geldart, Washington's homeland security director, said the crowd exceeded the 500,000 that organizers told city officials to expect. The largest-ever demonstration in Washington, according to National Park Service crowd estimates, was an anti-Vietnam protest in 1969 that drew 600,000. \n The Million Man March in 1995 drew 400,000, according to the park service, which no longer estimates crowd sizes, in part because the organizers of that event accused the agency of lowballing the number and threatened to sue. \n The Washington rally was a peaceful counterpoint to the window-smashing unrest that unfolded on Friday when self-described anarchists tried to disrupt the inauguration. Police used pepper spray and stun grenades against the demonstrators. More than 200 people were arrested. \n Marlita Gogan, who came to Washington from Houston for the inauguration, said police advised her family not to wear their \"Make America Great Again Hats\" as they walked through crowds of protesters while playing tourist on Saturday. \n \"I think it's very oppressive,\" she said of the march atmosphere. \"They can have their day, but I don't get it.\" \n Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump, took to Twitter to thank the participants for \"standing, speaking and marching for our values.\" \n The marches displayed a level of enthusiasm that Clinton herself was largely unable to generate during her campaign against Trump, when she won the popular vote but was outdistanced in the Electoral College that decides the White House. \n The hand-knit \"pussyhats\" worn by many women served as a message of female empowerment, inspired by Trump's crude boast about grabbing women's genitals. They \"ain't for grabbing,\" actress Ashley Judd told the Washington crowd. \n The marches were a magnet for A-list celebrities, unlike Trump's inauguration, which had a deficit of top performers. \n Alicia Keys sang \"Girl on Fire\" for the Washington crowd. Madonna gave a fiery, profanity-laced address to the gathering. Cher, also in the nation's capital, said Trump's ascendance has people \"more frightened maybe than they've ever been.\" \n In Park City, Utah, it was Charlize Theron leading demonstrators in a chant of \"Love, not hate, makes America great.\" Actresses Helen Mirren and Cynthia Nixon and Whoopi Goldberg joined the crowd of protesters in New York. \n Tens of thousands of protesters squeezed into London's Trafalgar Square. In Paris, thousands rallied in the Eiffel Tower neighborhood in a joyful atmosphere, singing and carrying posters reading \"We have our eyes on you Mr. Trump\" and \"With our sisters in Washington.\" Hundreds gathered in Prague's Wenceslas Square in freezing weather, mockingly waving portraits of Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin. \n In Sydney, thousands of Australians gathered in solidarity in Hyde Park. One organizer said hatred, bigotry and racism are not only America's problems. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Over 1 million join anti-Trump women's marches worldwide"}

{"date": "January 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump speaks at the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Va. \n LANGLEY, Va. >> President Donald Trump moved to mend his tumultuous relationship with America's spy agencies Saturday, traveling to CIA headquarters on his first full day in office and assuring officials, \"I am so behind you.\" \n But the president quickly shifted from praise for the CIA to criticism of media coverage of Inauguration Day, in an unscripted address that overstated the size of the crowd that gathered on the National Mall as he took the oath of office. Trump said throngs \"went all the way back to the Washington monument,\" despite photos and live video showing the crowd stopping well short of the landmark. \n The president's media criticism came as he stood in front of a memorial honoring CIA officers killed while serving the United States. \n Trump's decision to visit CIA headquarters just outside of Washington was aimed at making a public gesture to the intelligence officials he disparaged during the transition. He had repeatedly challenged the agencies' assessment that Russia meddled in the presidential race to help him win and suggested intelligence officials were behind the leak of an unverified dossier that claimed Russia had collected compromising financial or personal information about him. \n During remarks to about 400 CIA officials, Trump denied that he had a feud with the intelligence community, saying it was \"exactly the opposite.\" He again blamed the media for creating that impression, despite the fact that he made numerous public statements critical of intelligence officials. \n \"There is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and CIA than Donald Trump,\" he said. \"There's nobody.\" \n The 45th president's inauguration has been shadowed by news reports that the CIA and other federal agencies are investigating Russian interference in the presidential election on behalf of Trump. The New York Times, citing anonymous officials, said agencies were examining intercepted communications and financial transactions between Russian officials and Trump's associates. \n FBI Director James Comey has declined to confirm or describe the nature of the government's investigation, both during a congressional hearing and in closed-door meetings with members of Congress. \n Saturday marked the end of three days of inaugural celebrations, with Trump and his family attending a national prayer service traditionally held for the new president. The president and his wife, Melania, and Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, sat in a front pew at Washington National Cathedral for the morning service. \n The interfaith service is a tradition for new presidents and is hosted by the Episcopal parish. But the decision to hold a prayer session for Trump sparked debate among Episcopalians opposed to his policies. \n Bishop Mariann Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington wrote in a blog post that while she shared \"a sense of outrage at some of the president-elect's words and actions,\" she felt an obligation to welcome all people without qualification, especially those who disagree and need to find a way to work together. \n The service took place as throngs of women, many of them wearing bright pink, pointy-eared hats, descended on the nation's capital and other cities around the world Saturday for marches organized to push back against the new president. The presidential motorcade sped past the protesters. \n Officials said the crowd in Washington for the women's march could be more than half a million people, more than double expectations. The event appeared to have attracted more people than Trump's inauguration, based on figures from transportation officials. \n Trump arrived at the cathedral mid-morning. The service included readings and prayers from Protestant, Jewish, Sikh, Mormon, Buddhist, Roman Catholic, Baha'i, Episcopal, Hindu and Native American leaders. But the program was remarkable for the large number of evangelicals participating, including two former presidents of the Southern Baptist Convention, the country's largest evangelical denomination. Several speakers had served as Trump advisers and supporters who spoke at the Republican National Convention. \n Trump, a Presbyterian, is not a regular churchgoer. He does not attend weekly services in New York, but worships every Christmas at a church near his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump courted evangelical voters during the presidential campaign and infused his inaugural address with references to God and quoted from the Bible's book of Psalms during a call for national unity. \n The president's family joined him at the White House for his first weekend in office. His daughter Ivanka and her husband, senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, were seen snapping photos Saturday on the Truman balcony with a young girl who appeared to be their daughter. \n The Justice Department released a memo concluding the president's \"special hiring authority\" allows the New York real estate mogul to appoint Kushner to the administration and the move does not contravene federal anti-nepotism laws. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump assures CIA officials: 'I am so behind you'"}

Some party-goers who rushed outside without picking up their coats suffered hypothermia in the 10 Fahrenheit degree cold. \n The fire evoked memories of the disaster at another Bucharest nightclub in October 2015, which killed 64 people\u2014 the worst nightclub fire in the country's history. \n Prosecutors have opened an inquiry into the Bamboo fire but there was no immediate word on its cause. \n Witness Corina Anghel told private television station Digi24 that people were smoking upstairs and the roof caught fire. She also said waiters served bottles of drinks with sparklers attached.

{"date": "January 21, 2017", "text": "U.S. ARMY VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. \n RALEIGH, N.C. >> A military court will weigh the real-world consequences of President Donald Trump's fiery rhetoric as Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl argues he can't get a fair trial under his new commander in chief. \n Minutes into the Republican president's term, lawyers for Bergdahl cited Trump's scathing criticism in a request to dismiss charges that Bergdahl endangered comrades by walking off his post in Afghanistan. The motion filed Friday argues Trump violated his due process rights by repeatedly calling him a traitor and suggesting ways he could be punished. \n The motion noted more than 40 instances of Trump's criticism at public appearances and in interviews through August 2016. \n \"Remember the old days? A deserter, what happened?\" Trump said while campaigning in July before pantomiming pulling a trigger and adding: \"Bang.\" \n Trump's negative comments take on new importance now that he is commander in chief. Legal scholar Rachel VanLandingham said she thinks it will be hard for potential jurors and others involved in the case to ignore what Trump has said because of the sheer repetition. \n \"Ingrained in military culture is the desire to serve and follow commanders' orders, and that what commanders say is right,\" said VanLandingham, a former Air Force lawyer who teaches at Southwestern Law School in California. \"And so that applies to the ultimate commander in chief. \u2026 They were made time after time after time, and I do think they are seared into the military psyche.\" \n Bergdahl's trial is scheduled for April at Fort Bragg on charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The latter carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. \n Bergdahl, who is from Idaho, has said he walked off his post in 2009 to cause an alarm and draw attention to what he saw as problems with his unit. \n He was held captive by the Taliban and its allies for five years. The Obama administration's decision in May 2014 to exchange Bergdahl for five Taliban prisoners prompted some Republicans to accuse Obama of jeopardizing the nation's safety. \n During his campaign, Trump made criticism of Bergdahl a staple of his campaign speeches, suggesting such outlandish punishments as returning him to the Middle East by throwing the soldier out of a plane without a parachute. \n At a December 2015 rally in Iowa, Trump said: \"Let's fly him over. We'll dump him right in the middle; throw him out of the plane. Should we give him a parachute or not? I say no.\" \n There is precedent for a military judge to decide a president's comments have tainted a prosecution. In 2013, a Navy judge cited comments by then-President Barack Obama when he said two defendants in sexual assault cases couldn't be punitively discharged if they were found guilty because of Obama's public comments about cracking down on sexual assault. \n Now, Bergdahl's lawyers say the question of whether Trump went too far is one of monumental importance to the military justice system. \n \"The circumstances require the military justice system to defend itself,\" the defense lawyers write. \"Administrations come and go, but the credibility of the system must remain the lodestar.\" \n Eric Carpenter, a former Army lawyer who teaches law at Florida International University, said dismissing the charges \"wouldn't be an unreasonable decision,\" but that military judges typically seek ways to keep cases moving. The judge could also give the defense wide leeway to challenge potential jurors or limit Bergdahl's punishment if convicted. \n VanLandingham said she believes dismissing the case would be the right thing to do. \n \"I think justice demands a dismissal. But do I think it's going to happen? No,\" she said. \n As to whether Trump's brashness could affect future cases, Carpenter said he expects the secretary of defense or military lawyer to give Trump advice on how to avoid comments that create problems for the military justice system. \n \"Time will tell whether Trump would respond to that advice,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Bergdahl case presents early legal test of Trump rhetoric"}

{"date": "January 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Women with bright pink hats and signs begin to gather early and are set to make their voices heard on the first full day of Donald Trump's presidency in Washington. Organizers of the Women's March on Washington expect more than 200,000 people to attend the gathering. Other protests are expected in other U.S. cities. \n WASHINGTON >> In a global exclamation of defiance and solidarity, more than 1 million people rallied at women's marches in the nation's capital and cities around the world Saturday to send President Donald Trump an emphatic message on his first full day in office that they won't let his agenda go unchallenged. \n \"Welcome to your first day, we will not go away!\" marchers in Washington chanted. \n Many of the women came wearing pink, pointy-eared \"pussyhats\" to mock the new president. Plenty of men joined in, too, contributing to surprising numbers everywhere from New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles to Mexico City, Paris, Berlin, London, Prague and Sydney. \n The Washington rally alone attracted over 500,000 people according to city officials \u2014 apparently more than Trump's inauguration drew on Friday. It was easily one of the biggest demonstrations in the city's history, and as night fell, not a single arrest was reported. \n The international outpouring served to underscore the degree to which Trump has unsettled people in both hemispheres. \n \"We march today for the moral core of this nation, against which our new president is waging a war,\" actress America Ferrera told the Washington crowd. \"Our dignity, our character, our rights have all been under attack, and a platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday. But the president is not America. \u2026 We are America, and we are here to stay.\" \n Turnout in the capital was so heavy that the designated march route alongside the National Mall was impassable. Protesters were told to make their way to the Ellipse near the White House by way of other streets, triggering a chaotic scene that snarled downtown Washington. Long after the program had ended, groups of demonstrators were still marching and chanting in different parts of the city. \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer had no comment on the march except to note that there were no firm numbers for turnout because the National Park Service no longer provides crowd estimates. \n Around the world, women brandished signs with slogans such as \"Women won't back down\" and \"Less fear more love.\" They decried Trump's stand on such issues as abortion, health care, diversity and climate change. And they branded him a sexist, a bully, a bigot and more. \n \"We want a leader, not a creepy tweeter,\" some marchers chanted in Washington. Others: \"Welcome to your first day, we will not go away!\" \n In Chicago, organizers canceled the march portion of their event for safety reasons because of an overflow crowd that reached an estimated 250,000. People made their way through the streets on their own anyway. In New York, well over 100,000 marched past Trump's home at glittering Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. More than 100,000 also gathered on Boston Common, and a similar number demonstrated in Los Angeles. \n In Miami, real estate agent Regina Vasquez, 51, brought a sign saying \"Repeal and Replace Trump.\" \n \"I believe that strength is in the numbers, and that we should all come out and not make Trump the new normal,\" she said. \n All told, more than 600 \"sister marches\" were planned worldwide. Crowd estimates from police and organizers around the globe added up to more than a million. \n \"I feel very optimistic even though it's a miserable moment,\" said Madeline Schwartzman of New York City, who brought her twin 13-year-old daughters to the Washington rally. \"I feel power.\" \n Retired teacher Linda Lastella, 69, who came to Washington from Metuchen, New Jersey, said she had never marched before but felt the need to speak out when \"many nations are experiencing this same kind of pullback and hateful, hateful attitudes.\" \n \"It just seemed like we needed to make a very firm stand of where we were,\" she said. \n As the demonstrators rallied alongside the National Mall, Trump opened his first full day as president by attending a prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral, a tradition for the day after inauguration, and later visited the CIA. As he traveled around town, his motorcade passed large groups of protesters that would have been hard to miss. \n The Women's March on Washington appeared to accomplish the historic feat of drawing more people to protest the inauguration than the ceremony itself attracted. \n It far surpassed the 60,000 people who protested the Vietnam War at Richard Nixon's inauguration in 1973. Before Saturday, that was thought to be the largest such demonstration in inaugural history. \n Christopher Geldart, Washington's homeland security director, said the crowd exceeded the 500,000 that organizers told city officials to expect. The largest-ever demonstration in Washington, according to National Park Service crowd estimates, was an anti-Vietnam protest in 1969 that drew 600,000. \n The Million Man March in 1995 drew 400,000, according to the park service, which no longer estimates crowd sizes, in part because the organizers of that event accused the agency of lowballing the number and threatened to sue. \n The Washington rally was a peaceful counterpoint to the window-smashing unrest that unfolded on Friday when self-described anarchists tried to disrupt the inauguration. Police used pepper spray and stun grenades against the demonstrators. More than 200 people were arrested. \n Marlita Gogan, who came to Washington from Houston for the inauguration, said police advised her family not to wear their \"Make America Great Again Hats\" as they walked through crowds of protesters while playing tourist on Saturday. \n \"I think it's very oppressive,\" she said of the march atmosphere. \"They can have their day, but I don't get it.\" \n Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump, took to Twitter to thank the participants for \"standing, speaking and marching for our values.\" \n The marches displayed a level of enthusiasm that Clinton herself was largely unable to generate during her campaign against Trump, when she won the popular vote but he outdistanced her in the electoral vote. \n The hand-knit \"pussyhats\" worn by many women served as a message of female empowerment, inspired by Trump's crude boast about grabbing women's genitals. \n They \"ain't for grabbing,\" actress Ashley Judd told the Washington crowd. \n The marches were a magnet for A-list celebrities, unlike Trump's inauguration, which had a deficit of top performers. \n Alicia Keys sang \"Girl on Fire\" for the Washington crowd. Madonna gave a fiery, profanity-laced address to the gathering. Cher, also in the nation's capital, said Trump's ascendance has people \"more frightened maybe than they're ever been.\" \n In Park City, Utah, it was Charlize Theron leading demonstrators in a chant of \"Love, not hate, makes America great.\" Actresses Helen Mirren and Cynthia Nixon and Whoopi Goldberg joined the crowd of protesters in New York. \n Tens of thousands of protesters squeezed into London's Trafalgar Square. In Paris, thousands rallied in the Eiffel Tower neighborhood in a joyful atmosphere, singing and carrying posters reading \"We have our eyes on you Mr. Trump\" and \"With our sisters in Washington.\" Hundreds gathered in Prague's Wenceslas Square in freezing weather, mockingly waving portraits of Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin. \n In Sydney, thousands of Australians gathered in solidarity in Hyde Park. One organizer said hatred, bigotry and racism are not only America's problems. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hundreds of thousands of women protest against Trump"}
