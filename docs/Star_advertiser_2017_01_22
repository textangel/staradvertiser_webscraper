{"date": "January 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A crowd fills Independence Avenue during the Women's March on Washington, Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017 in Washington. \n DENVER >> Deb Szeman, a self-described \"homebody,\" had never participated in a demonstration before hopping on an overnight bus from her home in Charlotte, North Carolina, to attend the women's march on Washington. \n She returned on another bus that pulled in at 4 a.m. Sunday, full of people buzzing about what might come next and quipping that they would see each other at the next march. \n \"I wouldn't have spent 18 hours in Washington, D.C., and taken the bus for seven hours both ways if I didn't believe there was going to be a part two, and three and four and five,\" said Szeman, 25, who works at a nonprofit and joined the National Organization for Women after Trump won the White House. \n \"I feel like there's been an awakening,\" she said. \n More than a million people turned out Saturday to nationwide demonstrations opposing President Donald Trump's agenda, a forceful showing that raised liberals' hopes after the election denied them control of all branches of federal government. Now, the question is whether that energy can be sustained and turned into political impact. \n From marches against the Iraq War in 2003 to Occupy Wall Street, several big demonstrations have not directly translated into real-world results. In Wisconsin, for example, tens of thousands stormed the state Capitol in 2011 to protest Gov. Scott Walker's moves to weaken unions. Walker has since been re-elected. \n Trump also won the state in November as Republicans increased their hold on the statehouse, part of the GOP's domination of state-level elections in recent years. \n Organizers of Saturday's marches are promising 10 additional actions to take during the first 100 days of Trump's presidency. So far, the first and only is for supporters to write to their senators or representatives. \n Groups scrambled so fast to arrange the massive demonstrations in only a few weeks that they have had limited time to determine how to channel the energy into additional action. But, they promise, it's coming. \n \"The left has really woken up and said, 'My gosh, we've been fighting the symbolic fight, but we haven't been fighting the institutional fight,'\" said Yong Jung-Cho of the activist group All of Us, which organized protests at the inauguration as well as the women's march. \n There's still value in symbolism. Saturday's immense crowds ruffled the new president as his press secretary falsely contended that Trump had broken a record on inauguration attendance. Jamie Henn of the climate action group 350.org said that reaction is a hint on how to build the movement. \n \"Size matters to this guy,\" Henn said. \"It's like dealing with a schoolyard bully and some of us need to go back to middle school and revisit what that's like\" as they think up new tactics. \n Saudi Garcia, a 24-year-old anthropology student at New York University, is a veteran of Black Lives Matter protests in New York. She rode to Washington with longtime, largely minority activists to block checkpoints to the inauguration. \n She was heartened to find herself in a very different crowd Saturday, which she described as largely white women, many of whom brought young children to the women's march. Garcia hopes those women stay involved in fighting Trump. \n \"We need to be like the tea party was in 2009,\" Garcia said. \"Those people were relentless \u2014 showing up at town council meetings, everywhere.\" \n Stan A. Veuger of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, co-authored a study of how the nationwide demonstrations that launched the tea party movement led to increased conservative political clout. \n Higher attendance at individual demonstrations correlated with more conservative voting by congressional members and a greater share of Republican votes in the 2010 election, when the GOP won back the House, he said. \n But, Veuger cautioned, it wasn't automatic. The tea party activists also went home and volunteered in local organizations that helped change the electoral results. \n \"Political protests can have an effect,\" he said. \"But there's nothing guaranteed.\" \n One positive sign for the left, he added, was that the women's marches seemed to draw an older crowd not deeply rooted in demonstrating \u2014 people who are more likely to volunteer, donate and vote. \n Beth Andre is one of them. Before the election, the 29-year-old who works in crisis services at a college had bought a ticket from her home in Austin, Texas, to Washington to watch what she thought would be Hillary Clinton's inauguration. \n After Trump won, she canceled the trip. She was heartbroken again when she realized that meant she could not attend the women's march. But a friend invited her to a meeting to plan a women's march in Austin instead. \n Andre has never been involved in a protest movement before. Still excited after Saturday's demonstration, she's planning to attend lobbying workshops by her local Democratic Party and is thinking of running for office. \n \"We want to be able to harness that energy and anger that we have right now and turn it into something good,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "After mass turnout, can protests turn into political impact?"}

And I think it may very well be a great moment in history.\" \n Trump's reassurance came after a day marked by global protests against his presidency and his own complaints about media coverage of his inauguration. He said his staff was in the White House not to \"help ourselves\" but to \"devote ourselves to the national good.\" \n Trump held up the letter left to him by his predecessor, Barack Obama \u2014 a White House tradition. \"It was really very nice of him to do that,\" Trump said. \"We will cherish that.\" He said the contents will remain private. \n Earlier Sunday, Trump offered a scattershot response to the sweeping post-inauguration protests a day earlier, sarcastically denigrating the public opposition and then defending demonstrators' rights a short time later. \n \"Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly,\" Trump tweeted early Sunday morning. Ninety-five minutes later, he struck a more conciliatory tone. \n \"Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views,\" the president tweeted, still using his personal account. \n The dueling tweets marked his administration's first response to the more than 1 million people who rallied at women's marches in Washington and cities across the world. Hundreds of protesters lined the street as Trump's motorcade drove past on Saturday afternoon, with many screaming and chanting. \n The Washington rally appeared to attract more people than attended Trump's inauguration on Friday, but there were no completely comparable numbers. Regional transportation officials tweeted on Sunday that 1,001,616 trips were taken on the rail system on Saturday. Metro spokesman Dan Stessel had said that on Friday, the day of Donald Trump's inauguration, just over 570,000 trips were taken on the rail system. \n Even suggestions of weak enthusiasm for his inauguration clearly irked the new president, and appeared to knock the White House off its footing as it took its earliest steps. \n On Sunday, Trump's spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who told his Cabinet that the call would cover the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Syria, Iran and other issues. Trump said the call was \"very nice\" but provided no details. \n Trump also announced that he's set up meetings with the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \n \"We're going to start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA,\" he said of his meeting with Mexico, along with immigration and security at the border. Trump has promised to build a wall along the length of the southern border and insisted that Mexico will pay for it. \n Trump had no plans to sign any executive orders on Sunday. But his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said on \"Fox News Sunday\" the president would spend his first full week in office undoing some of his predecessor's agenda and planned to sign executive orders on immigration and trade. \n Trump has pledged to scuttle trade deals such as a pending Asia-Pacific agreement and overturn Obama's executive order deferring deportations for 700,000 people who were brought into the country illegally as minors. \n Trump plans to meet Monday with a bipartisan group congressional leaders to discuss his agenda. \n Later in the week, he'll address congressional Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia and meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May. \n In talk show interviews Sunday, Trump's advisers defended his criticism of journalists for correctly reporting that his inauguration drew a smaller crowd President Barack Obama did eight years ago, saying the Trump administration was supplying \"alternative facts.\" \n \"There's no way to really quantify crowds. We all know that. You can laugh at me all you want,\" Kellyanne Conway told NBC's \"Meet The Press.\" She added: \"I think it's actually symbolic of the way we're treated by the press.\" \n Aides also made clear that Trump will not release his tax returns now that he's taken office, breaking with a decades-long tradition of transparency. Every president since 1976 has released the information, but Trump has said he doesn't believe Americans care whether he follows suit. \n Throughout the campaign, Trump refused to make his filings public, saying they're under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and he'd release them only once that review is complete. Tax experts and IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said such audits don't bar taxpayers from releasing returns. \n \"He's not going to release his tax returns. We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care,\" Conway said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \n Trump, whose 12th wedding anniversary was Sunday, also attended a reception for law enforcement officers and first responders who helped with his inauguration. He singled out the work of FBI Director James Comey, whom he offered a handshake and hug. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Reach Lerer on Twitter at http://twitter.com/llerer and Lemire at http://twitter.com/JonLemire \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump, amid combative start, pledges to rise to moment"}

{"date": "January 22, 2017", "text": "BANJUL, Gambia >> Exiled Gambian ruler Yahya Jammeh stole millions of dollars in his final weeks in power, plundering the country's state coffers and shipping luxury vehicles by cargo plane, a special adviser for the new president said Sunday. \n Meanwhile, a regional military force worked to secure the tiny West African nation so that the democratically elected president, Adama Barrow, could return home after taking the oath of office in neighboring Senegal on Thursday because of concerns for his safety. \n At a press conference in the Senegalese capital late Sunday, Barrow's special adviser Mai Ahmad Fatty told journalists that the president \"will return home as soon as possible.\" \n Underscoring the challenges facing the new administration, Fatty confirmed that Jammeh made off with more than $11.4 million during a two-week period alone. That is only what they have discovered so far after Jammeh and his family took an offer of exile after more than 22 years in power and departed late Saturday. \n \"The Gambia is in financial distress. The coffers are virtually empty. That is a state of fact,\" Fatty said. \"It has been confirmed by technicians in the ministry of finance and the Central Bank of the Gambia.\" \n Fatty also confirmed that a Chadian cargo plane had transported luxury goods out of the country on Jammeh's behalf in his final hours in power, including an unknown number of vehicles. \n Fatty said officials with the new government \"regret the situation\" and would stop any additional belongings of Jammeh from leaving Gambia. It appeared, though, that the major damage had been done, leaving the new government with little recourse to recoup the funds. \n The unpredictable Jammeh, known for startling declarations like his claim that bananas and herbal rubs could cure AIDS, went into exile under mounting international pressure, with a wave to supporters as soldiers wept. He is now in Equatorial Guinea, home to Africa's longest-serving ruler and not a state party to the International Criminal Court. \n Jammeh's dramatic about-face on his election loss to Barrow, at first conceding and then challenging the vote, appeared to be the final straw for the international community, which had been alarmed by his moves in recent years to declare an Islamic republic and leave the Commonwealth and the ICC. \n Barrow's adviser disavowed a joint declaration issued after Jammeh's departure by the United Nations, African Union and West African regional bloc ECOWAS that bestowed a number of protections upon Jammeh, his family and his associates \u2014 including the assurance that their lawful assets would not be seized. \n \"As far as we're concerned, it doesn't exist,\" Fatty said. \n The declaration also said Jammeh's exile was \"temporary\" and that he reserved the right to return to Gambia at the timing of his choosing. \n Although the declaration was written to provide Jammeh with maximum protection, it doesn't give him an amnesty, according to international human rights lawyer Reed Brody. \n \"Under international law in fact you can't amnesty certain crimes like torture and massive or systematic political killings,\" he said in an email. \"Depending where Jammeh ends up, though, the real obstacles to holding him accountable will be political.\" \n Barrow, who defeated Jammeh in December elections, would begin forming a Cabinet and working with Gambia's national assembly to reverse the state of emergency Jammeh declared in his final days in power, said Halifa Sallah, spokesman for the coalition backing the new leader. \n The president's official residence, State House, needs to be cleared of any possible hazards before Barrow arrives, Sallah added. \n A regional military force that had been poised to force out Jammeh if diplomatic efforts failed rolled into Gambia's capital, Banjul, on Sunday night to secure it for Barrow's arrival. \n Hundreds greeted the force's approach to State House, cheering and dancing, while some people grabbed soldiers to take selfies. \n The force will remain in the country \"until such time the security general situation is comprehensively redressed,\" Barrow said in a statement. \n Marcel Alain de Souza, chairman of the regional bloc, said part of Gambia's security forces needed to be \"immobilized,\" and he confirmed that Jammeh had had mercenaries by his side during the standoff. \n With Jammeh gone, a country that had waited in silence during the standoff sprang back to life. Shops and restaurants opened, music played and people danced in the streets. \n As he waited for the arrival of the regional force in Banjul, defense chief Ousmane Badjie said the military welcomed it \"wholeheartedly.\" With proper orders, he said, he would open the doors to the notorious prisons where rights groups say many who have disappeared over the years may be kept. \n \"We are going to show Barrow we are really armed forces with a difference, I swear to God,\" Badjie said. \"I have the Quran with me.\" \n Some of the 45,000 people who had fled the tiny country during the crisis began to return. The nation of 1.9 million, which promotes itself to overseas tourists as \"the Smiling Coast of Africa,\" has been a major source of migrants heading toward Europe because of the situation at home. \n \"I think it will be safer now,\" said 20-year-old Kaddy Saidy, who was returning to Banjul with her three young children. \n Barrow, who has promised to reverse many of Jammeh's actions, told The Associated Press on Saturday he will launch a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate alleged human rights abuses of Jammeh's regime. \n \"After 22 years of fear, Gambians now have a unique opportunity to become a model for human rights in West Africa,\" Amnesty International's deputy director for West and Central Africa, Steve Cockburn, said in a statement Sunday. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Gambia's ex-leader made off with millions, luxury cars"}

Rain and snow have swamped California during a wet winter that has brought relief after years of drought. \n Flash flood watches and warnings were in effect for swaths of greater Los Angeles, where mountain locations could see up to 6 inches of rain. \n Authorities ordered evacuations near wildfire burn areas in Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and Orange counties. Officials said potential debris flows could restrict access for emergency responders. \n Some residents refused to leave, but Ralph Olivas loaded up his family and their dog and left his home in Duarte, nestled in scenic foothills east of Los Angeles that were left bare by wildfires last June. Recent rain sent rocks down steep streets where homeowners built protective barriers out of lumber and sandbags. \n \"We're packing and leaving because the muds are coming, the mudslides,\" he told Los Angeles news station KCAL-TV, adding that the risk \"comes with the territory living up here.\" \n In northern Los Angeles County, about 120 residents near burn areas of Santa Clarita were ordered to leave late Saturday. During another storm Friday, raging floodwaters overflowed a creek and sent a sheriff's cruiser floating down a street. \n Farther north, strong thunderstorms packing heavy rain and possible hail were expected to hit the San Francisco Bay Area. Wine country communities that already experienced destructive flooding this month faced flash flood warnings. Wind gusts brought down trees across Northern California. \n In Mendocino County, a massive oak toppled onto an apartment in the city of Ukiah early Saturday, crushing the building and killing a woman as she lay in her bed, fire officials told the Press Democrat newspaper of Santa Rosa.

Michael Jones said there were 89 cases of blown roofs with varying degrees of severity, 37 downed trees, six reports of arcing wires and 12 power line issues. \n \"Peak intensity was kind of from late afternoon yesterday through the night\" with the worst of the gusts tapering off around noon today, Jones said. \n Most of the calls required a single company response for damage that included portions of entire roofs coming off. In a few cases, photovoltaic and other solar panels came partially or completely loose. \n In one instance, the American Red Cross was called to assist a homeowner, Jones said. \n Cionita Salvador fretted through the night about the house-shaking wind that tore off roof sheeting at her home on Ala Iolani Place in Moanalua Valley. \n \"It was just a nightmare.

{"date": "January 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Radford Takashima works on a solar panel installation on a roof in Honolulu. California, Hawaii, Oregon, New York and many other Democratic-leaning states have ambitious goals to wean themselves off fossil fuels, but they rely heavily on federal grants, tax credits and research to support their efforts, programs that could evaporate or be cut significantly in the new administration. \n President Donald Trump has disputed climate change, pledged a revival of coal and disparaged wind power, and his nominee to head the Energy Department was once highly skeptical of the agency's value. What this means for states' efforts to promote renewable energy is an open question. \n States that are pushing for greater reliance on wind and solar power are not quite sure what to expect as Trump takes over. Many of them depend heavily on federal renewable-energy tax credits, grants and research, much of which comes from the Energy Department. \n Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Trump's pick to lead the department, presents a contradictory figure: A Texas oil promoter, he also oversaw a huge expansion of wind-energy production while governor. When he ran for president in 2011, he included Energy on a list of departments he thought should be abolished, though he disavowed the idea Thursday at his Senate confirmation hearing. \n \"We don't know what version of Perry is going to show up,\" said Michael Webber, deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas, Austin. \n Renewable energy accounts for about 15 percent of the electricity generated in the United States. And 29 states have set targets for boosting their reliance on such power. \n Officials, experts and advocates in more than a half-dozen states with some of the most ambitious goals told The Associated Press that they are on course to meet their targets. Most said that while Trump policies could slow the expansion, they won't stop it. \n The price of harnessing the power of the sun and wind has dropped so much that in many areas of the country, experts say it could be competitive with traditional power sources such as coal and natural gas even without federal subsidies. Further, they do not expect a fast repeal of the key federal tax credits that have propelled the industry for years. \n Still, policies aimed at bringing more renewable power online quickly are not expected while Trump is in office. \n \"We need to be moving faster, not slower,\" said Jeff Forward, president of the trade group Renewable Energy Vermont. \"I fear we're tapping on the brakes right now.\" \n Those who promote renewable energy are concerned because Trump has expressed doubts about whether climate change is real, even though scientists agree that it is happening and that the burning of fossil fuels is a major reason for it. \n Trump also has called for reviving the coal industry, which has struggled in part because of the rise of renewable energy. And he has criticized wind turbines near Palm Springs, California, both for killing birds and for looking like a \"junkyard.\" \n Perry, at his confirmation hearings, said he believes climate change is happening and that some of it is caused by human activity. He also said he favors an \"all of the above\" energy policy, the way he did in Texas, and wants the federal government to continue research on renewable energy. He didn't say what he thought of green-energy tax credits and other incentives. \n The federal wind credit is set to be phased out in 2019, and the solar one, four years after that. Those incentives and other federal spending on renewable energy in fiscal year 2015 totaled about $10 billion, nearly twice as much as similar subsidies for fossil fuels. \n In Hawaii, federal tax credits reduced the price for developers and homeowners by about $125 million annually from 2011 to 2014, according to an analysis by Blue Planet Foundation. During that time, the portion of the state's electricity coming from renewables nearly doubled from 12 to 21 percent. \n Randy Iwase, chairman of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission, said incentives are important to the state's goal of having 100 percent of its power generated from renewable sources by 2045, the nation's most aggressive target. \n \"We are in a toddler stage,\" he said. \"When you lose focus, when attention is distracted, when you make it less of a priority, the toddler kind of wobbles.\" \n The Energy Department said in a report last year that the cost of getting power from wind fell more than 40 percent from 2008 to 2015, and solar panel prices dropped more than 60 percent in that period. \n Market forces have made green power big in Republican-led states, with wind turbines springing up along the Great Plains from Iowa to Texas. In those places \u2014 many of which have low or no green-energy requirements \u2014 the arguments for renewable power are more often cost savings and job creation, rather than the environmental benefits. \n In December, Republican Gov. John Kasich of Ohio vetoed a bill that would have delayed the requirements there. This month, Phil Scott, the new GOP governor in Vermont, affirmed his commitment to Vermont's goal of 90 percent green power by 2050. \n Meanwhile, some Democratic-leaning states have been pushing their requirements upward.

{"date": "January 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Sulome Anderson, journalist and daughter of former American hostage Terry Anderson pauses with while looking through memorabilia, at her home in New York. \n NEW YORK >> She tried drugs. She tried arguing. She tried writing a book. After a quarter century, the daughter of the longest-held American hostage during Lebanon's civil war says she's found her father's love. And it took coming face-to-face with one of his captors to do it. \n \"I was searching and searching and this search, the journey, brought me closer to my father,\" said Sulome Anderson, a Brooklyn journalist whose father, Terry Anderson, was seized by Shiite kidnappers in Beirut in 1985 and held until 1991. \"I love my dad very much. My dad has always loved me. I just didn't know that because he wasn't able to show it to me.\" \n Her recently published book, \"The Hostage's Daughter,\" chronicles what happened after she met her father for the first time, at age 6, after his release from his long imprisonment. Anderson, then the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, was among around 100 foreign hostages taken during the war. \n Sulome Anderson said she expected him to be a \"superman\" as a young child. Real life was more turbulent. Before she turned 10, the two were having screaming fights. \n \"One of the problems that we had after I came home was communication,\" Terry Anderson said in a telephone interview from his Orange, Virginia, home. \"I was not able to express my feelings well and of course she was a very small girl in a very confusing and often scary world. So we didn't really connect very well.\" \n Sulome, now 31, said she escaped into drugs and depression for years, growing so distant from her father that they went weeks and months without speaking. \n They became more estranged as Terry Anderson and his wife, Sulome Anderson's mother, divorced. Sulome Anderson hated when he married a horse trainer only six years older than herself. At the peak of her rebelliousness, she cranked up the volume of the song \"Gold Digger\" by Kanye West, a passive aggressive message to the wife of a man who received tens of millions of dollars after suing Iran. The money, through bad investments, eventually disappeared. The new marriage fell apart. \n Sulome said her father gave her a Rolex after she graduated from New York University with a 3.7 grade point average, but she pawned it for drugs within a month. She attempted suicide three times. \n Her climb out of darkness began after learning she suffered from borderline personality disorder. \n By 2009, she had given up plans to be an actress and decided to become a journalist. Before long, she headed to Lebanon, her mother's birthplace, and began trying to reconstruct the events surrounding the Lebanese hostage crisis that tore her family apart. \n The trail she followed led her to a Hezbollah official in one of the southern towns near the Israeli border. \n That man revealed himself to have been one of her father's teenage captors. Sitting in a room with the man's wife and children, she confronted him, and then forgave him. \n Terry Anderson said he was amazed at the encounter. \n \"I was just astounded that she found somebody who had been there on the other side and interviewed him, which I thought took a fair amount of guts,\" he said, adding that he'd never discouraged the pursuit. \n \"I think she did some extraordinary things, went on a very difficult personal journey, but also accomplished a pretty important piece of journalism doing it,\" said Anderson, now 69 and retired. \"She's is now a better journalist than I ever was.\" \n He said he'd been scared for his daughter as she pursued her career, but he never tried to interrupt her journey. \n In the book, Sulome Anderson tells of nearly entering Syria last year to report on developments there when an FBI agent warned her intelligence officials believed her life was in danger. She didn't go. \n Terry Anderson said his daughter had not told her in advance of that trip \"because I would have screamed and hollered.\" \n \"We seem to have moved up an entire level in evil since my day,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ex-hostage's daughter finds dad's love by meeting his captor"}

{"date": "January 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., speaks during the first day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. \n BOSTON >> He's heir to a famed political family that traces its roots back to Boston's bare-knuckled campaigns when Democratic ward bosses kept a close ear to the city's narrow streets and tenement hallways. \n Massachusetts Congressman Joe Kennedy says contemporary party leaders could take a page from that history by listening harder to the economic worries of Democratic voters who bolted the party in November. \n It's not always an easy message for Democrats still reeling from Donald Trump's win to hear, especially in a state that handed Hillary Clinton a 27-point margin. \n But Kennedy said Democrats have little choice. \n \"There was a message sent on this Election Day where many voters that had traditionally come back home to the Democratic Party didn't,\" Kennedy told The Associated Press. \"I think not taking the time to ask the question why, to listen to their response, and to try to understand why we lost some folks that had been in support of Democratic candidates and the Democratic Party for so long is folly.\" \n Kennedy said Democrats can do that while also sticking to their progressive roots, including standing up for \"people that feel marginalized and voiceless.\" \n \"We've got a proud history of that and we should never back away from that,\" he said. \"You can do that while also recognizing there are an awful lot of people in our country hurting and that we have to do a better job addressing the economic needs of working class and middle class voters.\" \n Kennedy \u2014 the grandson of Attorney General Robert Kennedy and grandnephew of President John F. Kennedy \u2014 said he's willing to work with Republicans, emulating the political deal-making his great-uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy, used to build coalitions across party lines. \n Kennedy said there are few other options for a member of a minority party in an institution where bills need Republican support to pass. \n \"You've got to fight, but you've got to also try to move an agenda forward,\" he said. \"If you're just out there screaming and yelling, there are people out there who need help and need help now and they deserve progress, too.\" \n Kennedy's pragmatism was also at the root of his decision to attend the Trump inauguration out of respect for the presidency, while dozens of other House Democrats refused. \n His more measured tone contrasts to others in the party like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has positioned herself as a top political foil to President Trump. \n Kennedy's 4th Congressional District is a microcosm of Massachusetts, encompassing communities like Newton where Trump got just 17 percent of the vote to Rehoboth, where Trump received 53 percent. \n One of the biggest political questions in Massachusetts politics is where Kennedy may be headed in the future. \n For now, all he'll say is he's planning to run for a third term in 2018. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. Rep.

{"date": "January 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Ajani Russell poses with her artwork \"Female Figures\" prior to the Animated Women symposium at California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia, Calif. \n SANTA CLARITA, Calif. >> The California Institute of the Arts was created partly by Walt Disney's desire to bring more top-flight animators into the profession. And it has during its 47 years, though for a long time almost all were men. \n Now, nearly three-quarters of CalArts' more than 250 animation students are women, and there's a new goal: ensure that when they land jobs, they get to draw female characters reflective of the real world and not just the nerds, sex bombs, tomboys or ugly villains who proliferate now. \n \"Male villains, for example, can be any shape or size. But female villains are usually in their menopausal or postmenopausal phases. They're older, they're single, they're angry,\" said Erica Larsen-Dockray, who teaches a class on \"The Animated Woman\" for CalArts' experimental animation program. \n \"Then you have the innocent princess,\" she added with a chuckle, \"whose waist is so small that if she was actually alive, she wouldn't be able to walk.\" \n To call attention to that cartoonish reality, CalArts has played host the past two years to \"The Animated Woman Symposium on Gender Bias.\" This year it focused on the roles of \"Sidekicks, Nerd Girls, Tomboys and More.\" \n During a recent raucous two-hour symposium, nearly a dozen student researchers who spent months watching cartoons and reading comic books questioned why almost all female sidekicks look like nerds. Also why female heroes like Kim Possible are over-the-top beautiful. And why there are so few gay, lesbian and transgender characters. \n \"What are nerd-girl stereotypes? They have glasses, they're shy, they're awkward, they have some freckles going on,\" said film-video student and artist Madison Stubbs as she flashed drawings of several, including two of the most popular: Velma from \"Scooby-Doo\" and Meg Griffin of \"Family Guy.\" \n \"And we have Tootie from 'Fairly OddParents,'\" Stubbs said of the long-running Nickelodeon cartoon show's pig-tailed, braces-wearing, bespectacled sidekick. \"Basically, she's just in the show to go, 'Oh, Timmy. I want you. Why do you ignore me?'\" \n Not that all female cartoon sidekicks are unattractive. \n Velma could be the \"hot girl,\" Stubbs said, if only she would lose those nerdy glasses. But every time she does, she trips over stuff, walks into things and nearly upends another paranormal investigation by those meddling kids from Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated. \n Kim Possible, who couples her intellect with martial-arts skills to scuttle nefarious Dr. Drakken's plans to take over the world, has her own problems. Unable to attract any handsome, smart guy, she ultimately settles for her nerdy male sidekick, Ron Stoppable. \n There's a reason for such drawings and scenarios, said Marge Dean, president of the industry group Women in Animation: Men still fill animation's writing rooms and director's chairs. \n \"Many, many, many women are going to animation schools. At CalArts, it's over 70 percent. But yet if you start looking at women in creative roles, the last number we have is only 22 percent,\" said Dean, whose organization tracks figures through schools and industry groups. \n In an effort to boost those numbers, CalArts faculty invites studio representatives to campus for events like portfolio days and maintains a close relationship with groups like Dean's, which is pushing the studios to have a creative workforce of half women and half men by 2025. \n CalArts, with a student enrollment of nearly 1,500, offers graduate and undergraduate degrees in such fields as animation, art, music, film, acting, photography and others. The small school situated amid picturesque rolling hills some 30 miles north of Los Angeles has produced many of the entertainment industry's leading creative figures, including director Tim Burton and Oscar-winning animator and Disney-Pixar executive John Lasseter. \n Other alumni, including Brad Bird, Andrew Stanton and Pete Docter, have directed nine of the 15 Oscar-winning animated feature films since that category was created in 2002. Only two of those 15 films had female directors. Both of them, Brenda Chapman and Jennifer Lee, are CalArts graduates. \n Dean believes the character landscape will change as the popularity of animation continues to grow. Three of last year's top 10 box office films were animated \u2014 \"Finding Dory,\" \"Zootopia\" and \"The Secret Life of Pets.\" \n None were directed by women, although Lee, who wrote and co-directed the 2013 Oscar-winning film \"Frozen,\" had a writing credit on \"Zootopia.\" \n To make real change, students entering the animated world must demand it, said Stacey Simmons of the production company Stoopid Buddy Stoodios. \n \"The only way you're going to change it is to keep doing it,\" she said. \"The industry itself has changed a lot, but it has not changed at the same rate the country has.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "No more nerds, sex bombs: Female animators draw away clich\u00e9s"}
