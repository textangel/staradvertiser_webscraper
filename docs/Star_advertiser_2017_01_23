{"date": "January 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Comcast Corp. CEO Brian Roberts spoke during The Cable Show 2013 convention in Washington on June 11, 2013. \n PHILADELPHIA >> Despite a threat from cable giant Comcast to take legal action, Philadelphia has banned employers from asking potential hires to provide their salary history, a move supporters say is a step toward closing the wage gap between men and women. \n Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney signed the measure on Monday, and said he's confident the bill can withstand legal challenges. \n \"I know that Comcast and the business community are committed to ending wage discrimination, and I'm hopeful that moving forward we can have a better partnership on this and other issues of concern to business owners and their employees,\" he said. \"This doesn't need to be an either/or argument \u2014 what is good for the people of Philadelphia is good for business, too.\" \n Comcast and the city's Chamber of Commerce have said the law goes too far in dictating how employers can interact with potential workers. \n The City Council unanimously passed the ordinance in December. Supporters contend that since women have historically been paid less than men, the practice of asking for a salary history can help perpetuate a cycle of lower salaries for women, continuing throughout their careers. \n Women in Pennsylvania are paid 79 cents for every dollar a man earns, according to a 2015 Census Bureau report. For black and Hispanic women, the pay gap is even wider. \n Democratic City Councilman Bill Greenlee, who sponsored Philadelphia's bill, said he was inspired by a Massachusetts pay equity bill signed into law last summer that included a ban on asking for salary history. \n \"It's reasonable to think if you take this question out of the equation it could help lessen wage inequality, and it's worth a chance,\" Greenlee said. \"We're trying to ensure fairness.\" \n However, Comcast and the Chamber of Commerce see the bill as yet another hassle in bringing business to Philadelphia. \n \"The wage equity ordinance as written is an overly broad impediment to businesses seeking to grow their workforce in the City of Philadelphia,\" Rob Wonderling, president and CEO of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, wrote in an opinion piece to a city business journal this month, adding it \"infringes upon an employer's ability to gain important information during the hiring process.\" \n Comcast had urged the mayor to veto the bill or face legal challenges, according to a legal memo obtained by The Philadelphia Inquirer earlier this month. The memo said the law would violate employers' First Amendment rights to ask potential hires about their salary history. \n Comcast referred questions to the Chamber of Commerce for this story. Neither responded to requests for comment after the mayor signed the bill. \n David Cohen, a senior Comcast vice president, told the newspaper on Jan. 10 the bill was stoking frustrations in the city's business community about increased regulations coming from City Hall. He said the policy doesn't make sense in \"corporate America\" and pondered how companies would know what to pay top executives without past salary knowledge. \n Since the Massachusetts bill was signed, similar legislation has been picking up speed around the country, said Maya Raghu, director of workplace equality at the National Women's Law Center in Washington, D.C. \n \"For lawmakers, it is something that you can easily understand, thinking back to your first jobs and how those salaries impacted you,\" she said. \n Similar salary history bans have been introduced in New Jersey, and the city councils of New York City and Pittsburgh as well as the District of Columbia. In November, New York City stopped asking applicants for municipal jobs what they currently earn, and earlier this month Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order banning state entities from asking about pay history. Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate to Congress, has sponsored similar legislation in Congress. \n The Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce ended up backing the Massachusetts legislation after lots of meetings and some tweaks to the bill, said Jim Rooney, president and CEO of the group. Employers are allowed to ask candidates what their salary expectations are, and candidates are free to reveal their past salary, as with the Philadelphia bill. \n \"'What are your salary expectations?' is a powerful question, and it lets you be within law,\" he said. \n Victoria Budson, executive director of the Women and Public Policy Program at the Harvard Kennedy School, says many steps are needed in order to close the wage gap, including educating employees and employers and understanding what a job is worth in a particular labor market. \n \"This provision won't close the wage gap, but it's an important piece in helping close it,\" she said. \"You're not allowed to ask someone's marital status or if they are planning to have children. We have a long standing history of things not to ask an employee. This would just be one thing added to that.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philadelphia bars employers from requesting salary history"}

Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., responds to a lawmakers question during during his confirmation hearing before the Assembly Special Committee on the Office of the Attorney General in Sacramento, Calif. \n SACRAMENTO, Calif. >> In their first official action since Donald Trump became president, California lawmakers on Monday confirmed a new attorney general who has vowed to defend the state's liberal policies against the Trump administration and a Republican Congress. \n Xavier Becerra easily cleared the final hurdle to become the state's top law enforcement official, with a 26-9 vote along party lines in the Democratic-controlled state Senate. Becerra, who represented the Los Angeles area in the U.S. House for more than two decades, will be the state's first Latino attorney general. \n Democrats said Becerra will fight to defend California's protections for the gay and lesbian community, women and immigrants. \n \"He will be a very strong partner for our state to work with the federal government when we can and to resist when we must,\" said Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, a Los Angeles Democrat. \n Some Republicans said they voted against him because of his promise to challenge federal policies. Republican Sen. John Moorlach of Costa Mesa says he's worried Becerra will jeopardize billions of dollars in federal funding by antagonizing the Trump administration. \n Democrats in the Assembly approved Becerra's confirmation earlier this month. Becerra worked as a deputy attorney general for three years before winning an Assembly seat in 1990. \n He will replace Kamala Harris, who was elected to the U.S. Senate in November. \n Many of California's liberal policies face an uncertain future amid promises by Trump and Republican lawmakers to overhaul the nation's health care, immigration and climate change laws. \n \"Our state has the law, the grit and the guts to fight for hardworking families,\" Becerra told lawmakers at a hearing earlier this month, later adding, \"I think the best defense is a good offense.\" \n The day of Trump's inauguration, the White House was already at odds with the country's most populous state over climate change policy. The White House website said Friday that Trump planned to stop former President Barack Obama's climate action plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming. \n The same day, California regulators plowed ahead with their own climate change goals, releasing a 157-page plan to reach a target of a 40 percent reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2030. \n Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown has called Becerra \"battle-tested\" from his time in a polarized Congress and said his experience will serve him well in defending California's policies. \n In addition to confirming Becerra, Legislative leaders have taken their own steps to challenge the new White House administration. The day after Trump was elected president, de Leon and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon issued a joint statement rejecting Trump's campaign message. \n \"While Donald Trump may have won the presidency, he hasn't changed our values,\" they said. \"We will lead the resistance to any effort that would shred our social fabric or our Constitution.\" \n Earlier this month, they hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to advise them on a legal strategy as they prepare to clash with the Trump administration. Holder's firm will be paid $25,000 a month plus expenses from the Legislature's budget to help lawmakers develop strategies \"regarding potential actions of the federal government that may be of concern to the state of California,\" according to the contract with Holder. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "California confirms Trump opponent as attorney general"}

Bush is still suffering from pneumonia, but is well enough to leave the intensive care unit at a Houston hospital, doctors said Monday. His wife, Barbara, has been discharged from the same facility after completing treatment for bronchitis. \n The 92-year-old former president was struggling to breathe when he was admitted to the Houston Methodist Hospital Jan. 14. Last week, he was breathing with the aid of a ventilator in the ICU, but doctors removed the breathing tube on Friday and by Monday were talking about the possibility that he could return home soon. \n Dr. Amy Mynderse said at a news conference that the former president is \"sitting up, watching TV and is waiting anxiously for his favorite oyster stew for lunch.\" \n \"He's on minimal oxygen, joking and laughing with the nurses and doctors,\" she said. \n Dr. Clint Doerr said Bush was still coughing \"a fair amount\" but that if he continues to improve, he could be discharged from the hospital by Friday or over the weekend. \n \"He's excited to get home and he's feeling well,\" Mynderse said, describing Bush as \"not your average 92-year-old.\" \n Mynderse said when she told Bush he was being released from intensive care, he asked her: \"Can I just go home?\" \n Meanwhile, former first lady Barbara Bush, 91, who was admitted to the facility for treatment of bronchitis on Wednesday, is \"back to her normal self,\" Mynderse said. Mrs. Bush was told she could return home Sunday, but she opted to stay one more night to fully recover and remain close to her husband, according to family spokesman Jim McGrath. \n The couple's 72-year marriage is the longest of any presidential couple in U.S. history, and the doctors said they have been a great support to each other. \n \"They truly do have just such an amazing love for each other and that really came across here,\" Mynderse said, adding that Barbara Bush spent much her hospital stay by her husband's side. \n \"Part of why she ended up, I think, in the hospital was because even though she was ill, she was trying to be by his bedside all the time.\" \n Doerr said: \"They're essentially therapy for each other.

{"date": "January 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n FCC commissioner Ajit Pai presents his dissent during a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) hearing at the FCC in Washington. \n NEW YORK >> President Donald Trump has picked a fierce critic of the Obama-era \"net neutrality\" rules to be chief regulator of the nation's airwaves and internet connections. \n In a statement Monday, Ajit Pai said he was grateful to the president for choosing him as the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. Several reports last week had said he was the pick. \n Pai had been one of the two Republican commissioners on a five-member panel that regulates the country's communications infrastructure, including TV, phone and internet service. \n There are currently just three members on the panel. The Republicans' new majority at the FCC, along with their control of Congress and the White House, is expected to help them roll back policies applauded by consumer advocates that upset many phone and cable industry groups, including net neutrality rules that bar internet service providers from favoring some websites and apps over others. \n Pai, an active Twitter user, posted Monday that \"there is so much we can do together to bring the benefits of the digital age to all Americans and to promote innovation and investment.\" \n AN INDUSTRY-FRIENDLY FCC \n Pai has long maintained that the FCC under former Chairman Thomas Wheeler had overstepped its bounds, suggesting that he would steer the agency in a direction more favorable to big phone and cable companies. In a December speech, he expressed confidence that the 2015 net neutrality rules would be undone and said the FCC needed to take a \"weed whacker\" to what he considered unnecessary regulations that hold back investment and innovation. \n Consumer advocates have been concerned that a deregulation-minded FCC could potentially allow more huge mergers, overturn new protections for internet users and lead to higher costs for media and technology companies that rely on the internet to reach consumers. \n Pai opposed online privacy regulations that force broadband providers to ask consumers for permission before using their data, saying they are more onerous than the requirements for internet companies like Google and Facebook. \n He voted against approving Charter Communication's $67 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and a smaller company, Bright House \u2014 not because he opposed the merger, but because he thought some of the conditions required by the FCC, like barring data caps on home internet service, amounted to government meddling in business. \n The cable industry's trade group, the NCTA, supported Pai in a statement Monday that said he has a \"common-sense philosophy that consumers are best served by a robust marketplace that encourages investment, innovation and competition.\" Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group, said Pai had a \"history of attacking consumer protections\" and urged him to keep the FCC's recent initiatives intact. \n The Internet Association, a trade group that represents tech and video companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix, had said last week that while Pai doesn't always side with the internet industry, \"he is both thoughtful and willing to listen.\" \n TO COME: PAI VS. THE ZERO RATING, MORE MERGERS? \n Pai also criticized an FCC report on \"zero rating\" earlier this month, characterizing it as a meaningless document that won't influence the FCC under Trump. The report, issued in the last days of the Obama administration, took issue with the way companies like AT&T and Verizon exempted their own video services from wireless data caps, effectively making them cheaper to stream on phones and tablets than rival services such as Netflix. \n Future big media and telecom mergers may get a friendlier review under a Pai-led FCC. Pai voted to approve AT&T's 2015 acquisition of DirecTV. And while he told The Wall Street Journal in December 2013 that the Obama administration was likely to oppose Comcast's failed effort to acquire Time Warner Cable \u2014 he was right \u2014 he added that a Republican administration would be more likely to approve it. \n The FCC currently has a 2-1 Republican majority and two empty seats, which will be filled by one Republican and one Democrat. \n Pai, an Indian-American from Kansas, has been an FCC commissioner since 2012. During his roughly 15 years in government, he's been a Senate staffer and worked at the FCC and the Justice Department. He was also a lawyer for Verizon and an attorney at the law firm Jenner & Block. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'Net neutrality' foe Ajit Pai is new FCC head"}

Spicer answered questions about prescriptions drug costs, trade and President Donald Trump's schedule among other topics. \n NEW YORK >> White House press secretary Sean Spicer told a roomful of reporters that \"our intention is never to lie to you,\" although sometimes the Trump administration may \"disagree with the facts.\" \n Spicer's first full press briefing was closely watched today following a weekend statement about President Donald Trump's inauguration audience that included incorrect assertions. After White House counselor Kellyanne Conway received wide social media attention for her explanation that Spicer had presented \"alternative facts,\" today's briefing was televised live on CNN, Fox News Channel, MSNBC and, for a time, even ABC. \n Meanwhile, ABC announced that anchor David Muir would interview Trump for a one-hour prime-time special to air at 10 p.m. EST Wednesday. \n Spicer tried to defuse tension by opening with a self-deprecating joke about his lack of popularity, and his 78-minute session was wide-ranging and mostly substantive. He corrected one disputed statement from Saturday, defended another and expressed some frustration regarding how the new Trump administration feels about its news coverage. \n Asked for a pledge not to lie, Spicer assented, saying, \"I believe we have to be honest with the American people.\" He said he had received incorrect information about Inauguration day ridership on the Washington Metro system when he initially claimed the system was used more Friday than for Barack Obama's 2013 inauguration. \n \"There are times when you tweet something out or write a story and you publish a correction,\" he said. \"That doesn't mean you were trying to deceive readers or the American people, does it? I think we should be afforded the same opportunity.\" \n Spicer didn't back down from his claim that Trump's inauguration was the most-seen ever, clarifying that he was including people who watched online. The ceremony didn't have the highest TV ratings and aerial photographs indicate the live crowd wasn't as big as it was for Obama's first swearing-in, but there are no reliable crowd estimates or numbers indicating how many people across the world watched the ceremony online. \n He expressed frustration about an erroneous report, later corrected, stating that a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. had been removed from a room in the White House following Trump's inauguration. \n \"Where was the apology to the president of the United States?\" Spicer said. \"Where was the apology to the millions of people who thought that it was racially insensitive?\" \n One reporter said Spicer had accepted an apology from the news outlet that made the mistake in a pool report. \n Spicer would not say whether he was ordered by Trump or other staffers to make Saturday's statement, but explained some of the thinking that went into it. Like countless White House staffs before them, the Trump team is exasperated about \"negative\" and \"demoralizing\" coverage. \n \"When we're right, say we're right,\" he said. \"When we're wrong, say we're wrong. But it's not always wrong and negative.\" \n Spicer broke with the White House tradition of opening briefings with a question from The Associated Press. The AP was traditionally given the first question because it is a broad-based news cooperative that represents the largest swath of American newspapers, broadcasters and other kinds of news organizations. \n Instead, Spicer initially called on a reporter from the New York Post, and he took questions from several news organizations that were rarely called on during the previous administration. He said four seats in the briefing room would be kept open for out-of-town reporters to participate via Skype. \n The new press secretary \u2014 who took no questions Saturday \u2014 drew a laugh when he said he'd stay at the podium for as long as the reporters wanted him there, and he nearly did. \n \"I want to make sure we have a healthy relationship,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "White House press secretary: 'Our intention is never to lie'"}

The tail end of a punishing winter storm system lashed California with thunderstorms and severe winds Monday after breaking rainfall records, washing out roads and whipping up enormous waves. \n LOS ANGELES >> Sunshine and rainbows alternated with thunderclaps, downpours, snow and hail on Monday as the last in a trio of storms broke up over California after flooding roads and homes and trapping people in swamped vehicles. \n At least four people died, three were missing and others were rescued from raging floodwaters during the storms that added to impressive amounts of precipitation in a state that has struggled through years of withering drought. \n As of Sunday night, downtown Los Angeles had recorded 14 inches of rain since the start of the water year on Oct. 1, just .77 inch less than the seasonal average, and rain continued to fall in the unstable aftermath of the storm front. \n Heavy snow in the Sierra Nevada triggered an avalanche that shut down a highway just west of Lake Tahoe. Officials warned of continuing avalanche danger at all elevations of the Sierra. In northern Nevada, schools were canceled after more than a half-foot of snow fell near Reno. \n Flood watches and warnings remained in place for much of Southern California, a day after nearly 4 inches of rain fell south of Los Angeles, inundating roadways, toppling trees and raising fears of damaging mudslides. \n Low-elevation snow dusted rural communities just north of Los Angeles while resort communities to the east in the San Bernardino Mountains were digging out from more heavy snow. Many schools in the inland region closed for the day. \n The last of the three storms brought hours of rainfall to Southern California on Sunday. \n Ryan Schwarzrock, 35, and his wife, Emily Earhart, 32, were at home in Seal Beach, south of Los Angeles, when the rain began to pound. The couple watched the street that winds through their mobile home community fill with water. Then, the water crept over the concrete step leading up to their home. \n \"It just started seeping in,\" said Earhart. \"We started getting towels and realized it wasn't going to do it.\" \n The couple propped up couches on empty plastic bins and used paving stones to raise the bed off the floor. They pulled books from lower shelves and stacked them on the kitchen table. In 20 minutes, the floor was covered with 4 inches of water. \n \"With the drought, no one has really been thinking about rain and floods, and then it all comes,\" Schwarzrock said. \n Other Southern Californians were able to find some fun in the floods, paddleboarding and rafting through streets. A helmeted man raced a personal watercraft through suburban Fullerton. \n The National Weather Service had warned that the system could be among the strongest storms in years, and it delivered. \n Long Beach Airport received 3.87 inches of rain by 5 p.m. Sunday, breaking the all-time daily record for rainfall. Los Angeles Airport got 2.78 inches, another single-day record. \n Fire departments reported numerous water rescues through the weekend, many involving motorists in high water. \n A search resumed Monday for an 18-year-old woman whose car plunged into a rushing creek after a collision in Alameda County southeast of San Francisco on Saturday. \n A man's body was found in a swollen creek in northern San Diego County, which received more than 2.5 inches of rain. \n In San Diego, two women were swept into the ocean by a large wave Saturday in Sunset Cliffs. Both were pulled from the water, but one later died at a hospital, Fire-Rescue Capt. Joe Amador said. \n A motorist in the Los Angeles County city of Pomona died after losing control and smashing into a telephone pole amid heavy rains, according to police. \n In Mendocino County, a massive oak toppled onto an apartment in Ukiah Saturday, crushing the building and killing a woman in her bed, fire officials told The Press Democrat newspaper of Santa Rosa. \n The storm was accompanied by huge surf along the coast. \n A historic WWI-era ship called the S.S. Palo Alto beached near Santa Cruz was torn apart by massive waves Saturday. It had been a landmark since it was intentionally grounded and connected to shore with a pier in 1930 in a failed venture to create a seaside entertainment destination. \n Elsewhere in the West, avalanche warnings were issued for northern Utah, where heavy snow snarled traffic and led to numerous fender benders. Idaho Gov. C.L. \"Butch\" Otter signed a disaster declaration for Washington County due to snow accumulations.

The Senate is on track to confirm Pompeo to run the CIA and is expected to vote on his nomination Monday, Jan. 23, 2017, evening. \n WASHINGTON >> The Senate today confirmed President Donald Trump's nominee to run the CIA despite some Democratic objections that Rep. Mike Pompeo has been less than transparent about his positions on torture, surveillance and Russia's meddling in the U.S. election. \n The vote was 66-32. \n Pompeo takes the helm at the nation's top spy agency at a crucial time for U.S. national security as intelligence \u2014 traditionally a nonpartisan issue \u2014 has been thrust into the political arena. Trump has been critical of intelligence agencies after their assessment of Russian involvement to help him win the election while the new president also has said he is fully behind them. \n Senate Republicans had hoped to vote on Pompeo's nomination Friday, after Trump's inauguration. But Democrats succeeded in stalling action until they could debate. \n Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden said Pompeo was the \"wrong man for the job.\" \n \"He has endorsed extreme policies that would fundamentally erode liberties and freedoms of our people without making us safer,\" Wyden said. He said Pompeo's answers to questions from some senators have been \"vague\" and \"contradictory,\" making it impossible to know what Pompeo believes. \n \"I see no real commitment to transparency and his views on the most fundamental analysis of the day \u2013 the involvement of Russia in our election \u2013 seemed to shift with those of the president,\" Wyden said. \n In written responses to questions from the Senate, on Jan. 3, Pompeo said only that intelligence agency assessments in general should be taken seriously. After Trump conceded Russia was behind the campaign hacks, Pompeo on Jan. 12 told the Senate intelligence committee that particular assessment was \"solid.\" \n \"We need a CIA director who is direct about his beliefs and his assessments,\" Wyden said. \n Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said Democrats were playing politics in its efforts to delay and derail Trump's choice to run the CIA. \n One of Trump's first stops as president was at the CIA's headquarters in Northern Virginia on Saturday where he made a speech that focused more on falsely accusing the media of lying about how many people attended his inauguration than on the role the CIA plays protecting the U.S. \n Standing in front of a memorial for fallen CIA agents Saturday, Trump assured intelligence officials, \"I am so behind you.\" He made no mention of his repeated criticism of the intelligence agencies following the election, including his public challenges of their high-confidence assessment that Russia meddled in the White House race to help him win. \n In its final days, President Barack Obama's administration announced intelligence findings that Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential election with the goal of getting Trump elected. Trump himself has denied most of the assessment, though eventually conceded Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic emails during the campaign. \n Pompeo, a conservative Republican from Kansas and a member of the House intelligence committee, faced a mostly friendly confirmation hearing on Jan. 12. \n He enrolled as a teenager at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, and graduated first in his class in 1986.

{"date": "January 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Secretary of State-designate Rex Tillerson testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state headed for approval in a key Senate committee Monday after Florida Sen. Marco Rubio announced his support, backing off from a challenge to the new president. \n Rubio said that despite serious reservations about former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, particularly over his views on Russia, he believed a president was entitled to significant deference in assembling his Cabinet. \n \"Despite my reservations, I will support Mr. Tillerson's nomination in committee and in the full Senate,\" said Rubio, who'd come under strong pressure from fellow Republicans to back the nomination and avoid dealing Trump an embarrassing setback in the early days of his presidency. \n Rubio's announcement in a statement posted on Facebook came just hours before the Foreign Relations Committee was slated to meet and vote on Tillerson's nomination. Rubio's support virtually assures that the nominee will move through the committee and win full Senate confirmation. \n Rubio had clashed with Tillerson at a committee hearing earlier this month, bridling at his refusal to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"war criminal\" and his failure to condemn human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines in strong enough terms. He chided Tillerson over the need for \"moral clarity.\" But in the end, after unsuccessfully opposing Trump for the GOP nomination last year before coming around to support him, Rubio decided to fall in line this time, too. \n His statement came after the nomination got a boost on Sunday from two influential Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who also offered tepid endorsements for Tillerson. Like Rubio, McCain and Graham had voiced concerns in light of Tillerson's long history of personal dealings with Putin, his record of doing oil deals in Russia and his questioning of the U.S. sanctions on that country. \n It looks unlikely, though, that Tillerson will get much if any Democratic support in Monday's vote, which would be highly unusual for a secretary of state nominee. Every nominee for the job going back at least four decades has been approved by overwhelming votes from both sides in the Foreign Relations Committee, as senators have traditionally wanted to give a bipartisan vote of confidence to the nation's top diplomat. \n Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement Monday he won't vote for Tillerson. Cardin said he based his opposition on Tillerson's unwillingness to call Russia and Syria's atrocities war crimes, or to describe Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's extrajudicial killings as gross human rights violations. \n Cardin also said Tillerson misled the committee about Exxon's lobbying against the sanctions imposed on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. \n \"I believe Mr. Tillerson's demonstrated business orientation and his responses to questions during the confirmation hearing could compromise his ability as secretary of state to forcefully promote the values and ideals that have defined our country,\" Cardin said. Most of the other Democrats on the committee have also announced their opposition to Tillerson. \n Further roiling the debate is U.S. intelligence's assessment that Russia meddled in the presidential election to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton. \n Even while announcing his support for Tillerson, Rubio laid out a series of concerns in his statement Monday. \n \"Despite his extensive experience in Russia and his personal relationship with many of its leaders, he claimed he did not have sufficient information to determine whether Putin and his cronies were responsible for ordering the murder of countless dissidents, journalists and political opponents,\" Rubio said of Tillerson. \"He indicated he would support sanctions on Putin for meddling in our elections only if they met the impossible condition that they not affect U.S. businesses operating in Russia.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tillerson heading for confirmation as secretary of state"}

{"date": "January 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Packages of synthetic drugs are displayed in the North Dakota attorney general's office in the state Capitol in Bismarck, N.D. \n WASHINGTON >> The men who sold it called it Mr. Miyagi, a mind-altering chemical compound mixed with vegetable material and resembling marijuana. \n It was clear the drug was meant to be smoked for a potent high, notwithstanding the deceptive label that the product was potpourri not fit for human consumption. But less clear was how to punish the people who pushed it. \n As drug enforcement authorities sound alarms over the effects and accessibility of synthetic drugs, the Mr. Miyagi case in Louisiana is but one example of how courts are struggling for consistency in dealing with substances that are developing faster than the laws to govern them. The result is a sentencing process that's often bogged down by complex science and can yield uneven results in courtrooms around the country. \n \"It's been a challenge for the courts and for the regulatory agencies to manage and make appropriate, logical decisions relating to these new substances,\" said Greg Dudley, a West Virginia University chemistry professor who has testified in synthetic drug cases. \"If they're interpreted differently in different courts, you end up with broad disparities in sentencing for similar offenses.\" \n Now the federal panel that sets sentencing policy is studying ways for courts to better handle cases involving drugs such as \"bath salts,\" which can provoke violent outbursts, and the party drug Molly. \n The issue matters, given the sustained popularity of synthetic drugs \u2014 man-made compounds that mimic more conventional street drugs and hallucinogens and are sold under catchy names in stores and on the internet. \n Drug Enforcement Administration officials have repeatedly warned about the products' harmful effects but say it's hard to police them. Those who make synthetic drugs can alter their chemical makeup faster than regulators can ban them, and those who sell them can skirt the law through misleading labeling. Meanwhile, the DEA's forensic testing laboratories are \"overwhelmed with the amount of substances\" they're trying to identify and analyze, said spokesman Russ Baer. \n Amid the concerns about consistency in punishment, the U.S. Sentencing Commission is doing a two-year study on synthetic drugs that, among other things, will look at whether to update the drug quantity table that federal judges rely on at sentencing. \n Judges use the table to come up with the starting point for the sentence based on the amount of drugs involved, then factor in considerations like a defendant's criminal history and level of responsibility. That's easy for drugs like marijuana, cocaine and heroin that are listed on the table. \n Problem is, \"bath salts\" and similar synthetic or designer drugs aren't included. \n In prosecutions involving those drugs, judges consult the table to find the most similar drug to the one in their case, based on chemical makeup and pharmacological effects. They then convert the drug quantity in their case to the equivalent quantity of marijuana to calculate a base offense level. But that often causes confusion. \n Selling something that gets you high isn't unnecessarily illegal \"unless it's kind of like something on the list,\" said Lloyd Snook, a Virginia defense lawyer. \n \"Well, how kind of alike does it have to be? Who knows?\" Snook said. \n The commission says it's heard complaints about days-long hearings with dueling chemistry experts, disagreements about which drug is most analogous and varied sentences in similar cases. \n The Mr. Miyagi case, for instance, turned on a dispute over which drug was most similar to the product the defendants' sold \u2014 pure THC, marijuana's principal ingredient, or marijuana itself. \n A federal appeals court sided with the government's conclusion that it was most like THC. Since sentencing guidelines treat one gram of THC as equivalent to 167 grams of marijuana, the defendants, Thomas William Malone and Drew T. Green, were held responsible for 233,800 kilograms of marijuana and given long prison sentences. Each was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison. \n The defendants had argued it was most like marijuana and that a 1:1 ratio was appropriate, an assertion that if accepted would have resulted in lighter punishments. \n But, in an example of the disparate outcomes the guidelines sometimes yield, the ringleader in the case, sentenced in Florida, received only probation. And another man who worked with Malone and was charged in a similar case was allowed to avoid a conviction in New York by entering a diversion program, a supervised remedial plan for petty offenders. \n \"You just have a nightmare situation that cannot be explained to a defendant because it makes no sense,\" said Malone's attorney, Steven Sadow. \"He's at the mercy of what the judge chooses to do with the ratio and how the judge treats certain people.\" \n Some judges have openly struggled with formulas. In Florida, U.S. District Judge Donald Middlebrooks said he found no scientific basis for the marijuana-to-THC ratio and rejected it in a case involving a designer drug known as XLR-11. \n \"Although I asked each of the experts at the hearing, no one could provide me with a reason for this ratio, which has major implications in determining the base level offense,\" Middlebrooks wrote. \"After my own research and a phone call to the Sentencing Commission, I still could find no basis for this ratio.\" \n Snook, the lawyer, said he was glad the commission was studying the problem but thought Congress might need to get involved. \n \"There are a lot of reasons why it's an arbitrary and capricious system and why it ought to get changed,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Changes mulled as synthetic drug sentences cause confusion"}

Even as GOP governors and legislatures enacted a raft of new anti-abortion laws over the past decade, the movement faced a big obstacle from Democrat Barack Obama's eight years as president. \n \"I have high expectations,\" said Karin Capron, a 69-year-old retired chemist from the Kansas City suburb of Mission who has been active in the anti-abortion movement for more than four decades. \"The more hear about him (Trump), the more I think he can be very helpful to the pro-life movement.\" \n Some longtime anti-abortion activists and local private school students attended the annual Rally for Life, one day after the 44th anniversary of the Roe vs. Wade ruling. \n The rally, which is regularly the largest annual political event at the Capitol in Topeka, was accompanied by worship services and workshops \u2014 a prelude to the movement's paramount event, the annual March for Life on Friday in Washington. \n Trump on Monday reinstated a ban on providing federal money to international groups that perform abortions or provide information on the option. The policy has been instituted by Republican administrations and rescinded by Democratic ones since 1984. \n While the anti-abortion rally has drawn as many as 1,000 people to the Statehouse, a women's march and rally on Saturday drew more than 3,000 people \u2014 many of them concerned about abortion rights. \n Marilyn Ault, of Topeka, now 78, became an abortion rights supporter in the early 1960s after watching a friend recover from an illegal abortion. Ault, who ran the local Battered Women's Task Force, said she recalls fellow abortion-rights activists thinking after the Roe decision, \"That was it, and we wouldn't have to worry about it,\" she said. \n Capron, a lifelong Catholic, said she became active in the anti-abortion movement in 1973, following the decision, after seeing a slide show at a church that featured pictures of aborted fetuses. She'd just had a baby, and recalls, \"I said, God, I've got to do something.\" \n She has protested and handed out literature outside abortion clinics and staffed anti-abortion booths at fairs. She has marched to raise money for crisis pregnancy centers and worked as a pregnancy counselor. \n Capron hopes Congress approves a measure to halt funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation's leading provider of abortions. Another congressional proposal would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. \n At the state level, tough new restrictions on abortion are being pushed in numerous Republican-controlled legislatures. For example, Ohio and Kentucky, within the past six weeks, have joined about 15 other states in banning abortions after 20 weeks. \n Newly released data shows that the number of abortions in the U.S. fell to about 926,000 in 2014, the lowest level since 1974 \u2014 the year after the Roe v. Wade ruling. Reasons for the drop include the surge of abortion restrictions and the increased availability of effective contraceptives. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Marking Roe anniversary, abortion foes pin hopes on Trump"}

{"date": "January 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump speaks during a White House senior staff swearing-in ceremony in the East Room of the White House, in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump's economic plans are nothing if not ambitious: Annual growth of 4 percent \u2014 or more. A diminished trade gap. The creation of 25 million jobs over 10 years, including the return of good-paying factory positions. \n It all adds up to an immense challenge, one that Trump aims to achieve mostly by cutting taxes, loosening regulations, boosting infrastructure spending and renegotiating or withdrawing from trade deals. At the top of his agenda: Pulling out of the 12-nation Pacific trade agreement, a move Trump initiated Monday, his first full weekday in office. He has also said he will rewrite the North American Free Trade Agreement to better serve the United States. \n Yet to come anywhere near his goals, economists say Trump would have to surmount at least a handful of major hurdles that have long defied solutions. \n He may yet succeed. But he faces deep-rooted obstacles that have bedeviled presidents from both parties for years. \n Among the challenges are these: \n A SHIFT TOWARD AUTOMATION \n Trump's goal of vastly expanding manufacturing would require at least the partial reversal of a decades-long trend toward a service-oriented economy and away from factory work. Former President Barack Obama sought to add 1 million manufacturing jobs in his second term but came up two-thirds short. \n Even if Trump could return factory production to its heyday by toughening trade deals and threatening to slap tariffs on America's trading partners, a surge of new jobs wouldn't necessarily follow. The increased use of robots and automation has allowed factories to make more goods with fewer workers. Research shows that automation has been a bigger factor than trade in the loss of U.S. factory jobs. \n The trend is spreading outside factory gates. Uber is experimenting with self-driving cars. Restaurant chains like Eatsa can now serve meals through an automated order-and-payment system. No cashiers or servers are needed. \n \"You cannot just slap tariffs on and hope that will bring back middle class jobs,\" says Daron Acemoglu, an economist at MIT. \"The jobs that went to China would come back to robots rather than people.\" \n A SHORTAGE OF SKILLED WORKERS \n Jobs that can't be automated typically require education beyond high school. Yet not everyone can or wants to attend college. Many analysts say the economy needs better and more widely available post-high school education and training, whether through community colleges, vocational schools or boot camps offering technology training. \n Such a boot camp is how Sharnie Ivery managed to move beyond the retail and sales jobs he'd held right after high school. In 2013, Ivery began a six-month computer coding boot camp at Flatiron School in New York through which he obtained internships. Last year, he began working as a software developer at Spotify, the music streaming service. \"There weren't many opportunities for a career in technology\" without training and experience, Ivery, 24, said. \n Last year, the Obama administration opened some financial aid programs to Flatiron and other boot camps. But such efforts remain in an experimental phase, and any widespread successes from those programs are likely years away. \n A lack of technological skills isn't an issue only for the tech industry itself. Modern manufacturing work increasingly requires high-tech know-how requiring some education or training beyond high school. Since the economic recovery began in 2009, only 12 percent of manufacturing jobs have gone to workers with no more than a high school degree, according to research by Georgetown University's Center for Education and the Workforce. \n SLUGGISH WORKER PRODUCTIVITY \n In the past decade, the growth of American workers' productivity \u2014 the amount they produce per hour worked \u2014 has slumped to roughly half its long-term average. \n That slowdown has imposed a dead weight on the economy. When employees become less efficient, it slows economic growth, and companies can't raise pay without boosting prices. A faster expansion needs a combination of more people working and more efficient workers. \n Trump's proposals might help somewhat. He favors expanded tax breaks for companies that invest in new machinery and equipment, which typically make workers more productive. And he's vowed to build more roads, tunnels and other infrastructure, which can save on shipping and commuting costs. \n Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum, says Trump's push to loosen regulations might also lead to more startup companies, which could prod established businesses to become more efficient. \n Still, many economists, like Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, argue that today's innovations \u2014 in mobile communications and biotechnology, for example \u2014 aren't transformative enough to fuel the explosive productivity growth that resulted from inventions like the automobile, telephone and computer. \n INCOME INEQUALITY \n Economic growth since the recession ended has been both slow and uneven: It's benefited wealthier Americans far more than low- and middle-income households. Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, noted this concern at a confirmation hearing last week: \"The average American worker has gotten nowhere,\" he said. \n The tepid gains for low- and middle-income families have slowed the economy because those groups typically spend more of their income than do affluent households, and consumer spending is the economy's primary fuel. Against that backdrop, Trump's goal of 4 percent annual economic growth \u2014 a formidable one under any circumstances \u2014 might be next to impossible. \n Mnuchin said the administration's proposals to cut taxes for individuals and businesses would shore up families' finances and encourage companies to hire more. Yet America's wealth gap has widened even as previous presidents have cut individual taxes. \n And there's no way to know how companies would use their tax cuts. Many large companies return profits to shareholders by boosting dividend payments and share buybacks, rather than by expanding investment and raising employee pay. \n A SLOW-GROWING WORKFORCE \n Trump has pledged to add 25 million jobs over the next decade. But with fewer people looking for work now than just a few years ago, it's unclear where all those extra workers would come from. \n The president's pledge will run up against a long-standing trend: A decline in the proportion of Americans either working or seeking work. That's largely a reflection of an aging population. Roughly 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day, and many retire. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the proportion of Americans working or looking for will keep dropping to 61.5 percent by the end of 2020. \n Mark Lashinske of Tempe, Arizona-based Modern Industries, which makes machine tools, says he's struggling to fill 14 machinists' positions. He blames the steady loss of manufacturing jobs since 1980 for discouraging an entire generation from factory work. His company is expanding its efforts to find younger job applicants. \n The company has established an internship program and is working with a nonprofit group to encourage disadvantaged high school students to consider manufacturing careers. \n \"We've been looking for quite a while,\" he says. \"We have such a shortage.\" \n Most economists argue that encouraging more legal immigration could help counter an otherwise slow-growing workforce and might help accelerate economic growth. Yet Trump campaigned on tightening immigration restrictions. \n \"In the absence of immigration, we shrink the size of our population and our economy and our global influence,\" Holtz-Eakin says. \n STRONG DOLLAR \n Through renegotiating treaties like NAFTA and pushing companies to keep more jobs at home, Trump hopes to reduce \u2014 or even eliminate \u2014 the trade deficit, a measure of how much more America imports than exports. The U.S. has run trade deficits since 1975. \n Yet if Trump's policies accelerate growth, the Federal Reserve would be more likely to raise the short-term interest rate it controls to keep inflation in check. Faster growth and higher rates, in turn, would attract more investors to the dollar, raising its value compared with other currencies. \n The catch? A stronger dollar makes U.S. exports costlier and imports cheaper \u2014 a recipe for an even wider trade deficit and a headwind for growth. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Why Trump will find it hard to make American economy greater"}

{"date": "January 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this 1891 photo released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Penobscot Bay fishermen clean mackerel near their saltwater farm off the Maine coast. Scientists with the University of Massachusetts, and other institutions, published research findings this month where they concluded the 1815 volcanic eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia that led to a short period of climate cooling also increased the consumption of mackerel, which were less affected than crops and other animals in New England. \n PORTLAND, Maine >> What could an Indonesian volcanic eruption, a 200-year-old climate disaster and a surge in the consumption of mackerel tell us about today's era of global warming? \n Quite a bit, researchers say. \n A group of scientists and academics with the University of Massachusetts and other institutions made that assessment while conducting research about a long-ago calamity in New England that was caused by the eruption of Mount Tambora half a world away in 1815. \n A cooled climate led to deaths of livestock and changed fish patterns in New England, leaving many people dependent on the mackerel, an edible fish that was less affected than many animals. The researchers assert that bit of history gives clues about what food security could be like in the modern era of climate change. \n \"How we respond to these events is going to be critically important for how we come out of this in the long term,\" said Karen Alexander, the lead author of the study and a research fellow in environmental conservation. \"We can learn from the past how people dealt with the unanticipated.\" \n The research group's findings were published this month in the journal Science Advances. They looked at what the catastrophic Tambora eruption meant for the Gulf of Maine and nearby human food systems. \n The eruption was one of the most powerful in recorded history and was followed by a short time of climate change \u2014 specifically, global cooling \u2014 and severe weather. Its impact on weather, food availability and human and animals deaths worldwide has been studied extensively. The year that followed the eruption, 1816, is often described as the \"Year Without a Summer.\" \n The researchers behind the Science Advances article found that alewives, a fish used for everything from fertilizer to food by 19th-century New Englanders, did not fare well. But mackerel had better survival rates and became a critical source of protein and jobs, Alexander said. \n As crops failed and famine began to spread, the little fish emerged as a staff of life, the report states. The shift marked the beginning of the mackerel fishery as a critical piece of New England's marine economy, and it remains active today; Maine and Massachusetts fishermen caught more than 8 million pounds of Atlantic mackerel in 2015. \n It's a scenario similar to what parts of the developing world are experiencing today as climate change affects food security. \n The study states there is a parallel between the need for immediate adaptation after Tambora and the challenges in coping with the climate-driven devastation caused by storms, floods and droughts today. It notes that the loss of food staples due to climate change caused people in the northeastern states to move \u2014 something seen today in places such as Pakistan and Syria. \n \"Understanding how adaptive responses to extreme events can trigger unintended consequences may advance long-term planning for resilience in an uncertain future,\" the report states. \n How fisheries in the developing world will adapt to future climate change is an important contemporary food security issue, because fish are a vitally important protein resource worldwide. More than a billion of the world's poor obtain most of their animal protein from fish, and 800 million depend on fisheries and aquaculture for livelihoods, according to the nonprofit research group WorldFish. \n The report illustrates how abrupt changes in climate can have unexpected consequences long after conditions moderate, said Andy Pershing, chief scientific officer and ecosystem modeler for the Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland. \n \"Good stewardship of our natural resources can help buffer against some climate impacts. Unlike the people in 1815, we have an idea of what's coming, and we need to make sure we are prepared,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "What can mackerel and a volcano say about climate change?"}

The Employees Retirement System, which provides benefits to more than 120,000 employees and retirees, earlier this month announced that its unfunded pension liability for state and county employees and retirees was a whopping $3.67 billion more than had been previously calculated. \n To help cope with that extra cost, Ige said he will phase in a series of increased payments \"to ensure that we keep our promises to our retirees in a responsible way.\" \n Ige said he intends to expand the Early College Program that helps high school students to obtain college credits, saying that \"studies show that this may be one of the most powerful tools to advance college enrollment and success among our public high school graduates \u2014 especially for lower-income and first-generation college students,\" Ige said. \n Ige also said he will purchase more electric cars for the state using money from up to $10 million in payments to the state under a legal settlement with Volkswagen for alleged emissions fraud. \n Ige did not specifically mention his plans to increase the state's gasoline tax, weight tax and registration fees, but said he wants to work with lawmakers to \"find the funding to make significant upgrades to increase safety and reliability\" in the state's highway network. \n Lawmakers last year rejected Ige's plan to increase those taxes to fund highway improvements, but Ige promised to re-introduce those tax increase proposals again this year. \n The city plans to ask lawmakers this year to extend the half-percent excise tax surcharge for Oahu to provide more money for the city's rail project, and Ige said he plans to work with the city and the Legislature to find enough money to complete the rail system. \n \"This will give us a more comprehensive approach to traffic congestion on Oahu for the long term,\" he said. \n Ige's speech mostly steered clear of dramatic new initiatives such as \"Cool the Schools,\" which he unveiled in his speech last year. That plan to install air conditioning or other equipment to cool 1,000 classrooms by the end of last 2016 turned out to be a disappointment for the administration. \n Ige convinced lawmakers last year to appropriate $100 million for the plan, but unexpectedly costly bids by contractors contributed to delays, and shortly before New Years Day Ige reported that work had been completed in only 164 classrooms with bids have been awarded for another 207. \n However, Ige said his new budget includes $61.7 million to continue the \"Cool the Schools\" effort, adding that \"we haven't lowered our sights.\" \n Ige also said he will propose a new \"invasive species authority\" to oversee efforts to protect the Hawaii environment from invasive species, but provided few details. He said his budget includes $18.4 million to protect watersheds, forests and oceans from invasive species. \n Ige said his administration helped to reduce homelessness in Kakaako by two-thirds, and said his new budget proposes to spend $20.9 million per year for rent subsidies, supportive services, outreach services and enforcement to cope with homelessness. \n State funding for homeless prevention allowed 4,200 to stay in their homes and avoid homelessness, and helped to spur a 25 percent reduction in evictions, Ige said. \n Ige also praised his administration's efforts to speed renovations in public housing units so they can become available for occupancy more quickly. He said his proposed budget includes $59 million for additional public housing improvements, and said his budget proposes to invest $123.4 million in new housing starts. \n Ige also pitched his administration's efforts to steer Hawaii into the \"innovation\" sector. \n The governor has included $5 million per year for each of the next two years to support the work of the Cancer Center of Hawaii, and praised the state's HI Growth program to encourage high-tech entrepreneurs. He said that program has helped to fuel 145 start-ups with $10 million in state funds, and those start-ups attracted $250 million total investment. \n \"Together, we must pursue our own self-made opportunities through education, innovation and entrepreneurship,\" Ige said. \"We must tap our greatest resource, our people, to find our way to the next great economic transformation: the development of an innovation sector.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ", "author": "By Kevin Dayton kdayton@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Ige says slowing economy will force budget adjustments"}

At left is Wendell P. Weeks, Chief Executive Officer of Corning, at right is Alex Gorsky Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump moved to pull the United States out of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact today, fulfilling a campaign promise as he began his first full week in office. \n \"Great thing for the American worker that we just did,\" Trump said as he signed a notice in the Oval Office. \n The president also signed memorandums freezing most federal government hiring, though he noted an exception for the military, and reinstating a ban on providing federal money to international groups that perform abortions or provide information on the option. The regulation, known as the \"Mexico City Policy,\" has been a political volleyball, instituted by Republican administrations and rescinded by Democratic ones since 1984. \n Following a tumultuous first weekend in office \u2014 consumed by Trump's criticism of the media's inauguration coverage followed by pushback against his comments \u2014 the president was seeking to refocus on the sweeping, yet often vague, promises he made as a candidate. He campaigned as a fierce opponent of multilateral trade agreements, particularly the 12-nation Pacific Rim deal agreed to by President Barack Obama. \n Earlier today, Trump huddled with business leaders and warned that he would impose a \"substantial border tax\" on companies that move their manufacturing out of the United States. He also promised tax advantages to companies that produce products domestically. \n \"All you have to do is stay,\" he said during a meeting in the White House's Roosevelt Room. \n Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin were among the executives who attended the meeting. The gathering kicked off a jam-packed day for the new president, including an evening reception with lawmakers from both parties and a sit-down with union leaders. \n Trump ran for office pledging to overhaul U.S. trade policy, arguing that massive free-trade agreements have disadvantaged American workers. Since winning the White House, he's aggressively called out companies that have moved factories overseas, vowing to slap taxes on products they then try to sell in the U.S. \n \"Some people say that's not free trade, but we don't have free trade now,\" Trump said today. \n The president also reiterated his campaign pledge to lower taxes for companies, as well as the middle class, \"anywhere from 15 to 25 percent.\" He also called for cutting 75 percent of federal regulations \u2014 and insisted that doing so would not compromise worker safety. \n Today's developments came after a first weekend in the White House that included lambasting news organizations for correctly reporting on the size of the crowds at his inauguration and mass protests against his presidency on the following day. \n Trump delivered a more unifying message Sunday and sought to reassure Americans he was up to the daunting task ahead. \n Speaking in the White House East Room during a swearing-in ceremony for top aides, the president warned his staff of the challenges. \n \"But with the faith in each other and the faith in God, we will get the job done,\" he said. \"We will prove worthy of this moment in history. And I think it may very well be a great moment in history.\" \n Trump said his staff was in the White House not to \"help ourselves\" but to \"devote ourselves to the national good.\" \n \"This is not about party, this is not about ideology. This is about country, our country. It's about serving the American people,\" he said. \n Earlier Sunday, Trump offered a scattershot response to the sweeping post-inauguration protests, first sarcastically denigrating the public opposition and then defending the right to demonstrate a short time later. \n \"Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly,\" Trump tweeted. Ninety-five minutes later, he struck a more conciliatory tone. \n \"Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views,\" the president tweeted, still using his personal account. \n Trump also spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who accepted an invitation to visit the White House in early February. The prime minister said he is hoping to forge a \"common vision\" with the newly inaugurated U.S. president that could include expanded Israeli settlement construction and a tougher policy toward Iran. \n Trump also announced that he's set up meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. \n \"We're going to start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA,\" he said of his meeting with Pena Nieto. Mexico is part of the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada. Trump said he also will discuss immigration and security at the border. He has promised to build a wall along the length of the southern U.S. border and insisted that Mexico will pay for it. \n Later in the week, he'll address congressional Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia and meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May. \n Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire and Lisa Lerer contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump moves to pull U.S. out of Pacific-Rim trade deal"}

Fire and rescue crews were searching through the debris, looking for people who might have become trapped when the deadly storm came through. \n ALBANY, Ga. >> A tornado warning on television sent Anthony Mitchell, his pregnant wife and their three children scrambling for what little shelter their mobile home could provide. They crouched in a hallway as the winds started taking their home apart piece by piece. \n \"The windows exploded, the doors flew off the hinges, the sheetrock started to rip off the walls and fly out the windows,\" Mitchell said. \"The trailer started to lift up. And about that time a tree fell on the trailer, and I think that's what held the trailer in place from flying away.\" \n An unusual midwinter barrage of tornadoes and thunderstorms over the weekend was blamed for at least 20 deaths across the Deep South. Among them were three people killed at Big Pine Estates, the mobile home park in Albany where the Williams family lives. \n Residents reported a twister plowed into the neighborhood in the southwestern Georgia city of 76,000 people on Sunday afternoon, leaving the landscape strewn with broken trees and mangled sheet metal. Few of the roughly 200 homes escaped damage. \n In addition to the three dead at Big Pine Estates, a fourth body was discovered at a home just outside the trailer park. \n Mitchell lost his home and marveled that he didn't lose his life, too. \n \"Something helped us walk out the front door of the house,\" he said. \"There's some people who weren't fortunate enough to have a front door to walk out of.\" \n Georgia reported 15 deaths Sunday, and four people died Saturday in Mississippi. In northern Florida, a woman died after a tree crashed into her home in Lake City as a storm passed through. \n The National Weather Service said 39 possible tornadoes were reported over the weekend. The agency sent out teams to examine the damage and confirm whether the storms were twisters, which can happen any time of the year but are far more common in the spring and early summer. \n A day after the storms passed, search crews looked for people and pets in the Albany trailer park, stepping over tree limbs and ducking under splintered pine trunks as they went from home to home. One team discovered a terrified dog in a smashed-in trailer, where it had spent the night. Authorities said the pet owner's fate was unknown. \n In rural Cook County, about 60 miles southeast of Albany, Aretha Perry prayed aloud in front of the First Baptist Church, where a shelter was set up after an apparent tornado destroyed about half the homes at the Sunshine Acres mobile home park. \n Perry said her niece and the niece's brother both lived there, and she drove out to try to help them after hearing the park had been hit. \n \"We were looking, looking,\" Perry said, \"but couldn't find them.\" \n The coroner later confirmed seven people were found dead at Sunshine Acres. Perry said her two relatives were among them. \n \"They died in the storm trying to save her grandchildren,\" she said, adding that the children survived. \"I know they've gone on to Jesus.\" \n At Sunshine Acres today, crews with cadaver dogs checked the wreckage of mobile homes for anyone dead or alive.

{"date": "January 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Samsung Electronics's mobile president Koh Dong-jin speaks during a press conference at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, Monday, Jan. 23, 2017. Samsung Electronics Co. said Monday that problems with the design and manufacturing of batteries in its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones caused them to overheat and burst into fire. \n SEOUL >> Samsung Electronics says flaws in the design and production of batteries used in its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, not its hardware or software, made it prone to catch fire. \n Samsung said Monday that it was responsible for not ensuring the design specifications given to its suppliers were failsafe but believed its investigation into the problem would help the entire industry counter overheating risks with lithium batteries. Analysts questioned if the world's largest smartphone maker had really gotten to the bottom of the problem. \n The South Korean company delayed the launch of its next Galaxy phone \u2014the Galaxy S8, which usually would come in February. It also announced tighter quality controls and more rigorous testing to ensure safety. \n During a two-hour press conference livestreamed in English, Chinese and Korean, Samsung said tests of more than 200,000 phones and 30,000 batteries showed different problems with each of the two kinds of batteries used in the Note 7. \n Some experts had speculated that the phones' ultra-thin design or water-resistant features could have made them prone to overheat. Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung's mobile division, said the investigation found no such problems. \n The Galaxy Note 7 featured one of the biggest battery capacities so far for smartphones at 3,500 mAh, or milliampere hour, which gave it the highest energy density of all Samsung's devices. However, Koh said Samsung and outside inspectors found no evidence that the high energy density alone was to blame. \n Samsung introduced the Note 7 on Aug. 2 and weeks later recalled the first batch after reports emerged that the phones were overheating and in some cases exploding. After replacement phones also started catching fire, aviation authorities banned them on flights and the company dropped the product for good. It has estimated the quality control fiasco will cost it $5.3 billion through early this year. \n The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Manufacturers like the batteries because they weigh less and pack much more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. \n But rechargeable lithium batteries like those used in smartphones are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. \n Having taken heat for failing to fix the problem after the first Note 7 recall in September, Samsung brought in three private inspectors to help. U.S. companies UL and Exponent examined batteries from Samsung's suppliers Samsung SDI and Amperex Technology Ltd., or ATL. The German company TUV Rheinland analyzed the Note 7 supply chain as part of the investigation. \n Inspectors found damage to the upper corners of batteries made by one manufacturer \u2014 likely Samsung SDI \u2014 and used in the initial batches of Note 7s. \n That, combined with overly thin separators and high energy density, caused the phones to overheat, Samsung said. The cell-pouch design of the battery also did not have enough space to safely accommodate its electrodes \u2014 another flaw. \n In other batches of batteries from a second manufacturer, presumably China-based ATL, used in replacements for the recalled smartphones the researchers found welding defects and a lack of protective tape in some battery cells. \n Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy, said the odds of two different suppliers having issues with the same phone are extremely low. \n The case \"may signal we may have reached an inflection point in smartphone battery technology,\" Moorhead said. \n Samsung's latest findings were not that different from the ones announced after the first Note 7 recall, said Park Chul Wan, a former director of the next generation battery research center at the state-owned Korea Electronics Technology Institute. \n \"Samsung said the weaknesses could make the phone prone to catch fire. That I understand but what did trigger fires in such conditions? Did they discuss if there is another cause? No,\" said Park of the Korea Electronics Technology Institute. \n Though Samsung faulted the batteries from its suppliers, it said it would bear all costs from the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. \n \"We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing,\" it said in a statement. \n It was unclear to what extent the battery makers were responsible for those problems since Samsung said only that it had provided \"targets,\" such as how thin the batteries should be and what their capacity should be. That may suggest a breakdown both in communication between Samsung and its suppliers and in quality control and testing. \n \"We suggested that the Note 7 has innovations and a compact design and a 3500 mAh (battery) but we did not know how to make the separators within (the battery) or how many millimeters thick they should be,\" Koh told reporters. \n He said Samsung would use what it learned from its investigations to improve lithium battery safety for the industry. \n To avoid further problems, Samsung said it was introducing an 8-point battery safety check with more intense durability tests; a new test on accelerated usage and a charge and discharge test. The tighter safety measures will be implemented in \"every element of the company's devices,\" it said, including overall design and materials used. \n Samsung said it also will seek advice on battery safety and innovation from a group of battery experts. \n The company has recalled 3.06 million Note 7 phones. About 4 percent, or 120,000 units, of the recalled Galaxy Note 7s have not been returned. \n ___ \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Samsung says batteries caused Note 7 fires, delays new phone"}
