He was 103. \n Hartle may have been the oldest surviving Pearl Harbor salvage diver, said David Ball of San Diego, an officer with the Navy Divers Association. \n Hartle and his fellow Seabees worked in the days before scuba diving equipment was commonplace. His heavy canvas diving suit and brass helmet weighed more than 200 pounds. \n Japan's Dec. 7, 1941 surprise attack on Pearl Harbor sank or beached 18 ships. Among them was the battleship Arizona, which went down with 1,177 crew members. \n Hartle was working as a civilian ship-fitter at a Navy yard in the San Francisco Bay Area when the war broke out but he wasn't allowed to enlist until 1943 because his job was deemed too important to the war effort. \n Hartle was proud of the work he performed over the next two years, his children said. He risked death by towing away unexploded torpedoes and salvaging ships and planes, first at Pearl Harbor and later from Maine to the Philippines. \n He suffered the bends \u2014 painful and dangerous bubbles in his bloodstream from improper decompression \u2014 and was nearly killed when an anchor chain cracked and spewed metal shards. \n But he avoided mentioning one task: recovering the long-submerged bodies of sailors who went to the bottom at Pearl Harbor. \n \"He just didn't like talking about it,\" said his son, Ken W. Hartle, 64, of Montana. \"He would only say that the hardest part of the job was 'bringing up our boys.' \" \n Ambert Kenneth Hartle was born in 1913 in Bakersfield, Calif. His mother, a brother and a sister died from illness or accidents before he was 10 and his father was sent to a tuberculosis sanitarium in 1916, according to Hartle's children. \n Hartle and his siblings were sent to Los Angeles to live with relatives but he hitchhiked to the San Francisco Bay Area. He worked as a prune-picker, a ranch hand and a cook for mining camps and resorts, earned a high school diploma and studied commercial art in college, where he also managed the basketball team. \n His son said Hartle managed to cheat death several times, beginning at age 3 when a mule kicked him in the face and knocked him unconscious for 20 hours. \n At 9, he was stabbed in the neck during a schoolyard brawl. In college, he was flung hundreds of feet when his car was crushed by a truck. He was bitten by a rattlesnake and a scorpion while working alone at a mining camp. \n He had colon and prostate cancer, six heart bypass surgeries, and broke his shoulder falling from a ladder while trimming trees when he was 97. \n \"He was from a generation of people who were amazingly tough,\" said his daughter and longtime caregiver, Karen Dahl, 66. \"He had a lot of problems with pain from the work he did in his younger life, but he never complained.\" \n After the war, he settled in Buena Park, Calif., and later became a chicken breeder in Valley Center in northern San Diego County. \n His second wife, Jeanne, died in 2008. \n \"He was a great storyteller. He could talk for hours about his life in the most amazing detail,\" his daughter said. \"He loved his life and he had a wonderful one.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pearl Harbor Navy salvage diver dies at 103"}

{"date": "January 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Anti-abortion activists and supporters of President Donald Trump marched up Constitution Avenue en route to the Supreme Court in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> The politically ascendant anti-abortion movement gathered today for a triumphant rally on the National Mall, rejoicing at the end of an eight-year presidency that participants said was dismissive of their views. \n Vice President Mike Pence told the crowd at the March for Life that anti-abortion policies were a top priority of the new administration, and President Donald Trump tweeted that the rally had his \"full support.\" \n The March for Life is held every year in Washington to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. While no official crowd estimates were available, the turnout was clearly larger than in recent years, when abortion opponents had less political clout. Many thousands huddled in the shadow of the Washington Monument and stood in long lines outside security checkpoints made necessary by Pence's appearance. \n \"We've come to a historic moment in the cause for life,\" said Pence, the first vice president to address the rally. \"Life is winning in America.\" \n Pence said ending taxpayer-funded abortion and choosing a Supreme Court justice in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia \u2014 a conservative Catholic who opposed abortion \u2014 are among the administration's most important goals. \n One of Trump's first acts after taking office a week ago was to sign an executive order banning U.S. aid to foreign groups that provide abortions. Pence said more such actions would follow. \n A budget provision known as the Hyde Amendment already bans federal funding for Medicaid coverage of most abortions. Conservatives would like to see the rule made into a permanent law. \n Majority Republicans in the House and Senate would also like to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provided more than a third of the nation's abortions in 2014. They also hope to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Trump has pledged to sign both measures if they reach his desk. \n Many people at the march said they were encouraged by the early days of the Trump administration, even if they did not support him initially or disagreed with him on other issues. \n Trump \"was elected because of people who did not have a voice before. This past administration did not listen to us and did not even care,\" said Glenn Miller, 60, a cabinet maker from Connecticut, who was attending the march for the fourth time. \"I wouldn't say that I was a supporter of Donald Trump. I voted for him because I didn't think I had a choice.\" \n Other participants said they felt the march was important this year because their voices were not represented at last week's Women's March on Washington, an anti-Trump demonstration that drew massive crowds in Washington and cities around the country. The women's march included support for abortion rights in its mission statement and dropped an anti-abortion group as a partner. \n Joi Hulecki, 63, a nurse practitioner from Florida, said abortion-rights supporters wrongly portray the decision to terminate a pregnancy as empowering for women, when in fact women often feel pressured to have abortions and regret it later. \n \"We don't want to judge them. We want to help them,\" she said. \"We consider ourselves pro-women too.\" \n The annual event was never expected to attract a crowd on the scale of the women's march, which brought more than half a million people to Washington. Organizers said in their permit application that they expected 50,000 people, though they hoped for more. \n \"There's been a lot of talk about numbers this past week,\" said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life. \"It's hard to add up so many numbers after 44 years because there have been a lot of us.\" \n Mancini added that the most important number for marchers was 58 million, an estimate for the number of abortions performed in the United States since 1973. \n Americans remain deeply divided on abortion. The latest Gallup survey, released last spring, found that 47 percent of Americans described themselves as pro-abortion rights and 46 percent as anti-abortion. It also found that 79 percent believed abortion should be legal in either some or all circumstances. \n Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said that poll shows why abortion-rights supporters should not despair. \n \"The vast majority of Americans support Roe v. Wade and support the legal right to abortion,\" Hogue said. \n The March for Life, however, is running ads arguing that a majority of Americans support some restrictions on abortion and don't believe it should be funded by tax dollars. \n Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Trump, also addressed the rally and assured the crowd that Trump and Pence were on their side. \n \"Their decisive actions as president and vice president will further this cause,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Anti-abortion groups hold triumphant rally after Obama years"}

{"date": "January 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump, left, with Defense Secretary James Mattis watching, explained the executive action on extreme vetting before he signed it at the Pentagon today in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump signed an executive order today making major changes to America's policies on refugees and immigration. \n A look at what Trump ordered: \n SYRIA \n Trump's order directs the State Department to stop issuing visas to Syrian nationals and halts the processing of Syrian refugees. That will remain in effect until Trump determines that enough security changes have been made to ensure that would-be terrorists can't exploit weaknesses in the current vetting system. \n REFUGEES \n Trump ordered a four-month suspension to America's broader refugee program. The suspension is intended to provide time to review how refugees are vetted before they are allowed to resettle in the United States. \n Trump's order also cuts the number of refugees the United States plans to accept this budget year by more than half, to 50,000 people from around the world. \n During the last budget year the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Barack Obama had set the current refugee limit at 110,000. \n The temporary halt to refugee processing does include exceptions for people claiming religious persecution, so long as their religion is a minority faith in their country. That could apply to Christians from Muslim-majority countries. \n EXTREME VETTING \n Trump's order did not spell out specifically what additional steps he wants to see the Homeland Security and State departments to add to the country's vetting system for refugees. Instead he directed officials to the review the refugee application and approval process to find any other security measures that can be added to prevent people who pose a threat from using the refugee program. \n During the Obama administration, vetting for refugees included in-person interviews overseas, where they provided biographical details about themselves, including their families, friendships, social or political activities, employment, phone numbers, email accounts and more. They also provided biometric information, including fingerprints. Syrians were subject to additional, classified controls that administration officials at the time declined to describe, and processing for that group routinely took years to complete. \n OTHER IMMIGRATION \n Trump's executive order suspends all immigration from countries with terrorism concerns for 90 days. The State Department said the three-month ban in the directive applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen \u2014 all Muslim-majority nations. The order also calls for Homeland Security and State Department officials, along with the director of national intelligence, to review what information the government needs to fully vet would-be visitors and come up with a list of countries that don't provide it. The order says the government will give countries 60 days to start providing the information or citizens from those countries will be barred from traveling to the United States. \n Barring any travel to the U.S. from those seven countries, even temporarily, appears to at least partially fulfill a campaign promise Trump made to ban Muslims from coming to the United States until assurances can be made that visitors are properly vetted. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "A look at Trump's executive order on refugees, immigration"}

{"date": "January 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump, left, handed Defense Secretary James Mattis, right, a pen after he signed an executive action on rebuilding the military during an event at the Pentagon today in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump has barred all refugees from entering the United States for four months, and indefinitely halted any from Syria, saying the ban is needed to keep out \"radical Islamic terrorists.\" \n The order Friday immediately suspended a program that last year resettled in the U.S. roughly 85,000 people displaced by war, political oppression, hunger and religious prejudice. Trump indefinitely blocked those fleeing Syria, where a civil war has raged, and imposed a 90-day ban on all immigration to the U.S. from seven Muslim majority nations, citing terrorism concerns. \n \"We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas,\" Trump said as he signed the order at the Pentagon. \"We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people.\" \n Trump said the halt in the refugee program was necessary to give agencies time to develop a stricter screening system. While the order did not spell out what additional steps he wants the departments of Homeland Security and State to take, the president directed officials to review the refugee application and approval process and find any more measures that could prevent those who pose a threat from using the refugee program. \n The U.S. may admit refugees on a case-by-case basis during the freeze, and the government will continue to process requests from people claiming religious persecution, \"provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country.\" \n In an interview with CBN News, Trump said persecuted Christians would be given priority in applying for refugee status. \n \"We are going to help them,\" Trump said. \"They've been horribly treated.\" \n The order was signed on Trump's most robust day of national security and foreign policy at the start of his presidency. He met with British Prime Minister Theresa May and had a lengthy phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. \n As a candidate, Trump called for a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration to the U.S. He later shifted his focus to putting in place \"extreme vetting\" procedures to screen people coming to the U.S. from countries with terrorism ties. \n The State Department said the three-month ban in the directive applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen \u2014 all Muslim-majority nations. \n The Council on American-Islamic Relations said it would challenge the constitutionality of the executive order. \n \"There is no evidence that refugees \u2014 the most thoroughly vetted of all people entering our nation \u2014 are a threat to national security,\" Lena F. Masri, the group's national litigation director. \"This is an order that is based on bigotry, not reality.\" \n During the past budget year, the U.S. accepted 84,995 refugees, including 12,587 people from Syria. President Barack Obama had set the refugee limit for this budget year at 110,000. \n According to Trump's executive order, he plans to cut that to 50,000. Refugee processing was suspended in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and restarted months later. \n The president was applauded by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said it was \"time to re-evaluate and strengthen the visa-vetting process.\" \n But many Democrats cast the measures as un-American. \n \"Tears are running down the cheeks of the Statue of Liberty tonight as a grand tradition of America, welcoming immigrants, that has existed since America was founded has been stomped upon,\" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \n The order makes no mention of a plan to provide safe zones in Syria and the surrounding area. A draft of the order had directed the Pentagon and the State Department to produce a plan for safe zones in the war-torn Mideast nation. \n The president's directive capped a hectic first week for Trump at the White House, giving Americans an initial look at how he intends to position the United States around the globe. \n Earlier Friday, he hosted May at the White House for his first meeting with a world leader since taking office. Asked about whether he would revert back to Bush-era use of torture, Trump said he would defer to the views of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. \n \"He has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it. \u2026 I don't necessarily agree,\" Trump said. \"But I would tell you that he will override because I'm giving him that power. He's an expert.\" \n The Associated Press and other news organizations have obtained copies of a draft executive order signaling sweeping changes to U.S. interrogation and detention policy. The draft, which the White House said was not official, also requests recommendations on whether the U.S. should reopen CIA detention facilities outside the United States. Critics said the clandestine sites have marred America's image on the world stage. \n Trump held firm on another matter of contention, trade and illegal immigration from Mexico. He told reporters he had a \"very good call\" with Pena Nieto earlier in the day, but he reaffirmed his belief that Mexico has \"outnegotiated and beat us to a pulp\" on trade \u2014 and that would change. \n \"We're no longer going to be the country that doesn't know what it's doing,\" he declared a day after the Mexican leader canceled his visit to Washington in response to Trump's plans to build a border wall and have Mexico pay for it. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump order bars all refugees from entering U.S. for 4 months"}

About 1 percent of those samples were resistant to colistin, often considered the last option in antibiotics. \n The study, published Friday in the Lancet journal, is one of the first to document the extent of drug-resistant infections in more than one Chinese province. \n For decades, China has used colistin in its agriculture industry to speed animals' growth, but the drug was not used in people. Scientists say the latest work is further evidence that overuse in animals can spread to people. Chinese officials earlier this year approved colistin for use in hospitals, raising fears that it could worsen the resistance problem. \n \"It will be very important to ration its use so that it's only used when absolutely nothing else will work,\" said Mark Enright, a professor of medical microbiology at Manchester Metropolitan University, who was not part of the research. \n Health officials have long worried that colistin-resistant bacteria might spread more widely, setting the stage for superbug infections that would theoretically be impervious to medications. Only a small number of such cases worldwide have been detected, including in the U.S. \n Rising concerns over drug-resistant germs have prompted the United Nations to encourage countries to cut back on antibiotic use and develop new medicines. \n People infected with these resistant strains can usually be treated with current antibiotics, but doctors warn that as these bacteria \u2014 which are already untreatable with last-resort drugs \u2014 acquire resistance to current drugs, the infections may become impossible to treat. \n Experts also noted a surprise: the apparent ease with which the resistant gene spread between bacteria, including different species of bugs. \n \"It now looks like there's potential for the resistance gene to move around and spread between different species of bacteria,\" said Nigel Brown, a spokesman for Britain's Microbiology Society, adding that it could lead to a jump in infections. \n In a separate study also published in the Lancet, another group of Chinese researchers analyzed samples from patients with blood infections at 28 hospitals. About 1 percent had the colistin-resistant gene \u2014 a much higher figure than would be expected in developed countries. \n Colistin's use in hospitals should be restricted to avoid problems, said Yunsong Yu, one of the study's authors. \n \"This is a warning shot about the possible scenario where we don't have very much left in the armory to treat (bacterial) infections,\" said Brown. \"I don't think we are very close to that happening, but it is a remote possibility if we aren't careful about how we use our antibiotics.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Study: Superbug infections found in Chinese hospitals"}

{"date": "January 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Gregg Phillips is seen in Austin, Texas. President Donald Trump, today, continued to press his widely debunked claims of massive voter fraud by encouraging the work of a Texas man who has claimed without providing any evidence that millions of people illegally voted in the 2016 election. \n AUSTIN, Texas >> President Donald Trump on Friday pressed his widely debunked claims of massive voter fraud by encouraging the work of a Texas man who has offered no evidence to support his claim that millions of people illegally voted in the 2016 election. \n Trump tweeted: \"Look forward to seeing the final results of VoteStand. Gregg Phillips and crew say at least 3,000,000 votes were illegal. We must do better!\" \n The tweet came less than an hour after a CNN interview with Phillips, who has refused to substantiate his claims since he made them days after the November election. \n Phillips tweeted that a Houston-based group, True the Vote, \"will lead the analysis\" of widespread voter fraud. But the founder of that group said today it has not confirmed that millions voted illegally. \n Here's more about the man Trump is cheering on, and about True the Vote. \n WHO IS PHILLIPS? \n Phillips is a former Texas state official whose brief stint as deputy executive director at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission drew media scrutiny over privatization efforts. He went on to found AutoGov, a health care software contractor whose clients include state governments, and created a mobile app called VoteStand that allows people to report suspicious voting activity. \n Phillips also previously worked as a state health official in Mississippi, resigning under fire from lawmakers. A state panel concluded that he stepped down as executive director of the Mississippi's Department of Human Services on the same day he went to work for a company that he had given a state contract. \n \"Mr. Phillips's actions create the appearance of impropriety, facilitating an erosion of the public trust,\" according to the panel's 1995 report. \n After the 2016 election, Phillips tweeted that his \"completed analysis\" of voter registrations concluded that the \"number of non-citizen votes exceeded 3 million.\" He has rebuffed media requests for evidence, saying since Nov. 15 that he would release it broadly to the public, but he hasn't. He suggested today that he might do so in a few more months. \n Upset that Democrat Hillary Clinton defeated him in the popular vote, Trump has repeatedly blamed that result on illegally cast or counted votes but offered no substantiation. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have completed their election results with no reports of the kind of widespread fraud that Trump alleges. \n WHAT ABOUT TRUE THE VOTE? \n Phillips is a board member of True the Vote, a conservative group that has challenged the validity of voter rolls in numerous states. Tax records from 2014 show the group reported raising nearly $1.2 million and having an estimated 50,000 volunteers. \n It was founded by Catherine Engelbrecht, who also started the tea party group the King Street Patriots. That organization drew national attention in 2010 after sending hundreds of observers to Houston-area polling stations, spurring complaints of intimidation from minority rights groups. \n Engelbrecht said today that she believes millions of people illegally voted in the last election but also acknowledged \"there is no way to confirm that at this point.\" She said the group still lacks voter files from many states but hopes to begin releasing findings by late spring. \n King Street Patriots is in a legal battle over Democratic efforts to release the identity of its donors. The case is set to go before the Texas Supreme Court next month. \n WHAT'S NEXT? \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer said this week that Trump will take executive action to launch an investigation into voting fraud. The Republican who leads the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, said he's seen no evidence of fraud in the 2016 election and his committee will not investigate it. Chaffetz, however, said Trump is free to order the Justice Department to investigate the issue. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fact check: New Trump salvo on voter fraud lacks evidence"}

{"date": "January 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump met with British Prime Minister Theresa May, today, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump today pledged America's \"lasting support\" to the U.S.' historic \"special relationship\" with Britain after he emerged from his first meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, leader of an ally who seeks to nudge the populist president toward the political mainstream. \n May, who said the meeting was the start to building their relationship, announced that Trump had accepted an invitation from Queen Elizabeth II for a state visit later this year with his wife, first lady Melania Trump. \n Trump sought to charm May, noting during his first news conference as president that, \"by the way, my mother was born in Scotland.\" \n \"I am honored to have the prime minister here for our first official visit from a foreign leader,\" Trump said, standing alongside May in the ornate White House East Room. \"This is our first visit so, great honor.\" \n He added that the United States and the United Kingdom have \"one of the great bonds.\" \n \"We pledge our lasting support to this most special relationship,\" Trump said during brief opening remarks. \"Together, America and the United Kingdom are a beacon for prosperity and the rule of law.\" \n May thanked Trump for inviting her to visit so soon after his inauguration last Friday and said their meeting was an indication of the strength and the importance of maintaining good relations between the trans-Atlantic allies. She said there was \"much on which we agree.\" \n \"Today's talks, I think, are a significant moment for President Trump and I to build our relationship,\" May said. \n The Trump-May meeting came a day after Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto called off his own trip to Washington next week amid wrangling over who will pay for Trump's planned wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. \n Trump's spokesman said the president would seek a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports to pay for the barrier, then later clarified that such a tax would be a possible approach. \n May's meeting with the president is being hailed by the British government as a sign that the trans-Atlantic \"special relationship\" is valued by the new administration. \n Before answering questions from a few journalists, Trump welcomed May to the Oval Office where he promptly showed off a bust of Winston Churchill, one of her predecessors. \n \"It's a great honor to have Winston Churchill back,\" Trump said. The bust had been moved from the Oval Office to another part of the White House when Barack Obama held the office. \n Trump and May were seen holding hands briefly as they walked along the White House colonnade before the news conference. Afterward, they resumed their talks while dining in the State Dining Room on iceberg wedge salads, braised beef short ribs and salted caramel creme brulee. \n May's visit, so soon after Trump's inauguration, has been criticized by her political opponents, and risks being overshadowed by the flood of announcements, plans and proposals coming out of the White House. On Thursday, May was repeatedly asked about Britain's stance on torture \u2014 the U.K. has condemned it \u2014 after Trump said he thinks torturing terrorism suspects works. \n Trump is something of a mystery to world leaders, many of whom expected Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the election. They also don't know his administration's main interlocutors with foreign governments, including son-in-law Jared Kushner and senior adviser Steve Bannon, a conservative media executive. \n So May is a bit of a scouting party \u2014 or guinea pig \u2014 among global politicians. \n She has strong reasons for wanting the relationship to work. Britain is set to leave the European Union and its 500 million-person single market. A trade deal with the U.S., Britain's biggest export market, is a major prize. \n Trump has drawn parallels between Britain's choice to leave the EU and his own success, using the Brexit vote to bolster his derision of the 28-nation bloc and his preference for striking bilateral agreements. \n That puts May in an awkward spot. She wants a good relationship with Trump, but does not share his disdain for the EU, saying it's in Britain's interests that it succeed. \n Trump and May both addressed a Republican retreat Thursday in Philadelphia, though their visits did not overlap. During his remarks to lawmakers, Trump bemoaned the fact that Wilbur Ross, his nominee to be commerce secretary, would not be confirmed in time for a visit that was expected to focus heavily on trade. \n May's speech alternated between saluting Trump's vision for what she called American \"renewal\" and reminding him, and his Republican colleagues, of the United States' global responsibilities. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump pledges 'lasting support' to U.S. relations with Britain"}

Defense Secretary James Mattis today ordered reviews of two key Air Force aircraft programs that have been criticized by President Donald Trump as too expensive. \n WASHINGTON >> Defense Secretary James Mattis today ordered reviews of two key Air Force aircraft programs that have been criticized by President Donald Trump as too expensive. \n Mattis asked Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work to conduct a review of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program to find ways to \"significantly reduce\" the costs. He said the review should compare the F-35 with the F/A-18 Super Hornet and determine if an upgraded Hornet could be a cost-effective alternative that also meets requirements. \n Mattis also asked for a review of the presidential aircraft program \u2014 known as Air Force One \u2014 to identify cost savings. Boeing is slated to build two new planes to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. The new aircraft would go into service around 2024. \n Mattis' orders come after Trump's tweets in December revealing that he asked Boeing to \"price-out\" a comparable Super Hornet became of cost overruns in Lockheed Martin's F-35. \n The stealthy F-35 has a nearly $400 billion price tag. Three versions for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy are being built, and other countries, including Israel, are buying the fighter jet. \n Despite the huge cost, the program has strong bipartisan support in Congress, where lawmakers view the aircraft as essential to U.S. national security. \n Trump also tweeted last month that the costs of the new Air Force One were \"out of control.\" He demanded: \"Cancel order!\" \n Last March, the Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. The Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at about $4 billion, when research and development, construction and future maintenance were included. \n The Air Force has pressed for a faster replacement schedule, saying the aging current Boeing 747s are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. \n While Mattis, Trump and the Pentagon can push for deep cuts or even try to cancel the program, Congress controls the government's purse strings and makes final budget decisions. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pentagon orders cost reviews of F-35 fighter, Air Force One"}
