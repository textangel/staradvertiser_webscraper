Top congressional Republicans, however, remain largely behind the new president. \n During a round of Sunday show interviews, Trump's aides stressed that just a small portion of travelers had been affected by the order, which temporarily bars the citizens of seven majority Muslim nations from entering the country. The aides also reversed course and said that citizens of those countries who hold permanent U.S. residency \"green cards\" will not be barred from re-entering the country, as officials had previously said. \n \"I can't imagine too many people out there watching this right now think it's unreasonable to ask a few more questions from someone traveling in and out of Libya and Yemen before being let loose in the United States,\" insisted Trump's chief of staff Reince Priebus. \"And that's all this is.\" \n As of this afternoon, one legal permanent resident had been denied entry to the country as a result of the order, according to a federal law enforcement official. The official was not permitted to discuss the order's impact publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. \n The changes, said White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, are \"a small price to pay\" to keep the nation safe. \n But it's unclear whether the order, which also suspends refugee admissions for 120 days and indefinitely bars the processing of refugees from Syria, will accomplish that. The order does not address homegrown extremists already in America, a primary concern of federal law enforcement officials. And the list of countries in Trump's order doesn't include Saudi Arabia, where most of the Sept. 11 hijackers were from. \n Priebus said that other countries could be added to the list. \n The order has sparked widespread protests and denunciations from Democrats and a handful of Republicans. Many have accused the administration of rushing to implement the changes, resulting in panic and confusion at the nation's airports. \n \"You have an extreme vetting proposal that didn't get the vetting it should have had,\" said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who urged the new president to \"slow down\" and work with lawmakers on how best to tighten screening for foreigners who enter the United States. \n \"In my view, we ought to all take a deep breath and come up with something that makes sense for our national security\" and reflects the fact that \"America's always been a welcoming home for refugees and immigrants,\" he said. \n The comments came the morning after a federal judge in New York issued an emergency order temporarily barring the U.S. from deporting people from the seven majority Muslim nations subject to Trump's 90-day travel ban. The judge said travelers who had been detained had a strong argument that their legal rights had been violated. \n The order barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. It also covered anyone with an approved refugee application. \n The Department of Homeland Security, however, said the court ruling would not affect the overall implementation of the White House order. \n \"President Trump's executive orders remain in place \u2014 prohibited travel will remain prohibited, and the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety,\" the department said in a statement. \n Top congressional Republicans, meanwhile, were backing Trump despite concerns raised from a handful of GOP lawmakers. \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he supports more stringent screening mechanisms, though he cautioned that Muslims are some of the country's \"best sources in the war against terror.\" \n \"I think it's a good idea to tighten the vetting process But I also think it's important to remember that some of our best sources in the war against radical Islamic terrorism are Muslims, both in this country and overseas,\" he said. \n He also stressed the need \"to be careful as we do this,\" and said it would be up to the courts to decide \"whether or not this has gone too far.\" \n Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, meanwhile, warned of unintended consequences, expressing fear the order could \"become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.\" \n \"This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security,\" they wrote. \n Trump billed his sweeping executive order as a necessary step to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to the U.S. \n Koch political network, which is among the most influential players in the conservative movement, also condemned the plan today. \n \"The travel ban is the wrong approach and will likely be counterproductive,\" network co-chairman Brian Hooks said in a statement. \"We believe it is possible to keep Americans safe without excluding people who wish to come here to contribute and pursue a better life for their families.\" \n Priebus was on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and Portman was on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" while McConnell appeared on ABC's \"This Week.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "White House: Immigration order 'small price' for safety"}

The official comment came after May said during a meeting Saturday with Turkish leaders the decision was a matter solely for the U.S. \n Her main political rival, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, called for Trump to be banned from visiting Britain until the temporary travel restrictions are rescinded. \n A petition on the British Parliament's website attracted hundreds of thousands of signatures backing its call for Trump, who has been invited to meet Queen Elizabeth II, to be barred on the basis of misogyny and vulgarity. \n German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has drawn fire for her government's welcoming refugee policies, also regretted the ban. \n Merkel raised the issue during a phone call with Trump Saturday, citing the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention that calls on signatories to take in people fleeing war, spokesman Steffen Seibert said. \n \"She is convinced that even the necessary, resolute fight against terrorism doesn't justify putting people of a particular origin or particular faith under general suspicion,\" Seibert said. \n He said Germany's government \"will now examine what consequences the U.S. government's measures have for German citizens with dual citizenship and, if necessary, represent their interests toward our American partners.\" \n The order Trump issued Friday includes a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program. \n Influential Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr reacted by suggesting all Americans should be forced out of Iraq in retaliation, according to a statement from his office. \n The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, also was sharp in her criticism of Trump's move. \n \"All men are first and foremost human beings, with their inalienable rights,\" Mogherini wrote in a blog post. She added: \"It feels so strange that we need to restate this, just days after Holocaust Remembrance Day.\" \n In contrast, nationalist and far-right groups in Europe applauded the restrictions and said they should be used a model for the continent. \n The Dutch anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders said in a tweet: \"Well done POTUS it's the only way to stay safe + free. I would do the same. Hope you'll add more Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia soon.\" \n The far-right National Democratic Party in Germany celebrated \"the massive restriction on the entry of pseudo-refugees and Muslims to the USA.\" \n In Italy, the leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League party also expressed admiration. \"What Trump's doing on the other side of the ocean, I'd like it done also here,\" Matteo Salvini told reporters. \n Referring to the hundreds of thousands of asylum-seekers and economic migrants rescued while crossing the Mediterranean and brought to Italy in recent years, Salvini said there is \"an invasion underway which needs to be blocked.\" He is pressing for early elections and courting other far-right leaders for a possible campaign coalition. \n Italy's Interior Minister Marco Minniti, who had held top security roles in recent governments, warned against \"equating immigration and terrorism.\" \n \"Let's be careful,\" he said in a speech Sunday to officials from the main government coalition party, the Democrats. \"Dissatisfaction and marginalization becomes the culture terrain of terrorism.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump ban inspires anger, applause across world"}

{"date": "January 29, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Students Allie Trojano, front, and Deron Noel, rear, work on dessert projects during a class at the New England Culinary Institute in Montpelier, Vt. \n MONTPELIER, Vt. >> With enrollment in culinary institutes in decline and programs across the country closing their doors, schools such as the New England Culinary Institute in Montpelier, Vermont, which graduated celebrity chef Alton Brown, and the Culinary Institute of Charleston, South Carolina, are committed to staying relevant and in demand. \n \"We're constantly looking for new ways and opportunities to grow our school,\" said Michael Carmel, head of culinary arts in Charleston. \"It's not necessarily a numbers game, but a quality game. We need to stay current with trends and have to be able to offer our students opportunities.\" \n The reasons for the challenges facing the industry are varied, Carmel and others say. Tuitions can be relatively expensive, while federal financial aid for these \"career colleges\" has tightened since 2014. Graduates with a high debt load often move into low-paying restaurant jobs. \n In addition, there is an abundance of restaurant positions that provide on-the-job training for those looking to get into the business without accruing debt. Carmel said younger students aren't necessarily seeking the high stress factor and long hours of restaurant work, instead placing a high value on a regular schedule, benefits and quality of life issues like time with family. \n Despite the challenges, schools like the New England Culinary Institute, where enrollment has fallen from about 800 in 1999 to around 300 today, are consolidating, cutting expenses where possible and adjusting curriculum to attract students. The school is also expanding instruction about the business side of the industry. \n \"Even our founding chef has always said a chef is a businessman,\" said Philip Stevens, spokesman for the Institute. \n New England's school, which co-founder and former president Fran Voigt recently announced was facing imminent sale but remains optimistic of remaining in Vermont, two years ago partnered with the United States Coast Guard and Sandals Resorts to teach new cooking techniques, another way to expand its reach. \n Carmel's program is also taking steps to attract more students. The Culinary Institute of Charleston, which has seen enrollment fall by 25 percent over the past three years, has begun reaching into high schools to offer college-credit programs, and partnering with local restaurants and the Metro Chamber of Commerce to assist with student tuition. \n He hopes those steps will halt the enrollment decline, adding: \"We believe it will level out within the next few years.\" \n Other schools have not been as fortunate, with many well respected culinary programs shutting their doors. Le Cordon Bleu was founded in the 1800s in Paris. With that school, which Julia Child attended, will remain open, the last of the 16 Cordon Bleu programs across the U.S. have ceased new enrollment and are closing. \n In Minnesota alone, three of the five major culinary schools have announced they are shutting down. Southern New Hampshire University's culinary program announced earlier this month that the culinary program will likely be eliminated, noting that enrollments have dropped by more than a third and applications are down 29 percent over the last four years. A final decision is expected in February. \n \"This is not just an SNHU phenomenon, it is a national trend, and even better known culinary programs than ours are contracting,\" University President Paul LeBlanc said in a recent statement. SNHU's overall enrollments are strong and growing, he said, \"but Culinary stands in stark contrast and in steep decline.\" \n Rick Smilow, president and CEO of the Institute of Culinary Education in New York, said students cannot get the same level of training in a timely manner when learning on the job. Culinary school, he said, provides a \"breadth and depth of training that, while possible to get on the job, would typically take years.\" \n While acknowledging the restaurant labor shortage, Smilow still sounded optimistic for the industry. \n \"The best restaurants are still looking for the level of commitment and curiosity that a young cook demonstrates by going to culinary school,\" he said. \n The challenges don't appear to be discouraging culinary students like Sandra Curiel, 18, of Los Angeles, who was helped by a full tuition scholarship to attend New England Culinary Institute's certificate program. \n \"It's hard work but you know it's something that I love to do and I want to do that for the rest of my life,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Culinary schools struggle with enrollment decline"}

She didn't know how many people had been released. \n About 3,000 protesters holding signs and chanting \"no hatred, no fear, immigrants are welcome here\" and \"let them in\" gathered Saturday evening and continued demonstrating into early Sunday morning. \n Roeder said the crowd dispersed shortly after midnight, but that about 30 to 35 were arrested during the demonstration and face various misdemeanor charges. She said there were no injuries or damage to the facilities. \n The Port of Seattle Commissioners, which oversees the airport, issued a statement criticizing the executive order. \n NEW YORK \n Cries of \"Let them in!\" rose up from a crowd of more than 2,000 people protesting at John F. Kennedy Airport, where 12 refugees were detained Saturday. Celebrities including \"Sex and the City\" actress Cynthia Nixon joined the demonstration. \"What Donald Trump did in the last 24 hours is disgusting, disgraceful and completely un-American and I'm here in protest,\" said protester Pamela French. The agency that runs the airport tried to restore order by shutting down the train that runs to airport terminals. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, reversed that decision, saying people had a right to protest. \"The people of New York will have their voices heard,\" he said in a statement. \n NEWARK, NEW JERSEY \n More than 120 people clutching signs denouncing the Trump immigration orders gathered at Newark Liberty International Airport. NorthJersey.com reports that they joined lawyers who'd rushed to the airport to defend the rights of refugees and immigrants who were being detained and denied entry. \n FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA \n Dozens of protesters inside Washington Dulles International Airport chanted \"Love, Not Hate, Makes America Great\" and \"Say It Loud, Say it Clear, Muslims Are Welcome Here,\" as travelers walked through a terminal to a baggage claim area to collect luggage and greet their loved ones. There was a heavy police presence during the peaceful protest. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said during a press conference at Dulles that he has asked Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring to look into \"all legal remedies\" available to help individuals who may be detained in Virginia. \n DENVER \n Dozens of people converged on Denver International to show their support for refugees. Standing in the main terminal Saturday, they sang \"Refugees are welcome here.\" Some held signs declaring their identity, such as Jew or Christian, and the phrase \"I come in peace.\" Denver has some direct international flights but it wasn't clear whether anyone has been detained under the president's executive order. \n CHICAGO \n A crowd of demonstrators held a rally at O'Hare International Airport. The Chicago Sun-Times reports protesters blocked vehicle traffic to O'Hare's international terminal for a time. The newspaper says some arriving travelers joined the protest, while others were upset by the demonstrations. \n Lawyers working with the International Refugee Assistance Project tell the Chicago Tribune that 17 people who had been detained at O'Hare all released by late Saturday. \n Among those released before the federal judge's order was Hessan Noorian, a suburban Park Ridge resident returning with his family from Iran, the Tribune reported. \n Noorian, who is of British and Iranian citizenship and has a green card, was detained at O'Hare after he and his wife, Zahra Amirisefat, a U.S. citizen, arrived from Tehran, the newspaper said. \n The couple, who told the Tribune that they work at a community college in the Chicago area, said they were questioned for five hours. \n After Noorian was released, his wife told the Tribune: \"I can't believe something like this can happen to someone with a green card.\" \n DALLAS \n Protesters who gathered at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport Saturday evening voiced their displeasure with Trump's executive order. The crowd of a few dozen ballooned into hundreds of demonstrators who frequently chanted \"Set them free!\" At times, cheers erupted from the crowd as those who were detained got released. \n Among those still held at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport at midnight Saturday was a 70-year-old Iranian widow, Shahin Hassanpour, whose son said she suffers from high blood pressure and had breast cancer surgery four years ago. She obtained an immigrant visa in November on her son's petition. \n Bahzad Honarjou, a 43-year-old network engineer, said he spoke twice to his mother by phone after her 9 a.m. arrival, but that they hadn't talked since courts stayed the executive order, meaning she should have been released. \n Hundreds of protesters stood in the waiting area and chanted \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \n Immigration agents were not being very communicative, Honarjou said. \n \"They were like a machine when I talked to them today,\" he said. His mother only speaks a few words of English and a fellow passenger was translating for her from her native Farsi as no immigration agents spoke the language, he said. \n Hassanpour was originally going to be deported on a Sunday flight, she informed her son the first time they spoke. \n \"She was about to cry,\" he said. \"She is not able to take (tolerate) a 20-hour flight back to Iran.\" \n Honarjou said he is a U.S. citizen, obtained entry in a lottery, and has been in the country for seven years. Why did he come? \n \"To have a better life and to make more money,\" he said. \"And, you know, for the freedom.\" \n PORTLAND, OREGON \n A protest by several dozen people in and around Portland International Airport briefly disrupted light rail service at the airport. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the demonstrators carried signs and chanted \"Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here\" and \"No ban no wall America is for us all.\" \n LOS ANGELES \n About 300 people expressed their displeasure with the ban at Los Angeles International Airport Saturday night.
