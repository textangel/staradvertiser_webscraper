Inmates used \"sharp instruments\" to assume control of the building at the James T. Vaughn Correction Center on Wednesday, taking three prison guards and a woman counselor hostage. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n More State Troopers arrive on scene as all Delaware prisons went on lockdown late Wednesday due to a hostage situation unfolding at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna, Del. \n SMYRNA, Del. >> Police used a backhoe to breach a building at Delaware's largest prison early today, ending what the governor called a \"torturous\" hostage standoff that left one guard dead. \n Inmates used \"sharp instruments\" to assume control of the building at the James T. Vaughn Correction Center on Wednesday, taking three prison guards and a woman counselor hostage. The inmates told a local newspaper that concerns about their treatment and the leadership of the United States had prompted their actions. \n Authorities did not say how Sgt. Steven Floyd died. He was a 16-year veteran with the prisons agency. During the standoff, inmates negotiated to have the water turned on, which authorities said the prisoners used to fill up small foot lockers to build a wall at the prison entryways. \n Delaware State Police entered the building about 5:05 a.m. today and found Floyd unresponsive. He was pronounced dead about 25 minutes later. \n The counselor, a Department of Correction employee, was rescued. Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security Robert Coupe said some inmates had shielded her from harm. She is being examined at a hospital. \n Coupe described the inmates' weapons as \"sharp instruments\" but did not elaborate. \n \"My prayers all day yesterday was that this event would end with a different result but it didn't,\" Gov. John Carney said. \"So today all of us mourn for the family of Sgt. Floyd.\" \n The prison is in Smyrna, about 15 miles north of the state capital of Dover. \n The governor said the priority now is to determine what happened and why. \n In a statement released today, the new Democratic governor said officials will \"hold accountable anyone who was responsible\" for taking the hostages. He said officials will \"make whatever changes are necessary to ensure nothing like it ever happens again.\" \n It wasn't immediately clear whether any inmates had been held against their will. Coupe said all 120 inmates in the building were considered suspects while Department of Correction Commissioner Perry Phelps said dozens of inmates had been \"released\" during the standoff. \n The disturbance began about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday when a correctional officer inside Building C radioed for immediate assistance, Delaware State Police spokesman Sgt. Richard Bratz said. Other officers responded to help, and the employees were taken hostage, he said. \n A news release from the Delaware Department of Correction said 14 more inmates were released about 12:30 a.m. today from the building where the hostages had been held and were being held elsewhere at the prison. The news release said a total of 46 inmates had been released from the building since the standoff began. \n The hostage situation drew dozens of officers and law enforcement vehicles and prompted a statewide lockdown of all prisons. The first hostage was released Wednesday afternoon and another was released hours later. Both had injuries that are not life-threatening, authorities said. \n Three maintenance workers who had been hiding in the basement were able to make their way to the roof, where they were rescued, Phelps said. \n Earlier in the day, inmates reached out to The News Journal in Wilmington in two phone calls to explain their actions and make demands. Prisoners funneled the calls to the paper with the help of one inmate's fiancee and another person's mother. The mother told the paper that her son was among the hostages. \n In that call, an inmate said their reasons \"for doing what we're doing\" included \"Donald Trump. Everything that he did. All the things that he's doing now. We know that the institution is going to change for the worse.\" \n That caller said education for prisoners was the inmates' priority. They also said they want effective rehabilitation for all prisoners and information about how money is allocated to prisons. \n According to the department's website, the prison is Delaware's largest correctional facility for men, with about 2,500 inmates. It houses minimum, medium and maximum security inmates, and also houses Kent County detainees awaiting trial. \n It employs 1,500 corrections officers, according to Bruce Rogers, counsel for the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware. \n In 2004, an inmate at the Smyrna prison raped a counselor and took her hostage for nearly seven hours, according to an Associated Press report at the time. A department sharpshooter later shot and killed 45-year-old Scott Miller, according to the report, ending the standoff. \n Associated Press writers Sarah Rankin in Richmond, Virginia, David Dishneau in Hagerstown, Maryland, and Sarah Brumfield in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police use backhoe to breach Delaware prison, end standoff; 1 dead"}

{"date": "February 1, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump listened as he was introduced during the National Prayer Breakfast, today, in Washington. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n National Security Adviser Michael Flynn spoke during the daily news briefing at the White House in Washington Wednesday. Flynn said the administration is putting Iran \"on notice\" after it tested a ballistic missile. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump said today his administration has put Iran \"on notice,\" echoing comments from his top national security adviser that the U.S. will act against Iran unless it stops testing ballistic missiles and supporting Houthi rebels in Yemen. \n Trump and his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, didn't elaborate on what retaliatory actions the U.S. could pursue. \n Trump tweeted, \"Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile. Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!\" \n He added in another tweet: \"Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a lifeline in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion.\" \n As part of the nuclear deal struck during the Obama administration, Iran received access to an estimated $100 billion of its own money that had been frozen in foreign bank accounts. The U.S. did not give Iran $150 billion. \n Flynn on Wednesday forcefully denounced Iran's behavior in his first public remarks since Trump took office. He accused Iran of threatening U.S. allies and spreading instability throughout the Middle East while faulting the Obama administration for doing too little to stop the Islamic Republic. \n \"As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice,\" Flynn said from the White House podium. \n On notice for what, Flynn didn't say. Senior Trump administration officials said they were actively considering a \"range of options\" including economic measures and increased support for Iran's regional adversaries. The officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, declined repeatedly to say whether military action is being considered. \n The warning was an early manifestation of Trump's promise of a tougher American approach to Iran. Yet administration officials emphasized that their allegations were unrelated to Iran's obligations under the Iran nuclear deal that President Barack Obama and world leaders negotiated. Though Flynn noted Trump has criticized that deal, officials declined to say whether Trump planned to follow through on his campaign pledge to renegotiate it. \n \"The Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran's malign actions \u2014 including weapons transfers, support for terrorism and other violations of international norms,\" Flynn said. \n The White House also faulted Iran for backing Houthi rebels in Yemen who on Tuesday claimed a successful missile strike against a warship belonging to a Saudi-led coalition fighting to reinstall Yemen's internationally recognized government. The media arm of the Shiite rebels said the vessel was believed to belong to the Saudi Arabian navy. \n Administration officials said Iran was providing key support by arming, training and financing the rebels, with a goal of leveraging its relationship with the Houthis to \"build a long-term presence in Yemen.\" \n The White House said the goal in putting Iran \"on notice\" was to signal to Tehran that it needed to rethink its behavior. Flynn said Iran specifically violated the U.N.'s ban on \"activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.\" \n Iran's Defense Minister Gen. Hossein Dehghan confirmed Wednesday that Iran conducted a missile test, but did not say when the test was carried out or specify the type of missile. He insisted it wasn't a violation of U.N. resolutions. \n The U.S. said the test was of a medium-range ballistic missile. It ended with a \"failed\" re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, said a U.S. defense official, who wasn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n Reports of the test emerged after Trump signed an executive order last week temporarily suspending immigration from Iran and six other majority-Muslim countries. \n On one point, the U.S. and Iran agree: The test didn't violate the nuclear deal itself. \n Ballistic missile testing wasn't explicitly included in the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers. But as part of the final negotiations, Iran agreed to an eight-year extension of a U.N. ban on ballistic missile development. The U.N. Security Council later endorsed the agreement, calling on Iran not to carry out such tests. But Iran has flouted the prohibition regularly in the past year-and-a-half, drawing sanctions from the U.S. but also diplomatic cover from Russia. \n At the request of the U.S., the U.N. Security Council held a session Tuesday to address the missile test. The council referred the matter to its committee on Iran and asked for an investigation. \n Iran has long boasted of having missiles that can travel 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles), putting much of the Middle East, including Israel, in range. Such capability would also put U.S. bases in the region in danger. Iran says its missiles are key to deterring a U.S. or Israeli attack. \n In March, Iran test-fired two ballistic missiles. One was emblazoned with the phrase \"Israel must be wiped out\" in Hebrew, sparking international outcry. \n Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump puts Iran 'on notice' after ballistic missile test"}

{"date": "February 1, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaks to the media in May 2016 during a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia. Turnbull said Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump had agreed during a weekend telephone conversation to keep an Obama administration promise to resettle an undisclosed number of mostly Muslim refugees held on the impoverished nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea. \n CANBERRA, Australia >> Australia's prime minister insisted Thursday that a deal struck with the Obama administration that would allow mostly Muslim refugees rejected by Australia to be resettled in the United States was still on, despite President Donald Trump dubbing the agreement \"dumb\" and vowing to review it. \n The conflicting messages came hours after The Washington Post published a story detailing a tense exchange between Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during their first telephone call as national leaders. \n The newspaper reported that during the call, an angry Trump dubbed the agreement \"the worst deal ever\" and accused Turnbull of seeking to export the \"next Boston bombers\" \u2014 a reference to Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, U.S. citizens born in Kyrgyzstan, who set off two bombs at the 2013 Boston marathon. \n Turnbull declined to comment on the report, which also said Trump abruptly ended the expected hour-long conversation after 25 minutes as the Australian attempted to steer the conversation to other topics. \n \"It's better that these things \u2014 these conversations \u2014 are conducted candidly, frankly, privately,\" Turnbull told reporters. Later, however, he denied during an interview with Sydney radio station 2GB that Trump had hung up on him, saying the conversation had ended \"courteously.\" \n Turnbull told reporters the strength of the relationship between the two nations was evident in that Trump had agreed to honor the deal to resettle refugees from among around 1,600 asylum seekers, most of whom are on island camps on the Pacific nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Australia has refused to accept them and instead pays for them to be housed on the impoverished islands. \n \"I can assure you the relationship is very strong,\" Turnbull said. \"The fact we received the assurance that we did, the fact that it was confirmed, the very extensive engagement we have with the new administration underlines the closeness of the alliance. But as Australians know me very well: I stand up for Australia in every forum \u2014 public or private.\" \n Yet shortly after Turnbull made those comments to reporters, Trump took to Twitter to slam the deal. \n \"Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why?\" Trump tweeted. \"I will study this dumb deal!\" \n Australians \u2014 accustomed to the friendly relationship they have long enjoyed with the U.S. \u2014 were transfixed by the drama. The Washington Post story shot to the top of the nation's trending topics on Twitter, and was plastered across the top of Australia's major news sites. \n The country's news networks launched running commentaries on it, debating how Turnbull should respond and what the spat meant for the future of the longtime allies' relationship. \n Trump, who a day before the conversation with Turnbull had signed an executive order suspending the admission of refugees, complained during the call that he was \"going to get killed\" politically by the deal, the newspaper reported, citing anonymous officials. \n \"I don't want these people,\" Trump reportedly said. Trump also told Turnbull that he had spoken to four world leaders that day and that: \"This is the worst call by far.\" \n Trump told Turnbull that it was \"my intention\" to honor the agreement, a phrase designed to leave the president wriggle room to back out of the deal, the newspaper reported. \n There have been mixed messages from Washington all week on the state of the agreement. \n White House spokesman Sean Spicer confirmed on Wednesday that Trump had agreed to honor the deal. \n But a White House statement sent to Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Thursday said: \"The president is still considering whether or not he will move forward with this deal at this time.\" \n The U.S. State Department said in a statement later Thursday that the United States would honor the agreement \"out of respect for close ties to our Australian ally and friend.\" \n \"President Trump's decision to honor the refugee agreement has not changed and Spokesman Spicer's comments stand,\" the State Department said. \n The ABC spoke to senior Australian government sources who said The Washington Post report was \"substantially accurate.\" \n Australian officials said the conversation was \"robust\" and \"shorter than expected,\" while one minister told the ABC that \"Trump hates this deal.\" \n Opposition leader Bill Shorten called on Turnbull to be open about his interaction with Trump, saying The Washington Post version of the call was worrying. \n \"We shouldn't be finding out about what's happening to Australian policy through the news of foreign countries,\" Shorten said. \n Turnbull has likened himself to Trump in that both are wealthy businessmen who came to politics late in life. Turnbull also has a reputation for blunt conversation and tough negotiations behind closed doors. \n Turnbull has resisted pressure this week to join other Western leaders in condemning Trump's temporary ban of immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. \n \"When I have frank advice to give to an American president, I give it privately, as good friends should, as wise prime ministers do when they want to ensure they are best able to protect Australians and Australia's national interest,\" Turnbull told reporters on Tuesday. \n Some observers suspect Turnbull has held his tongue because he is grateful to Trump for agreeing to honor the refugee deal. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump slams 'dumb' refugee deal with Australia"}

The event was canceled out of safety concerns after protesters hurled smoke bombs, broke windows and started a bonfire. \n BERKELEY, Calif. >> Protesters hurled smoke bombs, broke windows and started a bonfire prompting University of California at Berkeley officials to cancel a talk Wednesday by a polarizing editor of Breitbart News out of safety concerns. \n The decision was made two hours before the appearance of Milo Yiannopoulos (yuh-NAH'-poh-lihs) because a crowd of more than 1,500 had gathered outside the venue, the university said in a statement. \n \"Of paramount importance this evening was the campus's commitment to ensure the safety and security of those attending the event, the speaker, those who came to engage in lawful protest, as well as members of the public and the Berkeley campus community,\" it said. \n UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulos said there are no immediate reports of arrests or serious injuries. \n The 32-year-old right-wing provocateur is a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and a self-proclaimed internet troll whose comments have been criticized as racist, misogynist, anti-Muslim and white supremacist.

The university has stressed it did not invite him and does not endorse his ideas but is committed to free speech and rejected calls to cancel the event. \n \"The event has been cancelled,\" Yiannopoulos posted on his Facebook page. \"I'll let you know more when the facts become clear.

Trump discussed the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, setting up a fierce fight with Democrats over a jurist who could shape America's legal landscape for decades to come. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump threatened in a phone call with his Mexican counterpart to send U.S. troops to stop \"bad hombres down there\" unless the Mexican military does more to control them itself, according to an excerpt of a transcript of the conversation obtained by The Associated Press. \n The excerpt of the call did not make clear who exactly Trump considered \"bad hombres,\" \u2014 drug cartels, immigrants, or both \u2014 or the tone and context of the remark, made in a Friday morning phone call between the leaders. It also did not contain Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's response. \n Still, the excerpt offers a rare and striking look at how the new president is conducting diplomacy behind closed doors. Trump's remark suggest he is using the same tough and blunt talk with world leaders that he used to rally crowds on the campaign trail. \n A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. \n The phone call between the leaders was intended to patch things up between the new president and his ally. The two have had a series of public spats over Trump's determination to have Mexico pay for the planned border wall, something Mexico steadfastly refuses to agree to. \n \"You have a bunch of bad hombres down there,\" Trump told Pena Nieto, according to the excerpt seen by the AP. \"You aren't doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isn't, so I just might send them down to take care of it.\" \n A person with access to the official transcript of the phone call provided an excerpt to The Associated Press. The person gave it on condition of anonymity because the administration did not make the details of the call public. \n The Mexican website, Aristegui Noticias, on Tuesday published a similar account of phone call, based on the reporting of journalist Dolia Estevez. The report described Trump as humiliating Pena Nieto in a confrontation conversation. \n Mexico's foreign relations department denied that account, saying it \"is based on absolute falsehoods,\" and later said the statement also applied to the excerpt provided to AP. \n \"The assertions that you make about said conversation do not correspond to the reality of it,\" the statement said. \"The tone was constructive and it was agreed by the presidents to continue working and that the teams will continue to meet frequently to construct an agreement that is positive for Mexico and for the United States.\" \n Trump has used the phrase \"bad hombres\" before. In an October presidential debate, he vowed to get rid the U.S. of \"drug lords\" and \"bad people.\" \n \"We have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out,\" he said. The phrase ricocheted on social media with Trump opponents saying he was denigrating immigrants. \n Trump's comment was in line with the new administration's bullish stance on foreign policy matters in general, and the president's willingness to break long-standing norms around the globe. \n Before his inauguration, Trump spoke to the president of Taiwan, breaking long-standing U.S. policy and irritating China. His temporary ban on refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, aimed at reviewing screening procedures to lessen the threat of extremist attacks, has caused consternation around the world. \n But nothing has created the level of bickering as the border wall, a centerpiece of his campaign. Mexico has consistently said it would not pay for the wall and opposes it. Before the phone call, Pena Nieto canceled a planned visit to the United States. \n The fresh fight with Mexico last week arose over trade as the White House proposed a 20 percent tax on imports from the key U.S. ally to finance the wall after Pena Nieto abruptly scrapped his Jan. 31 trip to Washington. \n The U.S. and Mexico conduct some $1.6 billion a day in cross-border trade, and cooperate on everything from migration to anti-drug enforcement to major environmental issues. \n Trump tasked his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner \u2014 a real estate executive with no foreign policy experience \u2014 with managing the ongoing dispute, according to an administration official with knowledge of the call. \n At a press conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May last week, Trump described his call with Pena Nieto as \"friendly.\" \n In a statement, the White House said the two leaders acknowledged their \"clear and very public differences\" and agreed to work through the immigration disagreement as part of broader discussions on the relationship between their countries. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writer Mark Stevenson in Mexico City contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump to Mexico: Take care of 'bad hombres' or U.S. might"}

{"date": "February 1, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis., joined by Rep. Scott Tipton, R-Colo., meets with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017, following GOP strategy session. \n WASHINGTON >> Moving to dismantle former President Barack Obama's legacy on the environment and other issues, House Republicans approved a measure Wednesday that scuttles a regulation aimed at preventing coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby streams. \n Lawmakers also voted to rescind a separate rule requiring companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments relating to mining and drilling. \n Republicans said the votes were first in a series of actions to reverse years of what they see as excessive government regulation during Obama's presidency. Rules on fracking, guns and federal contracting also are in the cross-hairs as the GOP moves to void a host of regulations finalized during Obama's last months in office. \n \"Make no mistake about it, this Obama administration rule is not designed to protect streams. Instead, it was an effort to regulate the coal mining industry right out of business,\" said Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Ohio, who sponsored the disapproval measure on the stream protection rule. \n The House approved the measure, 228-194. Nine Republicans voted against repeal, while four Democrats supported it. \n Lawmakers approved the financial disclosure measure, 235-187. \n The rule, which grew out of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, was intended to promote transparency so citizens in some of the world's most impoverished countries can hold their governments accountable for the wealth generated through mining and drilling. \n Republicans said the regulation placed an unfair burden on U.S. companies by requiring them to hand over key details of how they bid and compete while many foreign competitors are under no obligation to do the same. The GOP said the cost of compliance is estimated at $590 million a year \u2014 money that could be used to help produce more oil, gas and mineral resources. \n Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said the only reason to repeal the disclosure rule was \"to help corrupt governments steal money from their people.\" \n Republicans voted to repeal the Obama-era rules using the Congressional Review Act, an obscure oversight tool that could become more familiar in the coming weeks as Congress uses it to overturn regulations federal agencies issued late in Obama's presidency. \n The law hastens the process for bringing legislation to the floor and removes the hurdle of a 60-vote threshold in the Senate. Regulations imposed since June 13 can be invalidated on a simple majority vote of both GOP-led chambers and the president's signature. \n What's more, the law prevents the executive branch from imposing substantially similar regulations in the future. \n It is that aspect of the law that frightens environmental groups that have fought for years for the coal-mining rule and another rule to restrict energy companies from burning off natural gas during drilling operations on public lands. \n Using the review act to overturn a federal regulation \"is like burning down your house because you don't like the paint color,\" said Jenifer Collins, a clean water advocate for the environmental group Earthjustice. \n Collins calls the review act \"an extreme and blunt instrument\" that essentially prevents federal rule-makers from addressing a topic once Congress has acted. \n But House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans blame Obama, saying the rules Congress is rescinding are poorly crafted and hurt people. \n \"The stream protection rule is really just a thinly veiled attempt to wipe out coal mining jobs,\" Ryan, R-Wis., said. \n \"The Department of Interior's own reports show that mines are safe and the surrounding environment is well-protected,\" Ryan said, adding that the stream-protection rule ignores dozens of federal, state and local regulations already in place. \n The Interior Department said in announcing the rule in December that it would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests, preventing coal mining debris from being dumped into nearby waters. The rule maintains a long-established 100-foot buffer zone that blocks coal mining near streams, but imposes stricter guidelines for exceptions to the 100-foot rule. \n Interior officials said the rule would cause only modest job losses in coal country and could even create jobs as companies hire construction crews to haul and store debris. \n Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, senior Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, said repealing the stream protection rule would \"sicken and kill the very people Donald Trump falsely promised to help,\" coal miners in West Virginia and other states. \n Rep. John Yarmuth, D-Ky., displayed a bottle of brownish water he said came from a constituent's well near a surface coal mine.

In comparison, more than 52.3 million pounds of pork bellies \u2014 the cut of the hog from which bacon is derived \u2014 remained in storage in December 2015. \n \"Veterans of the industry say clearly this is record-breaking stuff,\" said Russell Barton, a market reporter for protein analyst firm Urner Barry. \"December is the lowest on record. They really haven't ever seen a situation like this before.\" \n Pork bellies are usually stockpiled in freezers at the end of the year and the first few months of the next year to get through the summer peak months when bacon consumption is highest, Barton said. This season, bacon demand was high enough that fresh pork bellies were used as quickly as they were produced, leaving significantly less meat to store. \n Prices at the wholesale level already are showing an increase. Tuesday's pork belly prices were at $1.71 a pound, about 37 percent higher than this time last year, Barton said. Retail bacon prices haven't jumped significantly but could climb as the industry works to catch up. \n \"What this says is there was excellent product movement in the fourth quarter of 2016,\" said Steve Meyer, a pork industry economist for Express Markets Inc., which tracks industry trends for retailers and foodservice companies. \n Meyer isn't concerned about the short-term stockpile shortage because he expects pork production to increase about 3 percent this year. \n The popularity of bacon has increased as the pork industry has figured out new ways to sell the product. To keep pace with increased pork demand, the industry is building at least four new processing plants in Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri and Michigan in the next few years. \n The variety of bacon treats has soared in recent years to include delicacies such as jalapeno bacon, bacon apple pie, doughnuts with bacon and chocolate chocolate-covered slices, said Brooks Reynolds, an Iowa commercial insurance agent who created the Blue Ribbon Bacon Festival, which attracts more than 10,000 bacon enthusiasts to Des Moines on Feb. 18. \n \"People will pay what it costs to buy bacon because they love it,\" he said. \n Demand also has increased as bacon has become an ingredient in menu options at restaurants including Subway and Bruegger's Bagels, and as McDonald's started selling breakfast all day. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pork industry says not to worry about a bacon shortage"}

{"date": "February 1, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A Facebook Live billboard on the side of a building near New York's Penn Station. From billboards to TV ads to endless notifications, Facebook is furiously promoting its live video feature as it tries to get more users to shoot and watch such videos. \n NEW YORK >> From billboards to TV ads to endless notifications, Facebook is furiously promoting its live video feature as it tries to get more users to shoot and watch such videos. \n But will it be a big business for the social network? The prospects for advertisers are uncertain, and even when users do \"go live\" \u2014 broadcasting their toddler's first steps to family or showing footage from protests around the world, for instance \u2014 their friends often don't see it until after the fact, just like any other recorded video. \n So why all the big fuss? \n FISHING FOR USERS IN THE LIVE STREAM \n Some analysts believe it's just another in Facebook's ongoing efforts to keep people attached to its service as long as possible. \"It's a usage thing \u2014 keeping them engaged, keeping them on Facebook, giving them an avenue to share,\" says eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson. \"As long as Facebook can be successful with that, it can show ads to them.\" \n As is its custom, the company is first pushing the service to as many of its 1.8 billion users as possible. Users get special notifications when their friends go live, and ads prompting them to do the same have been prevalent in the last few weeks. \n But making money off live streams isn't easy, starting with the fact that they offer few opportunities to display video ads. But that's OK, Williamson says, arguing that now is the time for marketers to experiment with the feature. \n Some are already doing just that \u2014 not by advertising on other live broadcasts, but by streaming themselves. General Motors, for example, was the first automaker to livestream on Facebook, rolling out its Chevy Bolt EV at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show. \n LIVE FROM EVERYWHERE \n Mobile video, especially live video, is already transforming how we experience the world online, whether that means puppies and kittens or witnessing crime , social unrest and other world events. We can stream official channels and news, as well as individual people's perspectives in a way that was not possible just a few years ago. \n Last October, Facebook started an ad campaign featuring real users doing weird, quirky but generally upbeat stuff live with the goal of introducing more, possibly reluctant users to the feature. Think: pile of teddy bears, girl singing with a guitar, someone recording lightning in the distance. \n While the company isn't disclosing data on how many users have gone live or watched a live video, anecdotally at least it seems to be catching on \u2014 somewhat. The company says people comment more than 10 times more on live videos than on regular ones, and that the number of people broadcasting live at any given minute has grown by fourfold since last May. Facebook gave regular users the ability to create live videos in April. \n News outlets live streamed the presidential debates, as well as election night and Donald Trump's inauguration and Tuesday's Supreme Court nomination. Users, meanwhile, are broadcasting from sports events, protests and their living rooms. \n Live video provides \"an immediate, synchronous conversation experience,\" says Forrester Research analyst Melissa Parrish. Tools that increase the \"immediacy of interaction,\" such as messaging platforms, are growing more and more popular. \n At the same time, live videos that have gotten outsize attention \u2014 those showing police shootings, for instance \u2014 are not exactly good PR for the company. While the vast majority of live streams don't involve violence or crime, Williamson says the negative connotations are \"definitely a red flag and could cause advertisers to take a second look on whether it makes sense for them.\" \n LESS IS MORE? \n Facebook warned last year that \"ad load\" \u2014 that is, the number of ads it can push in front of users without clogging up their feeds \u2014 is unlikely to keep increasing. After all, the company can't keep endlessly shoving more advertisements before users without souring them on the experience. To maintain growth, Facebook needs higher-priced ad products. \n Live video, Parrish says, is a good platform for that. Even if advertisers themselves are not yet \"going live\" with their own videos, splicing ads into live broadcasts could be a lucrative option to reach highly engaged eyeballs. \n There's another upside for live video: anecdotally, it is popular with young users, the generation that's following millennials, according to Parrish. For Facebook, this could be a good way to fend off criticism that it's losing popularity with the younger set. \n On Wednesday, Facebook blew past Wall Street's expectations again with its quarterly earnings report, despite some concerns that its ad load has reached its limit. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $3.56 billion, up sharply from $1.56 billion in the same period a year earlier. \n On a per-share basis, the Menlo Park, California-based company said it had net income of $1.21, up from 54 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $1.41 per share in the latest quarter. The company posted revenue of $8.81 billion, up 51 percent from $5.84 billion a year ago. \n Facebook's monthly user base, meanwhile, grew 17 percent to 1.86 billion. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Why Facebook keeps pushing you to go 'live' with video"}

{"date": "February 1, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon arrives for a meeting with President Donald Trump on cyber security in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> People are beginning to pay more attention to the man behind the curtain. \n It is a mark of Steve Bannon's extraordinary sway in the Trump White House that a man who has spoken so little in public over the past two weeks is getting so much credit \u2014 and blame \u2014 for what's going on. \n The conservative media executive's fingerprints are on virtually every significant move taken by President Donald Trump, from Trump's sweeping order to suspend the country's refugee program and block visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries to the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. \n Trump raised eyebrows and hackles when he gave Bannon a seat on a powerful National Security Council. Bannon, a shaggy-haired agitator-turned-insider eager to make a lasting mark on Washington, was a strong advocate for Gorsuch, according to a person who spoke with him recently. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss a private conversation. \n Bannon's early moves to consolidate power haven't come without pushback. \n In a phone call Monday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Acting Secretary of State Tom Shannon asked the White House to take a back seat in cleaning up confusion caused by the chaotic rollout of the immigration order, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about internal government discussions. \n Still, the extent of Bannon's influence was underscored by Trump's striking decision over the weekend to add his name to the roster of the National Security Council, not typically the province of political advisers. \n \"Steve's the main ideological mover of the administration. He's the chief ideological officer and he has a strong point of view,\" said Christopher Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax and a friend of the president. \"I think the bond is their world view.\" \n The 64-year-old Bannon shares Trump's business and media experience, as well as his dramatic flair. He's a fellow disruptor who helped Trump capitalize on the populist anger and frustration that propelled them both to the White House. \n Rarely seen or heard during Trump's campaign, Bannon is now a fixture. \n If Trump is moving quickly to overthrow the established order, Bannon is the one fomenting rebellion. \n If White House chief of staff Reince Priebus is there to maintain order and focus, Bannon is there to wage war. \n \"He wants to be the intellectual, strategist bomb-thrower,\" says former House Speaker and informal Trump adviser Newt Gingrich, who sees Bannon as the perfect ally to the president in disrupting the status quo. \"He does not want to be the guy who makes the trains run on time.\" \n Bannon has cultivated a near-diabolical image in his rare, headline-making interviews. \n He recently told The New York Times he sees the media as \"the opposition party,\" and advised the press to \"keep its mouth shut\" after it underestimated Trump. \n \"Darkness is good,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter shortly after Trump's win. \"Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That's power.\" \n As Trump's chief strategist and senior counselor, Bannon had a hand in crafting the president's inaugural address and in selecting his Cabinet. He's bringing in aides from the conservative Breitbart media empire where he ruled before Trump tapped him to direct his campaign. \n Trump's move to add Bannon to the National Security Council has drawn howls from Democrats and even some Republicans. Bernie Sanders called it \"dangerous and unprecedented.\" Republican Sen. John McCain called it a \"radical departure\" from recent history. Former Clinton adviser Robert Reich called Bannon \"nuts and malicious.\" \n Former deputy campaign manager David Bossie, who introduced Trump to Bannon in 2011, says the two got to know each other as Trump appeared multiple times on Bannon's Breitbart radio show over the ensuing years. \n \"They believe in each other's agendas, which is why they have grown so close,\" says Bossie. \n Still the two are an unusual match. While Trump is not an avid reader, Bossie describes Bannon as \"a carnivore of books\" who's always reading and talking history \u2014 ancient Greece, the Civil War, World War II and more. \n Bannon took over Breitbart News after the sudden death of its founder in 2012 left people wondering what would become of the website. By then, the former U.S. Navy officer and Harvard MBA had left behind Goldman Sachs and investment banking, capitalized on an entertainment deal that left him with a share of \"Seinfeld\" royalties, founded an institute to ferret out government corruption and created a number of his own films, including paeans to Sarah Palin, the tea party movement and Ronald Reagan. \n Under Bannon's guidance, Breitbart grew into one the right's most powerful voices as it took on establishment Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan. Critics, however, accused Bannon of allowing the website to become a platform for the white nationalist sentiments of the alt-right \u2014 a charge Bannon has denied. \n His politics appear to skew closer to European, right-wing views than the typical American conservative agenda. He's described himself as an \"economic nationalist\" and has long advocated for closing off the nation's borders. We're in the midst of an \"outright war,\" he's said, \"between \"jihadist Islamic fascism\" and the \"Judeo-Christian West.\" \n Critics see more self-interest than devotion to conservatism in Bannon's history. \n \"He's really good at ingratiating himself to prominent people,\" says Ben Shapiro, a former Breitbart editor who's now a Bannon critic. Shapiro lists Palin, former Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and website founder Andrew Breitbart as past subjects of Bannon's attention. After Breitbart died, adds Shapiro, Bannon began using the website to promote Trump \u2014 \"and then he was able to use that to enter into the halls of power.\" \n Another critic, Ben Howe, a filmmaker and conservative blogger who once considered Bannon a mentor and friend, says that while Bannon cultivates the unassuming, rumpled look in public, \"he's nothing like that behind the scenes,\" talking nonstop and screaming at those who cross him. \n Bannon, he says, \"just looks at Trump as a good vehicle to get into power so that he can accomplish his objectives.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Little heard in public, Bannon is quiet power in Oval Office"}

{"date": "February 1, 2017", "text": "COURTESY USGS \n The lava stream, pouring out of the lava tube on the sea cliff at the Kamokuna ocean entry. \n A dramatic \"firehose\" stream of molten lava continued to shoot out of a sea cliff Wednesday on Hawaii Island, splashing into the Pacific Ocean below and exploding upon impact. \n The massive Kilauea flow is coming from a lava tube at the Kamokuna ocean entry on the southeast side of the Big Island. The lava is gushing from a tube that was exposed when a huge, 26-acre lava delta collapsed into the ocean at the site on New Year's Eve. The collapse of the newly formed land triggered massive explosions and giant waves in the area. \n The lava stream, dubbed a \"firehose\" flow because it shoots lava outward from the source, started out as a drizzle coming down the sea cliffs after the New Year collapse, but has recently increased in intensity. The molten lava is now arching out and falling about 70 feet to the ocean below. \n When the molten lava hits the cool seawater, it reacts, causing explosions that can throw large chunks of hot rock and debris inland, where people hike in to see the lava, and seaward, where tour boats cruise the shoreline. \n Captains are constantly watching the cliffs and lava to keep their passengers safe, said tour boat owner Shane Turpin, who runs Lava Ocean Tours. \"We've never had an incident,\" he said. \"We're always watching for what the cliff is doing. Is it moving? Are the rocks rolling down the cliff? We can actually see the changes throughout the day.\" \n Turpin described this flow as a \"special,\" saying it \"is definitely the most dramatic firehose event I've ever witnessed in the last three decades of viewing lava.\" \n On land, the National Park Service is responsible for visitor safety and has restricted the areas that people can go to view the flow, but Turpin said he sees people on the cliff edge where they shouldn't be on a daily basis. \n Lava bench collapses can happen at any time without warning and if someone was on the edge during a collapse \"it would likely be a fatality,\" said Cindy Orlando, Superintendent of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. \n Despite signs and roped-off areas, people still cross the boundaries and go to the edge of the cliffs near the lava flow, Orlando said. \n Park rangers have recently issued citations to people who cross into prohibited areas, but Orlando said it is nearly impossible to prevent everyone from breaking the rules. \n One of the biggest concerns is a large \"hot crack\" in the rock above the firehose flow, said USGS geologist Janet Babb. The crack runs parallel to the sea cliff and makes the surrounding land susceptible to collapse. When the large delta collapsed on December 31, it sent hot rocks and lava spatter flying into the air and giant waves outward. \n \"The seaward side of that crack could fall away,\" Babb, who works at the Hawaii Volcano Observatory, said. \"That is of great concern because if it does, it's going to drop a lot of hot rock into the water and hot rock mixing with cool seawater makes for explosive interactions.\" \n The steam plume created by the lava reaching the water is also a concern. \"It's super-heated steam laced with hydrochloric acid from the interaction with the seawater and has shards of volcanic glass,\" she said. \"It's something to be avoided.\" \n Babb said that this firehose event is unusual because it has lasted so long. Usually when a flow opens up like this, the lava quickly builds new land below and plugs the entry. \n \"In this case, there's no evidence of a new delta is forming, which leads us to believe that the offshore topography there is very steep,\" Babb said. \n Kilauea has been erupting continuously since 1983, and the most recent vent flow that is reaching the ocean has been ongoing since last summer. \n \"There's no indication of it slowing down or stopping,\" Babb said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Massive lava stream exploding into ocean off Big Island"}

The reports were made to California's Department of Motor Vehicles, which posted them online. \n The documents catalog the number of times from December 2015 through the end of November that humans took control from a car's software for safety-related reasons. \n Waymo, as Google's self-driving car project was recently rebranded, did far more testing than the other 10 companies combined. \n Waymo reported that its fleet drove itself more than 635,000 miles with 124 safety-related \"disengagements\" \u2014 the equivalent of two incidents every 10,000 miles. That was a notable improvement over the prior year, when there were eight incidents per 10,000 miles. \n A reportable disengagement happens when the technology fails or the backup driver takes control out of concern the car is malfunctioning. \n Though imperfect, the data are the best peek the public gets into the fiercely competitive world of self-driving cars and how the prototypes are performing. California required the disengagement reports as part of regulations governing testing on public roads. Separately, the state also requires companies to report any collisions involving its cars. \n The Department of Motor Vehicles has been working on regulations that will define how the technology can be rolled out to the public when companies believe it is ready. When that will happen depends on several factors, including regulators' readiness and company confidence the vehicles are safe. \n While Tesla's Elon Musk has been bullish, talking about months rather than years, companies such as Waymo have suggested 2017 or 2018 is more realistic. \n The state expects to release final version of the \"public operation\" regulations within six weeks, according to Melissa Figueroa, a spokeswoman for California's top transportation official. \n The Department of Motor Vehicles made public a first draft in December 2015, nearly a year after final rules were supposed to be in place, and has since revised the language based on developments at the federal level and input from industry and other groups. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Data: Self-driving cars needing less human help than in past"}

Ben Cardin, the Foreign Relations Committee's top Democrat, says he feared Tillerson would be a \"yes man\" and would not be able to prevent Trump from pursuing a misguided foreign policy that leads the country \"on a march of folly.\" \n But Republicans had the numbers to push Tillerson's nomination through. They got help from several Democrats who crossed party lines. \n Tillerson's ties to Russia and his stand on sanctioning Moscow have been a point of contention. \n 2:40 p.m. \n A spokesman for Andrew Puzder says the Labor secretary-nominee is working to divest his assets so he can take office as part of President Donald Trump's Cabinet. \n Puzder says he is \"fully committed to becoming secretary of Labor.\" \n In a statement to The Associated Press, Puzder says he's looking forward to his confirmation hearing, which has been postponed at least three times. \n Spokesman George Thompson says Puzder's work to divest assets is complicated because his fast food empire, CKE Restaurants Inc., is a private company. \n The statement comes as Democrats and their allies opposed to Puzder's nomination have raised questions about his fitness for the post. \n Puzder still has not turned in the required paperwork detailing his plan to avoid conflicts of interest. \n 2:25 p.m. \n Two Republican senators have announced their opposition to Betsy DeVos for education secretary. \n Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska both say they cannot support DeVos, a wealthy Republican donor and school choice activist. Both said in Senate floor speeches today that DeVos' commitment to the nation's public schools is in question in light of her long-held support for vouchers and charter schools. \n If all other GOP senators support DeVos as expected, and all Democrats oppose her, she would end up with a 50-50 vote in the Senate and Vice President Mike Pence would have to break the tie to confirm her. \n 12:01 p.m. \n Democrats temporally thwarted a Senate confirmation vote on President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency by boycotting a key committee meeting. \n The seats reserved for the 10 Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee were empty as today's meeting to discuss to nomination of Scott Pruitt was called to order. Committee rules require that at least two members of the minority party be present for a vote to be held. \n Chairman John Barrasso accused the absent Democrats of engaging in obstruction amounting to nothing more than \"political theater.\" After recessing, the Wyoming Republican pledged to \"do what is necessary\" to advance Pruitt's nomination, raising the possibility the GOP majority may seek a rules change to push the issue to a vote before the full Senate. \n 11:25 a.m. \n The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general after angry exchanges between Republicans and Democrats. \n The 11-9 vote was along party lines. All the panel's Democrats voted against the nomination. \n The Alabama Republican is expected to be confirmed by the full Senate. Republicans have been strongly supportive of their colleague, arguing that he will follow the law and maintain traditional independence from President Donald Trump, if needed. \n Democrats have expressed doubts that he would be able to say no to the president since he was one of his earliest and strongest defenders in the presidential campaign. \n They also expressed concerns about whether Sessions would be committed to civil rights, a chief priority of the Obama administration. \n 11:10 a.m. \n Tempers flared in the usually decorous Senate as the Judiciary Committee weighed a vote on attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions. \n Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota and Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas traded charges today over previous committee testimony. \n Franken said he wanted to set the record straight and complained that his integrity had been abused. \n Cornyn interrupted Franken as Republicans tried to move ahead and vote on the nominee. \n 10:50 a.m. \n The top Democrat on a Senate panel responsible for advancing President Donald Trump's pick to head the White House budget office says she needs time to examine the results of a routine FBI investigation before she can vote on Rep. Mick Mulvaney's nomination. \n Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill says she gained access to Mulvaney's FBI file just a half-hour before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee vote today morning. Mulvaney is a Missouri Republican tapped to lead the Office of Management and Budget. \n The vote has been postponed by not rescheduled. Mulvaney faces a Budget panel vote on Thursday. \n Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain is a critic of Mulvaney's prior House votes on Pentagon spending, but he said after the hearing that he would have voted to advance Mulvaney. \n 9:50 a.m. \n A Senate committee has approved President Donald Trump's picks for Health and Treasury secretaries after majority Republicans suspended the panel's rules. The rule they suspended requires at least one Democrat to be present for votes. It was the latest escalation in partisan tensions in the new Congress. \n The Senate Finance Committee approved Georgia GOP Rep. Tom Price to become Health secretary and financier Steve Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary by a pair of 14-0 votes. \n Democrats boycotted the meeting, demanding time to ask more questions about both nominees. Democrats say there were unresolved questions about both nominees' financial backgrounds. \n 7 a.m. \n President Donald Trump's nomination of Rex Tillerson for secretary of state is headed toward Senate confirmation after several Democrats crossed party lines to back the former Exxon Mobil CEO. \n The vote on Tillerson, scheduled for today, comes as tension builds among congressional Republicans and Democrats over Trump's executive order on immigrants and refugees. The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, said the order would be a litmus test for Trump's remaining Cabinet choices, and that any who refuse to reject the \"horrible\" new policy should be opposed. \n But Democrats lack the numbers in the Senate to block Tillerson from becoming the nation's chief diplomat. Republicans hold a four-seat advantage and during a procedural vote Monday on the nomination, Democrats Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Mark Warner of Virginia cast their ballots for Tillerson.

{"date": "February 1, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A protester hold a sign during a protest of President Donald Trump's executive order banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen, at the Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia. \n Days into an administration that promised to govern by upheaval, Donald Trump's White House has been the target of massive protests, defied reporters who questioned fact-challenged statements and issued a blur of lightning-rod executive actions. The speed and depth of it all have left many Americans apprehensive: Even some who longed for a shake-up are unsettled by a sense of chaos it has unleashed. \n \"We're in a very fragile state right now,\" said Margaret Johnson of Germantown, Maryland, who runs a small translation business. \"We don't know what's coming next. The country's divided. There's a lot of fear. And I think we're kind of at that point where things can go any kind of way, and it's really hard to say which way they're going to go.\" \n That uncertainty finds an echo in Pastor Mike Bergman's church in Adrian, Missouri, 40 miles south of Kansas City, where many congregants count themselves as conservatives and embrace the new administration's order cutting off funding to international groups that provide abortions. But as church members consider another order \u2014 restricting refugees and pausing entry to the U.S. from several Muslim-majority countries \u2014 worries about security are tempered by concern about the needs of refugees and whether Trump's rhetoric is widening the gulf between Americans, Bergman said. \n \"There is worry about how deep the divide is going to run. There is worry about some of the political rhetoric \u2026 about how all that is going to cause the divide in the community to deepen and more bitterness to spring up between the people of our country. I wouldn't say we're really optimistic right now,\" he said. \n Trump is hardly the first president to take office promising wholesale change in the face of substantial skepticism. But Kevin Boyle, a professor of American history at Northwestern University, said the new administration has put itself at the center of an extraordinary political moment. \n Boyle hears echoes of the Ronald Reagan era in Trump's attempts to alter the role of government; this administration's willingness to play on division rather than serve as a calming influence is reminiscent of Richard Nixon. The mass protests since inauguration day are reminiscent of some of the upheaval of the 1960s. Still, Boyle said, the tensions swirling around Trump's administration are unique. \n \"I cannot in my adult life think of a moment that compares to this,\" he said. \"The level of tension between these two competing visions of the country needs to be resolved in some way or another.\" \n Trump's actions have unsettled Suzanne Kawamleh, 24, a graduate student born in Chicago to parents who emigrated from Syria. On Saturday night, Kawamleh said, she joined protesters outside the terminal at O'Hare International Airport to protest the executive order stopping Syrian refugees from entering the country. The next day, she told a crowd gathered at the county courthouse in Bloomington, Indiana, about how her relatives had fled Syria by boat and ended up in a refugee camp before finding refuge in Germany. \n Last year, Kawamleh said, she and her father were taken off a flight for questioning when they returned from Lebanon to do relief work in a refugee camp. But that scrutiny, she said, pales with Trump's executive order, which forced a family friend from Syria who had flown to the U.S. to visit a sick relative to return to the Middle East on Saturday. \n \"Immediately after the order, everything changed. There wasn't a chance to plead your case,\" she said. \"It seems like everything is very in flux. People don't know what's going on.\" \n Over the last week, teacher Dee Burek has led discussions with the seventh- and eighth-graders in her debate and journalism classes about Trump's first days as president. Students were dismayed when they read about false statements by White House press secretary Sean Spicer and by an interview with Trump adviser Steve Bannon in which he compared himself to Darth Vader. \n When one girl compared Trump to Dolores Umbridge \u2014 a character from the Harry Potter series who provokes a student revolt after issuing a series of harsh decrees \u2014 classmates nodded in agreement, Burek said. \n \"As a teacher I'm trying to present both sides, as I always have to, and when I deal with the children and I'm reading articles to them (about the Trump administration), their faces are in shock,\" said Burek, who teaches in Allentown, New Jersey. \"They just keep coming back to, 'We're America. How could this happen?' And I say I just don't have the answers.\" \n Many Americans say that Trump's moves since taking office are exactly what the country needs. Nonetheless, they are taking note of the pushback. \n Juan Villamizar, a 52-year-old flooring business owner in West Hartford, Connecticut, said he supports Trump's executive order restricting refugees and immigration from seven countries as a way to protect Americans from terrorism. But while he believes the country is headed in the right direction, he is disheartened to see a negative response to Trump's actions. \n \"I just think that the people of this country, the citizens of this country, need to take a really deep breath and read the Constitution,\" he said. \n During the presidential campaign, Brenda Horvath strapped a giant \"Hillary for Prison\" sign to her Logan, West Virginia, front porch, and another that read \"Make America Great Again\" beside it. She isn't opposed to Trump's plans, but thinks the new president could do a better job at presenting his plans with compassion, in a way that doesn't alienate and offend so many. She believes Trump is off to a rocky start, but believes he deserves more time to get on track. \n \"You can listen to the wrong people and do the job wrong. I'm hoping and praying that he'll start listening to the right people,\" she said. \n Yatziri Tovar, a 24-year-old college student in New York who emigrated from Mexico as a toddler, saw the response to Trump in a different light. Though troubled by the initial days of the new administration, she was encouraged to see the activism it has spurred and the people of many backgrounds who have spoken in protest. She felt a duty to speak, too, addressing a weekend rally that she helped organize as a member of an immigrant advocacy group, which drew an estimated 30,000 people. \n \"It's a moment that has a lot of confusion, it has some scary times, but at the same time it has become a time of unity,\" said Tovar, a part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which President Barack Obama instituted to allow young people brought into the country illegally as children to stay and obtain work permits. \n Others hold the protesters, not Trump, responsible for the discord. \n John Fusaro, an immigration officer in Dallas who voted for Trump, said the media and protesters should ease up. \n \"They're trying to sow seeds of doubt and keep stirring the pot,\" he said. \"They're just not giving him a chance.\" \n Fusaro said the upheaval represents a \"new normal\" of constant protests. While he's dubious of the protesters' message, the presence of a niece in their ranks reminds him of the wide gulf in Americans' political views. \n \"She's standing against Trump, out there yelling and stuff, and I'm honestly thinking you don't know the whole picture. I sent her a message: Give it time. It'll sort itself out.\" \n So far, he said, she hasn't responded. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Amid Trump's shake-up, many wondering 'what's coming next'"}

He is our hero.\" \n Since the shooting, Labidi had been soft-spoken, but his voice rose as he spoke about his friend and his struggle living as a foreigner in Quebec City. \n \"We went to university together. He got a PhD in geology \u2014 and he couldn't find a job in this city because his name was Azzeddine Soufiane.\" \n He forged his own path by starting his grocery store, Labidi said. \n \"I didn't want to talk about it because it wasn't the time to do it \u2026 but go to taxi stands and you'll see PhDs and people with master's degrees because we do not find jobs here,\" he said. \n Ahmed El-Ghandouri wiped away tears as he spoke about knowing Soufiane for 35 years and helping him start his grocery store. \n \"This is my second home,\" he said of the mosque. \"But we have to return here.

North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven said, Tuesday, that the Acting Secretary of the Army has directed the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with an easement necessary to complete the Dakota Access pipeline. \n BISMARCK, N.D. >> The acting secretary of the Army has ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to allow construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under a Missouri River reservoir, a North Dakota senator said, the latest twist in the months-long legal battle over the $3.8 billion project. \n The Standing Rock Sioux, whose opposition to the project attracted the support of thousands of protesters from around the country to North Dakota, immediately vowed to return to court to stop it. \n Sen. John Hoeven, a Republican, announced late Tuesday that Robert Speer directed the Army Corps of Engineers to \"proceed\" with an easement necessary to complete the pipeline. President Donald Trump signed an executive order signaling his support for the project a week ago. \n Army spokesman Maj. Gen. Malcolm Frost today said the Army has begun its review. \n \"These initial steps do not mean the easement has been approved,\" Frost said. \n Hoeven spokesman Don Canton said Speer's move means the easement \"isn't quite issued yet, but they plan to approve it\" within days. \n The crossing under Lake Oahe, a wide section of the Missouri River in southern North Dakota, is the final big chunk of work on the pipeline designed to carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. \n The pipeline has been the target of months of protests led by the Standing Rock Sioux, whose reservation lies near the pipeline's route and who have argued that it's a threat to water and tribal artifacts. \n The tribe has vowed to challenge any granting of the easement in court, and Chairman Dave Archambault renewed that vow Tuesday night. \n \"If it does become a done deal in the next few days, we'll take it to the judicial system,\" Archambault said. He added: \"This is a good indicator of what this country is going to be up against in the next four years. So America has to brace itself.\" \n The developer, Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, said the pipeline would be safe. \n An environmental assessment conducted last year determined the crossing would not have a significant impact on the environment. However, then-Assistant Army Secretary for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy on Dec. 4 declined to issue an easement, saying a broader environmental study was warranted. \n Energy Transfer Partners called Darcy's decision politically motivated and accused then-President Barack Obama's administration of delaying the matter until he left office. Two days before he left the White House, the Corps launched an environmental impact study of the crossing that could take up to two years to complete. \n On Jan. 24, just four days after he took office, Trump signed an executive action telling the Corps to quickly reconsider the Dec. 4 decision. \n The company appears poised to begin drilling under the lake immediately. Workers have already drilled entry and exit holes for the Oahe crossing, and the company has put oil in the pipeline leading up to the lake in anticipation of finishing the project, its executive vice president Joey Mahmoud said in court documents filed earlier this month. \n Hundreds and at times thousands of pipeline opponents calling themselves \"water protectors\" have camped on federal land near the crossing site since August, often clashing with police and prompting more than 625 arrests. The camp's population has thinned to fewer than 300 due to harsh winter weather and a plea by Archambault for the camp to disband before the spring flooding season. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Senator: Army Corps told to approve Dakota pipeline easement"}

Neither earned the institute's \"Top Safety Pick\" award, which is given to vehicles that get the highest rating in five different crash tests and offer a crash-prevention system with automatic braking. To get a highest \"Top Safety Pick-Plus\" designation, vehicles must meet all of those criteria and have good headlights. \n In the 2017 model year, 38 vehicles have won the \"Top Safety Pick-Plus\" designation, including two plug-in hybrids: the Toyota Prius Prime and the Chevrolet Volt. But no all-electric vehicles are on the list.

But it earned a lower rating in a small overlap frontal crash test, which replicates what happens when the front corner of the car collides with a tree or telephone poll at 40 miles per hour. The Tesla's safety belt allowed the crash dummy to move too far forward and it hit its head on the steering wheel. \n The institute said Tesla made a production change this month to address the problem, so the car will be tested again. The Model S has earned the highest ratings on U.S. government crash tests, but IIHS performs different tests. \n Tesla also earned a \"poor\" rating for its headlights. And a high-performance version of the Model S, the P100D, got a lower ranking on the roof strength test because its larger battery makes it much heavier, so the roof might not hold up as well in a rollover crash. The government hasn't performed a roof-strength test on the P100D. \n The BMW i3, a small electric car that starts at $42,400, also earned good ratings in four out of five tests.
