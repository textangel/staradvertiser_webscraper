{"date": "February 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Damien Chazelle, director of \"La La Land,\" held his nominee's medallion backstage at the 69th annual Directors Guild of America Awards. \n BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. >> \"La La Land\" director Damien Chazelle waltzed off with the top honor at today's Directors Guild of America Awards. It's the latest stop on the ebullient musical's journey to the Oscars, but it wasn't all song and dance at the annual awards ceremony in Beverly Hills. The evening also took on a more somber, urgent note as many directors and presenters also grappled with President Donald Trump's refugee and immigration ban. \n \"I wanted to celebrate the act of dreaming and what art means. Art does connect people and transcend borders,\" Chazelle said. \"I want to be part of that transnational dialogue of movies.\" \n At 32-years-old, Chazelle, a first-time nominee, is the youngest ever recipient of the DGA feature film award which all but guarantees an eventual Oscar win on Feb. 26. \n Rarely has the DGA winner not gone on to win the directing prize at the Academy Awards. \"La La Land\" recently won the top honor at the Producers Guild Awards and is nominated for a record-tying 14 Oscars. \n Earlier in the evening \"La La Land\" stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling presented Chazelle with the directing medallion. While singing his accolades, like the fact that he shot the musical in 40 days using 35mm film, 93 locations and 1600 extras, Gosling also joked that Chazelle \"directed his own birth in a single take.\" \n Chazelle was up against Barry Jenkins for \"Moonlight,\" Kenneth Lonergan for \"Manchester by the Sea,\" Garth Davis for \"Lion,\" and Denis Villeneuve for \"Arrival.\" All but Davis are also nominated for the Oscar. \n Davis did win the first time director award for \"Lion,\" however. Starring Dev Patel and newcomer Sunny Pawar, \"Lion\" tells the true story of an Indian man who was lost as a 5-year-old and 25 years later used Google Earth to retrace his steps to his hometown and his birthmother, not knowing the name of either. \n \"I had the first half of the film relying on a 5-year-old child who did not speak English,\" Davis said. \"This movie demanded that the whole cast and crew make this film from their hearts.\" \n Nate Parker was also nominated for the first time feature award for \"The Birth of a Nation\" \u2014 the only major awards recognition for his film. \n The Directors Guild also recognizes excellence in directing in documentaries, live, scripted and reality television and commercials. Ezra Edelman won the documentary award for \"O.J.: Made in America\" which he called a \"labor of labor.\" \n Other winners included Steven Zaillian for \"The Night Of,\" Tina Mabry for \"An American Girl Story \u2014 Melody 1963: Love Has to Win,\" Miguel Sapochnik for \"Game of Thrones\" and Becky Martin for \"Veep.\" \n Sir Ridley Scott was also given the 35th Directors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award, presented by Christopher Nolan, Billy Crudup and Michael Fassbender. \n Fassbender described Scott as, \"direct, generous, loyal, competitive \u2026 and a bit of a loner who prefers the company of dogs to most people.\" \n Beyond the self-congratulatory air typical of a Hollywood awards season event, many were compelled to address the refugee and immigration ban as it relates to the entertainment industry and the art it creates. \n Davis said he's spoken to \"a lot of refugees who have said that this film has given them the courage to find their families.\" \n Chazelle praised Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, an Oscar-nominee for his film \"The Salesman\" who said he will not attend this year's Academy Awards because of a travel ban imposed by Trump. \n Farhadi, Chazelle said, \"comes from a country my government tells me I shouldn't be in dialogue with.\" \n Chazelle said that the business of excluding filmmakers or voices is \"inherently anti-art.\" \n So prevalent were politics throughout the evening that even the absence of a political statement required acknowledgement. \n Ridley Scott said, \"I'm not going to talk about politics because there have been a lot of references to politics tonight and I'm best off not talking about it.\" \n But for the most part, directors were eager to condemn the ban. Falling in line with statements from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Writers Guild of America, DGA President Paris Barclay said that \"transcending borders is kind of what we live for.\" The DGA, he noted, was founded by immigrants and said that even Billy Wilder was a refugee. \n \"The DGA will always be a home for all directors,\" Barclay said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'La La Land' continues dance to the Oscars with DGA win"}

{"date": "February 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shook hands at the prime minister's office in Tokyo on Friday. \n TOKYO >> In his debut abroad as the first retired general to lead the Pentagon in more than half a century, Jim Mattis found that in Japan and South Korea his experience in uniform is seen as an asset. \n Not everyone who knows Mattis well in the U.S. shares that view, but he clearly was an instant hit in northeast Asia. \n Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was effusive in his endorsement as the two shook hands Friday before a phalanx of Japanese and international news reporters and cameras. \n \"I was very encouraged,\" Abe said, \"to see someone like you who has substantial experience, both in the military and in security, defense and diplomacy, taking this office.\" \n Mattis won easy confirmation by the U.S. Senate just hours after President Donald Trump's swearing in on Jan. 20. But some had questioned the wisdom of breaking a long American tradition of picking defense secretaries with primarily civilian backgrounds. \n In fact it has been more than a tradition. There is a legal prohibition on appointing a defense secretary who has not been out of uniform for at least seven years. Mattis retired from a 41-year career in the Marine Corps in 2013. The Congress had to pass a bill making a one-time exception for Mattis, who was widely praised as a thoughtful, level-headed leader. \n The only other time in history that such an exception was made was for George C. Marshall, the former Army chief of staff who had served as secretary of state before President Harry Truman picked him as defense secretary in September 1950, at a crucial point in the just-started Korean War. \n Abe noted that Mattis's military career included a stint on Okinawa, which the U.S. returned to Japanese control in 1972 based on an agreement signed a year earlier to end the postwar period of U.S. military control. \n \"So I believe that you are quite familiar with the situation surrounding Japan,\" he said. \n In Seoul, where civilian control of the military has a mixed history, Mattis's counterpart, Han Min Koo, portrayed him as a kindred spirit. Han told reporters he knew why they were able to forge a bond in their very first meeting. \n \"I believe this was possible because we both served as active-duty servicemen for 40-plus years,\" Han said. \n Mattis was not shy, either, about highlighting his military background. In Tokyo he recalled training in Okinawa and elsewhere in Japan as a newly minted lieutenant in 1972. He said he made Japanese acquaintances that have lasted a lifetime. \n Asia is hardly Mattis's forte, however. He spent the bulk of his career focused on the Middle East, including combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also served as NATO supreme allied commander transformation, focused on Europe, from 2007 to 2009. \n In picking Mattis, 66, to lead the Pentagon, Trump seemed enamored of the general's popular nickname, \"Mad Dog,\" as if this served as a warning to the world not to mess with America. \n Mattis, however, insists that the nickname was a media invention that he does not embrace. He certainly came across as anything but \"mad\" or rabid on his visits to Japan and South Korea. He was a picture of sober restraint at his several public appearances, including a news conference Saturday in Tokyo. \n He expressed caution on Iran, saying its adventurism did not mean the U.S. should send more military forces to the Middle East. And he called for diplomacy to address China's militarization of disputed islands and land formations in the South China Sea. \n Even some of his biggest admirers have questioned, however, whether he is the right man for Trump's Pentagon. One such skeptic is Erin Simpson, a noted defense strategist who wrote about a prospective Secretary Mattis last fall, before he had been selected. \n \"Not only does the role of secretary of defense not play to Mattis' strengths,\" she wrote, \"but success in that role would compromise much of what we admire most in him: his bluntness, clarity and single-minded focus on war fighting. The secretary's job is by necessity much more political than all that.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New Pentagon chief an instant hit in Japan, South Korea"}

The rally, held to show interfaith support, featured religious leaders and speakers, including people who have family members in the United States on visas. \n CHICAGO >> Visa holders from seven majority-Muslim countries affected by President Donald Trump's travel ban hurried to board U.S.-bound flights today, fearing they might have only a slim window through which to enter the country after a federal judge temporarily blocked the ban. \n Those who could travel immediately were being urged to do so because of uncertainty over whether the Justice Department would be granted an emergency freeze of the order issued Friday by U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle. The government today suspended enforcement of the week-old ban as it scurried to appeal Robart's order. \n The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court today to set aside a judge's order that temporarily blocked the Trump administration's travel ban. The Justice Department has alerted a court in Washington state that it is appealing the judge's ruling from a day earlier. \n The appeal is to be filed tonight with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. \n The ruling from U.S. District Judge James Robart temporarily halted a Trump administration executive order that suspended America's refugee program and halted immigration to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries. \n President Donald Trump has lashed out at Robart on Twitter, calling him a \"so-called judge.\" \n Rula Aoun, director of the Arab American Civil Rights League in Dearborn, Mich., said her group is advising people to hurry. \n \"We're telling them to get on the quickest flight ASAP,\" said Aoun, whose group filed a lawsuit Tuesday in federal court in Detroit asking a judge to declare Trump's immigration order unconstitutional. \n Aoun said some people have had to make hard choices, including a Yemeni family expected to arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Sunday from Egypt without two of their children. The father and two of the children are U.S. citizens, the mother has an immigrant visa, but the other two children did not yet have theirs and were left behind with relatives. \n \"They just don't want to take a chance of waiting,\" she said. \n U.S. officials have said up to 60,000 foreigners had their visas \"provisionally revoked\" to comply with Trump's order. Confusion during the rollout of the ban initially found green card holders caught in travel limbo, until the White House on Wednesday clarified that they would be allowed to enter and leave the U.S as they pleased. \n Even so, green card holder Ammar Alnajjar, a 24-year-old Yemeni student at Southwest Tennessee Community College, cut short a planned three-month visit to his fiancee in Turkey, paying $1,000 to return immediately when the ban was lifted. \n \"I got to study. I got to do some work,\" said Alnajjar, who arrived at JFK on today. He said he fled civil war in Yemen and moved to the U.S. from Turkey in 2015. \"I'm Muslim. I'm proud of it. Islam means peace.\" \n Although the government suspended enforcement of the travel ban while it sought an emergency stay of Robart's order, some airlines reportedly still weren't letting some people from the seven countries board their planes, at least initially. \n Royal Jordanian Airlines, which operates direct flights from Amman to New York, Chicago and Detroit, said it would resume carrying nationals from the seven countries as long as they presented a valid U.S. visa or green card. \n But in the African nation of Djibouti, immigration attorney Julie Goldberg said a Qatar Airways representative told her that immigrants from all seven countries affected by the ban \u2014 Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen, Iran and Somalia \u2014 were not allowed to fly this afternoon. A Qatar Airways spokeswoman said the airline would begin boarding travelers from those countries. \n Goldberg said she was trying to arrange flights for dozens of Yemeni citizens who have immigrant visas and were stranded there. She said a supervisor at Turkish Airlines told her that people holding immigrant and non-immigrant visas from the seven countries still were being banned unless they had a special email from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection with the person's name and passport number. \n A 12-year-old Yemeni girl whose parents and siblings are U.S. citizens living in California, was finally allowed to depart after \"an hour-and-half of fighting\" with officials, Goldberg said. It was unclear when she would arrive. \n \"Her mother is on pins and needles \u2026 her father is on the plane with her,\" Stacey Gartland, a San Francisco attorney who represented the girl, said in an email. \n Refugees also awaited word on their fates. \n A Somali refugee said about 140 refugees whose resettlement in the U.S. was blocked by Trump's executive order were sent back to their refugee camp and it was unclear if or when they could travel. \n Nadir Hassan said the group of Somali refugees was relocated to Dadaab camp in eastern Kenya today. They had been expected to settle in the U.S. this week and had been staying at an International Organization for Migration transit center in Nairobi. \n \"I was hoping to start a new life in the U.S.\" Hassan said. \"We feel bad.\" \n The State Department has advised refugee aid agencies that refugees who had been scheduled to travel before the order was signed will now be allowed into the U.S. A State Department official said in an email obtained by the Associated Press that the government is \"focusing on booking refugee travel through February 17,\" and they were working to have arrivals resume as soon as Monday. \n American businesses affected by the ban also were jumping into action. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who quit Trump's business advisory council this week following criticism of his initial response to Trump's ban, said his company is buying plane tickets for some of its drivers who are stranded, tweeting Friday night that the head of litigation for the ride-hailing app is \"buying a whole bunch of airline tickets ASAP!\" \n Protesters also took to the streets in several cities to protest the ban. Thousands gathered at Denver's City Center Park today, carrying signs, chanting and singing. \n \"I find it utterly cruel that Trump is depriving people of the same dreams my family and I had,\" 17-year-old Zahra Abdulameer told the crowd. She said she came to the U.S. as a refugee from Iraq and is now a U.S. citizen. She said she was welcomed and treated with respect, but fears things could change amid fears over immigrants. \n \"No religion inflicts terror on people, but those who do so in the name of a faith have only twisted its value,\" Abdulameer said. \n Meanwhile, legal advocates waited at airports to offer assistance to new arrivals in case anything went wrong. \n Volunteer attorney Renee Paradis was among 20-25 lawyers and interpreters who stationed themselves inside JFK's Terminal 4 in case anyone arrived Saturday needing help. They were carrying handmade signs in Arabic and Farsi \"that say we're lawyers, we're here to help. We're not from the government,\" Paradis said. \n \"We're all just waiting to see what actually happens and who manages to get through,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Visa holders rush to board flights to U.S. amid reprieve"}

{"date": "February 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Judge James Robart listened to a case at Seattle Courthouse on March 12, 2013 in Seattle. \n Judge James L. Robart, 69, was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush in 2004, following a distinguished 30-year career in private practice that included his selection to the American College of Trial Lawyers, an honor bestowed on less than 1 percent of lawyers. \n The judge made the most high-profile ruling of his tenure Friday when he temporarily invalidated Trump's ban on travel to the U.S. from seven primarily Muslim nations. Washington state sued to block the order \u2014 with support from Minnesota and major corporations including Microsoft, Amazon and Expedia \u2014 arguing that it's unconstitutional and would harm its residents, and Robart held that the state was likely correct. \n The ruling did not sit well with the president, who on Twitter called Robart a \"so-called judge\" and the ruling \"ridiculous.\" The president later falsely claimed the decision meant \"anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.\" \n The comments are unlikely to sway Robart, said those who know him. \n \"Jim will give a wry smile, maybe adjust his bowtie a little bit and go back to doing his business,\" said former Seattle U.S. attorney John McKay, who worked with Robart for a decade at the law firm of Lane Powell Spears Lubersky. \"He's a very careful judge, and he's conservative in the sense he looks at the law and tries to determine what that is, not what he wants. He's conservative in his review of the law, but courageous in his application of it.\" \n Another former Seattle U.S. attorney, Jenny Durkan, called Robart exacting: \"We won some in front of him and we lost some in front of him, but we knew anytime we walked into his courtroom we'd better be prepared.\" \n That was evident Friday when Robart grilled a Justice Department lawyer, Michelle Bennett, asking if there had been any terrorist attacks by people from the seven counties since 9/11. Bennett said she didn't know. \n \"The answer is none,\" Robart said. \"You're here arguing we have to protect from these individuals from these countries, and there's no support for that.\" \n Robart, a graduate of Georgetown Law School, is an expert in patent and intellectual property law, and he issued a landmark decision \u2014 later upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 in a lawsuit between Microsoft and Motorola that provided guidance in how to calculate reasonable rates for use of another company's patents. \n He's considered a tough sentencing judge in criminal matters, especially in cases involving white-collar defendants, and he has overseen reforms at the Seattle Police Department since 2012, when it agreed to make changes in response to Justice Department findings that its officers were too quick to use force, especially in low-level situations. \n Robart was holding a hearing in that case in summer 2015 \u2014 a time fraught with tension over violence by and against police officers around the country \u2014 when he surprised the courtroom by adopting the mantra of protesters. \n \"The importance of this issue to me is best demonstrated by the news,\" he said, shaking his head and sighing heavily. \"According to FBI statistics, police shootings resulting in death involve 41 percent black people, despite being only 20 percent of the population living in those cities. Forty-one percent of the casualties, 20 percent of the population: Black lives matter.\" \n Robart donated to the state Republican party and to GOP candidates before becoming a judge, but was picked for the bench with the help of a bipartisan selection panel. He helped lead his law firm's efforts to provide free legal services to those who couldn't afford them, and he served as president of Seattle Children's Home, which offers mental health services and special education for at-risk children. \n And as U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., noted during his confirmation hearing, he and his wife had fostered six children themselves. \n Robart drew high praise from Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, who cited his \"exceptional qualifications\" and his work representing southeast Asian refugees. \n \"Working with people who have an immediate need and an immediate problem that you are able to help with is the most satisfying aspect of the practice of law,\" Robart said then. \"If I am fortunate enough to be confirmed by the Senate, I will take that experience to the courtroom with me, recognize that you need to treat everyone with dignity and with respect, and to engage them so that when they leave the courtroom they feel like they had a fair trial and that they were treated as a participant in the system.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Seattle judge derided by Trump known as conservative jurist"}

His remarks echoed President Donald Trump's comments from earlier in the week in which the president urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to \"go nuclear\" and scrap longstanding rules requiring 60 votes if Democrats move to block Gorsuch. \n A least one Democratic senator has vowed to block Gorsuch's nomination as payback for McConnell's decision to wait until after the Nov. 8 election to fill the opening created by the February 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The Senate held no hearings or votes on the Supreme Court candidate that President Barack Obama put forward. \n Trump on Tuesday announced Gorsuch, 49, a judge on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, as his choice to succeed the conservative Scalia. \n Pence said Gorsuch had already met with 12 senators from both political parties and is willing to meet with all 100 senators.

{"date": "February 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People hold a banner as they take part in a protest march in London, against U.S. President Donald Trump's ban on travellers and immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries entering the U.S., Saturday, Feb. 4, 2017. \n WASHINGTON >> The Justice Department has appealed a judge's order temporarily blocking President Donald Trump's refugee and immigration ban, saying it's the \"sovereign prerogative\" of a president to admit or exclude aliens in order to protect national security. \n The appeal filed late today at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, cites a \"basic principle that an alien seeking initial admission to the United States requests a privilege and has no constitutional rights regarding his application.\" \n The Justice Department asked that the federal judge's order be stayed pending resolution of the appeal. It says the ban is necessary \"to ensure that those approved for admission do not intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism.\" \n Earlier today, the government officially suspended enforcement of the ban in compliance with the judge's order, which plunged the new administration into a crisis that has challenged both Trump's authority and his ability to fulfill campaign promises. \n That stand-down marked an extraordinary setback for the White House. Only a week ago, the president had acted to suspend America's refugee program and halt immigration to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries that the government said raise terrorism concerns. \n The appeal says the temporary restraining order by U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle is a broad overreach of judicial authority. \n \"Judicial second-guessing of the President's national security determination in itself imposes substantial harm on the federal government and the nation at large,\" it says. The order also imposes harm on U.S. citizens \"by thwarting the legal effect of the public's chosen representative,\" it says. \n On Twitter, Trump mocked Robart, appointed by President George W. Bush, as a \"so-called judge\" whose \"ridiculous\" ruling \"will be overturned.\" He added in a subsequent tweet: \"Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision.\" \n Trump's direct attack recalled his diatribes during the campaign against a federal judge of Mexican heritage who was overseeing a Trump University case. Justice Department lawyers could be called upon to answer for his words as the travel ban case is judged by higher courts. \n The ban has caused unending confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the United States, prompting protests across the United States and leading to multiple court challenges. Demonstrations took place outside the White House, in New York and near Trump's estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where he was spending the weekend and attending an annual American Red Cross fundraising gala. \n \"We'll win,\" Trump told reporters tonight. \"For the safety of the country, we'll win.\" \n The State Department, after initially saying that as many as 60,000 foreigners from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen had their visas canceled, reversed course on Saturday and said they could travel to the U.S. if they had a valid visa. \n The department on Saturday advised refugee aid agencies that refugees set to travel before Trump signed his order will now be allowed into the United States. A State Department official said in an email obtained by the Associated Press that the government was \"focusing on booking refugee travel\" through Feb. 17 and working to have arrivals resume as soon as Monday. \n The Homeland Security Department no longer was directing airlines to prevent visa-holders affected by Trump's order from boarding U.S.-bound planes. The agency said it had \"suspended any and all actions\" related to putting in place Trump's order, which the White House argued was \"intended to protect the homeland.\" \n Trump made clear what he thought of Robart's action. \n \"The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned,\" Trump tweeted. \"When a country is no longer able to say who can and who cannot come in & out, especially for reasons of safety & security \u2013 big trouble!\" \n After a pause of several hours, the president returned to Twitter: \"What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?\" \n Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, criticized Trump for \"attempting to bully and disparage yet another federal judge\" and said he seemed \"intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.\" \n Trump's rhetoric also could put government lawyers defending his order in a tough spot. \n \"Either they have to defend the statements that Judge Robart is a 'so-called judge,' which you can't do, or they have to distance themselves from the president, who is their boss,\" said University of Pittsburgh law professor Arthur Hellman. \n With legal challenges pending, two prominent Middle Eastern air carriers announced they would resume carrying passengers from the seven affected countries. Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways, national carrier of the United Arab Emirates, said U.S.-bound travelers from those countries with valid visas would be allowed to board. \n In Egypt, Cairo airport and airline officials said they have received instructions from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to suspend President Trump's executive order. \n Government-backed Qatar Airways is one of a few Mideast airlines operating direct daily flights to multiple American cities. Its U.S. destinations from its Doha hub include New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and Washington. \n At New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, volunteer lawyer Renee Paradis said most of the flights involving passengers from the affected countries were to arrive later today. \n \"Anybody who comes here on a visa is supposed to be allowed in, so we would anticipate that somebody who is in the air would be able to land and enter,\" she said. \"Of course, as with everything this week, it remains to be seen what happens on the ground.\" \n The executive order has caused chaos within the government and the courts. Trump fired Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover who was serving as acting attorney general, after she said the Justice Department would not enforce it. In Washington today, demonstrators chanting \"No hate, No fear, Refugees are welcome here\" walked from the White House down Pennsylvania Avenue. \n Hearings have also been held in court challenges nationwide. \n In arguments to the court, Washington state and Minnesota said the temporary ban and the global suspension of the U.S. refugee program harmed residents and effectively mandated discrimination. \n Federal attorneys had argued that Congress gave the president authority to make decisions on national security and immigrant entry. \n But in his written order Friday, Robart said it's not the court's job to \"create policy or judge the wisdom of any particular policy promoted by the other two branches,\" but rather, to make sure that an action taken by the government \"comports with our country's laws.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. suspends enforcement of travel ban, DOJ appeals"}

{"date": "February 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Two women take a selfie, as they wait to enter the re-opened Louvre museum, a day after a man attacked French soldiers near the museum in Paris. \n PARIS >> The Louvre Museum reopened to the public Saturday, less than 24 hours after a machete-wielding assailant shouting \"Allahu akbar!\" attacked French soldiers guarding the sprawling building and was shot by them. \n The worldwide draw of the iconic museum in central Paris, host to thousands of artworks including the \"Mona Lisa,\" was on full display on a drizzly winter day as international tourists filed by armed police and soldiers patrolling outside the site, which had been closed immediately after Friday's attack. \n The attacker was shot four times after slightly injuring a soldier patrolling the nearby underground mall but his injuries on Saturday were no longer life-threatening, the Paris prosecutor's office said. \n French President Francois Hollande said there is \"no doubt\" the suspect's actions were a terror attack, and he will be questioned as soon as that is possible. \n An Egyptian Interior Ministry official confirmed to The Associated Press on Saturday that the attacker is Egyptian-born Abdullah Reda Refaie al-Hamahmy, who is 28, not 29 as widely reported. \n The official said an initial investigation in Egypt found no record of political activism, criminal activity or membership in any militant group by him. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media. \n French authorities said they are not yet ready to name the suspect, but confirmed they thought he was Egyptian. \n The suspect was believed to have been living in the United Arab Emirates and came to Paris on Jan. 26 on a tourist visa, prosecutor Francois Molins said. The suspect bought two military machetes at a gun store in Paris and paid 1,700 euros ($1,834) for a one-week stay at a Paris apartment in the chic 8th arrondissement, near the Champs-Elysees Avenue. \n On the Twitter account of an \"Abdallah El-Hamahmy,\" a tweet was posted about a trip from Dubai to Paris on Jan. 26. In the profile photo, Hamahmy is seen smiling and leaning against a wall in a blue-and-white sports jacket. \n In another tweet in Arabic written shortly before the Louvre attack, Hamahmy posted an angry tirade: \"No negotiation, no compromise, no letting up, certainly no climb down, relentless war.\" \n In an interview Saturday on the Dubai-based news channel al-Hadath, Hamahmy's father, Reda Refae al-Hamahmy, said he was shocked to learn of his son's alleged involvement in the latest Paris attack and denied that he was a radical or belonged to any militant groups. \n \"All I want is to know the truth and find out whether he is dead or alive,\" the father said. \n \"This is all a scenario made up by the French government to justify the soldiers opening fire,\" he added. \"He is a very normal young man.\" \n The father said Hamahmy is married with a 7-month-old child and told them he intended to tour the sights in Paris before leaving France. He sent his father a photo of himself with the Eiffel Tower in the background shortly before the clash at the Louvre. \n Hamahmy's brother Ahmed, who works at the Health Ministry in Dubai, was interrogated for several hours by security officials in the United Arab Emirates, the father said. In Egypt, several domestic security agency officers visited the family home in the Nile Delta on Friday night to question family members. \n At the Louvre on Saturday, visitors expressed mixed feelings about the incident, with some planning to leave Paris earlier than planned. \n \"We heard on the news that a terrorist attack took place \u2026 we stayed at the hotel and we're thinking about cutting our vacation in Paris short,\" said Lucia Reveron from Argentina. \n Others felt safer because of the heightened security presence. \n \"I went around yesterday in the evening and security was everywhere. Even now, when we arrived (at the Louvre), we were checked and it's secure. I don't feel any threats,\" said Kurt Vellafonde from Malta. \n With the spate of attacks on France in the last few years, many residents have become resilient, even blase. \n \"There have been very good security measures taken and it does not scare me at all,\" said Regine Dechivre. \"It's the phenomena of a person a little bit disturbed. The investigation will tell us what exactly happened.\" \n The United Arab Emirates condemned the attack at the Louvre but UAE officials offered no comment Saturday about the suspect's possible connection to the country. \n The UAE, which includes the Mideast commercial hub of Dubai, is a major destination for guest workers from Egypt and other countries. Foreign residents outnumber native Emiratis roughly four to one. \n \"The UAE, while strongly condemning this hideous crime, affirms its full solidarity with the friendly French Republic in these circumstances and its support for whatever measures France may take to preserve its security and safety of its citizens and residents,\" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said. \n France is working with the Emirates to build a branch of the Louvre in the federal capital, Abu Dhabi. The project has been repeatedly delayed and is now expected to open later this year. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Louvre museum reopens; Egypt identifies machete attacker"}

{"date": "February 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump shakes hands with 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Neil Gorsuch, his choice for Supreme Court associate justice in the East Room of the White House in Washington. \n Judge Neil Gorsuch recalls being blinded by tears in the middle of a ski run after someone rang his cellphone with news of the unexpected death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. The reaction illustrates not only the depth of Gorsuch's admiration for his mentor but also how thoroughly he has modeled his conservative constitutionalist views after Scalia. \n \"I immediately lost what breath I had,\" Gorsuch, who sits on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, said in a speech last April. \"And I am not embarrassed to admit that I couldn't see the rest of the way down the mountain for the tears.\" \n One year later, the 49-year-old Colorado native is President Donald Trump's pick to replace Scalia as the Republican leader heeded calls by many conservatives to find someone as near to a Scalia philosophical clone as possible. \n Like Scalia, Gorsuch believes judges must focus primarily on the text of the 230-year-old Constitution and resolve legal disputes by following the Founding Fathers' intentions. Gorsuch has said that if judges factor in personal beliefs, societal changes or calculations about maximizing social welfare, they risk becoming \"little more than politicians with robes.\" \n Gorsuch, who once went fly-fishing with Scalia, said Scalia helped remind Americans about the roles of judges and lawmakers. In a speech last year at Case Western Reserve University, Gorsuch said that message was that \"legislators may appeal to their own moral convictions and to claims about social utility to reshape law. \u2026 But that judges should do none of these things in a democratic society.\" \n Scalia, who died last February, was a leading proponent of originalism, an approach that seeks to resolve constitutional disputes by focusing on the document's text, its historical context and the framers' intentions. Originalism often is viewed as a conservative philosophy, but adherents can often hold strong civil libertarian views. Scalia, for example, held that flag burning was protected speech. \n Scalia frequently complained that the concept of originalism was misunderstood. He explained that an emphasis on text and historical context is flexible enough to be applied to modern phenomena like radio and the internet. And he said originalism left open avenues for change, including through constitutional amendments and legislation. \n \"You want to create new rights and/or destroy old ones?\" Scalia asked in a 1996 speech. \"A legislature and the electoral franchise are all that you need. The only reason you need a constitution is because there are some things which you don't want a majority to be able to change.\" \n Originalism's critics say judges should treat the Constitution as a living, breathing document that's able to encompass society's evolving values. An example of this approach is the 2015 Supreme Court ruling that says constitutional rights to due process and equal protection supports a right to same-sex marriage. In his dissent, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the Constitution \"had nothing to do with\" that ruling by the court majority. \n In his 2016 speech, Gorsuch also quoted Scalia as saying that, to be a good judge, \"you have to resign yourself to the fact that you're not always going to like the conclusions you reach. If you like them all the time, you're probably doing something wrong.\" \n Despite his adherence to a conservative legal philosophy, Gorsuch has also warned against rigidity. When asked at his 2006 confirmation hearings for the appeals court about the kind of judge he considers unacceptable, Gorsuch answered: \"Someone who is not willing to listen with an open mind to the arguments of counsel, to his colleagues, and to precedent.\" \n But Gorsuch's tendency to harken back to the framers is reflected in his sharp criticism of the Chevron doctrine, which holds that judges should defer to federal departments and agencies to fill in the blanks of certain laws, including on immigration and the environment. The framers, Gorsuch wrote last year, intended for lawmakers to make the laws, executives to execute them and judges to decipher their meaning. \n \"A government of diffused powers, they knew, is a government less capable of invading the liberties of the people,\" he wrote. \n Gorsuch incorporated wariness of executive power in a dissent after the full 10th Circuit declined to rehear a three-judge panel's ruling that a sex offender should comply with detailed rules about registering as a sex offender. Those rules were set not by Congress, but by the U.S. attorney general. \n \"If the separation of powers means anything, it must mean that the prosecutor isn't allowed to define the crimes he gets to enforce,\" Gorsuch wrote in 2015. \n If political leaders differ with judges over existing law, Gorsuch wrote, politicians always had a clear constitutional remedy: \"It's called legislation. \u2026 Admittedly, the legislative process can be an arduous one. But that's no bug in the constitutional design: It is the very point of the design.\" \n Originalists such as Gorsuch also apply their philosophy to resolve disagreements over laws crafted by Congress or state legislatures, focusing on the text and intention of the lawmakers. \n In a 2012 dissent in an appeal of a federal law that bans felons from possessing guns, Gorsuch wrote: \"When the current statute's language is clear, it must be enforced just as Congress wrote it. \u2026 Congress could have written the law differently than it did, and it is always free to rewrite the law when it wishes. But in our legal order it is the role of the courts to apply the law as it is written, not some different law Congress might have written in the past or might write in the future.\" \n Gorsuch has argued that liberals are too quick to file lawsuits as a way to force change, even though there's \"no doubt that constitutional lawsuits have secured critical civil-rights victories,\" including desegregation. He said that reliance can end up hardening divisions. \n \"In the legislative arena, especially when the country is closely divided, compromises tend to be the rule of the day,\" he wrote in the National Review in 2005. \"But when judges rule this or that policy unconstitutional, there's little room for compromise: One side must win, the other must lose.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's Supreme Court pick wary of 'politicians with robes'"}

{"date": "February 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell, left, and Attorney General Bob Ferguson, right, listen to questions from reporters, following a hearing in federal court Friday, Feb. 3, 2017, in Seattle. \n PALM BEACH, Fla. >> President Donald Trump lashed out Saturday at \"this so-called judge\" who put a nationwide hold on his executive order denying entry to the U.S. to refugees and to people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The ruling set in motion another weekend of confusion and chaos around the country. \n The White House pledged to swiftly appeal the federal judge's ruling late Friday, but that didn't appear to be enough for Trump, who vented his frustrations on Twitter. \n \"The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!\" Trump said. \n The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! \n The government moved quickly to comply with the judge's order. The State Department reversed visa cancellations for foreigners, and the Homeland Security Department said it's no longer directing airlines to prevent affected visa-holders from boarding U.S.-bound flights. \n Up to 60,000 foreigners had their visas \"provisionally revoked\" to comply with Trump's order, which the president has said will keep Americans safe at home by keeping potential terrorists from entering the country. \n Trump also said Saturday on Twitter that \"when a country is no longer able to say who can and who cannot come in & out, especially for reasons of safety & security \u2014 big trouble!\" \n U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle ruled late Friday against government lawyers' claims that Washington state and Minnesota, which sued over the ban, lacked the legal grounds to challenge Trump's order. Robart said the states showed that their case was likely to succeed. \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer said late Friday that the Justice Department would appeal the \"outrageous\" order \"at the earliest possible time. Spicer quickly issued an amended statement that deleted \"outrageous.\" \n \"The president's order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people,\" Spicer said, calling the order both lawful and appropriate. \n Trump billed the action as necessary to stop \"radical Islamic terrorists\" from coming to the U.S. \n The order included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen, a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program, and an indefinite bar against admitting Syrian refugees. \n The decision sparked protests nationwide and confusion at airports as some travelers were detained. More protests were planned for this weekend, including at Trump's estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where he is spending the weekend. \n Last week, U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York issued an emergency order after lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a court petition on behalf of people from the seven countries who were detained at airports nationwide as the ban took effect. \n Donnelly's order addressed only a portion of Trump's order, and barred U.S. border agents from removing anyone who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa from the seven countries. Robart's decision was more sweeping in scope. \n Saturday was not the first instance of Trump criticizing a federal judge, a member of an independent branch of the government. \n During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly criticized the federal judge who was presiding over a lawsuit brought by former students of Trump University. Trump claimed that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was born in Indiana, had an \"absolute conflict\" in handling the case because he is \"of Mexican heritage.\" Trump launched his presidential campaign with a harsh description of Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers. \n Trump recently agreed to pay $25 million to settle the lawsuits against Trump University. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump lashes out at federal judge over ruling on travel ban"}
