{"date": "February 5, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump watched the Palm Beach Central High School band play during their arrival at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. \n WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. >> President Donald Trump said he respects Vladimir Putin, and when told the Russian leader is \"a killer,\" Trump said the United States has many of them. \n \"What do you think? Our country's so innocent?\" he told Fox's Bill O'Reilly in a taped interview aired today on the Super Bowl pregame show. \n Trump has long expressed a wish for better ties with Moscow, praised Putin and signaled that U.S.-Russia relations could be in line for a makeover, even after U.S. intelligence agencies determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Putin has called Trump a \"very bright and talented man.\" \n During Putin's years in power, a number of prominent Russian opposition figures and journalists have been killed. \n In the interview, Trump says, \"I do respect him,\" then is asked why. \n \"I respect a lot of people, but that doesn't mean I'm going to get along with him. He's a leader of his country. I say it's better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world \u2014 that's a good thing,\" Trump said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. \"Will I get along with him? I have no idea.\" \n O'Reilly then said about Putin: \"But he's a killer, though. Putin's a killer.\" \n Trump responded: \"There are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country's so innocent?\" \n When O'Reilly says he doesn't know any government leaders who are killers, Trump says \"take a look at what we've done, too. We've made a lot of mistakes\" and references the Iraq war. \n The Kremlin had no immediate comment. Democrats and Republicans took issue with Trump's comparison of Russia and the U.S. \n \"I really do resent that he would say something like that,\" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., on ABC's \"This Week.\" \n The Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, distanced himself from the president. \n \"Putin's a former KGB agent. He's a thug. He was not elected in a way that most people would consider a credible election. The Russians annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine and messed around in our elections. And no, I don't think there's any equivalency between the way the Russians conduct themselves and the way the United States does,\" McConnell told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \n O'Reilly also asked Trump to back up his claims that some 3 million to 5 million illegal votes were cast in the election. Trump didn't answer directly, but asserted that immigrants in the U.S. illegally and dead people are on the voter rolls. \"It's really a bad situation, it's really bad,\" Trump said. \n There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the Nov. 8 election. Trump won the Electoral College vote but lost the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes to Clinton. \n Trump recently announced on Twitter that he would call for a \"major investigation\" into voter fraud, but senior administration officials said last week that plans for Trump to take some type of executive action on the issue had been delayed. \n Trump said in the Fox News interview that he will set up a commission to be headed by Vice President Mike Pence and \"we're going to look at it very, very carefully.\" \n McConnell, meanwhile, said he saw no role for the federal government because states historically have handled voter fraud investigations. \n \"There's no evidence that it occurred in such a significant number that would have changed the presidential election, and I don't think we ought to spend any federal money investigating that,\" McConnell told CNN. \"I think the states can take a look at this issue.\" \n On other issues, Trump said: \n \u2014California's consideration of legislation to create a statewide sanctuary for people living in the country illegally is \"ridiculous.\" He suggested withholding federal funding as possible punishment. \n \u2014Plans to enact a replacement for the Affordable Care Act could slip into next year. \"I would like to say by the end of the year, at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year,\" Trump said. \n \u2014Living in the White House is \"a surreal experience in a certain way, but you have to get over it, because there's so much work to be done.\" \n The Trump administration on Thursday revised recent U.S. sanctions that had unintentionally prevented American companies from exporting certain consumer electronic products to Russia. The change allows companies to deal with Russia's security service, which licenses such exports under Russian law. The products were not intended to be covered by the sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Dec. 29 after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the presidential election. The White House denied it was easing sanctions. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "When asked about Putin, Trump says U.S. isn't 'so innocent'"}

Here's a breakdown of what of entertainers in Houston. \n LUKE BRYAN DIDN'T PARTY \n Luke Bryan, one of country music's top party boys, said he toned down his lifestyle in preparation of his performance at the Super Bowl. \n \"It's two months of preparation when you find out you're doing the anthem,\" Bryan said after singing the national anthem. \"I haven't went out any night so I've been a good boy preparing.\" \n He said he felt proud of his performance \u2014 especially after his fellow country singers contacted him to say they were impressed. \n \"I hope everybody felt that I did a great job with it. And when all my Nashville country music singer buddies are texting me 'good job,' I'm like, 'All right, I did a good job,'\" he said. \n Bryan, who is from Georgia, said he was also proud to see former President George H.W. Bush \u2014 who recently received treatment for pneumonia for more than two weeks \u2014 at the game. \n Bush, 92, took part in the pregame coin toss with his wife, Barbara, earning a huge ovation from the crowd. \n \"With what they're dealing with health-wise, I think it was an honor and a privilege for America to see them,\" Bryan said. \"What a beautiful family, and for them to be here together it was a special moment. I was glad I got to witness it.\" \n 'HAMILTON' STARS REUNITE \n Tony Award winner Renee Elise Goldsberry said reuniting with her \"Hamilton\" co-stars to sing \"America the Beautiful\" at the Super Bowl marked a lifetime moment for her. \n Goldsberry, Phillipa Soo and Jasmine Cephas performed as the Schuyler sisters \u2014 from the Broadway hit \"Hamilton\" \u2014 harmonizing like a veteran girl-group, and earning loud applause from the audience. \n \"It was a miracle. It feels really good. It's the most exciting part, if you have to rank it, probably the best thing ever is to stand with them, hold hands and shake a little bit together because of the excitement of it all,\" Goldsberry said after the performance. \n The performer, who won a Tony last year for her role in the mega-hit musical, said the ladies took time to arrange the performance: \"It was a pretty complicated arrangement harmonically.\" \n Aside from showing off her vocals, she was hoping to provide a sense of sisterhood on the football field. \n \"We've spent a lot of time in \u2026 'Hamilton' trying to celebrate women and their role in history, and I'm just grateful that the NFL let us come here and sing that beautiful song,\" she said. \n And now Goldsberry can enjoy the rest of the game. \n \"I'm a big football fan, and what's great about the Super Bowl is even if you're not a big football fan, this is just very Americana,\" she said. \"It's a time to celebrate our sport.\" \n SUPER BOWL IS EMOTIONAL FOR TARAJI \n For Taraji P. Henson, being at the Super Bowl is sentimental. \n The Oscar-nominated actress recalls watching football games on Sunday with her late father, and said today she wished she could have brought him to the big game. \n \"It's a big deal for me because I lost my dad and football was such a big part of us on Sundays. My stepmom would cook and we would watch football,\" Henson said at the NRG Stadium before the Atlanta Falcons take on the New England Patriots. \n \"I love being this close to it and wished he was actually alive to go to a Super Bowl 'cause he's never been to a Super Bowl,\" she said. \n GOING GOO-GOO FOR GAGA \n Lady Gaga's little monsters aren't the only one anticipating her halftime show performance. \n \"You never know what's going to come with her. It's so hard to bet on what she might do, but that's what's fun,\" said Dave Haywood of the Grammy-winning country trio Lady Antebellum. \"She always pushes the limit and always goes for something over-the-top. I can't wait to see it.\" \n Gaga will perform for 13 minutes. She sang the national anthem at last year's game. \n \"She's money. She's got such a ridiculous voice. I love people that actually have the talent, that can actually stand onstage and I know it's them,\" said Noelle Scaggs of the alternative band Fitz & the Tantrums, who performed during the Tailgate Party. \"I'm a big fan of hers.\" \n LADY ANTEBELLUM IS SCREAMING RISE UP \n Lady A could stand for Lady Atlanta. \n Two members of the \"Need You Now\" band \u2014 Haywood and Charles Kelley \u2014 are from Georgia and are celebrating the Falcons ahead of Super Bowl 51. \n \"We got our Falcons in the game, so this is a special one. We've actually gotten to perform at a couple Super Bowls before and I don't think we've ever been as excited as we are for this one,\" Kelley said. \n The country group performed at a pre-Super Bowl concert today, alongside O.A.R. and Tyler Farr. \n Hillary Scott said they were excited to perform their new, high-energy single \"You Look Good,\" and then \"go and watch the Super Bowl, which is, I think, that never gets old. It's amazing.\" \n FITZ & THE TANTRUMS THANK NFL \n Fitz & the Tantrums released the addictive song \"HandClap\" last June, but months later it's climbing the charts, and the band is thanking the NFL. \n \"The cool thing for us is that it kind of became one of those unofficial songs of the NFL this year because I think it started when the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders did a routine to it, and every other team's cheerleading squad did a routine,\" singer Michael Fitzpatrick said. \"We've been all over NFL Network and all that kind of stuff, so we've just been on the road and playing.\" \n \"HandClap\" just climbed to No. 53 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making it the band's highest-charting song on the Hot 100. \"HandClap\" has reached the Top 5 on the alternative and rock songs charts, respectively. \n Fitz & the Tantrums sang the track at the Tailgate Party before Zac Brown Band hit the stage. The group says they are big football fans. \n \"I'm a Giants guy,\" Fitzpatrick said. \n \"I'm a Packers girl,\" Scaggs said. \n \"Our drummer is Seahawks. Our tour manager is Detroit Lions. So there's been a few rivalries that have happened this year,\" Fitzpatrick added. \n \"A lot of people hate me, basically, at the end of the year, that's for sure,\" Scaggs said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'Hamilton' actress, Luke Bryan reflect on Super Bowl moments"}

Her hit \"Born This Way\" became a gay rights anthem but in the context of today's show fit into the idea of accepting differences, a thread through much of the game's commercial messaging. \n President Donald Trump's name didn't come up. Gaga's most notable ad-lib? Saying hi to mom and dad. \n Once onstage, she commanded a large troupe of dancers and musicians, props that breathed fire and audience members swinging lights in synchronization \u2014 the usual excess that has become a Super Bowl cliche. \n Yet Gaga commanded the show herself, unlike many predecessors who brought in guest stars to bolster their act. An expected appearance by Tony Bennett, a frequent duet partner, didn't take place. He was relegated to a brief role in a commercial. \n With that pressure, Gaga acquitted herself well. Hits like \"Poker Face\" and \"Just Dance\" were frothy and fun. Her best performance came in her least-known song: \"Million Reasons,\" where she sat at the piano and explored a new style that has advanced beyond the dance pop of her youth. \n The finale \"Bad Romance\" was a crowd pleaser. Gaga, who had spent much of the evening in a metallic space suit, emerged in her third outfit of the performance, a midriff baring costume topped off by football-like shoulder pads. She threw down the microphone and jumped off a platform to disappear at the end. \n She promised inoffensiveness and good vibes \u2014 and mission accomplished. \n The Super Bowl halftime show, with an audience usually topping 100 million, is easily the biggest show of an artist's career. It's so attention-getting that Las Vegas even set odds on what color Gaga's hair would be. Those who bet blonde took home some money. \n Before the game, singers Phillipa Soo, Renee Elise Goldsberry and Jasmine Cephas Jones \u2014 the Schuyler sisters from the original cast of Broadway's hit \"Hamilton\" \u2014 brought exquisite three-part harmony to a version of \"America the Beautiful.\" They made an inclusive editing choice, with Jones adding \"and sisterhood\" to the lyrical reference of brotherhood. \n Fox's own editing choice added a downer to a nice moment, cutting to a camera shot of New England's scowling coach Bill Belichick as the song ended. \n Country star Luke Bryan played it straight for \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" adding few showy flourishes while taking care not to rush through the moment. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lady Gaga delivers a show big on flash and inclusiveness"}

If convicted, he faces up to 25 years to life in prison. \n The closely watched case caused fear among women who run alone and baffled investigators, who for months were unable to find anyone who matched the probable suspect's DNA that was found under the victim's fingernails as she fought back. The DNA also was found on her neck and phone. \n New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said the break came after police went back through 911 calls and found one reporting a suspicious person in the area near the attack. Investigators interviewed Lewis on Thursday and obtained a DNA sample from him, which Boyce said was tested and linked to DNA found at the scene and on the victim. \n \"Karina helped us identify this person,\" Boyce said. \"She had the DNA under her nails. She had touch DNA on her back and there was more DNA on her cellphone. So three incidents. That's how we were able to bring this profile up. And that's how we made the link.\" \n The detective said that after Lewis was arrested at the home he shares with his mother on Saturday night, he gave incriminating statements on \"each step of the assault.\" Asked for a more detailed description of Lewis, Boyce declined to comment on the suspect's mental state or social behavior. \n Boyce said the encounter that led to Vetrano's death apparently was a chance one, and authorities didn't believe she and Lewis knew each other. Lewis has no prior arrest record, police said. \n Asked how they felt about the arrest and the randomness of the crime, the victim's parents, Philip and Cathy Vetrano, reacted with numbness and anger. \n \"It hasn't really sunk in,\" Philip said outside his home. \"She was unlucky that day.\" \n \"We've been in a state of shock for six months and we really don't know what we feel right now,\" said Cathy, who called Lewis a \"savage\" and said she was glad he was off the streets. \n \"The demon must get his justice and we will see to it.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "DNA leads to arrest in strangling of NYC jogger"}

{"date": "February 5, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Protestors carried a puppet depicting Liviu Dragnea, leader of the social democratic party. \n BUCHAREST, Romania >> The largest anti-government crowds since the violent 1989 revolution that toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu succeeded today in pressuring Romania's new government to repeal a hastily adopted decree that would have eased penalties for official corruption. \n The law, opposed by the influential Romanian Orthodox Church, would have weakened the country's emerging anti-corruption effort, which has begun to make progress against a ruling culture accustomed to acting with impunity. \n The government backed down today following six days of street protests, but plans to introduce another version of the law in Parliament, where it would be debated and possibly passed. \n The late-night introduction last week of an emergency ordinance to turn a blind eye toward abuse in office by officials if the amount involved was less than about $48,500 provoked a lightning response from Romania's civil society. \n Nightly throngs in Bucharest and other major cities pit angry citizens who believe a modern, pro-European Romania must not condone corruption in high places against a moneyed elite that stands to benefit, if the law eventually passes. \n \"We want all people to be equal before the law, and no privileges for the people in Parliament,\" said retired engineer Profira Popo, protesting in crowded Victory Square. \"This government is organized from the high level to the low like a mafia, and we don't want something like this.\" \n Opponents see it as legitimizing criminal activity \u2014 if it's done by people with influence. It would not only go lightly on future offenses, but take some politicians off the hook for cases pending against them. \n \"The law protects a layer of ex-Communist politicians who kept stealing for years,\" said software engineer Dorin Popa, 36, who was carrying a somewhat vulgar sign about the government. He said the tough anti-corruption drive which began in 2008 had \"panicked\" the ruling elite. \n \"The rule of law is kind of working, so the only thing they can do is change the law,\" he said. \"They think the Romanian people are fools.\" \n The protests so far have been largely peaceful, even festive. Parents brought young children and large pets, while volunteers distributed fresh-baked sweets to kids bundled up in wool hats and winter wear. \n Even after the repeal, tens of thousands packed the Victory Square outside the government offices Sunday evening, waving Romanian flags, blowing horns and carrying giant puppets of politicians dressed as convicts. They yelled, \"You thieves!\" and \"Resign!\" \n Thousands protested in the cities of Cluj, Timisoara, Craiova, Ploiesti and even in the Moldovan capital, Chisinau. \n There was also a pro-government demonstration Sunday as several hundred people gathered around the presidential palace to protest President Klaus Iohannis' decision to side with the protesters seeking repeal of the measure. \n One part of the ordinance that gained less attention also would weaken human rights protections and ease penalties for related crimes. \n It would have substantially reduced the sentences for officials who violated or restricted the rights of people based on race, religion, disability or HIV status. \n It would also, in some cases, decriminalize discrimination committed by officials. \n Cluj Court Judge Cristi Danilet, a former member of the Supreme Council of Magistrates, said the changes would open the door to future abuses and \"creates the possibility of issuing racist legislation.\" \n Amid the sounds of the Romanian national anthem and the red, yellow and blue colors of the national flags waving at Victory Square, gymnasium owner Cornel Sain, 53, carried an American flag. Sain said he wanted to thank U.S. officials for calling for a repeal of the law. \n He said the huge crowds of the last six days reminded him of the 1989 revolt that ushered in the post-communist era as Soviet rule collapsed in Romania and much of Eastern Europe. \n \"This fight is different than 1989 \u2014 no bullets, no casualties. It's a moral fight. But it's almost as important,\" Sain said. \"That fight was\u2026 with death and suffering. This is a fight for hope.\" \n Romania's Constitutional Court is still scheduled to rule on the legality of the just-repealed proposal. Among those it might have benefited is Social Democratic Party leader Liviu Dragnea, whose path to becoming prime minister is effectively blocked by corruption charges. \n Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu, who is also a Social Democrat, said the draft should respect the court's rulings, European directives and Romania's criminal code. \n Sain said the new government, in power just one month, must step down despite its reversal on the emergency decree. \n \"It's too late,\" he said of the government's about-face on the new law. \"Their credibility is zero.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Romanian protesters get key concession, seek more changes"}

{"date": "February 5, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Far-right leader presidential candidate Marine Le Pen spoke during a conference in Lyon, France. \n LYON, France >> French far-right candidate Marine Le Pen blasted the \"two totalitarianisms\" of globalization and Islamic fundamentalism today in a speech formally launching her presidential campaign that hit all the right chords for her National Front party followers. \n Looking to translate her high early poll numbers into votes, Le Pen evoked a frightening image of France's future during her much-anticipated speech. The country, enslaved to the European Union and unrecognizable as French, risks losing its identity if the political status quo endures, she said. \n \"We are at a crossroad \u2026. This election is a choice of civilization,\" she said, asking whether her three children and other young citizens would have the rights and cultural signposts of the current generation. \"Will they even speak our French language?\" \n She issued a call for French voters on the left and right to join her, saying \"You have a place at our side.\" \n The speech recalled the thundering and previously unpalatable pronouncements of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front's hard-liner founder. Marine Le Pen banished him from the party in an effort to clean up its image. \n But her remarks made clear the elder Le Pen's anti-immigration message, targeting Muslims, remains a selling point in party ranks. \n \"We do not want to live under the rule or threat of Islamic fundamentalism. They are looking to impose on us gender discrimination in public places, full body veils or not, prayer rooms in the workplace, prayers in the streets, huge mosques \u2026 or the submission of women,\" she said. \n The estimated 5,000 people in the amphitheater and watching on big screens cheered and chanted \"On est chez nous\" (\"We are in our land.\") \n Le Pen reiterated some of the 144 \"commitments\" she has pledged to fulfill, if elected. It is a nationalist agenda laying out plans for France to leave the European Union, control its borders and readopt the old French franc as the national currency. \n Running under the slogan, \"In the Name of the People,\" her platform also would create popular referendums on any issue that gathered at least 500,000 signatures. And it would put French people first, with \"national preference\" enshrined in the Constitution. \n \"We've witnessed the impoverishment of France for some years now at a cultural, economic and social level,\" Billy Winkens, a 41-year-old supporter from Toule, in eastern France, said. \"Today, people are hungry for change and want to drain the swamp, but in an orderly fashion, with coherence.\" \n The National Front has taken heart in the French left's disarray amid the unpopularity of Socialist President Francois Hollande, who decided not to run for re-election. \n The right's leading candidate, Francois Fillon, recently has been caught up in a corruption scandal and created an opening for maverick centrist Emmanuel Macron, who could end up facing Le Pen in the final round of the two-part election. \n Le Pen has been a leader in early polls, which place her at the top in the April 23 first-round vote but not winning the May 7 runoff. \n If elected, she envisions a \"government of national unity\" formed after June legislative elections. \n Le Pen took control of the National Front in 2011 and largely rid it of the overt anti-Semitism that flourished under her father's leadership. \n Since then, the party has drawn supporters from the length of the political spectrum by tapping into disgust over France's 10 percent unemployment rate and political corruption scandals. But the portrait its presidential candidate paints is as stark as her prescriptions for change. \n The European Union, she said, \"is a failure.\" \n \"It hasn't upheld one of its promises especially in terms of prosperity and security,\" Le Pen told the cheering crowd on Sunday. \n If elected, she plans to call a referendum on EU membership within six months. She also predicted other European members will join her. \n She said the EU is \"historical parentheses and, hopefully, one day, just a bad memory.\" \n Along with leaving the EU, Le Pen would withdraw France from NATO's integrated command, crack down on illegal immigration and reduce regular immigration to 10,000 people a year. \n No one living in France illegally would be issued residency documents or allowed to acquire French citizenship, she said. \n She said she would arrange for foreigners convicted of crimes in France to serve their prison terms in their homelands. \n \"There will be no other laws and values in France but French,\" she said. \n Britain's vote to leave the European Union and U.S. President Donald Trump's election have revealed the \"awakening of the people against oligarchies,\" said Le Pen, praising Trump as a man who respects campaign promises and \"acts quickly.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Far-right hopeful: French election 'choice of civilization'"}

{"date": "February 5, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Supporters cheered as an Iranian citizen with a valid U.S. visa arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on Thursday. \n IRVINE, Calif. >> Iranian-American supermarket supervisor Alan Tahmasebi voted for Donald Trump last year, hoping a businessman would be more trustworthy than a politician. \n The 35-year-old now sorely regrets it, seeing the havoc wreaked upon his fellow countrymen \u2014 and his family \u2014 since the new president issued a temporary travel ban on refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, including his former home. \n Tahmasebi and his wife have spent more than $7,000 on green card applications for their parents. Now, their parents are in limbo overseas as the Irvine couple awaits the birth of their second child. \n \"It was a land of opportunity but now, I don't think so,\" he said. \"They wish to come here and visit my new baby. They never worked with the army, with the government (in Iran) \u2014 I have no idea what is going on.\" \n The ban has rattled Americans with ties to the listed countries, and its effects are perhaps most widespread among the country's thriving Iranian American community. The U.S. has nearly 370,000 Iranian immigrants, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, far more than the other countries targeted by the order. \n While Tehran and Washington have a lengthy history of friction, personal ties between residents of the two countries have held strong. Many Iranian Americans travel back to visit family or bring aging parents to join them in the U.S. \n Since Trump imposed the travel ban, tension between the two governments has continued to rise. \n On Friday, Iran barred U.S. wrestlers from an important international tournament. The same day, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 13 people and a dozen companies in response to Iran's recent ballistic missile test, increasing pressure on Tehran without directly undercutting a nuclear deal with the country. \n Later Friday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the travel ban following a lawsuit by Washington state and Minnesota that said Trump's order is causing significant harm to residents and effectively mandates discrimination. \n A federal appeals court today denied a Justice Department request for an immediate reinstatement of the ban, meaning the legal fight will continue for days at least. \n Iranian Americans said they are perplexed as to why Iran is even on Trump's list, noting the country is not mired in war like Syria and Yemen. In addition, many Iranians came to the United States after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in search of religious and personal freedom and continue to cherish those ideals. \n \"There's two things in my country \u2014 one is people, one is government,\" Tahmasebi said. \"This new law is not for the government. It's for the people, who like the United States.\" \n In the Southern California suburb of Irvine, a tidy strip mall hosts a pharmacy, bakery and dental office that cater to clients in English and Persian. At the supermarket, Tahmasebi said customers relish persimmon and other produce from Iran, but if relations between the countries sour further the store may have to bring in Pakistani or Chinese goods instead. \n The vast majority of the country's Iranians and Iranian Americans live in California. The sizable community in Los Angeles \u2014 which includes members of diverse religious groups, including Muslims, Christians, Jews and Baha'i \u2014 has led some to adopt the nickname \"Tehrangeles.\" \n Jeannine Stepanian, a 32-year-old lawyer who helped travelers detained at Los Angeles International Airport last weekend, said she comes from a family of refugees. First, her Armenian grandparents fled to Iran. Then, her parents, who are Christian and were born in Iran, sought safe haven in the United States after the Islamic Revolution. \n \"I felt like it could have been any one of my relatives this could have been happening to,\" said Stepanian, adding she is outraged by the ban. \n Trump's order placed a temporary halt on visitors and refugees from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.

There are concerns just about being an Iranian American at this time, I think, until cooler heads prevail,\" Yebri said. \n At the Irvine supermarket, 45-year-old Iranian American Mary Far said she hasn't returned to Iran in two decades. She was hoping to go this summer to visit her brother and sister, whom she hasn't seen since she left the country.

Their lawyers had until 2:59 a.m. EST Monday to submit briefs opposing the government's request. The Justice Department then had a 6 p.m. EST deadline to respond. \n \"We'll accomplish the stay and will win the case on the merits,\" Vice President Mike Pence said. \n Members of Trump's Republican Party scolded him for Twitter attacks on U.S. District Court Judge James Robart, appointed by President George W. Bush, and accused Trump of stepping over the line that separates the executive from the judiciary. To Trump, Robart is a \"so-called judge\" whose \"ridiculous\" ruling \"will be overturned.\" \n Trump renewed his Twitter attacks against Robart on Sunday. \"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" \n He followed with another tweet saying he had instructed the Homeland Security Department to check people coming into the country but that \"the courts are making the job very difficult!\" \n Vice President Mike Pence defended Trump, saying \"the president can criticize anybody he wants.\" Pence added that he believes the American people \"find it very refreshing that they not only understand this president's mind, but they understand how he feels about things.\" \n At issue is the legality of a presidential action undertaken in the name of national security. Whatever the outcome and however the case drags on, a president who was used to getting his way in private business is finding, weeks in to the jobs, obstacles to quickly fulfilling one of his chief campaign pledges. \n \"The president is not a dictator,\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. \"He is the chief executive of our country. And there is a tension between the branches of government.\" \n The government had told the appeals court that the president alone has the power to decide who can enter or stay in the United States, an assertion that appeared to invoke the wider battle to come over illegal immigration. \n Congress \"vests complete discretion\" in the president to impose conditions on entry of foreigners to the United States, and that power is \"largely immune from judicial control,\" according to the court filing. \n \"We don't appoint judges to our district courts to conduct foreign policy or to make decisions about the national security,\" Pence said. \n Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, predicted the appeals court would not have the last word. \"I have no doubt that it will go to the Supreme Court, and probably some judgments will be made whether this president has exceed his authority or not,\" she said. \n In his ruling, Robart said it was not the court's job to \"create policy or judge the wisdom of any particular policy promoted by the other two branches,\" but to make sure that an action taken by the government \"comports with our country's laws.\" \n Trump's order applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen \u2014 Muslim-majority countries that the administration said raise terrorism concerns. The order had caused unending confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the United States, prompted protests across the United States and led to multiple court challenges. \n Trump's criticism of Robart echoed campaign comments against a federal judge of Mexican heritage who was overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University. Justice Department lawyers could be called upon to answer for Trump's words as the travel ban case makes it way through the courts. \n \"We all get disappointed from time to time at the outcome in courts on things that we care about,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \"But I think it is best to avoid criticizing judges individually.\" \n Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., was blunter: \"We don't have so-called judges. We don't have so-called senators. We don't have so-called presidents. We have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.\" \n The State Department said last week that as many as 60,000 foreigners from those seven countries had had their visas canceled. After Robart's decision, the department reversed course and said they could travel to the U.S. if they had a valid visa. \n The department also advised refugee aid agencies that refugees set to travel before Trump signed his order would now be allowed in. \n The Homeland Security Department no longer was directing airlines to prevent visa-holders affected by Trump's order from boarding U.S.-bound planes. The agency said it had \"suspended any and all actions\" related to putting in place Trump's order. \n Pence appeared on ABC's \"This Week,\" CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and \"Fox News Sunday.

The listing would be the most widespread shark listing in the U.S. to date. \n The National Marine Fisheries Service said in a document published in the Federal Register in December that the sharks are indeed likely to become endangered in all or at least a significant portion of their range \"within the foreseeable future.\" \n Threats to the sharks include fishing pressure all over the world, as their fins are prized in Asian markets for use in soup. The sharks have declined by 80 to 90 percent in the Pacific Ocean since the 1990s, and 50 percent to 85 percent in the Atlantic Ocean since the 1950s, said Chelsey Young, a natural resource management specialist for the fisheries service. \n \"The oceanic whitetip has very large pectoral fins, and so they have fetched a high price on the international market in Asia,\" Young said. \"It incentivized the fin trade.\" \n The fisheries service is collecting public comments about the shark's status until March and is expected to make a final decision in November. Listing the species as threatened would afford it protections aimed at recovery. \n The shark is also listed as \"vulnerable\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. Additional protections would only help, said Lora Snyder, a campaign director for conservation group Oceana. The group has also pushed for a broader ban on the U.S. shark fin trade, which is already restricted. \n \"In order to truly combat the global trade of shark fins, which kills tens of millions of sharks every year, we need to pass a full ban in the U.S. on the buying and selling of shark fins,\" Snyder said. \n Attacks on humans by the sharks are extremely rare. Oceanic whitetips are thought to be responsible for some of the deaths of sailors who were aboard the USS Indianapolis, a Navy cruiser that was sunk during World War II. But there have been only 10 documented non-provoked attacks on humans by the sharks, according to the Florida Museum, which collects records about shark attacks. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Oceanic whitetip shark warrants 'threatened' listing"}

{"date": "February 5, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Rhea Powell poses for a photograph on Independence Mall in Philadelphia. The massive turnout for last month's women's marches protesting the policies of the Trump administration have led to calls for sustained political activism to help Democrats get back in power. \n Passionate protests against Donald Trump's presidency have swelled the ranks of Democratic activists, but their new enthusiasm faces a hard reality: Republicans remain well-positioned to retain their grip on power in the 2018 elections. \n While Republicans hold only a slim majority in the U.S. Senate, Democrats occupy most of the seats up for election in two years. That means they must play defense against Republicans, especially in 10 states that Trump won. \n In the U.S. House, Republicans will be aided by favorable district boundaries that were drawn to maintain GOP political dominance. In some cases, the congressional districts were gerrymandered to pack high numbers of Democratic voters into just a few districts as a way to create a greater number of Republican-leaning seats. \n \"Democrats are extremely fired up right now,\" said Sam Wang, a Princeton University neuroscientist and statistician who has developed a statistical model for analyzing partisan gerrymandering. \n But for Democrats to win back Congress, Wang said it \"would take an extreme event. The question is, are we seeing something that's headed towards that?\" \n The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is targeting 59 Republican-held House seats in 24 states as it builds toward the next election. Those include 23 districts where Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton defeated Trump and various others that Republicans took away from Democrats in recent years. \n It also is beginning to place full-time paid organizers in 20 of those districts, something the committee says it has never done at this early stage. \n The Democratic committee is touting a surge of 675,000 new supporters in January, many of whom joined the cause amid nationwide protests against Trump's policies. Whether that energy can be sustained through 2018 remains to be seen. \n National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Jesse Hunt calls the Democratic optimism a \"pipe dream.\" Hunt notes that Democrats also held high hopes for 2016, but unseated just four of the 15 freshmen GOP representatives they targeted. \n Democrats would appear to have history on their side. The president's party has lost ground in Congress in all but two of the initial midterm elections since the Civil War. The exceptions are 1934, when President Franklin Roosevelt was guiding the country through the Great Depression, and 2002, when President George W. Bush was leading the response to the 2001 terrorist attacks. \n In the 2010 election during the middle of President Barack Obama's first term, Republicans flipped more than five dozen seats to take control of the U.S. House away from Democrats. Republicans also won control of a majority of state legislative chambers and governors' offices that year. \n They then used that statehouse power to help cement their control in Washington by redrawing congressional districts following the 2010 Census. \n In 2012, the first election under those new maps, Republicans won a 33-seat majority in the U.S. House even though Democratic candidates across the country received 1.4 million more votes than their Republican opponents. \n Although court rulings have since forced the redrawing of some districts, many of those boundaries remain in place for the 2018 elections. \n Wang estimates Democratic congressional candidates would need to win the 2018 nationwide vote by 7 to 12 percentage points to capture enough seats to win control of the House. The last time Democrats enjoyed such a spread was 2008, he said. \n But circumstances have changed since then. \n \"There are just more districts at the moment that have a natural tilt toward Republicans, partly because of Democratic geography and partly because of Republicans drawing districts with an eye toward helping pick up more seats for their party,\" said Michael Barber, an assistant political science professor at Brigham Young University who has studied the effects of gerrymandering and incumbency on congressional elections. \n Former Attorney General Eric Holder recently signed on as chairman of the new National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which is attempting to better position Democrats for the 2021 redistricting by winning key statehouse races and court cases in the coming years. \n \"There's a lot of work to be done,\" said Iowa-based Democratic consultant Jim Kottmeyer. \"Redistricting is a real problem, but the bigger problem is frankly that Democratic votes are just way too concentrated in too small of geographic areas\" \u2014 big cities, instead of America's many small and mid-size towns. \n The realities of the electoral map have tempered the optimism of some newly invigorated Democratic activists. \n Since Election Day, Philadelphia physician Rhea Powell has marched with other women in Washington, protested in her home town against the potential repeal of Obama's health care law and joined in airport demonstrations against Trump's immigration restrictions. She has even enrolled in a program that trains potential Democratic candidates. \n But she also understands that victories may be difficult, at least in the near term. \n \"I am worried that because of the impact that gerrymandering has had on many of the districts that it may be hard to make big changes\" in the 2018 elections, Powell said. \n Other new activists believe it's possible to win even with unfavorable districts. \n \"I think there'll always be barriers \u2026 (but) we're not just going to sit back and shake our head and say, 'OK, well, I guess that's it,'\" said Mary Clauss, a small business owner from suburban Chicago who recently marched in Washington and now is organizing other women in her community. \n Ironically, Democratic chances for huge congressional gains may depend on Trump's success at enacting his agenda. The Republican wave in 2010 was fueled by voter backlash against Obama's policies, headlined by the health care law that quickly became known as \"Obamacare.\" \n \"Politicians sometimes think that they made promises and their voters want them to keep them, but the historical pattern is the opposite \u2014 that public opinion moves against the direction of policy change,\" said political scientist Matt Grossmann, director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University. \n \"So the more Donald Trump is successful \u2014 and the Republican Party is successful \u2014 in moving policy to the right, the bigger the backlash is likely to be.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "For Trump foes, Democratic gains may remain elusive in 2018"}
