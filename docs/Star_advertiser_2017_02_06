{"date": "February 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg spoke at Stanford University. \n STANFORD, Calif. >> U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg lamented partisanship in Congress during a talk at Stanford University today and said she hoped it would return to an era when \"it was working for the good of the country and not just along party lines.\" \n Ginsburg did not address the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court seat vacated by the late Justice Antonin Scalia or President Donald Trump's travel ban, which could end up before the high court. But she did say she would like to change the Electoral College, a comment that drew applause from the packed church. She did not elaborate. \n Ginsburg said during the presidential campaign that she presumed Democrat Hillary Clinton would win and have the opportunity to make a few appointments to the court. \n She said at the time she did not want to think about the possibility of a Trump victory, calling Trump in one interview a \"faker\" who \"really has an ego.\" \n She later apologized and said her remarks were ill-advised. \n Ginsburg recalled Monday that she received bipartisan support for her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch was her most ardent supporter. \n \"I think today he wouldn't touch me with a 10-foot pole,\" she joked. \n The 83-year-old justice offered personal reflections at a discussion billed as an exploration of what it means to lead a meaningful life. \n Ginsburg's talk came after Trump last week nominated Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. The nomination would likely restore the court's conservative tilt. \n Ginsburg is the leader of the court's liberal wing. She is also the oldest justice on the court and has survived pancreatic and colon cancer, creating anxiety among liberals about her health and the future of their causes if Trump gets an opportunity to replace her or any of the other liberal judges on the bench. \n Ginsburg supporters have joked about steps she could take to stay healthy such as eating more kale. Asked by a Stanford student who else should eat more kale in Washington, D.C., the justice quipped, \"Justice Kennedy.\" Anthony Kennedy, 80, is the second oldest justice on the Supreme Court and is considered a swing vote. \n Ginsburg has shown no signs of slowing down and has said she has a personal trainer who leads her through hour-long workouts that include push-ups and weights. She said family plays a large part in her life, and she doesn't admit defeat. \n \"The attitude is I'm going to surmount this whatever it is,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Justice Ginsburg laments partisanship at Stanford talk"}

{"date": "February 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / JAN. 23 \n Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. spoke during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> A House conservative leader today called for votes \"as soon as possible\" on legislation voiding and replacing the health care law, even as President Donald Trump's latest remarks conceded that the effort could well stretch into next year. \n \"Maybe it will take till sometime into next year, but we are certainly going to be in the process,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly that was broadcast Sunday. While saying he expected something \"fairly soon,\" he added, \"I would like to say by the end of the year, at least the rudiments. But we should have something within the year and the following year.\" \n The comments come as congressional Republicans continue laboring to deliver on a promise they've been making for years: that they will repeal President Barack Obama's 2010 health care overhaul and replace it with an alternative. \n They also come as constituents supporting Obama's law have made life uncomfortable back home for some Republican lawmakers. Reps. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., and Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., faced pointed questions from voters in recent days in scenes reminiscent of 2009, when tea party voters noisily confronted congressional Democrats at town hall meetings. \n Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said late Monday that there's \"growing consensus\" among members of the hard-line conservative group for quick votes on repealing Obama's statute and replacing it that would be held simultaneously, or at worst within days of each other. \n \"Repeal and replace as soon as possible gives us a lot more credibility\" with voters, Meadows said in an interview after his group discussed their health care strategy in an evening meeting without approving a formal position. Meadows, whose organization claims around 40 House GOP lawmakers as members, said delays in producing a Republican replacement plan create \"unnecessary anxiety on behalf of our constituents.\" \n Meadows said Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., is working on legislation similar to a bill by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that's winning support among conservatives. That measure would eliminate requirements in current law that insurance policies cover specified benefits such as maternity and mental health; expand tax-advantaged health savings accounts and let insurers sell policies across state lines. \n A House health subcommittee planned Tuesday votes on a pair of minor bills making it harder for people to avoid counting some forms of income \u2014 including lottery winnings \u2014 used to determine if they qualify for Medicaid, the health program for low-income people. \n Republicans pushed back Monday against the notion that their work was slowing. \n Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said there were \"relatively minor differences\" among Republicans and dismissed what he said were reporters' efforts to \"manufacture divisions\" in the party. \n \"I have little doubt that we can work through whatever differences do exist and, more importantly, I think we will,\" he said on the Senate floor. \n House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said he was sticking to the deadline set by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to pass an initial bill by late March repealing and replacing parts of the statute. \n \"We're continuing on a good, deliberate, pretty steady pace,\" Brady told reporters. \n Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a member of the Senate Finance Committee, said he thinks Congress will enact legislation this year, though it would take a couple of years for the new law to be implemented. \n Republicans have called health care their top priority. Trump said in January that the measure was nearly finished and would be ready \"soon.\" \n But the GOP has yet to unite behind an alternative, with divisions over what to do about Medicaid, the law's taxes and how to protect insurers and consumers during a transition to a new system. And some Republicans have begun using the less threatening term \"repair\" to describe their goal. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump remarks hint of health law repeal slowdown"}

{"date": "February 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Robbo Coleman watches a live broadcast of former President Barack Obama waving goodbye during the inauguration of President Donald Trump at the Sawmill Saloon in Prairie du Chien, Wis., on Jan. 20. Coleman voted for Obama four years ago. This time, he voted for Trump. \n PRAIRIE DU CHIEN, Wis. >> She tugged 13 envelopes from a cabinet above the stove, each one labeled with a different debt: the house payment, the student loans, the vacuum cleaner she bought on credit. \n Lydia Holt and her husband tuck money into these envelopes with each paycheck to whittle away at what they owe. They both earn about $10 an hour. She did the math; at this rate, they'll be paying these same bills for 87 years. \n In 2012, Holt voted for Barack Obama because he promised her change, but she feels that change hasn't reached her here. So last year she chose a presidential candidate unlike any she'd ever seen, the billionaire businessman who promised to help people like her win again. \n Many of her neighbors did, too \u2014 so many that for the first time in more than 30 years, Crawford County, Wisconsin, a sturdy brick in the once-mighty Big Blue Wall, abandoned the Democratic Party and that wall crumbled. Some 50 counties stretching 300 miles down the Mississippi River \u2014 through Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois \u2014 transformed in one election season into Trump Country. \n They voted for Trump for an array of reasons, and the list of grievances they hope he now corrects is long and exacting: stagnant wages, the cost of health care, a hard-to-define feeling that things are not getting better, at least not for people like them. \n Here in Crawford County, residents often recite two facts about their hometown, the first one proudly: It is the second-oldest community in the state. The next is that it's also one of the poorest. \n There are no rusted-out factories to embody this discontent. The main street of Prairie du Chien butts up to the Mississippi River and bustles with tourists come summer. Pickup trucks crowd parking lots at the 3M plant and Cabela's distribution center where hundreds work. Just a few vacant storefronts hint at the seething resentment that life still seems harder here than it should. \n In this place that astonished America when it helped hand Trump the White House, many of those who chose him greeted the frenetic opening acts of his presidency with a shrug. Immigration is not their top concern, and so they watched with some trepidation as Trump signed orders to build a wall on the Mexican border and bar immigrants from seven Muslim countries, sowing chaos around the world. \n They are still watching and they are waiting, their hopes pinned on his promised economic renaissance. \n Jim Bowman, director of the county's Economic Development Corporation, says some of the economic anxiety here is based not on measurable decay, but rather a perception that life is decaying. There are plenty of jobs, but it's hard to find one that pays more than $12 an hour. Ambitious young people move away. Rural schools are dwindling, and with them a sense of pride and purpose. \n \"If you ask anybody here, we'll all tell you the same thing: We're tired of living like this,\" said Mark Berns, leaning through the service window in the small-engine repair shop that he can barely keep open anymore. \n Berns watched Trump's first days in office half-hopeful, half-frightened. He bemoaned what he described as Trump's quantity-over-quality, \"sign, sign, sign\" approach to governing. \n \"I just hope we get the jobs back and the economy on its feet, so everybody can get a decent job and make a decent living, and have that chance at the American dream that's gone away over the past eight or 10 years. I'm still optimistic,\" he said, sighing. \"I hope I'm not wrong.\" \n Marlene Kramer is also optimistic Trump will make good on his promises. Her priority is health care. \n Kramer, who voted twice for Obama, used to watch Trump on \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" \"I said to myself, 'Ugh, I can't stand him.'\" When he announced his candidacy, she thought it was a joke. \"Then my husband said to me, 'Just think, everything he touches seems to turn to money.'\" And she changed her mind. \n She's 54, and she's worked since she was 14, all hard jobs: feeding cows, standing all day on factory floors. Now she works at a sewing shop, where she's happy, and gets to sit. But there's no health insurance. \n Kramer said she's glad the Affordable Care Act has helped millions get insurance, but it hasn't helped her. \n She and her husband were stunned to find premiums over $1,000 a month. They opted to pay the penalty of $2,000 until Trump, she hopes, keeps his promise to replace the law with something better. \n Across town, Robbo Coleman leaned over the bar he tends and described a similar political about-face. He held up an ink pen, wrapped in plastic stamped \"Made in China.\" \n \"I don't see why we can't make pens in Prairie du Chien or in Louisville, Kentucky, or in Alabama or wherever,\" said Coleman. \n Coleman doesn't love Trump's moves to build a wall or ban certain immigrants, but he's frustrated that other politicians stopped listening to working people like him. \n \"We've got to give him some time,\" he said. \"He's not Houdini.\" \n Farmer Bernard \"Tinker\" Moravits is also willing to wait and see. \n Change is what he looked to Obama for and now expects from Trump. The price of milk and agricultural goods has plummeted, and it's getting harder to keep things running. He wants the president to reduce red tape and renegotiate trade deals to benefit American farmers. \n He has several choice words for Trump's move to build \"his stupid wall.\" Moravits employs Hispanic workers who have been with him 15 years. He trusts them to do a dirty, difficult job that he says white people aren't willing to do. \n But unlike many transfixed by Trump's presidency, Moravits doesn't stay up-to-the-minute on the news. \n \"The play-by-play don't mean bullshit,\" he said. \"It's like watching the Super Bowl. What counts is how it ends.\" \n Moravits isn't sure Trump is going to \"Make America Great Again\" for farmers. But he feels he had to take the gamble. \n He laughed, then shrugged and pantomimed rolling the dice. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Voters await economic revival in a part of pro-Trump America"}

We want to keep the momentum going, and to do that we must keep the relationship strong in light of some of the things that have been said outside of our cities.\" \n Faulconer, a Republican who won a second term in a landslide election last year in a solidly Democratic city, has taken issue with Trump in the past. He said during the presidential primary that Trump hadn't earned his vote. When Trump signed an executive order last month to erect a wall on the 2,000-mile divide, Faulconer said, \"We already have a safe and secure border in San Diego built by the federal government.\" \n Faulconer pledged last year to serve his full term as mayor of the nation's eighth-largest city through 2020, but he continued to privately discuss a possible run for California governor in 2018. His message of stronger ties with Mexico would play well to a statewide audience. \n San Diego was the busiest corridor for illegal immigration until the mid-1990s, when a surge in agents and fencing pushed traffic to Arizona. It has one of the most fortified stretches of border, with razor wire atop much of its fencing with Mexico. \n Faulconer invited his Mexican counterpart and business leaders from both cities to discuss economic integration in a region of about 5 million people and the nation's busiest border crossing. \n Nikia Clarke, executive director of World Trade Center San Diego, a public-private partnership that promotes trade, said regional leadership has never been more important in a climate of uncertainty. \"What this country needs right now is people who know and understand our regional reality \u2013 the regional reality of trade, of immigration, of co-production,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "San Diego, Tijuana mayors extol virtues of cross-border ties"}

The left picture is of Alshogre taken on January 2017 in Stockholm, Sweden. The right picture is of Alshogre in July 2015 in Antakya, Turkey, a month after he got out of Syria's Saydnaya prison, near Damascus. While in detention, Alshogre said he heard men escorted to be hanged and had himself been called for \"execution\" but was spared after a brief trial. \n BEIRUT >> Syrian authorities have killed at least 13,000 people since the start of the 2011 uprising in mass hangings at a prison north of Damascus known to detainees as \"the slaughterhouse,\" Amnesty International said in a report Tuesday. \n It covers the period from 2011 to 2015, when Amnesty said 20-50 people were hanged each week at Saydnaya Prison in killings authorized by senior Syrian officials, including deputies of President Bashar Assad, and carried out by military police. \n The report referred to the killings as a \"calculated campaign of extrajudicial execution.\" \n Amnesty has recorded at least 35 different methods of torture in Syria since the late 1980s, practices that only increased since 2011, said Lynn Maalouf, deputy director for research at Amnesty's regional office in Beirut. \n Other rights groups have found evidence of massive torture leading to death in Syrian detention facilities. In a report last year, Amnesty found that more than 17,000 people have died of torture and ill-treatment in custody across Syria since 2011, an average rate of more than 300 deaths a month. \n Those figures are comparable to battlefield deaths in Aleppo, one of the fiercest war zones in Syria, where 21,000 were killed in the province since 2011. \n \"The horrors depicted in this report reveal a hidden, monstrous campaign, authorized at the highest levels of the Syrian government, aimed at crushing any form of dissent within the Syrian population,\" Maalouf said. \n While the most recent data is from 2015, Maalouf said there is no reason to believe the practice has stopped since then, with thousands more probably killed. \n \"These executions take place after a sham trial that lasts over a minute or two minutes, but they are authorized by the highest levels of authority,\" including the Grand Mufti, a top religious authority in Syria, and the defense minister, she said. \n Syrian government officials rarely comment on allegations of torture and mass killings. In the past, they have denied reports of massacres documented by international human rights groups, describing them as propaganda. \n The chilling accounts in Tuesday's report came from interviews with 31 former detainees and over 50 other officials and experts, including former guards and judges. \n According to the findings, detainees were told they would be transferred to civilian detention centers but were taken instead to another building in the facility and hanged. \n \"They walked in the 'train,' so they had their heads down and were trying to catch the shirt of the person in front of them. The first time I saw them, I was horrified. They were being taken to the slaughterhouse,\" Hamid, a former detainee, told Amnesty. \n Another former detainee, Omar Alshogre, told The Associated Press the guards would come to his cell, sometimes three times a week, and call out detainees by name. \n Alshogre said a torture session would begin before midnight in nearby chambers that he could hear. \n \"Then the sound would stop, and we would hear a big vehicle come and take them away,\" said Alshogre, who spent nine months in Saydnaya. Now 21, he lives in Sweden. \n Speaking in an interview from Stockholm via Skype, Alshogre described how he was forced to keep his eyes closed and his back to the guards while they abused or suffocated a cellmate. \n The body often would be left behind, or there would be a pool of blood in the cell for other prisoners to clean up. \n \"We can tell from the sound of the prisoner as he dies behind us. He dies a meter away. I don't see anything, but I see with my ears,\" said Alshogre, who at age 17 moved among nearly 10 detention facilities in Syria for two years before landing in Saydnaya. \n Alshogre survived nine months in the prison, paying his way out in 2015 \u2014 a common practice. He suffered from tuberculosis and his weight fell to 35 kilograms (77 pounds). \n Two cousins detained with him in western Syria didn't survive, dying a year apart in a military intelligence detention facility. The younger one died in Alshogre's arms, deprived of food and so weak he was unable to walk to the bathroom on his own. \n Still, Alshogre said nothing could have prepared him for Saydnaya. \n At one point, Alshogre was called out by his guards \"for execution,\" he said. He was brought before a military trial and told not to raise his gaze at the judge, who asked him how many soldiers he had killed. \n When he said none, the judge spared him. \n Death in Saydnaya was always present, \"like the air,\" Alshogre said. \n Once when he was deprived of food for two days, a cellmate handed him his food ration \u2014 and died days later. \n \"This is someone who gave me his life,\" he said. Another cellmate died of diarrhea, also common in the prison. \n \"Death is the simplest thing. It was the most hoped for because it would have spared us a lot: hunger, thirst, fear, pain, cold, thinking,\" he added. \n \"Thinking was so hard. It could also kill,\" said Alshogre, who keeps a photo of one of his tormentors on the wall of his home. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "At least 13,000 hanged in Syrian prison since 2011"}

Israel's prime minister is moving ahead with a contentious law that would legalize dozens of settlement outposts in the West Bank. \n JERUSALEM >> Israel's parliament on Monday passed a contentious law meant to retroactively legalize thousands of West Bank settlement homes built unlawfully on private Palestinian land, a step that is expected to trigger international outrage and a flurry of lawsuits against the measure. \n The explosive law is the latest in a series of pro-settler steps taken by Israel's hard-line government since the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president. He is seen as more sympathetic to Israel's settlement policies than his fiercely critical predecessor, and the Israeli government has approved plans to build thousands of new homes on occupied territory since Trump took office. \n \"We are voting tonight on our right to the land,\" Cabinet minister Ofir Akunis said during a stormy debate ahead of the vote. \"We are voting tonight on the connection between the Jewish people and its land. This whole land is ours. All of it.\" \n Critics say the legislation enshrines into law the theft of Palestinian land, and it is expected to be challenged in Israel's Supreme Court. According to the law, Palestinian landowners would be compensated either with money or alternative land, even if they did not agree to give up their property. \n The vote passed 60-52 in Israel's 120-member Knesset following a raucous debate in which opposition lawmakers shouted from their seats at governing coalition lawmakers speaking in favor of the vote from the dais. Some legislators supportive of the law took pictures of the plenum during the vote while some spectators in visitors' seats raised black cloth in apparent protest. \n Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had voiced misgivings about the law in the lead-up to vote, reportedly expressing concern that it could lead to international censure and saying he wanted to coordinate with the Trump administration before moving ahead on a vote. \n He told reporters on a trip to London that he had updated Washington and was ready to move ahead with the law. He was on his way back from the trip and was not present for the vote. \n The White House's immediate response was to refer to its statement last week that said the construction of new settlements \"may not be helpful\" in achieving an Israeli-Palestinian peace. The State Department later that \"the Trump administration will withhold comment on the legislation until the relevant court ruling.\" \n David Harris, CEO of AJC, the global Jewish advocacy organization, said: \"Israel's High Court can and should reverse this misguided legislation.\" \n \"The controversial Knesset action, ahead of Prime Minister Netanyahu's meeting with president Trump in Washington, is misguided and likely to prove counter-productive to Israel's core national interests,\" he said in a statement. \n Netanyahu's attorney general has called the bill unconstitutional and said he won't defend it in the Supreme Court. Critics have warned it could drag Israel into a legal battle at the International Criminal Court at The Hague, Netherlands, which is already pursuing a preliminary examination into settlements. \n Among the law's problematic elements is that the West Bank is not sovereign Israeli territory and that Palestinians who live there are not citizens and do not have the right to vote for the government that imposed the law on them. \n Palestinians condemned the law. \n \"This is an escalation that would only lead to more instability and chaos. It is unacceptable. It is denounced and the international community should act immediately,\" said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. \n Netanyahu faced intense pressure from within his nationalist coalition, especially from the pro-settler Jewish Home party, to press ahead with the vote following the court-ordered evacuation last week of the illegal Amona outpost found to have been built on private Palestinian land. Over 40 settler families were forced to leave the 20-year-old outpost, and on Monday construction vehicles demolished and removed the trailer homes that remained behind. \n Opposition legislators said Netanyahu's support for the law was a high-stakes risk meant solely to curry favor with settler constituents and their potent political lobby. \n \"For how many settler votes is Netanyahu willing to pass a law that he admits will drag us to The Hague?\" Zehava Galon, leader of the dovish Meretz party, wrote on Facebook ahead of the vote. \"The prime minister declares that the legalization bill is dangerous for Israel and instead of standing on his hind legs to stop this shameful law, he presses ahead with it.\" \n After years of condemnations from the Obama administration over settlement construction, Israel's government has ramped up settlement initiatives since Trump took office, announcing plans for some 6,000 new homes in the West Bank and east Jerusalem and promising to build a new settlement for the Amona evacuees. \n Trump has signaled a far more accepting approach to settlements, raising hopes in Netanyahu's government that it will be able to step up construction. The White House said little as Netanyahu announced plans during Trump's first two weeks in office to build over 6,000 new settler homes. But after Netanyahu announced his plan to establish a new settlement for the first time in two decades, Trump indicated that he, too, might have his limits. \n \"While we don't believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal,\" the White House said. \n The Palestinians want the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip \u2014 territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war \u2014 for their future state. Much of the international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to reaching peace with the Palestinians. Shortly before leaving office, President Barack Obama allowed the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution declaring settlements illegal. Obama cited the Israeli outpost legislation as a reason for not vetoing the resolution. \n Before the law passed, the U.N. Mideast envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, called on lawmakers to vote against the law, saying that \"it will have far-reaching legal consequences for Israel and greatly diminish the prospects for Arab-Israeli peace.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Israel passes law legalizing thousands of settlement homes"}

{"date": "February 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump supporter Peter Chianchiano, right, clashed with Donna Davis, co-founder of the Tampa chapter of Black Lives Matter, at a \"Trump Not Welcome\" protest in Tampa, Fla. \n WASHINGTON >> Scrappy as ever, Donald Trump dismissed polls showing low approval ratings as \"fake news\" today. But whatever his opinion, active opposition to his go-it-alone presidency appears to be widening.  \n From corporate boardrooms to the halls of Congress, Trump is facing an unprecedented effort to disrupt even the most basic of his presidential functions. It's an evolving, largely grass-roots effort that aims to follow Trump and his potential supporters everywhere they go \u2014 and there are early signs that it's having an impact. \n The Trump name alone is enough to spark outrage. There are plans for a mass \"mooning\" of Trump Tower in Chicago. Boycotts are underway of companies that sell Ivanka Trump's clothing line or advertise on NBC's \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" where Trump has remained an executive producer. \n Congressional offices are being flooded with emails, social media messages and calls jamming phone lines. Hundreds of protesters are flocking to town halls and local congressional offices, some in strongly Republican districts, to voice their opposition to Trump's Cabinet picks, health care plans and refugee restrictions. \n The goal, say organizers of some of the efforts, is nothing short of complete resistance. It's a strategy Democrats say they learned from the success of the tea party movement, which stymied President Barack Obama's agenda through protests, door-to-door political action campaigns and online activism. \n \"The lesson from the last eight years is, sadly, that implacable resistance works,\" said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va. \"Because it's all about your base, and I will simply point out that our base is bigger than theirs, and it's riled up.\" \n Trump and some Republicans shrug it off as sore losers unwilling to accept the results of the election. The president's core supporters, in states like Iowa and Wisconsin, applaud him as a man of action, delivering on his campaign promises to move quickly and shake up Washington. \n Although recent polls show his approval ratings in the 40s, a historic low for a new president, Trump rejects the surveys as false. \n \"Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting,\" he tweeted today. \"I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it.\" \n Later today, Trump renewed his Twitter attacks on The New York Times, slamming the paper \"for the poor reporting it did on my election win. Now they are worse!\" \n Trump's base is likely to reward him for his actions, say former White House aides, who note that all presidents face opposition and public demonstrations. \n \"It's only a problem if it lets it stop him from doing what he seeks to do,\" said former George W. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer, who recalled a travel stop in Portland, Oregon, when protesters threw rocks at the president's motorcade. \"When it comes to policy full speed ahead, the people screaming at you can't be convinced to be for you in any case.\" \n But recent presidents never faced the kind of multi-front opposition that Trump is now experiencing so early in their terms. \n Last week, he canceled a trip to the Harley-Davidson factory in Milwaukee, where local groups planned to protest his event. The White House said the protests weren't the cause. And on Saturday, more than 1,000 protesters beat drums, sang and chanted outside the gates of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, where the president was attending a Red Cross benefit. \n The displays of public outrage have been aimed not only at Trump but at lawmakers, world leaders and corporate executives who might be tempted to work with him to pass key parts of his agenda, like replacing the health care law or rewriting trade agreements. \n The White House claims to be unimpressed by the protests. In fact, a lot of the demonstrators are simply paid to show up and shout, says Trump Press Secretary Sean Spicer. But that's just a fantasy, foes say. \n \"The level of mobilization against Trump is almost like nothing I've ever seen before,\" said Joe Dinkin, spokesman for the Working Families Party, which coordinates weekly anti-Trump events across the country. \"Collaboration with Trump is a path that will bring well-deserved ire.\" \n Already, there are some signs that the early efforts may be having an impact on his ability to promote his agenda across the globe. On Monday, the speaker of Britain's House of Commons said he strongly opposes Trump addressing Parliament, making it unlikely he'll be given the honor during a state visit later this year. \n Technology executive Elon Musk spent hours on Twitter over the weekend defending his decision to serve on Trump's business council. So far, one CEO\u2014 Uber's Travis Kalanick \u2014 has quit the group after facing a weeklong rider boycott. \n The ACLU saw donations pour in after it sued the government over the refugee ban. \n And Republican lawmakers are bracing themselves for an onslaught of rowdy town hall meetings, after congressmen in California and Florida faced raucous crowds last weekend. \n \"The situation was rapidly escalating into a riot,\" said California Rep. Tom McClintock, who had to be extracted by police from an event in downtown Roseville, the population center of his sprawling congressional district. \"One thing came through loud and clear: They were not angry at President Trump for breaking any of his promises \u2013 they were angry at him for keeping them.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Anti-Trump protests complicate start of his presidency"}

{"date": "February 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump spoke at the U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command at MacDill Air Force Base. \n MACDILL AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. >>President Donald Trump accused the media today of deliberately minimizing coverage of the threat posed by the Islamic State group, saying news outlets \"have their reasons\" for not reporting what he described as a \"genocide\" underway at the hands of the group.  \n The president did not immediately offer evidence to support his claim, made during the new commander in chief's first visit to the headquarters for U.S. Central Command. Later, the White House released a list of 78 attacks it described as \"executed or inspired by\" the Islamic State group since September 2014. The White House said \"most\" on the list did not get sufficient media attention, although it did not explain how it defined the term. Some of the incidents on the list received widespread attention and deep reporting. \n \"You've seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it's happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported,\" Trump told a group of military leaders and troops during the visit. \"And in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that.\" \n Trump, who has made relentless criticism of the media a hallmark of his presidency, did not explain why he thinks news outlets minimize attention on such attacks. \n Later, White House spokesman Sean Spicer tried to tone down the president's remarks, saying it was a question of balance: \"Like a protest gets blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn't necessarily get the same coverage.\" \n The list released late today included incidents like a truck massacre in Nice, France, that killed dozens and received widespread attention, as well as less high-profile incidents in which nobody was killed. \n The AP could not verify that each of the incidents had connections to the Islamic State group. The list appeared to be hastily assembled, including several misspellings of the word \"attacker.\" \n Trump also used the visit to CENTCOM to defend his immigration and refugee restrictions and reaffirm his support for NATO. \n He laced his speech with references to homeland security amid a court battle over his travel ban on people from seven majority-Muslim countries. He did not directly mention the case now before a federal appeals court after a lower court temporarily suspended the ban. \n \"We need strong programs\" so that \"people that love us and want to love our country and will end up loving our country are allowed in\" and those who \"want to destroy us and destroy our country\" are kept out, Trump said. \n \"Freedom, security and justice will prevail,\" Trump added. \"We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and we will not allow it to take root in our country. We're not going to allow it.\" \n Trump touched upon various alliances in his remarks, noting, \"we strongly support NATO.\" \n He spoke Sunday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. A White House statement said the two \"discussed how to encourage all NATO allies to meet their defense spending commitments,\" and also talked about the crisis in Ukraine and security challenges facing NATO countries. \n Trump once dismissed the trans-Atlantic military alliance as \"obsolete,\" and said he would decide whether to protect NATO countries against Russian aggression based on whether those countries \"have fulfilled their obligations to us.\" \n Speaking as commander in chief, Trump repeated his promises to defeat \"radical Islamic terrorists\" but provided no specifics on any policy changes he wants in the fight against the Islamic State. \n Before his remarks, Trump sat down for lunch with a room full of troops in fatigues from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, as well as senior members of his White House staff. \n Trump made small talk with some of the soldiers, discussing everything from football to military careers. \n \"Gonna make it a career?\" Trump asked one person. \n \"C'mon, you have to stay,\" he urged another. \n Trump also hailed New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, saying he \"cemented his place\" in football history after his fifth Super Bowl win Sunday. \n Trump stopped at the base on the way back to Washington after his first weekend away from the White House. Trump spent the weekend at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, with first lady Melania Trump, who had not appeared in public since shortly after her husband took office. \n At MacDill, the president was briefed by CENTCOM and SOCOM leaders. A number of his advisers, including Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, also attended. \n Trump met with Florida Gov. Rick Scott before delivering his remarks, telling the crowd at CENTCOM that Scott's endorsement of his candidacy for president \"makes him a better friend of mine,\" adding that with those who don't offer their endorsement, \"it's never quite the same.\" \n CENTCOM oversaw a recent raid by U.S. special operations forces on an al-Qaida compound in Yemen, the first military operation authorized by Trump. A Navy SEAL, Senior Chief Special Warfare Operator William \"Ryan\" Owens, 36, of Peoria, Illinois, was killed, making him the first known U.S. combat casualty under Trump. \n Three other U.S. service members were wounded in the operation. More than half a dozen suspected militants and more than a dozen civilians were also killed, including the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric and U.S. citizen who was targeted and killed in 2011 by a U.S. drone strike. \n Trump made no mention of Owens or the raid in Yemen during his remarks today, but he paid recognition to the sacrifices of American military families and the spouses of American soldiers, vowing his support to those who risk their lives for the country. \n \"We protect those who protect us, and we will never, ever let you down,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump says media 'doesn't want to report' extremist attacks"}

{"date": "February 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n \"Fake news,\" which has gotten a lot of attention for its potential role in swaying the 2016 presidential election, has fascinated researchers for some time. \n NEW YORK >> You, too, can join the battle against misleading and other \"fake\" news online. But your options are somewhat limited unless you're already an academic or data scientist who's been studying the subject since way before Donald Trump started running for president. \n Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia, a research scientist at Indiana University, fits that bill. He helped create a tool tracking how unsubstantiated claims spread online, a phenomenon that first caught his eye during the Ebola crisis in 2014. \n \"We started seeing a lot of content that was spreading, completely fabricated claims about importations of Ebola, (such as) entire towns in Texas being under quarantine,\" he says. \"What caught our attention was that these claims were created using names of publications that sounded like newspapers. And they were getting a lot of traction on social media.\" \n \"Fake news,\" which has gotten a lot of attention for its potential role in swaying the 2016 presidential election, has fascinated researchers for some time. Their studies have yielded tools that help track how \"alternative facts\" spread, and others that let you identify fake stories or block them altogether. \n DECIPHERING TWITTER RUMORS \n Some of these are still baby steps in dealing with the phenomenon, but they're part of a larger effort that now involves Facebook , Google and big media companies actively trying to tamp down the spread of fake stories. And the researchers were there first. \n Tanushree Mitra, a doctoral student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, began a project three years ago to see how misinformation and fake news spread through Twitter. At the time, she says, \"companies like Facebook and Twitter were not paying much attention.\" \n What attracted her to the project was the prevalence of fake news that spread online following natural disasters such as Superstorm Sandy in 2012. When she saw that people were sharing a lot of incorrect or misleading information about the events, Mitra decided to track both big stories and smaller rumors with the goal of creating an app that could help ordinary people sort fact from fiction so they can make decisions that could be crucial to their wellbeing. \n Mitra and her fellow researchers scanned 66 million tweets linked to nearly 1,400 real-world events to identify words and phrases linked to perceived levels of credibility. Looking at tweets surrounding news events in 2014 and 2015 \u2014 including the Ebola crisis, the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris and the death of Eric Garner in a confrontation of police officers in New York City \u2014 they asked people to judge tweets based on how credible they thought the posts were. \n Words such as \"eager,\" \"terrific\" and \"undeniable\" were linked to more credible posts, while words such as \"ha,\" \"grins\" and \"suspects\" were the opposite. A computer matched the humans' opinions 68 percent of the time. The next step, an app, could help people rate the credibility of tweets and other social media posts. \n TRACKING HOAXES \n A group of researchers at Indiana University have created an online tool called Hoaxy that seeks to visualize \"the spread of claims and related fact checking online.\" Although it's still a work in progress, Hoaxy can trace the origin of, for instance, the false claim that millions of votes in the 2015 presidential election were cast by \"illegal aliens.\" Type in your search terms and Hoaxy will report back with stories that spread the claims, as well as fact-checking articles that debunked it. \n In this instance, the claim goes back to a November article from Infowars.com that was shared 17,961 times on Twitter and 52,200 times on Facebook, according to Hoaxy. The site only tracks actual links people shared, so it misses anything that's paraphrased or posted without a link. \n A data visualization tool shows the intertwined web of Twitter users who spread both the claims and the fact checks, and how they are connected to one another. The researchers focused on Twitter because the service makes more data available to the public, which makes it easier to use in data-tracking tools than Facebook. \n LEAD A HORSE TO WATER \n Tools like Hoaxy or rumor-identification apps are only helpful if people use them. The same goes for another approach \u2014 using a web browser plug-in to identify or block fake-news stories. For instance, the Chrome extension \"Fake News Alert,\" created last year, says it will tell you when you are visiting a site \"known for spreading fake news.\" \n But there are a few drawbacks. Many people aren't willing to go to the trouble of adding new extensions to their browser. And such extensions only work on the desktop version of Chrome, not its mobile counterpart. \n \"Fake News Alert\" also uses a widely circulated but oft-criticized list of fake and misleading news sites assembled by a Merrimack College professor. The list casts a very broad net and includes some established, but highly partisan sites such as the right-wing Breitbart News and the left-wing Occupy Democrats. \n A final obstacle: While fake news has been in the real news a lot, many people simply aren't that aware of it. \n \"A lot of consumers are not savvy about it,\" says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University who follows the fake news phenomenon. \"And of those that are \u2014 and it's a small number\u2014 not a lot of them add plug-ins to browsers.\" \n EDUCATE THE PEOPLE \n Chiagouris believes we are at the \"beginning of the beginning\" when it comes to defining just what fake news is and how to combat it. But he and other experts say technological solutions like apps and plug-ins are unlikely to get to the root of the problem. \n The real solution, he says, will start in school: \"not college, grammar school.\" \n The better educated and informed the public is, the more likely they are going to be \"asking questions and exploring alternative sources of information,\" says Mike Posner, co-founder and co-director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"What you really want is people saying they want to see different sides of an issue, looking at things by people who don't agree with me, so one (part of the solution) is public education.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fighting fake news isn't just up to Facebook and Google"}

{"date": "February 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Farhad Khan, who has attended the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce for more than seven years, shows members of the media its charred remains, in Fort Pierce, Fla. \n FORT PIERCE, Fla. >> An ex-convict who posted anti-Islamic rants online pleaded no contest and was sentenced to 30 years in prison on Monday for setting fire to a mosque that the Orlando nightclub shooter attended occasionally. \n Joseph Schreiber, dressed in a burnt orange jumpsuit, his wrists and ankles shackled, pleaded no contest during Monday's hearing before Circuit Judge Steven Levin. A no contest plea is treated the same as a guilty plea. Schreiber answered Levin's questions in a clear, unwavering voice before sentencing. He was also ordered to pay $10,000 in restitution although damages exceeded $100,000. Because he was declared a habitual offender, he could have received a life sentence. \n He had confessed to detectives that he set fire to the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce last Sept. 11, the 15th anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks. The damage to the mosque was so extensive that the leaders recently announced that it will move. \n Omar Mateen was killed by police after opening fire at the Pulse nightclub on June 12 in a rampage that left 49 victims dead and 53 wounded, making it the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Mateen professed allegiance to the Islamic State group. His father is among roughly 100 people who regularly attend the mosque. \n Schreiber, who is Jewish, posted on Facebook last July that \"All Islam is radical\" and that all Muslims should be treated as terrorists and criminals. \n Prosecutor Steve Gosnell said Schreiber, 32, confessed to detectives that he set the fire, saying he believed Muslims \"are trying to infiltrate our government\" and that \"the teaching of Islam should be completely, completely illegal.\" \n Before he was sentenced, Schreiber read a written statement entitled \"From the Mountaintops, Stop the Killings\" where he said the fire was not caused by hate but by his anxiety. He feared that Florida could be the site of another 9-11, Boston Marathon bombing or Pulse nightclub shooting, he said. \n \"My message is this to all the Muslim communities on the face of the Earth \u2014 make peace with America and make peace with Israel and stop the killings, stop the attacks,\" he said. \n Schreiber then turned to a man he thought was the mosque's imam and apologized. Mosque member Mohammad Malik whispered \"thank you\" in return. \n \"In the Islamic faith and in all faiths, we believe that God is merciful and just as we want to be forgiven by him we should also forgive,\" Malik said after the hearing. \"I believe he was misled. Misled by fear mongering, misled by false information\" about Islam. He said the \"bright spot\" of the fire is that the local Jewish and Islamic communities are now communicating. \n Rabbi Bruce Benson, who leads a local Reform synagogue, said he has been meeting with Schreiber regularly since his arrest and believes he is remorseful. Benson said he believes Schreiber subconsciously set the fire just before midnight because no one would be there. \n \"From the first day I spoke to him, he was thankful no one was hurt,\" Benson said. \"He didn't do this on a Friday afternoon when Mr. Malik and the parishioners were there. He wasn't trying to do this to hurt people. For some reason, he was trying to make a statement.\" \n Schreiber was previously sentenced twice to state prison for theft, according to records from the Florida Department of Corrections. The records show he served his first sentence from March 2008 to July 2009 and his second from June 2010 to August 2014. \n Last September, a former inmate who served time with Schreiber at the faith-based Lawtey Correctional Institution, described Schreiber as being a \"couple cans short of a six-pack.\" \n Ralph Alfonso said Schreiber joined a Messianic Jewish group he led because he was looking for a place to fit in. Messianic Jews follow Jewish law and the Torah but also believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah. He said Schreiber sometimes would say something negative about Muslims, but \"we would tell him that's not what we believe, that it is not godly.\" \n A surveillance video from the mosque showed Schreiber driving up to the mosque on a motorcycle and approaching the building, possibly talking on a cellphone. Gosnell said Monday that investigators now doubt he was talking on his phone and, if he was, they were never able to determine with whom. \n He carried a bottle of liquid and some papers and left when there was a flash. The first 911 calls were made about 45 minutes later, after the fire had spread to the attic.

Patty Murray, D-Wash., said on the floor around mid-day today. \"And I strongly encourage people across the country to join us \u2014 to double down on your advocacy \u2014 and to keep making your voices heard for these last 24 hours.\" \n Republicans accused Democrats of slow-walking qualified nominees to placate liberal base voters who still haven't come to terms with Trump's election. \n \"It seems this gridlock and opposition has far less to do with the nominees actually before us than the man who nominated them,\" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \"Enough is enough.\" \n In addition to DeVos, Republicans hope to confirm a series of other divisive nominees this week: Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general, GOP Rep. Tom Price of Georgia as secretary of Health and Human Services, and financier Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary. \n In each case Democrats intend to use the maximum time allowed under the Senate's arcane rules to debate the nominations, which may result in a series of late-night votes this week and delay Mnuchin's approval until Saturday. \n Republicans complain that previous presidents have been able to put their Cabinets in place more quickly. Democrats say it's Trump's fault because many of his nominees have complicated financial arrangements and ethical entanglements they claim they have not had enough time to dissect. Thus far, six Cabinet and high-level officials have been confirmed, including the secretaries of Defense, Homeland Security and Transportation. \n The clash over nominees has created a toxic atmosphere in the Senate that mirrors the tense national mood since Trump's election, with Democrats boycotting committee votes and Republicans unilaterally jamming nominees through committee without Democrats present. Republicans control the Senate with a narrow 52-48 margin, yet there is very little suspense about the final outcome on any of the nominees. That's because Democrats themselves changed Senate rules when they were in the majority several years ago so that Cabinet nominees can now be approved with a simple majority in the 100-seat Senate, not the 60 votes previously required. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Senate in round-the-clock session to confirm Trump Cabinet"}

The aquarium acquired him from the Sydney Aquarium in Australia during a 1933 collecting expedition and Granddad was one of two lungfish that attracted visitors during that year's A Century of Progress International Exposition in Chicago.

The Trumps are attending a Super Bowl party at the club. \n WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. >> President Donald Trump has long expressed a desire for improved relations with Moscow, but his latest comments about Russian President Vladimir Putin and the U.S. are leading some fellow Republicans to take a step back from the president \u2014 on this issue at least. \n Told by Fox News' Bill O'Reilly during an interview that the Russian leader is \"a killer,\" Trump said the U.S. has killers, too. \n \"What do you think? Our country's so innocent?\" Trump said during the taped interview broadcast during Sunday's Super Bowl pregame show. \n Trump has praised Putin and signaled that U.S.-Russia relations could be in for a makeover under his leadership, even after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. \n During Putin's years in power, a number of prominent Russian opposition figures and journalists have been killed. \n Trump says in the interview that he respects a lot of people, including Putin \"but that doesn't mean I'm going to get along with him. He's a leader of his country. I say it's better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world \u2014 that's a good thing,\" Trump said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. \"Will I get along with him? I have no idea.\" \n O'Reilly then said about Putin: \"But he's a killer, though. Putin's a killer.\" \n Trump responded: \"There are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country's so innocent?\" \n When O'Reilly says he doesn't know any U.S. government leaders who are killers, Trump said \"take a look at what we've done, too.

Trump won the Electoral College vote but lost the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes to Clinton. \n Trump recently announced on Twitter that he would call for a \"major investigation\" into voter fraud. He said during the Fox News interview that he will set up a commission to be headed by Vice President Mike Pence and \"we're going to look at it very, very carefully.\" \n Asked earlier about Trump's promised investigation, McConnell said he saw no federal role because states historically have handled voter fraud investigations. \"I don't think we ought to spend any federal money investigating that,\" he said on CNN. \n On other issues, Trump said in the interview that: \n \u2014 California's consideration of legislation to become a statewide sanctuary for people living in the country illegally is \"ridiculous.\" He suggested withholding federal funding as a possible punishment. \n \u2014 Plans to enact a complete replacement for the Affordable Care Act could slip into next year. \"I would like to say by the end of the year, at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year.\" \n \u2014 Living in the White House is \"a surreal experience in a certain way, but you have to get over it, because there's so much work to be done.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Republicans denounce 'thug' Putin after Trump defense"}

They don't mean to sound ungrateful, but New York public college students who would stand to gain from the nation's most ambitious free-tuition proposal were quick to point out a sobering reality from their own meager finances: Free tuition doesn't mean free college. \n BUFFALO, N.Y. >> They don't mean to sound ungrateful, but \u2026 New York public college students who would stand to gain from the nation's most ambitious free-tuition proposal are quick to point out a sobering reality from their own meager finances: Free tuition doesn't mean free college. \n Take Brooklyn College senior Florencia Salinas, who despite having her tuition nearly covered in full through scholarships and grants, still expects to graduate with a daunting $50,000 in debt. Or Buffalo State College junior Avery Edwards, who despite similar financial aid expects to owe $20,000 after collecting his degree next year. \n That's because tuition, at around $6,500 a year, is just about a third of the typical four-year student's total public college bill in New York. Room and board are the bigger-ticket items at nearly $13,000 a year, and student fees and books tack on another $3,000. \n Those extra expenses would not be covered under Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo's Excelsior Scholarship proposal, which would pay only the difference between financial aid and tuition at State University of New York or City University of New York campuses for full-time students from families earning $125,000 or less. \n Students interviewed by The Associated Press said that any tuition help is welcome, but they could also use help paying for the many other costs of a college education. \n \"It's less that my parents would have to pay. It's less that I would have to pay,\" said Nigel Peters, a sophomore at Buffalo State College, part of the state's sprawling public college system, which includes 64 State University of New York and 24 City University of New York institutions. \n But \"enough?\" he said. \"No, not at all.\" \n The 19-year-old's parents in Queens work overtime to keep the financial burden off of him and his twin sister, who attends college in Delaware. His mother, who already juggles positions in accounting and retail, recently picked up a third job, at an arena box office. They make too much to get aid now, he said, but \"we don't make enough so that my parents don't have to work their behinds off to put me and my sister through school.\" \n He would welcome tuition help, he said, especially with plans to pay his own way his senior year. But even if it's covered by then, Peters said, he still will likely work at his minimum-wage job over breaks and need loans to pay for everything else. \n Most of Salinas' debt comes from housing costs, so the Cuomo plan probably wouldn't have helped her graduate in better financial shape. The 22-year-old computer science major said she would rather see the state put the money into the faculty and facilities at CUNY. \n Cuomo's proposal, which still faces approval by lawmakers, is one of an increasing number of plans across the country that seek to address the nation's suffocating $1.2 trillion in student debt. \n Democratic Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo has proposed making two years of community college or the final two years of a four-year degree free at a public college in that state. A plan from Democratic Colorado gubernatorial candidate Mike Johnston would require volunteer service as a condition of two free years of college or job training. \n All differ from independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' no-tuition plan, which became a major issue during the presidential campaign. Sanders' plan would have eliminated tuition at public universities and colleges, while Cuomo's \"last-dollar\" approach pays the tuition after awards from the state and federal sources of aid are applied. \n It's a distinction that troubles advocates for lower-income students, who say the program, while expanding aid to the middle class, won't improve anything for them because their tuition is already covered. They warn it might hurt needy students if it takes away some of the flexibility they now have to use federal Pell awards for expenses other than tuition. \n \"Our goal is to provide the most students with the greatest opportunity,\" Cuomo spokeswoman Dani Lever said, \"and that goal is met by the Excelsior Scholarship program.\" \n The New York program also comes with a push to get students to tap into existing state and federal financial aid programs that could lower their costs even more. SUNY Chancellor Nancy Zimpher estimated New Yorkers leave $174 million of federal aid untouched each year. \n Lawmakers at a budget hearing last month also worried that the $163 million estimated cost of the New York proposal is too low. Cuomo budget officials said they based the estimate in part on free community college programs in other states. The program would also draw on the state's existing $1 billion Tuition Assistance Program. \n SUNY enrolls 403,000 undergraduate students and CUNY 245,000 students. Based on 2014-15 enrollment, about 40,000 students who meet the criteria would begin to have their tuition paid. \n Said state Sen. Kenneth LaValle, a Long Island Republican: \"All the bean counters say there's no way.\" \n Associated Press writers Karen Matthews in New York City and Nicholas Riccardi in Denver contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Free tuition doesn't mean free college, students point out"}

While foreign brand-name goods are often paid for in U.S. dollars, Euros or Chinese yuan, and priced accordingly at the official exchange rate, most people buy their daily necessities in North Korea's own currency, the won, which has an unofficial and more market-friendly exchange rate. \n Pyongyang, North Korea >> To get a feel for how North Korea's economy works, go buy a roll of toilet paper. Or start up a mobile phone network. \n As capitalist-style markets have grown more important in North Korea, so has a market-friendly exchange rate for the much-coveted U.S. dollars, euros and Chinese yuan that lubricate the North's economy. But the official and unofficial rates are totally out of whack. And as one big investor recently found out, the difference can mean hundreds of millions of dollars in lost profits. \n Dueling exchange rates are a common issue for developing countries that have an official premium rate set by the government, often for political purposes that don't reflect economic realities and are therefore often ignored in the marketplace. \n The discrepancy can severely hamper foreign investment, undermine confidence in the local currency and contribute to corruption and economic instability. \n But nowhere in the world is the gap bigger than North Korea, according to Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at the Johns Hopkins University who specializes in hyperinflation, \n \"The North Korean won's black market premium is the highest in the world: a fantastic 6,440 percent,\" he said. For comparison's sake, the black market premium for the Syrian pound is \"only\" 144.3 percent of the official rate, he said. \n What does such a system look like on the ground? \n If you pick up that roll of toilet paper in a shop catering to foreigners, tourists or the relatively affluent elite in the capital, it would probably have a price tag in the 200-400 won range, or $2-4. The prices in won are calculated according to the official exchange rate. In reality, you can't actually pay in won, at least not at that rate. \n Typical Pyongyang residents, meanwhile, are more likely to do their shopping at a place like the Kwangbok Department Store, which does take won and therefore uses an entirely different pricing system. Here, a roll of toilet paper costs 1,400 won. An exchange booth right next to the checkout counter posts the day's rates \u2014 not the official 108-or-so won to the dollar, but a whopping 8,000-plus. \n \"The official rate is a political rate,\" Hanke said. \"It is, therefore, totally arbitrary and no one really knows how it is determined. The black-market rate is a free-market rate. The supply and demand for dollars and won on the black market calls the tune and sets the rate.\" \n Most North Koreans don't have foreign currency to begin with and don't shop in upscale stores, so the system is fairly invisible most of the time. \n On a larger scale, it has major ramifications. \n One of North Korea's biggest recent success stories has been the rapid spread of mobile phones, now in the millions, thanks to capital and expertise invested by the Egyptian conglomerate Orascom. The venture, Orascom Telecom Media and Technology, was hugely profitable, but rather predictably hit a big wall when it tried to get its earnings out of North Korea. \n In late 2015, it announced a huge loss after North Korea insisted it use the unofficial rate to convert its profits into dollars, turning what would have been $450 million into a mere $8 million. \n CEO Naguib Sawiris resigned on Jan. 1 this year. \n Sawiris refused to comment to the AP until after the company releases its next financial report. But the company, which has staff working out of a hotel in Pyongyang, is apparently still waiting to get even its $8 million out of North Korea. \n The importance of the unofficial exchange rate has grown tremendously since the 1990s, when the collapse of the Soviet bloc and natural disasters that devastated harvests took North Korea's economy to the verge of collapse. Citizens who previously relied on the government for their needs had to learn how to fend for themselves. \n The result was the rise of an unofficial, but by now well-established, capitalist-style market, where prices are competitive and determined by supply and demand. Transactions are primarily made in cash. Outside experts estimate that half or even more of all economic activity in the North is done in this gray zone. \n The transformation has not been without its shocks. \n In 2009, leader Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, ordered a revaluation of the won, effectively cutting two zeros off the value of each bill. That appears to have been an attempt to reassert control over nouveaux riches who had profited too much from the gray market and were seen as a potential political threat. \n That put the country through a severe bout of hyperinflation from late 2009 to early 2011. Monthly inflation peaked at 496 percent in March 2010, according to Hanke's calculations, and the value of the won on the black market collapsed. \n To the surprise of many, the won appears to have rebounded and stayed within a fairly stable range, both officially and at the unofficial rate, since Kim Jong Un assumed power in late 2011. \n \"This is a major quandary, and an apparent success story of the Kim regime,\" said William Brown, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and non-resident fellow at the Korea Economic Institute of America. \"I think for the time being people are getting used to monetary stability and that is allowing a big increase in market activity and growth.\" \n He warned, however, that the stability could be fragile. \n \"Some kind of shock would instantly cause people to trade in their won for dollars and the exchange rate and won prices would soar,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "North Korean economics 101: How much is a dollar worth?"}
