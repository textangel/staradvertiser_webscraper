{"date": "February 10, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly spoke at a news conference as cars entered the United States from Mexico at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego. \n SAN DIEGO >>U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told law enforcement officials on a tour of nation's border with Mexico today that he couldn't define a sanctuary city, which President Donald Trump has targeted for withdrawal of federal funding for refusing to cooperate with immigration authorities. \n Trump's executive order on immigration last month says a \"sanctuary jurisdiction\" defies federal law by shielding people in the country illegally and that they have caused \"immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.\" While sanctuary cities are broadly understood to mean a refusal to cooperate with the federal government on immigration enforcement, a precise definition has eluded many, including in law enforcement. \n \"I don't have a clue,\" Kelly told San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman when she asked for a definition. \n The blunt-spoken, retired four-star general went on to say it was inconceivable why any jurisdiction wouldn't want criminals removed from their communities. \"I'm stunned when people say, 'Well, we're not going to cooperate with you even in the event of convicted criminals,\" he said. \n Kelly said it would be difficult to justify immigration enforcement grants to cities that refuse to cooperate. \n \"I promise you we'll work with you and will make no Draconian moves until I fully understand what a given locale might be doing or not doing,\" he told Zimmerman and other local police chiefs and sheriffs. \n Kelly spoke near the end of a two-day tour of the border in Arizona and California. In San Diego, he joined agents on two house visits to deport people in the country illegally and toured a cross-border drug tunnel. Last week he toured the border in south Texas. \n The secretary said he got \"an earful\" of suggestions from his employees on where to extend a border wall with Mexico, which currently covers about 700 miles of the 2,000-mile international divide. \n \"I'll take that on board, we'll bring it back to Washington, put in the blender and come up with a solution,\" he told federal, state and local law enforcement officials at San Diego's San Ysidro port of entry, the nation's busiest border crossing. \n On Tuesday, Kelly told lawmakers that he would like to see wall construction \"well underway\" within two years, but he held open the possibility that it wouldn't extend to areas where there are natural physical barriers. \n San Diego, which has one of the most fortified stretches of border, is often cited as an example of how walls can slow illegal crossings, but critics say fencing only forced people to more remote areas, particularly in Arizona, where many have died in extreme heat. \n Kelly later told reporters that he worried about a federal appeals court's refusal to reinstate Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. He said vetting practices in those countries \"are loose at best\" and that the countries include failing or faltering states. \n \"I am concerned in that we are unable to vet these folks who are coming here in a more meaningful way,\" he said. \n Asked about reports from advocacy groups that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents did a large roundup of people in the country illegally in Southern California and made arrests elsewhere, Kelly said authorities are executing the law. He didn't specifically address the reports but rejected the term 'roundup' and said officials cannot ignore federal laws. He said Congress should change the law if it sees fit. \n At the meeting with law enforcement officials, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore sought help for legal authority to hold criminals in the country illegally after they finish their sentences, giving ICE authorities more time to pick them up at county jails. Kelly said he didn't know if that was possible but would do so if he could. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Homeland Security head is pressed to define 'sanctuary city'"}

{"date": "February 10, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Residents looked at the collapsed portion of a bridge in Surigao hours after a powerful earthquake rocked Surigao del Norte province in southern Philippines. \n MANILA, Philippines >> A powerful nighttime earthquake in the southern Philippines killed at least six people and injured more than 120 others, as officials on Saturday combed through cracked buildings looking for more casualties. \n The late Friday quake with a magnitude of 6.5 roused residents from sleep in Surigao del Norte province, sending hundreds to flee their homes. The quake was centered about 14 kilometers (8 miles) northwest of the provincial capital of Surigao at a relatively shallow depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles), said Renato Solidum of the Philippine Institute of Seismology and Volcanology. \n Nearly 100 aftershocks have been felt, officials said. Evacuation centers accommodated wary residents overnight but many have returned home by Saturday, Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo said, adding officials were continuing to assess the damage in Surigao city and outlying towns. \n Solidum said the quake was set off by movement in a segment of the Philippine fault, which sits in the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" where quakes and volcanoes are common. \n At least six people were killed, some after being hit by falling debris and concrete walls, provincial disaster-response official Gilbert Gonzales said. At least 126 others were injured in Surigao city, about 700 kilometers (430 miles) southeast of Manila. \n \"Rescuers pulled out a man pinned by a collapsed wall in his house but he died and was no longer brought to a hospital,\" Gonzales said by telephone. \n TV footage showed the facade of a number of buildings heavily cracked, their glass windows shattered with canopies and debris falling on parked cars on the street below. Rescuers in one building are trying to break a collapsed concrete slab to check if there were people pinned underneath. \n Roads had visible cracks in the coastal city and a bridge collapsed in an outlying town. Rescue teams were checking for possible casualties in a village called Poknoy in the city of 140,500 people, officials said. \n The city's airport was temporarily closed due to deep cracks in the runway, aviation officials said. A major port in Lipata district also was briefly closed while engineers checked the stability of an access road, Gonzales said. \n \"The shaking was so strong I could hardly stand,\" coast guard personnel Rayner Neil Elopre told the Associated Press by telephone. \n Village leaders asked residents to move to a school building on higher ground, Elopre said, pausing briefly during a mild aftershock while talking on the phone. \n Police officer Jimmy Sarael said he, his wife and two children embraced each other until the shaking eased. They later moved to the moonlit grounds outside the provincial capitol complex to join more than 1,000 jittery residents, he said. \n The last major earthquake that struck Surigao, an impoverished region also dealing with a communist insurgency, was in the 1800s, Solidum said. A magnitude 7.7 quake killed nearly 2,000 people on the northern island of Luzon in 1990. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Nighttime Philippines quake kills at least 6, damages runway"}

At one point, when DeVos tried to enter the school, two protesters blocked her path, forcing her to return to her car. D.C. police said one man was detained for assaulting a police officer. \n DeVos praised the school for its hard work and innovative approaches to teaching and vowed to strengthen public education. But she also had some tough words for the protesters. \n \"I respect peaceful protest, and I will not be deterred in executing the vital mission of the Department of Education,\" DeVos said in a statement. \"No school door in America will be blocked from those seeking to help our nation's school children.\" \n DeVos' visit itself was not advertised by the Education Department and was closed to the news media.

It's only a crime when you have a family and you pretend to be married.\" \n The demonstration comes a month after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case from Kody Brown and his four wives on the TLC show \"Sister Wives\" challenging Utah's bigamy law. \n The high court left Utah's law in place, but state legislators are considering changes this year that would leave those convicted under it facing harsher penalties if they're also convicted of other crimes such as domestic abuse. \n The sponsor, Republican Rep. Mike Noel of Kanab, said other changes in his proposal would help the law withstand any future court challenge. \n Shortly before the rally began outside the Capitol, Noel and more than half a dozen women who left polygamous communities held a news conference to defend his bill, saying the plural relationships hurt women and children. They said the closed communities where polygamy is practiced can be rife with welfare fraud and child abuse, sexual abuse and forced labor. \n Outside the Capitol, polygamy supporters said the law criminalizing a relationship between consenting adults keeps anyone witnessing crimes like fraud or abuse from speaking out. \n Prosecutors say they generally leave polygamists alone but need to keep the ban to pursue polygamists for other crimes. Only 10 people have been charged with violating the law between 2001 and 2011. \n Utah's current polygamy law bars married people from living with an extra spouse or claiming to have a second purported \"spiritual spouse.\" Noel's bill would make it a crime only if someone lives with and claims they have another spouse. \n It would also shield from prosecution anyone who leaves a polygamous relationship because they feared coercion, bodily harm, are underage or trying to protect a minor in a plural family. \n The bill was approved by a House committee this week and awaits a vote by the full House of Representatives. \n Court documents show there are about 30,000 polygamists in Utah. They believe polygamy brings exaltation in heaven \u2014 a legacy of the early Mormon church. The mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints abandoned the practice in 1890 and now strictly forbids it. \n Noel, who is Mormon, said Friday that his great-grandfather was jailed for being a polygamist and he's irritated that today's polygamists refer to themselves as Mormons. \n \"They've hijacked my religion and I actually resent that,\" Noel said. \n Brenda Nicholson, a former member of a sect led by Warren Jeffs on the Utah-Arizona border, said polygamy is not just a relationship involving consenting adults. \n \"It's not a choice,\" she said, \"if you're told this is what God expects of you.\" \n Jeffs now is serving a life sentence in Texas after being convicted of sexually assaulting girls he considered wives. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Polygamous families protest bigamy law at Utah Capitol"}

Saturday's rescue efforts during the morning high tide appeared more promising. \n \"Fingers crossed, the new whales are going to lead them out into deeper water,\" Lamason said. \"There's a chance some might come back onto the beach.\" \n Lamason said improved weather and crystal clear water helped with the latest rescue attempt. He said all the surviving whales were refloated, and about 100 volunteers formed a human chain in the water to prevent them from beaching again. \n He said volunteers were warned about the possibility of stingrays and sharks, after one of the dead whales appeared to have bite marks consistent with a shark. He said there had been no shark sightings. \n With the rescue effort now paused, officials are beginning to turn their attention to the grim task of disposing of hundreds of carcasses. \n Lamason said one option was to tether the carcasses to stakes or a boat in the shallow tidal waters and let them decompose. The problem with towing them out to sea or leaving them was that they could become gaseous and buoyant, and end up causing problems by floating into populated bays. \n Farewell Spit, a sliver of sand that arches like a hook into the Tasman Sea, has been the site of previous mass strandings. Sometimes described as a whale trap, the spit's long coastline and gently sloping beaches seem to make it difficult for whales to navigate away from once they get close. \n There are different theories as to why whales strand themselves, from chasing prey too far inshore to trying to protect a sick member of the group or escaping a predator. \n New Zealand has one of the highest rates of whale strandings in the world, and Friday's event is the nation's third-biggest in recorded history. The largest was in 1918, when about 1,000 pilot whales came ashore on the Chatham Islands. In 1985, about 450 whales stranded in Auckland. \n Pilot whales grow to about 7.5 meters (25 feet) and are common around New Zealand's waters. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New Zealanders refloat 100 pilot whales after 400 stranded"}

Toledo, who governed Peru from 2001 to 2006, is a visiting scholar at Stanford University in California. \n Authorities have also reached out to Israel because they said Toledo may have plans to take advantage of his wife's dual Belgian-Israeli citizenship to seek refuge in the country, which doesn't have an extradition treaty with the South American nation. \n The international manhunt comes a day after a judge issued an arrest order for Toledo, finding that the evidence presented by prosecutors suggested there was a high probability he had received bribes from a Brazilian construction firm that has admitted to paying off officials throughout Latin America. \n Toledo is accused of taking some $20 million in bribes from Odebrecht to favor the company so it could win a contract to build a highway from Brazil to Peru's Pacific Coastline. \n Toledo, who was last believed to be in Paris a week ago, has denied any wrongdoing. \n Odebrecht last year admitted in a plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department to paying some $800 million in bribes to politicians throughout Latin America including $29 million during the 2001-2006 governments of Toledo and his two successors. \n Although several countries have launched investigations, no head of state has yet to be arrested. \n The precipitous fall from grace for Toledo has come as a shock to many Peruvian who never could have imagined that the one-time academic born into an impoverished family of indigenous peasants may now soon join behind bars the former strongman, Alberto Fujimori, who he helped depose during massive street protests in 2000. \n A spokeswoman for Stanford said that Toledo is not an employee of the university but as a scholar has use of office space and access to libraries to conduct research for a book he's preparing on education in Latin America.

But he said the White House was also weighing other alternatives, including making changes to the order, which suspended the nation's refugee program and barred all entries from seven Muslim-majority countries. \n The president said a new executive order would likely change \"very little\" from the first. \n Trump's comments came a day after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a restraining order on the original travel ban. While a White House official initially suggested the administration would not ask the Supreme Court to overturn that order, chief of staff Reince Priebus later said \"every single court option is on the table,\" including a high court appeal. \n Priebus said the administration was also considering \"fighting out this case on the merits\" in a lower court. \n Trump's executive order was hastily unveiled at the end of his first week in office. It caused chaos at airports in the U.S. and sparked protests across the country. \n The president has cast the order as crucial for national security. Earlier Friday, he promised to take action \"very rapidly\" to protect the U.S. and its citizens in the wake of the appeals court decision, but he did not specify what steps he planned to take. \n \"We'll be doing things to continue to make our country safe,\" Trump pledged at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \"It will happen rapidly. We will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people.\" \n The president's comments were far more restrained than his angry reaction to last week's initial court ruling blocking the travel ban. Trump took aim at both the \"so-called judge\" in that case and the ruling, which he called \"ridiculous.\" \n Trump continued to conjure images of unspecified danger Friday, saying he had \"learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely president. And there are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen, I can tell you that. We will not allow that to happen.\" \n The 9th Circuit ruling represented a significant setback for Trump in just his third week in office. The appellate decision brushed aside arguments by the Justice Department that the president has the constitutional power to restrict entry to the United States and that the courts cannot second-guess his determination that such a step was needed to prevent terrorism. \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted that Trump \"ought to see the writing on the wall\" and abandon the proposal. The New York Democrat called on the president to \"roll up his sleeves\" and come up with \"a real, bipartisan plan to keep us safe.\" \n House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California promised, \"Democrats will continue to press for President Trump's dangerous and unconstitutional ban to be withdrawn.\" And Trump's former presidential rival Hillary Clinton offered a terse response on Twitter, noting the unanimous vote: \"3-0.\" \n Congress' Republican leaders, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, declined to comment. \n U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued the temporary restraining order halting the ban after Washington state and Minnesota sued, leading to the federal government's appeal. \n The Trump administration has said the seven nations \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 have raised terrorism concerns. The states have argued that the executive order unconstitutionally blocked entry based on religion and the travel ban harmed individuals, businesses and universities. \n Trump and his aides frequently refer to a ruling by a federal judge in Boston who declined last week to extend a temporary injunction against Trump's travel ban. In a separate federal ruling in Seattle, a different federal judge put the ban on hold nationwide; it is that judge's decision that the White House has challenged. \n \"It's a decision that we'll win, in my opinion, very easily and, by the way, we won that decision in Boston,\" Trump said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Colvin reported from Air Force One.

Lawyers for the state of Virginia are challenging President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration, arguing in federal court that his seven-nation travel ban violates the Constitution and is the result of \"animus toward Muslims.\" \n WASHINGTON >> Opponents of President Donald Trump's travel ban sought today to rack up another legal victory against the measure, believing they have the administration on the defensive after a federal appeals court refused to reinstate the order. \n As government attorneys debated their next move, they faced unsympathetic judges on both coasts. \n The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided Thursday with the states of Washington and Minnesota in refusing to reinstate the ban, opening the possibility that the case could advance to the U.S. Supreme Court. A federal judge today in Virginia also seemed inclined to rule against the administration in a different challenge. \n For his part, Trump promised today to take action \"very rapidly\" to protect the U.S., but offered no immediate details. He said he still expects to prevail against the legal challenges, despite the appellate court decision. \n In Virginia, a lawyer for the state asked a judge to impose a preliminary injunction barring the government from enforcing a portion of Trump's Jan. 27 executive order that bars anyone from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the U.S. for 90 days. \n A preliminary injunction would be long-lasting, continuing through the trial in a case. Still, because of the 9th Circuit's decision refusing to reinstate the order, the practical effect of any decision in Virginia may be muted for now. \n Judge Leonie Brinkema, who was appointed to the federal bench by President Bill Clinton in 1993, did not seem satisfied with answers about the executive order from an administration lawyer. \n Brinkema said that the order \"clearly has all kinds of weaknesses,\" and she asked the government to explain the justification for the ban, saying courts have been \"begging\" for that explanation. The president can legally suspend the entry of non-citizens into the country when he \"finds\" that their entry \"would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\" \n \"Finds,\" she said, doesn't mean just \"think.\" \n Virginia's Solicitor General Stuart Raphael said the government has been unable to answer the charge that the ban was targeted at Muslims. \n Brinkema, who did not say when she will rule, said that there was strong evidence that the order is harmful to national security. She quoted from a joint declaration filed in the case by former national security, foreign policy and intelligence officials, including former secretaries of state Madeline Albright and John Kerry, former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and former CIA Director and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. \n \"In our professional opinion, this Order cannot be justified on national security or foreign policy grounds. It does not perform its declared task of 'protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States,\" the declaration states. \n The group continued that Trump's executive order \"could do long-term damage to our national security and foreign policy interests.\" \n A lawyer for the administration, Erez Reuveni, countered that the group is not in the current administration. But he did not give any additional justification for the order. Instead, Reuveni argued that Virginia does not have the right to challenge the ban and that Brinkema does not have the power to review the president's executive order. \n As for how the government will move forward in the 9th Circuit case, Reuveni said no decisions had been made. \n \"We may appeal. We may not,\" Reuveni said. \"All options are being considered.\" \n Moments after the ruling Thursday, Trump tweeted, \"SEE YOU IN COURT,\" adding that \"THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\" But he did not specify what court he meant. \n The administration could appeal the ruling to a larger 9th Circuit panel or bypass that step and go straight to the U.S. Supreme Court. That could put the decision over whether to keep the temporary restraining order suspending the ban in the hands of a divided court that has a vacancy. Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch, probably could not be confirmed in time to take part in any consideration of the ban, which would expire in 90 days unless it is changed. \n The ban still faces lawsuits around the country, some filed by refugees directly affected by it. The Trump administration did win a legal victory earlier this month in Massachusetts, where a federal judge in Boston declined to extend a temporary injunction against the travel ban. But a separate federal ruling in Seattle later in the day put the ban on hold nationwide. It was the Seattle judge's ruling that was ultimately appealed to the 9th Circuit. \n Associated Press writers Kevin Thomas and Darlene Superville in Washington, D.C., and Gene Johnson in Seattle contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Travel ban opponents try to score more victories in court"}

{"date": "February 10, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, accompanied by their wives, first lady Melania Trump and Akie Abe, waved before boarding Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base Md. today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump shook hands with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, left, greeted Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, center right, at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington today. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump, fresh off patching up ties with China, reassured Japan's leader today that the U.S. will defend its close ally. Together, the pronouncements illustrated a shift toward a more mainstream Trump stance on U.S. policy toward Asia. \n Welcoming Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the White House with a hug, Trump said he wants to bring the post-World War II alliance with Japan \"even closer.\" While such calls are ritual after these types of meetings, from Trump they're sure to calm anxieties that he has stoked by demanding that America's partners pay more for their own defense. \n Abe, a nationalist adept at forging relationships with self-styled strongmen overseas, was the only world leader to meet the Republican before his inauguration. He is now the second to do so since Trump took office. Flattering the billionaire businessman, Abe said he would welcome the United States becoming \"even greater.\" \n He also invited Trump to visit Japan this year. Trump accepted, according to a joint statement. \n Other leaders of America's closest neighbors and allies, such as Mexico, Britain and Australia, have been singed by their encounters or conversations with Trump. \n But the optics today were positive. After a working lunch on economic issues, the two leaders boarded Air Force One with their wives for a trip to Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. Trump and Abe are scheduled to play golf Saturday. \n Their Oval Office meeting came hours after Trump reaffirmed Washington's long-standing \"one China\" policy in a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. That statement will similarly ease anxieties in East Asia after Beijing was angered and other capitals were rattled by earlier suggestions that he might use Taiwan as leverage in trade, security and other negotiations. \n Although Japan is a historic rival of China, Trump said that his long and \"warm\" conversation with Xi was good for Tokyo, too. \n \"I believe that will all work out very well for everybody, China, Japan, the United States and everybody in the region,\" Trump said at a joint news conference with Abe. \n Stepping carefully into Japan's longstanding territorial dispute with China over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, Trump said the U.S. is committed to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control. The implication was that the U.S.-Japan defense treaty covers the disputed islands, which Japan which calls the Senkaku, but China calls the Diaoyu. \n Beijing opposes such statements, but Trump's wording allowed for some diplomatic wiggle room. The joint statement released later was more explicit, however, in spelling out the U.S. commitment. \n Abe has championed a more active role for Japan's military. He has eased constraints imposed by the nation's pacifist post-war constitution and allowed forces to defend allies, even if Japan itself is not under attack. \n As a candidate, Trump urged even greater self-reliance, at one point even raising the notion of Japan and South Korea developing their own nuclear weapons as a deterrent to North Korea. \n He made no similar remark today, instead thanking Japan for hosting nearly 50,000 American troops, which also serve as a counterweight to China's increased regional influence. He said freedom of navigation and dealing with North Korea's missile and nuclear threats are a \"very high priority.\" \n There was less agreement on economics. \n One of Trump's first actions as president was to withdraw the U.S. from a 12-nation, trans-Pacific trade agreement that was negotiated by the Obama administration and strongly supported by Tokyo. \n Diverting from Trump's stance that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is bad for America, Abe stressed the importance of a \"free and fair common set of rules\" for trade among the worlds' most dynamic economies. \n \"That was the purpose of TPP. That importance has not changed,\" Abe said through an interpreter, though both leaders held out the possibility of a future bilateral, U.S.-Japanese deal. \n Trump has also criticized Toyota Motor Corp. for planning to build an assembly plant in Mexico and has complained Japanese don't buy enough U.S.-made cars. \n But Abe told U.S. business leaders today that \"a whopping majority\" of the Japanese cars running on American roads are manufactured in the U.S. by American workers. That includes 70 percent of Toyotas. Abe said Japanese business supports some 840,000 jobs in the United States. \n That may not be enough for Trump, who is highly sensitive to U.S. trade deficits. \n Japan logged the second-largest surplus with the U.S. last year, behind only China, and there had been some expectation Abe would use the visit to propose new Japanese investments to help Trump spur American job growth. There was no such announcement today. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump hugs ally Japan after easing U.S.-China tensions"}

All residents in a nearly 1.2-mile radius are to be evacuated, starting at 7 a.m. Sunday. Authorities will also evacuate a nearby refugee camp with about 450 residents. \n The bomb, dropped during an air raid on the city in the 1940s, was found last week during work to expand fuel storage tanks. \n A state of emergency has been declared in the three municipalities involved and about 1,000 police and 300 volunteers are expected to help out during the evacuation, Thessaloniki's Deputy Governor Voula Patoulidou told The Associated Press. \n \"It is the first time something like this is happening in Greece,\" Patoulidou said. \"The transfer of all residents is mandatory and we will go door-to-door to make sure everyone leaves.\" \n Thessaloniki's long-distance bus terminal, which is in the area, will shut down during the operation, and trains will also stop running to and from the city, as the main railway line passes through the exclusion zone. \n Traffic along a major road nearby will be halted, while churches in the area will not hold services. \n Army spokesman Col. Nikos Fanios said the device's exterior was too degraded to be able to determine whether it was a German or an Allied bomb. But one resident says he recalls the day it fell. \n \"The bombing was done by English and American planes on Sept. 17, 1944. It was Sunday lunchtime,\" said Giorgos Gerasimou, 86, whose home is half a mile from where the bomb was found. \"We could see the planes coming.\" \n They were targeting local German rail facilities, he said. Nazi Germany occupied Greece from 1941 until October 1944. \n A 13-year-old at the time, Gerasimou said he and his friends would go to the railway station each day for food rations. \n \"That day something told me I had to leave, and in the end we did,\" Gerasimou told the AP. \"When I heard the (air raid) sirens, I jumped into a ditch with my friends and we survived.\" \n Another one of his friends wasn't so lucky. Ten-year-old Panagiotis was killed in the air raid, Gerasimou said, clutching a photo of the boy that he keeps to this day. \n During Sunday's evacuation, residents will be transported by bus to schools, sports halls and cultural centers elsewhere in the city while the exclusion zone is cordoned off. \n Army bomb disposal experts will initially attempt to defuse the bomb's detonator, and then transport the device to an army firing range, where they will determine what further steps to take, said Fanios, the army spokesman. \n \"Every operation involving munitions is always difficult,\" he said. \n Some residents expressed concern about leaving their properties vacant. \n \"I'm really worried about the house, mainly in case thieves take advantage of the evacuation,\" said Giorgos Aravias, 44. \"I hope there are security measures in place.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Greeks prepare to evacuate 75,000 to defuse WWII bomb"}

{"date": "February 10, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This frame grab from video provided by Fox News shows White House adviser Kellyanne during her interview with Fox News Fox and Friends, Thursday, in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Kellyanne Conway, the high-profile White House counselor, has come under fire from Democratic and Republican lawmakers, fact-checkers and the media. But she's so far maintained the support of her boss, President Donald Trump. \n Trump backed Conway both publicly and privately Thursday after House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, criticized her for promoting Ivanka Trump's fashion line during a television appearance and urged the Office of Government Ethics to review the matter. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Conway had been \"counseled\" on her comments, but he would not expand on what that entailed. \n The president appeared to take issue with his own press secretary's depiction, telling staff that he believed it was unfair to Conway and made it sound like she was in trouble, according to a person with direct knowledge of his comments. A White House spokeswoman said that while Trump didn't see Conway's television comments urging people to buy Ivanka Trump's products, he believed she was \"merely sticking up\" for his daughter after Nordstrom dropped her brand. \n The flare-up came in the midst of a rough stretch for Conway, who is among Trump's most visible advisers. \n Her reference to a nonexistent \"Bowling Green massacre\" made her a punchline for comics and internet pranksters. She said it was a slip of the tongue as she was describing the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi nationals in a failed plot to send weapons overseas to al-Qaida. It was later discovered that she had made that misstatement before. \n Conway was then caught up in the bad blood between the Trump administration and CNN. The news network was angered last weekend when Vice President Mike Pence made the rounds of Sunday talk shows and pointedly left out Jake Tapper's CNN show. CNN said it \"passed\" when Conway was offered instead, while Conway said she was unable to appear. \n Conway's high-profile and close relationship with Trump has created tension with some other advisers. One Trump associate said Conway's standing with some senior staff had been hurt by her recent missteps, though the person noted that her relationship with the president remained strong. \n The Trump associate and the person with knowledge of the president's comments about Conway insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal matters. \n Conway's sales pitch for Ivanka Trump was particularly notable in that it sparked a rebuke from Chaffetz, a Republican who until now has not questioned the young administration on ethical matters. Chaffetz said Conway's actions were \"wrong, wrong, wrong, clearly over the line, unacceptable.\" \n The Utah congressman and the ranking Democrat on the committee, Elijah Cummings of Maryland, jointly asked for the ethics review. The Office of Government Ethics advises federal employees on such issues but is not an enforcement agency. \n While Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are not subject to ethical regulations and laws for federal employees, Conway is. Among the rules: An employee shall not use his or her office \"for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise.\" \n But because Conway reports only to Trump, it would be up to him to punish her for any ethics infraction and that seems unlikely. \n \"For whatever reason, the White House staff evidently believes that they are protected from the law the same way the president and vice president are,\" said Stuart Gilman, a former special assistant to the director of OGE. \n In addition to the House Oversight Committee, two liberal-funded government watchdog groups pounced on Conway's comments, filing ethics violation complaints with OGE. A third group, the Project on Government Oversight, asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to open a Justice Department investigation. \n Nordstrom reiterated that its decision to drop Ivanka Trump's brand was based on its performance, not politics. The company said sales of her items had steadily declined over the past year, particularly in the last half of 2016, \"to the point where it didn't make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now.\" \n While Ivanka Trump has handed over management of her company while she is in Washington, like her father, she retains ownership of it. \n Associated Press writers Bernard Condon, David Bauder and Anne D'Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump backs aide who promoted his daughter's fashion on TV"}

{"date": "February 10, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Health and Human Services Secretary-designate, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga. paused while testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington, Jan. 24, at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath of office to Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, accompanied by his wife Betty, today, in the in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump's new health secretary took office today after becoming the latest Cabinet nominee to eke out a confirmation victory in the bitterly divided Senate. \n Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath of office to Tom Price, of Georgia, at the White House hours after the Senate confirmed him 52-47 in a party-line vote. That roll call came in the dead of night, thanks to Democrats' tactic of forcing prolonged debates to broadcast their opposition to Trump and his team. \n Pence said Price, an orthopedic surgeon, is \"uniquely qualified\" for the job and playing a leading role in helping the Republican-controlled Congress achieve its top priority of repealing and replacing the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. \n Pence called Price \"the most principled expert on health care policy\" in Congress. Price served seven terms in the House. \n As head of the Health and Human Services Department, Price will take center stage as the administration and congressional Republicans try delivering on their pledge to scrap President Barack Obama's health care law and substitute their own programs. After years of trying, they finally command both the White House and Congress but have so far struggled to craft a plan with enough votes to win approval. \n Price is likely to play a lead role both in shaping health care legislation and issuing department regulations aimed at weakening Obama's statute. \n \"Having Dr. Tom Price at the helm of HHS gives us a committed ally in our work to repeal and replace Obamacare,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said today. \n Democrats focused on the legislation Price once sponsored, including efforts to kill Obama's law. He's also sought to reshape Medicare's guarantee of health coverage for seniors into a voucher-like program, cut Medicaid, which helps poor people afford care, and halt federal payments to Planned Parenthood because it provides abortions. \n Sen Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., conceded that Price had experience but added, \"It's the kind of experience that should horrify you.\" \n That battle won, Republicans were preparing to next win Senate confirmation for financier Steven Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary. He was expected to get the chamber's approval Monday, along with Trump's choice to head the Department of Veterans Affairs, physician David Shulkin. \n Republicans have lauded Mnuchin's long career in the finance and banking worlds. \n As they did with Price, Democrats are attacking Mnuchin's background, such as criticizing OneWest bank, which he led, for not protecting thousands of homeowners from unnecessary foreclosures. They also said he failed to disclose nearly $100 million in assets on forms he filed with the Senate. \n Price's nomination is part of a larger clash in which Republicans want to quickly enact priorities long blocked by Obama. Democrats, with few tools as Congress' minority, are making a show of resistance, stretching some floor debates to the maximum 30 hours Senate rules allow. \n The high stakes plus Trump's belligerent style have fed the combativeness. They've also produced remarkable scenes, including Democratic boycotts of hearings, Republicans suspending committee rules to approve nominees and GOP senators voting to bar Warren from joining one debate. \n Democrats have accused Price of lying about his acquisition of discounted shares of an Australian biotech company and benefiting from insider information. They've also asserted he pushed legislation to help a medical implant maker whose stock he'd purchased. \n Price has said he's done nothing wrong. It's illegal for members of Congress to engage in insider trading. \n His close confirmation was the fourth consecutive Senate clash over a Cabinet nominee that closely followed party lines. \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions was confirmed 52-47, after Warren was punished for reading a 1986 letter by Coretta Scott King criticizing him. Betsy DeVos became Education secretary by 51-50, thanks to a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence. \n And Former Exxon-Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson became secretary of state by 56-43. \n Those close tallies are a departure from most Cabinet votes, in which the Senate usually grants overwhelming approval in a show of deference to letting presidents choose their teams. \n Just four of 31 votes for then-President Barack Obama's Cabinet vacancies drew at least 40 \"no\" votes, as did only two of 34 votes for Cabinet positions under President George W. Bush. \n During that period, the closest tally for health secretary before Price was the 65-31 roll call for Obama's 2009 pick, Kathleen Sibelius. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's pick for health and human services secretary takes office"}

Four of the new arenas in the main Olympic Park have failed to find private-sector management, and ownership has passed to the federal government. Another new arena will be run by the cash-strapped city with Brazil stuck in its deepest recession in decades. \n The historic Maracana stadium, site of the opening and closing ceremony, has been vandalized as stadium operators, the Rio state government, and Olympic organizers have fought over $1 million in unpaid electricity bills. The electric utility reacted by cutting off all power to the city landmark. \n There are few players for a new $20 million Olympic golf course, and little money for upkeep. Deodoro, the second-largest cluster of Olympic venues, is closed and searching for a management company. \n The state of Rio de Janeiro is months late paying teachers, hospital workers, and pensions. The state also reports record-breaking crime in 2016 in almost all categories from homicides to robbery. \n \"During the Olympics, the city was really trying hard to keep things together,\" said Oliver Stuenkel, a Brazilian who teaches international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a Brazilian university. \"But the minute the Olympics were over, the whole thing disintegrated.\" \n \u2014 \n BETTER IMAGE, OR WORSE?  \n The Olympics \u2014 and to a lesser extent the 2014 World Cup \u2014 showcased the reality of Rio, a city romanticized for its sprawling beaches, annual Carnival celebration, and sensual lifestyle. \n It also exposed the city's crime, environmental contamination, and corruption. \n Some building projects connected to the Olympics and World Cup have been tied to a probe which has led to the jailing of dozens of politicians and businessmen for receiving kickbacks in Brazil's largest corruption scandal. \n Three politicians who were instrumental in landing and organizing the Olympics \u2014 former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, former Rio governor Sergio Cabral, and former Rio Mayor Eduardo \u2014 have been under investigation. Cabral, an early promoter of the Olympics and World Cup, has been jailed on corruption charges. \n \"The Olympics gave people a better sense of the difficulties Brazil faces,\" Stuenkel said. \"Maybe not a better or worse image, but more rounded.\" \n \u2014 \n UNPAID BILLS  \n Sidney Levy, the chief executive officer of the Rio organizing committee, tried to run the games with only private money, and almost succeeded. His $3 billion operating budget \u2014 the budget for running the games, not building the infrastructure \u2014 was frugal by Olympic standards. At the last minute, he had to ask for a 250-million-real bailout \u2014 $80 million \u2014 from the city of Rio and the federal government to run the Paralympics. \n Eventually, he got only 100 million reals ($30 million), and the shortfall has left organizers owing creditors millions. \n Today, Levy says he's nearly a forgotten man. \n \"I could call the president of the country, and the call was taken,\" Levy said. \"But try it today. I could call the IOC and everybody. But now people have other things to handle. We are no longer a priority.\" \n Levy said organizers probably lost about $200 million in income during the run-up to the games as sponsors backed out of expensive deals as the recession kicked in. \n Levy said he has not asked the IOC to help pay debts, but acknowledged the Olympic body came up with millions in advance money several times during the run-up to the games. \n \"The whole thing was too painful,\" Levy told The Associated Press. \"We never really enjoyed the games, themselves; 2016 was just extremely hard. It's like we were climbing Everest, and ice is falling on your lips, and you are not seeing.\" \n \u2014 \n WHITE ELEPHANTS \n The Olympic Park is a ghost town; sleek sports arenas without events, deserted before they were even broken in, and well-tended flower gardens, free from pedestrian wear-and-tear. \n \"The arenas are beautiful,\" Wagner Tolvai said, walking inside the park with his girlfriend Patricia Silva. \"But it's all abandoned, everything has stopped. Nobody is here.\" \n He likened the 2.5 billion real ($800 million) park to a new shopping mall \"without stores, or customers.\" The park is only open on weekends, and there's not much to do but walk, pedal a bike, or look for shade. \n Four permanent arenas are being run by the federal government. Among them is the Olympic tennis center, which was used earlier this month for a one-day beach volleyball tournament. This in a city with endless sand and beaches. \n Two temporary venues for swimming and handball have yet to be dismantled. The exterior of the swimming venue is falling apart and many translucent tapestries that covered the outside of the building are frayed or falling to the ground. \n The warm-up pool, which was covered during the games, is filled with muddy, stagnant water. \n Away from the park, the famous Maracana stadium has drawn the most attention. It was renovated for the 2014 World Cup at a cost of about $500 million. It was largely abandoned after the Olympics and Paralympics, and then hit by vandals who ripped out thousands of seats and stole televisions. \n \"The Maracana is the biggest symbol of the way the games were managed,\" said Mauricio Santoro, a political scientist at Rio de Janeiro State University. \"The vast majority of people in Rio will never go to the golf course, or the Olympic venues. But the Maracana is different. It's the jewel of the crown.\" \n Up the road from the Olympic Park, the $1 billion Athletes Village \u2014 it housed about 10,000 athletes \u2014 is fenced off and empty. The developer says it has sold only 260 of the 3,604 apartments \u2014 about 7 percent. \n Rio's Globo newspaper reported that new Rio Mayor Marcelo Crivella is arranging low-cost loans for public employees to buy the units. \n \u2014 \n SUBWAY AND BUSES  \n Transportation projects driven by the Olympics look better than the sports venues. \n The games led to a subway line extension, though at the reportedly inflated price of $3 billion. They also produced a high-speed bus network, a light-rail line, and a pedestrian-friendly, renovated port area. Rio's international airport also got a makeover. \n People using the new subway line have benefited, though city traffic is still badly snarled. \n But many of the improvements benefit mostly the wealthy south and west of the city. \n \"The gains were unevenly spread across the city,\" Stuenkel, the political scientist said. \n \u2014 \n TOKYO 2020 ADVICE  \n Levy, the CEO, said Tokyo's 2020 Olympics will face completely different challenges. \n \"They have a society that works pretty well already,\" he said. \"They don't have to prove anything to anybody.\" \n Tokyo will face higher costs than Rio, and organizers are already looking for places to cut. \n Levy suggested reining in sports federations, which all want five-star treatment. He used an example from the equestrian events. \n \"They wanted 15 horse ambulances,\" Levy said. \"We offered nine. In the end, the right number was four. The magic of the games doesn't come from these things.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Rio is stuck with big bills and vacant venues after Olympics"}

{"date": "February 10, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A federal appeals panel Thursday unanimously rejected President Donald Trump's bid to reinstate his ban on travel from seven largely Muslim nations, a sweeping rebuke of the administration's claim that the courts have no role to act as a check on the president. \n The three-judge panel, suggesting that the ban did not advance national security, said, for instance, that the administration had pointed to \"no evidence\" that anyone from the seven nations had committed terrorism in the United States. \n The ruling also rejected the administration's claim that courts are powerless to review a president's national security determinations. Judges have a crucial role to play in a constitutional democracy, said the decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San Francisco. \n \"It is beyond question,\" the unsigned decision said, \"that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action.\" \n The court acknowledged that Trump was owed deference on his immigration and national security policy \ndeterminations, but it said he was asking for something more. \n \"The government has taken the position,\" the decision said, \"that the president's decisions about immigration policy, particularly when motivated by national security concerns, are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections.\" \n Within minutes of the ruling, Trump angrily vowed to reporters at the White House and in a Twitter message to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. \n \"SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \n He told reporters that the ruling was \"a political decision\" and predicted that his administration would win an appeal, \"in my opinion, very easily.\" He said he had not yet conferred with his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, on the matter. \n The Supreme Court remains short-handed and could deadlock. A 4-4 tie there would leave the appeals court's ruling in place. \n The travel ban, one of the first executive orders Trump issued after taking office, suspended worldwide refugee entry into the United States. It also barred visitors from seven Muslim-majority nations for up to 90 days to give federal security agencies time to impose stricter vetting processes. \n Immediately after it was issued, the ban spurred chaos at airports nationwide as hundreds of foreign travelers found themselves stranded at immigration checkpoints, and protests erupted against a policy that critics derided as un-American. The State Department said up to 60,000 foreigners' visas had been canceled in the days immediately after the ban was imposed. \n Trial judges around the country have blocked aspects of Trump's executive order, but no other case has yet reached an appeals court. \n Thursday's decision \nreviewed a ruling issued Feb. 3 by Judge James Robart, a federal judge in Seattle. Robart blocked the key parts of the order, allowing immigrants and travelers who had been barred entry to come into the United States. \n That case, filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota, is at an early stage, and the appeals court ruled on the narrow question of whether to stay a lower court's temporary restraining order blocking the travel ban. \n In rejecting the administration's request for a stay, the court said, \"The government submitted no evidence to rebut the states' argument that the district court's order merely returned the nation temporarily to the position it has occupied for many previous years.\" \n The court said the government had not justified suspending travel from the seven countries. \"The government has pointed to no evidence,\" the decision said, \"that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.\"The members of the three-judge panel were Judge Michelle Friedland, appointed by President Barack Obama; Judge William Canby Jr., appointed by President Jimmy Carter; and Judge Richard Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush. \n They said the states were likely to succeed in the end because Trump's order appeared to violate the due process rights of lawful permanent residents, people holding visas and refugees. \n In its briefs and in the arguments before the panel Tuesday, the administration's position evolved. As the case progressed, the administration supplemented its request for categorical vindication with a backup plea for at least a partial victory. \n At most, a Justice Department brief said, \"previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future\" should be allowed to enter the country despite the ban. \n The court rejected that request, saying that people in the United States without authorization have due process rights, as do citizens with relatives who wish to travel to the United States. \n The court discussed but did not decide whether the executive order violated the First Amendment's ban on government establishment of religion by disfavoring Muslims. \n It noted that the states challenging the executive order \"have offered evidence of numerous statements by the president about his intent to implement a 'Muslim ban.'\" And it said, rejecting another administration argument, that it was free to consider evidence about the motivation behind laws that draw seemingly neutral distinctions. \n But the court said it would defer a decision on the question of religious discrimination. \"In light of the sensitive interests involved, the pace of the current emergency proceedings, and our conclusion that the government has not met its burden of showing likelihood of success on appeal on its arguments with respect to the due process claim,\" the decision said, \"we reserve consideration of these claims.\" \n ", "author": "By Adam Liptak, New York Times", "title": "Reinstatement of travel ban rejected"}
