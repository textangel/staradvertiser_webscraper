{"date": "February 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former Charleston Mayor Joe Riley and International African-American Museum President Michael Moore stood at the site of a new museum about African-American history being built over the next three years in Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 30. \n CHARLESTON, S.C. >> The bullet holes in the fellowship hall at Emanuel AME church have been patched, but the holes in the fabric of life in Charleston remain. \n Sharonda Coleman-Singleton is absent from Goose Creek High School, her exhortations still ringing in the ears of girls who ran track for her. The strong voice of Emanuel's pastor-legislator, Clementa Pinckney, does not resound, here or at the capitol in Columbia. \n Dylann Roof, killer of these worshippers and six others at one of the South's first African-American churches, is headed to death row after an agonizing and therapeutic trial. But if justice has been served, the community has not moved on; the shots that rang out on June 17, 2015, still resonate. \n They are amplified by the unfinished case of a white North Charleston police officer charged with murder in the death of a black driver. Efforts go on to build a museum to tell the stories of more than three centuries of African-American struggles, and to place this community's recent suffering in context. \n And at Emanuel, churchgoers still assemble for Bible study on most Wednesdays, vowing that love and faith will prevail. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n The girls who ran track for Singleton called her Mom. \n \"She would take you in like you were her daughter, then she would teach you how to be a lady,\" said senior Alexis Simmons. \n Singleton's death stung the close-knit team. They had their best season ever just before Singleton was killed. Even more athletes made the state meet the year after her death. And Goose Creek High has managed to make one of Singleton's dreams come true \u2014 the school will host a track tournament next month in Singleton's honor. \n \"She loved on them, and it is good to see it pour back out,\" said Doris Simmons, who was hired as an assistant coach after Singleton's death (she is not related to Alexis Simmons). \"We all know this could have went the opposite way. You would have a couple of girls rebelling because of the pain, and you just see these girls just wrap their arms around them.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n \"Think about Dylann Roof,\" said Michael Moore. \"I don't believe he could have done what he did if he knew about the humanity of the people in that room.\" \n Moore \u2014 the great-great grandson of Robert Smalls, a man who freed himself, a ship's crew and their families from slavery by commandeering a ship from Confederates in 1862, and later served in Congress \u2014 believes that education can help fill the emptiness in the souls of people like Roof. He is president of the $75 million African-American history museum proposed for the site of the old wharf where nearly half of the slaves that entered the U.S. first stepped on American soil. \n Former Mayor Joe Riley needs to raise $19 million quickly to reach his goal of starting two years of construction by the end of this year. \n \"This is one of the most sacred sites of African-American history in the western hemisphere,\" Riley said of the wharf, just a short walk from the old slave market where artists sell the sweetgrass baskets native to the area. \"There are stories of courage and determination and suffering. These are American stories that Americans do not know.\" \n Moore said he wants the door to the museum to be very wide \u2014 big enough to acknowledge that African-American history is really just American history. Dylann Roof walked through Emanuel's open door intent on murdering black people; someday, Moore hopes, his museum's door will help open hearts. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n It's been hard enough for the black community to come to terms with the murders at Emanuel. The unresolved case of a white police officer charged in the shooting death of an unarmed black man during a traffic stop makes it even harder. \n The killing of Walter Scott happened in North Charleston \u2014 an 8-mile drive from Emanuel AME. And former officer Michael Slager's trial happened a month before Roof's trial started, with a jury unable to reach a verdict in the murder trial of the officer. \n Walter Scott's death was videotaped by a bystander and played over and over \u2014 the 50-year-old man in the green shirt running slowly away from an officer firing eight times at his back. \n \"There's great unease. It's unfinished business. Communities, black and otherwise, are still walking on eggshells, talking about these things,\" said Mount Zion AME pastor Kylon Middleton. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n And yet, there has been progress. \n The most obvious legacy of the Emanuel AME shootings came in South Carolina's capital, where after 50 years the Confederate flag was removed from Statehouse grounds. \n Roof, a self-taught white supremacist, took pictures with the familiar flag. And after years of ignoring calls to bring it down \u2014 including from Pinckney himself \u2014 the killings shook many Republicans enough to remove the rebel banner less than a month after the massacre. \n But was this enough? Pinckney's seatmate in the South Carolina Senate, Sen. Vincent Sheheen, does not think so. \n Sheheen recalls a colleague who became a pastor at 18 and was voted into the Statehouse at 23, a man who often called for health care and a living wage for all, and for better education in poor, rural areas. He was often ignored in conservative South Carolina, but he never stopped speaking out. \n That unique voice is missing now \u2014 the voice of \"a man of the church who actually lived by its tenets,\" said Sheheen, a Camden Democrat who could sit in his chair during the Confederate flag debate and touch the black shroud on Pinckney's desk. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Church shootings leave holes in the fabric of Charleston"}

{"date": "February 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n John Lugo, of Unidad Latina en Accion of New Haven, was arrested during a demonstration after some protesters blocked the intersection of Elm and College Streets in New Haven, Conn., on Friday. The protesters were in favor of changing the name of Yale University's Calhoun College. \n NEW HAVEN, Conn. >>After years of debate, Yale University announced today it will change the name of a residential college that honors a 19th century alumnus and former U.S. vice president who was an ardent supporter of slavery. \n Yale trustees said the Ivy League university is renaming Calhoun College after trailblazing computer scientist Grace Murray Hopper, a mathematician who earned Yale degrees in the 1930s, invented a pioneering computer programming language and became a Navy rear admiral. \n Yale said it was the final decision in a controversy over former Vice President John C. Calhoun's legacy that had simmered for years and boiled over with campus protests in 2015. Four people were arrested in a peaceful protest as recent as Friday after they blocked street traffic. \n The university's president, Peter Salovey, announced in April that the school would keep Calhoun's name. But, in August, he appointed an advisory panel to consider whether the name should be changed after all. \n \"We have a strong presumption against renaming buildings on this campus,\" Salovey said Saturday. \"I have been concerned all along and remain concerned that we don't do things that erase history. So renamings are going to be exceptional.\" \n The board of trustees made its decision to rename the college Friday. Salovey, who sits on the board, said the case was exceptional because Calhoun's principal legacy is at odds with the university's values and mission, and his views were contested in his own time. \n Calhoun, a member of the Yale class of 1804, was a senator from South Carolina and a leading voice for those opposed to abolishing slavery. He served as vice president from 1825 to 1832. \n \"John C. Calhoun. White supremacist. Ardent defender of slavery as a positive good,\" Salovey noted. \"Someone whose views hardened over the course of his life, died essentially criticizing the Declaration of Independence and its emphasis on all men being created equal.\" \n Chris Rabb, a 1992 Yale graduate, said in a telephone interview today that just changing the name from a \"bad person to a good person\" is not enough. \n Rabb has spoken out against the name since his own days living at Calhoun College when he successfully lobbied for the removal of a stained glass window depicting a black man in shackles kneeling before Calhoun. \n \"I'm underwhelmed,\" said Rabb, an educator and state representative in Pennsylvania who co-founded an alumni network for black Yale graduates. \"This choice makes no corrective move toward reconciliation in light of not just the legacy of John C. Calhoun, but Yale University's ties to slavery and systemic racism.\" \n The residential college was named for Calhoun when it was established in the early 1930s. The name received new attention as protesters on campuses around the country called for universities to address the legacies of historical figures, such as Woodrow Wilson at Princeton University in New Jersey. \n In an online essay today in The New York Times, Yale senior Tobias Holden, a black Calhoun descendant, said it's wrong to treat Calhoun as a benign symbol of history. \n \"Get my racist ancestor's name off of Yale's campus\" was the essay's title. \n A flare-up of the controversy last summer followed the arrest of a black dining services worker, Corey Menafee, who used a broomstick to smash a stained-glass window at the college that depicted slaves. Criminal charges have since been dropped and Yale has rehired Menafee, who had described the image as offensive. \n University officials said today the school will not remove symbols of Calhoun on campus, such as engravings and a statue atop the landmark Harkness Tower. It also won't discourage alumni if they want to continue associating with the Calhoun name instead of Grace Hopper College. \n But Salovey said he hopes the university community will \"embrace Grace Hopper and get to know her better.\" She graduated from Yale in 1930 and earned a doctorate in mathematics and mathematical physics from there in 1934, just a year after Calhoun College was established. \n After teaching math at Vassar College in New York for nearly a decade, she enlisted in the Navy and \"used her mathematical knowledge to fight fascism during World War II,\" the university said. \n A programming language her team invented in the 1950s was a predecessor to the widely-used COBOL. She retired as a Navy rear admiral at age 79, and died in 1992 at age 85. She was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom last year. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Yale drops slavery proponent Calhoun from college name"}

Henson had a big night at the NAACP Image Awards, where Hollywood glamour shared the stage with somber remarks from the director of Washington's new African-American museum. \n \"Hidden Figures,\" the fact-based drama about the contributions of black female mathematicians to the U.S. space program, won the award for best movie tonight, while star Henson was honored as best actress. \n \"There are roles you accept that scare you. And this one did, because I failed math,\" said Henson, recalling that she grew up in a time when math and science were supposed to be \"just for boys.\" \n \"I made it my mission to do this film. This film was very important. It was bigger than me. \u2026 People are seeing it because it's important,\" she said. \n Henson also won the trophy for TV drama series actress for her role as matriarch Cookie in \"Empire.\" \n Denzel Washington added to his awards haul for \"Fences,\" winning the trophy for best movie actor. Washington, who directed the adaptation of August Wilson's play, won a Screen Actors Guild award for his performance and is vying for an Oscar Feb. 26. \n \"It is a privilege, an honor, a responsibility, a duty and a joy to bring his brilliance to the screen,\" Washington said of the late Wilson, whom he called among America's greatest playwrights. \n The TV sitcom \"black-ish\" came close to sweeping its categories, taking the award for best TV comedy and with stars Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross getting top acting trophies. In non-televised awards given Friday, the show earned honors for co-stars Laurence Fishburne and Marsai Martin and a writing trophy for creator Kenya Barris. \n A directing award to Donald Glover for his comedy series \"Atlanta\" prevented a \"black-ish\" monopoly at the 48th Image Awards, which are presented by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to honor people of color in entertainment. \n \"Queen Sugar,\" created by filmmaker Ava DuVernay, was named best drama series, and \"This Is Us\" star Sterling K. Brown claimed the award for best TV drama series actor. \n Lonnie G. Bunche III received the NAACP President's Award for his work as founding director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. \n \"This is a big deal for a historian from New Jersey,\" Bunche said. \"With this award, you recognize more than me. You recognize the power of history.\" \n He said he was accepting the award on behalf of many others, including enslaved women who retained their humanity and \"all the black men whose lives and hopes were shattered by the criminal justice system or destroyed by the racial violence, like that of Emmett Till,\" a teenage lynching victim in 1950s Mississippi. \n Dwyane Johnson was named entertainer of the year in online voting, beating out contenders including Beyonce. But the pop star, a front-runner at Sunday's Grammy Awards, wasn't slighted: She won five Image Awards, including top female artist and album (\"Lemonade\"), at Friday's event. \n Anderson, host of the ceremony televised by TV One, paid tribute to former President Barack Obama during his opening remarks, saying appreciation of his \"greatness\" will only grow and that future generations may include him on Mount Rushmore. \n Then Anderson ribbed Obama's successor. \n \"I want to thank Donald Trump for expanding my vocabulary. I don't do things 'big' anymore, I do things 'bigly,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't lie to folks anymore. I'm merely providing alternative facts.\" \n On a more acid note, Anderson said that while \"those who want to return to the past now have the reins of power in their hands \u2026. we must always have the audacity of hope.\" \n Anderson circled back during the show to acknowledge an apparent flub in an opening joke, one in which he teased whites for conflating the titles of \"Hidden Figures\" and \"Fences.\" But Anderson did just that in lauding the performances in what he called \"Hidden Fences\" \u2014 the error Michael Keaton made at the Golden Globes and later apologized for. \n While the recent SAG and Golden Globes ceremonies were far heavier on political references from winners, \"Daily Show\" host Trevor Noah used his appearance as a presenter to get a jab in. \n After complimenting the Pasadena, Calif., auditorium audience as \"black and beautiful,\" he added: \"The room is so black it looks like a photo negative of the Trump administration.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'Hidden Figures,' Henson among top NAACP Image Award winners"}

{"date": "February 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A police officer walked next to uniforms painted with red ink to symbolize blood, during a protest in Brazil on Friday. \n SAO PAULO >> Several hundred military police returned to duty in Espirito Santo today, but authorities said a weeklong strike that has paralyzed the southeastern Brazilian state and led to a wave of homicides was not over. \n Earlier in the day, the defense minister appealed to \"all of the good police officers\" to return to the streets, even as he said that life was beginning to return to normal now that more than 3,000 federal troops are on patrol. \n Late today, 600 officers began doing just that, mustering in the state capital of Vitoria and four other towns, according to the Espirito Santo Public Safety Department. In a symbolic blow to the protest movement, helicopters landed on the roof of the barracks of the military police command and ferried away 70 officers who were inside and couldn't leave through the doors because of the barricade. \n In photos handed out by the department, police, in uniform and not, could be seen lining up in formation in public squares. At least some of them then went out on patrol, according to Gustavo Tenorio, a spokesman for the department. \n The Folha de S.Paulo newspaper also reported seeing five police vehicles circulating in Vitoria. \n But Tenorio said the strike was not over, and that friends and relatives of the police officers are continuing to block their barracks, as they have for the last week, to demand higher pay for their loved ones. Those protests have prevented vehicles from exiting, thus paralyzing the force. \n Earlier in the day, the government said the relatives had rejected an agreement, announced Friday, to end the standoff. Because members of the military police, who patrol Brazilian cities, are forbidden to strike, relatives of the officers took the lead, but state authorities have accused the officers themselves of being behind the movement. Union leaders have denied this, but said they support the protesters' goals. \n The state has seen an extraordinary wave of violence since the standoff began. Shops have been looted and buses burned, and the union representing civil police officers says 137 people have been killed since military police stopped patrolling. The state government has not released a death toll. \n To stem the violence, the state called in federal troops, including both members of the military and the national guard, who have been patrolling the streets of several cities. Defense Minister Raul Jungmann said 3,130 troops were now in the state. \n Jungmann told reporters that, since the troops arrived, looting and break-ins have stopped. He also said there had been a reduction in homicides, though the rate remains higher than normal. \n Amid the insecurity, most state services ground to a halt, with schools and health centers closing and city buses sitting idle. \n Bus service partially resumed in Vitoria on Saturday, and hospitals were open, according to Tenorio. But smaller health centers remained closed. \n \"On Monday, this was a ghost town,\" Jungmann told reporters. \"Today, we see a city that is getting back to normal: People are on the beach, people are in the streets, people are moving about.\" \n The government, which is experiencing an economic and fiscal crisis like many Brazilian states, has rejected demands for higher pay, though it said Friday it would analyze the system of promotions. \n The strike in Espirito Santo inspired a handful of much smaller family protests in neighboring Rio de Janeiro state on Friday and Saturday. However, in Rio, family members did not block barracks, instead demonstrating peacefully outside them. The military police there took to Twitter to repeatedly reassure the population that they were on patrol. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hundreds of police back on duty in paralyzed Brazil state"}

And next door, also tackling hurdles, tunnels and weaving poles, were some decidedly rare breeds for the Westminster world: \n Cats. \n For the first time, felines sidled up to the nation's premier dog show, as part of an informational companion event showcasing various breeds of both species. It included a cat agility demonstration contest, while more than 300 of the nation's top agility dogs vied in a more formal competition. \n Trick topped a field of 50 finalists to take the agility title with her owner and handler, John Nys of Pascoag, Rhode Island. Intensely athletic and willing, \"she really is a team player,\" he said. \n A former shelter dog named Crush won a separate title for the top mixed-breed dog in the competition. Not \"a sit-on-the-couch-dog,\" Crush needed activities to focus on, says owner and handler Aryn Hervel of American Canyon, California. Besides agility, Crush works sniffing for sewage leaks, Hervel said. \n While there weren't exactly cats in the 140-year-old dog show, their inclusion in the \"Meet the Breeds\" event came close enough to prompt some \"what?!\" and waggish alarm about a breakdown in the animal social order. Some Twitter users have portrayed the development as a sign of impending cat-astrophe. A satirical Chicago Tribune column declared that \"we can't just let cats start racing across the borders of traditional dog events.\" \n Even some Westminster competitors found the juxtaposition jarring \u2014 or \"so weird,\" in the words of Hannah Naiburg of Milford, Connecticut, who guided her terrier mix, Molly, to the final round of Westminster's agility contest. But others tipped their hats to the cats that were padding and prowling around their own course, most of them trying the sport for the first time. \n \"Good for them,\" said Tina Ackerman of New Hampshire, who handled her bichon frise, Bubba Watson. \"There's no way we could ever have trained any of our cats to do agility.\" \n Bemisu, a 1-year-old sphynx cat nicknamed Misha, had never tried the sport before Saturday. But within a half-hour, she was following owner Blake Gipson's toy-dangling signals to hop through hoops and run through a mesh tunnel \u2014 so well that she bested about 30 other cats to win. \n \"I had no idea she would learn so fast,\" said Gipson, whose nearly hairless, down-covered cats share his Denver home with a pit bull. \"She's smarter than I ever gave her credit for.\" \n If today's \"Meet the Breeds\" event \u2014 sponsored by Westminster, the American Kennel Club and The International Cat Association \u2014 gave felines their first chance to share Westminster's spotlight, it also illustrated that there's plenty of everyday crossover between the dog and cat camps. In fact, a 2011 CBS News poll found that 23 percent of American pet owners have both a dog and a cat. \n Agility is increasingly popular for both species, seen as a way to give the animals activity and strengthen the bond between pets and their people. \n Lonnie, a mixed-breed dog born in an animal shelter, used to be \"afraid of everything,\" even being in a car, owner Robin Lembo said. She started training Lonnie in obedience and then agility to build her confidence. Now, the 8-year-old dog is so outgoing that she eagerly ran the agility course in front of crowds Saturday. \n And Lembo is all for cats getting into the agility act. \n \"I keep telling my husband to try it \u2014 because he's a cat lover,\" said Lembo, of New Jersey. \n As every cat owner who has watched his pet walk along a railing knows, feats of agility come naturally to many felines. But training? A cat? \n It's easier than many people think, though cats are often more motivated by chasing toys than getting treats, said Vickie Shields, who oversaw Saturday's agility demonstrations. A former trainer of dogs for field trials, she helped organize cat agility as a sport in 2003, largely with the goal of getting people to play more with their cats. \n \"People think cats are solitary. They aren't,\" said Shields, of New Mexico, noting that wild cats often form colonies. \"You can do stuff with them, too. It's not just dogs.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Cats are companions at Westminster dog show"}

China was second place, with 17,745 requests coming from citizens of that country. \n Venezuela first cracked the top 10 asylum-seeking nations following months of sometimes bloody street protests in early 2014 seeking to oust President Nicolas Maduro. \n But back then, amid the widespread jailing and harassment of opponents of the socialist administration, fewer than 100 Venezuelans per month sought asylum. That compares with 2,334 requests in December, 2016, the last month for which data is available. \n The number of applicants has skyrocketed since December 2015, when the opposition took control of congress in a landslide election, giving hope to many that it could disrupt 17 years of socialist rule. Instead of reaching out to his opponents, Maduro retrenched and more and more Venezuelans began to uproot as triple-digit inflation pulverized salaries and widespread food and medicine shortages made life unbearable for many. \n The vast majority leaving are middle-class Venezuelans who don't qualify for refugee status reserved for those seeking to escape political persecution, according to Julio Henriquez, director of the Boston-based nonprofit Refugee Freedom Program, which has been drawing attention to the trend. \n \"The pace at which requests are increasing is alarming,\" said Henriquez, whose group obtained the still-unpublished data in a Feb. 8 meeting between U.S. officials and immigration lawyers. \"It's not just worrisome that so many people are escaping the terrible situation in Venezuela but also that the practice of sending asylum-seekers with poor advice and false proof is proliferating.\" \n Still, given mounting hardships at home, increasing numbers of Venezuelans are willing to take advantage of a more-than-two-year delay for their applications to be processed to obtain work authorization and seek short-term employment even if it means being eventually deported. \n In the 2015 fiscal year, Venezuela was among the top 10 countries whose citizens had overstayed their visas in the United States, according to an estimate of visa overstays by the Department of Homeland Security. \n Venezuelans seeking U.S. asylum represent a small share of the overall Venezuelan immigrant population, some of whom have made their home in the U.S. for decades. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Venezuela now leads U.S. asylum requests as crisis deepens"}

The U.S. Strategic Command said it detected and tracked what it assessed to be a medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missile. \n The reports came as Trump was hosting Abe and just days before the North is to mark the birthday of leader Kim Jong Un's late father, Kim Jong Il. \n Appearing with Trump at a news conference at the president's south Florida estate, Abe condemned the missile launch as \"absolutely intolerable.\" Trump followed Abe with even fewer words, saying in part: \"I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent.\" \n Abe read a brief statement in which he called on the North to comply fully with relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions. He said Trump has assured him of U.S. support and that Trump's presence showed the president's determination and commitment. \n South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement the missile was fired from around Banghyon, North Pyongan Province, which is where South Korean officials have said the North test launched its powerful midrange Musudan missile on Oct. 15 and 20. \n The military in Seoul said that the missile flew about 500 kilometers (310 miles). But Yonhap reported that while determinations are still being made, it was not believed to be an ICBM. \n The missile splashed down into the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, according to the U.S. Strategic Command. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters the missile did not hit Japanese territorial seas. The North conducted two nuclear tests and a slew of rocket launches last year in continued efforts to expand its nuclear weapons and missile programs. Kim Jong Un said in his New Year's address that the country has reached the final stages of readiness to test an ICBM, which would be a major step forward in its efforts to build a credible nuclear threat to the United States. \n Though Pyongyang has been relatively quiet about the transfer of power to the Trump administration, its state media has repeatedly called for Washington to abandon its \"hostile policy\" and vowed to continue its nuclear and missile development programs until the U.S. changes its diplomatic approach. \n Just days ago, it also reaffirmed its plan to conduct more space launches, which it staunchly defends but which have been criticized because they involve dual use technology that can be transferred to improve missiles. \n Kim Dong-yeop, an analyst at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, speculated the missile could be a Musudan or a similar rocket designed to test engines for an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the U.S. mainland. Analysts are divided, however, over how close the North is to having a reliable long-range rocket that could be coupled with a nuclear warhead capable to striking U.S. targets. \n South Korea's Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn said that his country will punish North Korea for the missile launch. According to the Foreign Ministry, South Korea will continue to work with allies including the United States, Japan and the European Union to ensure a thorough implementation of sanctions against the North and make the country realize that it will \"never be able to survive\" without discarding all of its nuclear and missile programs. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "North Korea reportedly test fires missile, challenging U.S."}

Now he's putting his game to work. \n The president spent his Saturday morning golfing with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he hosts his first foreign leader at his winter estate in Palm Beach, Florida. \n After a rocky diplomatic start that included contentious phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia, the friendly weekend of meetings, dinners and golf suggests the new president is willing to invest time in developing close personal relationships with leaders he feels he can work with. \n Trump and Abe left Mar-a-Lago early Saturday morning and headed north to one of Trump's golf courses in Jupiter, Florida. Reporters weren't able to catch a glimpse of the pair as they played on the 285-acre property. But Trump later posted a photo of them giving each other a high-five on the golf course and tweeted, \"Having a great time hosting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the United States!\" \n The Trump National Golf Club website, in typical Trumpian language, claims the course \"features the finest revetted bunkers in the United States, incredible water hazards, including a magnificent island green, and one of the most picturesque landscapes, all of which make for a truly memorable round.\" \n Abe had joked at a joint press conference at the White House on Friday that he was looking forward to playing golf with Trump, even though he's not nearly as good with a club. \n He said he planned to use the time to discuss the future of the world, the Pacific region and U.S.-Japanese relations. \n As their husbands golfed, Melania Trump and Akie Abe toured the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in nearby Delray Beach. The women were also expected to have lunch together at Mar-a-Lago. \n The two couples touched down in Florida on Friday afternoon and headed straight to Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club, where they enjoyed a late dinner at its crowded patio restaurant. They were joined by Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, and several interpreters. Paying members and club guests took in the scene and mingled with Trump and Abe into the night. \n The president and Mrs. Trump are expected to host a more formal delegation dinner with the Abes on Saturday night. \n Trump is also expected to tend to other business in Florida.

It was not immediately clear who fired the projectiles. \n Saturday's protests were called for by influential cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and clashes that erupted as crowds pushed toward the Green Zone left two policeman and three protesters dead, according to police and hospital officials. \n The officials said six other policemen were injured along with dozens of protesters. The violent outbreak prompted the government to call for a \"full investigation.\" \n The demonstrators loyal to al-Sadr gathered in Baghdad's downtown Tahrir square demanded an overhaul of the commission overseeing local elections scheduled this year. Al-Sadr has accused the commission of being riddled with corruption and has called for its overhaul. \n Shots rang out in central Baghdad as security forces used live fire and tear gas to disperse the crowds. An Associated Press team at the scene witnessed ambulances rushing away protesters suffering from breathing difficulties. \n Hospital officials who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to brief journalists said the policemen died of gunshot wounds. They gave no details as to the cause of death of the protesters. \n While at times the crowds advanced toward Baghdad's highly fortified Green Zone, by afternoon they began to disperse after a statement from al-Sadr's office called on his followers to refrain from trying to enter the compound. \n Meanwhile, Iraq's prime minister ordered an investigation into the violence. \n \"The prime minister ordered a full investigation into the injuries among security forces and protesters during the demonstration today in Tahrir square,\" read a statement from Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's office Saturday evening. \n Al-Sadr's office issued another statement Saturday night following news of protester casualties claiming that \"excessive force\" was used against the demonstrators and threatened greater protests. \"The next time the blood of our martyrs will not go in vain,\" the statement read. \n \"We will not give in to threats,\" said the head of the electoral commission, Serbat Mustafa, in an interview with a local Iraqi television channel Saturday afternoon.

A deepening economic crisis and persistent insurgent attacks in the Iraqi capital have fueled support for powerful political opponents of al-Abadi like al-Sadr. \n Al-Abadi has said that he respects the rights of all Iraqis to peacefully demonstrate but called on the protesters Saturday to obey the law and respect public and private property. \n The Green Zone is home to most of Iraq's foreign embassies and is the seat of the Iraqi government. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Rockets hit Baghdad's Green Zone after protests turn violent"}

The torrent chewed up trees and soil alongside the concrete spillway before rejoining the main channel below. \n OROVILLE, Calif. >> Water started flowing over an emergency spillway at the nation's tallest dam, on Lake Oroville, for the first time Saturday after erosion damaged the Northern California dam's main spillway. \n Officials hoped to avoid using Oroville Dam's emergency spillway, fearing it could cause trees to fall and leave debris cascading into water that rushes through the Feather River, into the Sacramento River and on to the San Francisco Bay. Crews prepared for several days, clearing trees and brush. \n Water began running over the emergency spillway around 8 a.m., said Ted Thomas, a spokesman for California's Department of Water Resources. It was the first time the emergency spillway has been used in the reservoir's nearly 50-year history. \n Unexpected erosion chewed through the main spillway earlier this week, sending chunks of concrete flying and creating a 200-foot-long, 30-foot-deep hole that continues growing. Engineers don't know what caused the cave-in that is expected to keep getting bigger until it reaches bedrock. \n A spokesman for the Water Resources Department has said officials estimate the cost of repairing the dam could approach $100 million, but noted the estimate was an early, ballpark figure. \n Officials have emphasized Oroville Dam is sound and there is no imminent threat to the public. \n State officials also had been attempting to rescue millions of hatchery-raised fish imperiled by muddy water flowing downstream alongside the damaged spillway after sections of its concrete walls collapsed earlier this week \n About 150 miles northeast of San Francisco, Lake Oroville is one of California's largest man-made lakes, and the 770-foot-tall Oroville Dam is the nation's tallest.

{"date": "February 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A person shouts to Rep. Jason Chaffetz during his town hall meeting at Brighton High School, Thursday, Feb. 9, 2017, in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. \n GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. >> The voter identified himself as a cancer survivor, and he had something to say to Republican Rep. Justin Amash: \"I am scared to death that I will not have health insurance in the future.\" \n The comment earned 61-year-old retiree Paul Bonis a standing ovation from the crowd packed into a school auditorium in Amash's Michigan district Thursday night. And the congressman was booed for his response: That the Affordable Care Act has \"hurt a lot of people,\" and he supports his party's plans to repeal and replace it, even though the GOP still hasn't united around an alternative. \n It's a scene that's played out around the country over the past several weeks as Republicans and President Donald Trump have assumed control of Washington and begun moving forward on their long-held promise to undo former President Barack Obama's health care law. In an echo of the raucous complaints that confronted Democrats back in 2009 as they worked to pass \"Obamacare\" in the first place, Republicans who want to repeal it now are facing angry pushback of their own at constituent gatherings from Utah to Michigan to Tennessee and elsewhere, even in solidly Republican districts. \n And just as the protests in 2009 focused on health care but reflected broader concerns over an increasingly divisive new president and Democrats' monopoly control over Washington, now, too, constituent complaints at town hall meetings appear to reflect more general fears about the Trump administration and the implications of one-party GOP rule of the nation's capital. \n In a Salt Lake City suburb on Thursday night, GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz faced irate constituents chanting \"Do your job!\" as they pressed the House Oversight Committee chairman to investigate Trump. Chaffetz struggled to be heard as he faced a litany of sharp questions and screams from a crowd of people who grilled him on everything from Obamacare to Chaffetz's desire to overturn a new national monument in southern Utah. \n \"Come on, we're better than this,\" Chaffetz protested over the hubbub at one point, practically pleading with the deafening crowd to let him speak. \n In Tennessee, GOP Rep. Diane Black faced questions from impassioned and well-informed constituents defending the Affordable Care Act, including one man who told her that he and others with health conditions might die without insurance. \"And you want to take away this coverage, and have nothing to replace it with,\" the man said. Black argued that the Affordable Care Act has been ineffective because although 20 million people gave gained coverage under the law, millions more have chosen to pay a fine and remain uninsured. \n And in southern Wisconsin, GOP Rep. James Sensenbrenner faced a voter who asked him: \"Who's going to be the check and balance on Donald Trump?\" Like others interviewed at town halls around the country, the woman asking the question, Barbara Kresse, said she has not been politically active, another similarity to 2009 when the advent of the Obama administration seemed to cause enough anxiety to awaken groups of voters who had never previously gotten involved. \n Indeed the recent protests are being amplified by liberal activists modeling their opposition to Trump on the tea party groups that sprang up to oppose Obama and the Democrats. Calling itself \"Indivisible,\" a non-profit group that grew out of a how-to guide written by former Democratic congressional staffers has advertised town hall gatherings nationally, suggesting at least some level of coordination, which was the case with the anti-Obamacare protests as well. Some Republicans, including White House press secretary Sean Spicer, have dismissed the protesters as orchestrated and even paid, though there's been no evidence of that. \n House GOP leaders have taken note of the protests, and took time during a regular meeting of their conference this past week to give lawmakers \"best practices\" advice for dealing with them, including to treat protesters with courtesy and respect, consider hiring security or a moderator for town hall gatherings, or even \"kill them with kindness\" by offering cookies or coffee. \n Lawmakers insisted that they are not changing their public schedules out of concern over being met by protesters, but town hall meetings have grown rarer in recent years anyway, with some lawmakers citing the shooting of Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords at a constituent gathering in Tucson, Arizona in 2011 as one reason. In some districts and states, constituents have been trying to shame lawmakers into holding town halls to discuss Obamacare or other issues, showing up at district offices with signs demanding a meeting. \n In a letter to fellow House Republicans on Thursday, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, vice chairman of the GOP conference, downplayed the opposition and sought to encourage lawmakers to stay committed to their agenda. \n \"We have been charged with holistic reform,\" Collins wrote. \"And to the extent that we are leading our communities in a new direction, we remember \u2014 with sadness \u2014 that, because a broken system became the status quo, even those who have suffered under that brokenness may resist its repair.\" \n ", "author": "", "title": "GOP lawmakers face angry, worried constituents at town halls"}

Rallies aimed at urging Congress and President Donald Trump to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood are scheduled across the country. \n SEATTLE >> Anti-abortion activists emboldened by the new administration of President Donald Trump staged rallies around the country today calling for the federal government to cut off payments to Planned Parenthood, but in some cities counter-protests dwarfed the demonstrations. \n Thousands of Planned Parenthood supporters, many wearing the pointy-eared pink hats popularized by last month's women's marches, turned out for a rally in St. Paul, Minnesota, separated by barricades from an anti-abortion crowd of a couple hundred people. In Detroit, about 300 people turned up outside a Planned Parenthood office, most of them supporting the organization. In St. Louis, thousands marched, many carrying pink signs that read, \"I stand with Planned Parenthood.\" \n \"They do a lot of work to help women with reproductive health \u2014 not just abortions, obviously \u2014 but they help with birth control and cancer screenings and counseling and a whole variety of services, and it seems they're under attack right now, and that concerns me greatly,\" said Kathy Brown, 58, a supporter of the organization who attended the St. Paul rally. \n Andy LaBine, 44, of Ramsey, Minnesota, rallied with abortion opponents in St. Paul. LaBine, who was there with his family, said he believes Planned Parenthood is hiding \"under a veil of health care.\" \n \"I personally believe that abortion is a profound injustice to the human race,\" LaBine said. \n In one of his first acts as president, Trump last month banned U.S. funding to international groups that perform abortions or even provide information about abortions. Vice President Mike Pence strongly opposes abortion, citing his Catholic beliefs, and the newly confirmed health secretary, Tom Price, has supported cutting off taxpayer money to Planned Parenthood. \n Federal dollars don't pay for abortions, but the organization is reimbursed by Medicaid for other services, including birth control and cancer screening. Anti-abortion conservatives have long tried to cut Planned Parenthood funds, arguing that the reimbursements help subsidize abortions. Planned Parenthood says it performed 324,000 abortions in 2014, the most recent year tallied, but the vast majority of women seek out contraception, testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, or other services including cancer screenings. \n The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says defunding plans would cut roughly $400 million in Medicaid money from the group in the year after enactment and would result in roughly 400,000 women losing access to care. Republicans would redirect the funding to community health centers, but Planned Parenthood supporters say women denied Medicaid services from Planned Parenthood may not be able to find replacement care. \n At the nonprofit's New York headquarters, supporters outnumbered a group of 50 abortion rights opponents by a ratio of 3-to-1, and thousands rallied separately at Washington Square Park to support Planned Parenthood. In the Seattle suburb of Kent, 300 supporters turned out, as opposed to a couple dozen opponents, KOMO-TV reported. By contrast, in the deeply conservative western Iowa city of Council Bluffs, two dozen anti-abortion demonstrators drew no counter-rally. \n Outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in the Dallas suburb of Plano, about 20 anti-abortion protesters gathered \u2014 a few more than a typical Saturday, attendees said. They bore signs reading \"Abortion Kills Children,\" \"Pray to End Abortion\" and \"Men Regret Lost Fatherhood.\" \n Maria Nesbitt, 47, participated along with her husband and daughters, ages 5 and 3, and said she was pleased about Trump's election and the prospect of cutting Planned Parenthood's funding. She and the girls held signs saying \"Pray to End Abortion,\" though she said they're too young to understand what it means. \n Nearby, Anthony Hodgson, 57, held a sign with the same message. \n \"I believe it's not right. God told us, 'Thou shalt not kill,'\" he said. \n In Detroit, Jill Byczek, 59, said she felt empowered after attending the recent women's march in Washington. Wearing a pink shirt that said \"My Body My Choice,\" she said Planned Parenthood stands for \"so much more\" than abortion services. \n \"This is a way women get educated, get protected,\" she said. \"This shows people are upset about what's happening. \u2026 We are scared. We are worried. We have a person in power who's against us.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Anti-abortion activists, counter-protesters rally around U.S."}

Bayan Claremont is rejecting $800,000 in federal funds aimed at combating violent extremism less than a month into Donald Trump's presidency. \n WASHINGTON >> A California Islamic school wanted to keep an open mind before Donald Trump took office. But less than a month into Trump's presidency, the school rejected $800,000 in federal funds aimed at combatting violent extremism. \n The decision made late Friday night by the Bayan Claremont graduate school's board to turn down the money \u2014 an amount that would cover more than half its yearly budget \u2014 capped weeks of sleepless nights and debate. Many there felt Trump's rhetoric singling out Islamic extremism and his travel ban affecting predominantly Muslim countries had gone too far. \n It also made the school the fourth organization nationwide under the Trump administration to reject the money for a program created under President Barack Obama known as countering violent extremism, or CVE, which officials say aims to thwart extremist groups' abilities to recruit would-be terrorists. \n Bayan Claremont had received the second-largest grant, among the first 31 federal grants for CVE awarded to organizations, schools and municipalities in the dwindling days of the Obama administration. The school had hoped to use the money to help create a new generation of Muslim community leaders, with $250,000 earmarked for more than a dozen local nonprofits doing social justice work. \n But the fledgling school's founding president, Jihad Turk, said officials ultimately felt accepting the money would do more harm than good. \n It's \"a heck of a lot of money, (but) our mission and our vision is to serve the community and to bring our community to a position of excellence,\" Turk said. \"And if we're compromised, even if only by perception in terms of our standing in the community, we ultimately can't achieve that goal,\" he said, adding that accepting the funds would be short-sighted. \n The school's internal debate is also emblematic of handwringing among grassroots and nonprofit organizations involved in the program in the last couple weeks. \n At Unity Productions Foundation of Potomac Falls, Virginia, officials said they would decline a grant of $396,585 to produce educational films challenging narratives supporting extremist ideologies and violent extremism \"due to the changes brought by the new administration,\" according to a private message to donors reviewed by The Associated Press. \n And in Dearborn, Michigan, Leaders Advancing and Helping Communities said last week it was turning down $500,000 for youth-development and public-health programs because of the \"current political climate.\" Ka Joog, a leading Somali nonprofit organization in Minneapolis, also turned down $500,000 for its youth programs. \n The Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. \n A U.S. official said the Trump administration has been discussing changing the Obama administration program's name, established as a presidential strategy in 2011, to an iteration of \"countering Islamic extremism.\" The official, who has knowledge of the discussions, was not authorized to speak publicly about the proposal and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n All told, more than 20 percent of the roughly $10 million awarded by the Homeland Security Department has been rejected. And other groups have signaled they may follow suit, should the name change. \n Turk said school officials already had reservations about the CVE strategy under Obama because they felt there's no clear or proven pathway to violence for someone with a particular extreme ideology. The group went ahead, despite worries by some activists that the program equated to a government surveillance program, because it believed the previous administration wasn't hostile to their faith. \n But amid what Turk called Trump's \"fixation on the American Muslim community,\" it became clear that the president's actions were more than campaign-trail rhetoric, he said. \n \"It was becoming more and more apparent,\" Turk said of Trump, \"that he's actually looking to carry out all the scary stuff he said.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fourth Muslim group rejects federal grant to fight extremism"}

Trump has described the sprawling Mar-a-Lago property as the Winter White House and has spent two weekends there this month. \n PALM BEACH, Fla. >> President Donald Trump's South Florida estate is no longer just the place where he goes to escape. \n He has described the sprawling Mar-a-Lago property as the Winter White House and has spent two weekends there so far this month. But it's also become a magnet for anti-Trump protesters and the subject of an ethics debate over his invitation to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to join him this weekend \u2014 with Trump pledging to pay for the accommodations. \n Demonstrators plan to assemble Sunday near the estate to protest Trump's decision on the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The North Dakota project, opposed by a Native American tribe fearful of water contamination from potential oil leaks, had stalled in Democrat Barack Obama's administration. Trump's executive order cleared the way for the developer to start building the final stretch of pipeline. \n During Trump's other weekend in Florida, several thousand people marched near the property to protest his temporary ban on travel to the United states by refugees as well as citizens of seven mostly Muslim countries. A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's decision that temporarily blocks the ban's enforcement. \n Trump's election is also putting charitable organizations, such as the American Red Cross, in an awkward position for choosing Mar-a-Lago for events booked months in advance. The Red Cross held its annual fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago, as it has done for many years, on Feb. 4, about a week after Trump enacted the travel ban. Trump and his wife, Melania, attended. \n \"What an honor, what a great honor it is. And let's go to Florida,\" Trump told Abe on Friday at a White House news conference shortly before they boarded Air Force One for the trip. \n The two world leaders and their wives headed straight to Mar-a-Lago, where they enjoyed a late dinner at the crowded patio restaurant. Joining them under a white-and-yellow striped canopy were Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, and several interpreters. Paying members and their guests took in the scene and mingled with Trump and Abe into the night. \n On Saturday, Trump and Abe went to Trump's golf course in nearby Jupiter and were expected to hold more talks over meals at Trump's various Florida properties. \n World leaders typically exchange gifts, and Trump and Abe did so when Abe rushed to New York City in November to become the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after the election. Abe gave Trump a pricey, gold-colored Honma golf driver; Trump reciprocated with a golf shirt and other golf accessories. \n White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Abe's free-of-charge stay at Mar-a-Lago is Trump's gift to Abe this time around. But the gesture wasn't sitting well with government watchdog groups. \n Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, said Trump and Abe don't need to meet at Trump's commercial property, where the membership fee recently was doubled to $200,000. \n \"Hosting a foreign leader at the president's business resort creates impossible sets of conflicts,\" Weissman said. \"If the president hadn't offered to pay, the U.S. government would be paying Donald Trump's business for the purpose of hosting the Japanese leader.\" Typically, the U.S. government would pick up the costs associated with such a visit. \n Weissman said Camp David, the U.S. government-owned retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains, which presidents use for personal getaways as well as to conduct the people's business, would do fine. \n \"Why should you go to a resort in Florida?\" Weissman asked. \"Fine, you want to go to a resort in Florida? Don't go to one Trump's family owns.\" \n But Trump has shown that he isn't too concerned about possible conflicts of interest involving him and his family. This past week, Trump used his official government Twitter account to criticize Nordstrom after the retailer said it had dropped a line of clothing and accessories sold by his daughter Ivanka. \n Trump offered a possible explanation for inviting Abe to Mar-a-Lago, saying a \"great friendship\" had developed from their New York meeting. \n The president is expected to continue bringing world leaders to the estate, helping to fulfill the vision of the property's former owner, Marjorie Merriweather Post. The late cereal heiress willed Mar-a-Lago to the U.S. government after her death in 1973, intending for it to become a retreat for U.S. presidents and visiting dignitaries. \n Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in the 1980s and retains a financial interest in the club. \n Presidents through the years often escaped the majesty and protocol of the White House by choosing less formal settings for bilateral talks. \n \"It's difficult, in effect, to get away inside the White House with the press corps in the same building,\" said Bruce Buchanan, politics professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \"In fact, it's very desirable for presidents to have multiple venues within which to build and create relationships with other world leaders.\" \n President George W. Bush took advantage of his dusty ranch in Crawford, Texas, and regularly invited foreign counterparts there for talks. \n Obama opted for Sunnylands, an estate in the California desert formerly owned by Walter and Leonore Annenberg. The late philanthropists built Sunnylands and long hoped the property they used as a winter home would become the \"Camp David of the West.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's Florida estate stirs protests, spurs ethics debate"}

{"date": "February 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2016 \n A group of residents and activists stand outside the state Capitol ahead of a meeting about labor conditions for foreign fishermen in Hawaii's commercial fleet in Honolulu. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2016 \n A federal law enforcement officer talks to foreign fishermen in Hawaii's commercial fleet during a vessel inspection in Honolulu. About 700 foreign fishermen are required to stay on their vessels and not set foot ashore in Hawaii. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2017 \n A catch of fish is unloaded from a commercial fishing boat at Pier 38 in Honolulu. Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state laws for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who have been refused entry into the U.S. \n Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state law for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who were refused entry into the country, the Associated Press has found. \n About 700 of these men are confined to vessels in Honolulu, some making less than $1 an hour to catch premium tuna and swordfish sold at some of America's most upscale restaurants and grocery stores. \n In this unique fishing arrangement, Hawaii's boat owners pay brokers up to $10,000 for each crew member sent from abroad. Because the workers don't have visas, they aren't allowed to arrive at Honolulu's airport. Instead, they're flown to foreign ports and put on fishing boats for long sails back to Hawaii. \n Before they start working, they need a commercial fishing license. And in order to get that, Hawaii requires that they are \"lawfully admitted\" to the U.S. As proof of legal admission, state officials point to landing permits issued to all fishermen by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents when the men arrive at the dock. \n Here's the hitch: AP has learned Customs agents stamp \"refused\" on all the landing permits, which voids them. So instead of being \"lawfully admitted,\" the fishermen are actually barred by law from setting foot in the U.S. \n \"Try taking a check to your bank that says 'void' on it and telling them, 'Oh, but they wrote the check to me,'\" said Hawaii attorney Lance Collins, who advocates for the workers. \n Nonetheless, in a written opinion, state Attorney General Douglas Chin said the Department of Land and Natural Resources provides the landing permits as proof the fishermen are \"lawfully admitted.\" \n Customs sees it differently. \"NO. They cannot be admitted,\" spokesman Frank Falcon wrote in an email. \n The Hawaii Longline Association has condemned labor abuses. Its president, Sean Martin, would not comment for this story, but in the past the group said the crew members are legally hired for legitimate work on the fleet's 141 active vessels. And while the conditions and pay are often below U.S. standards, the jobs are typically better than the bleak opportunities the men have at home, mostly in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and the tiny Pacific island of Kiribati. \n Under federal law, U.S. citizens must make up 75 percent of the crew on most American commercial fishing boats. An AP investigation last year revealed Hawaii's fleet \u2014 which catches about $110 million worth of seafood annually \u2014 relies on a federal loophole allowing foreign fishermen to fill most jobs. \n On some boats the men are exposed to dangerous, unsanitary conditions. Two workers who ran away in San Francisco were granted visas as victims of human trafficking in 2010. They are now suing their boat owner. \n Hawaii's premium fish is sold everywhere from Costco and Sam's Club to Trump International Hotel Waikiki. Whole Foods suspended buying seafood from the fleet after the AP's initial report, while Costco says it is monitoring the situation. Trump Hotel and Wal-Mart, which owns Sam's Club, did not respond to requests for comment. \n The Hawaii Seafood Council recently surveyed crew members and assessed the fleet's working conditions. A draft of the findings, published online, finds some fishermen have contracts requiring them to pay for replacement workers if they break their agreements, or facing $5,000 fines for absconding \u2014 more than a year's salary for some. \n \"There exists no system of grievance mechanisms for crew to voice concerns over pay,\" the report says. \n However, the assessment also found some fishermen had excellent relationships with their captains. All 207 men surveyed said they were being paid in cash, and none expressed concerns about forced labor or human trafficking. \n In Honolulu most vessels dock at piers 17 and 38, which are guarded and patrolled, but some go as far as the West Coast. \n Customs says six fishermen were deported in 2016 after wandering away from their boats in Honolulu, some to visit friends on other vessels, others sneaking away for a drink. \n Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said agents checking out a number of leads related to possible human trafficking in the fleet have \"identified instances where crew members were contending with less than ideal working conditions,\" but found no situations meeting the legal threshold to bring criminal charges. \n Some fishermen have good working conditions, but others lack clean drinking water or proper health care, and are fed just bait and rice, according to federal marine observers, who live with the men for weeks at a time. Many crew members are forced to use buckets as toilets. \n Uli Kozak, an Indonesian-language professor at the University of Hawaii, said the men have spoken of physical abuse, including captains slapping them in the face. Sometimes when he visits to exchange goods for fresh fish, workers ask him to bring vegetables because of shortages on board, he said. \n \"Very often they are in a situation where they have no choice,\" Kozak said. \"They are here, they signed their contract and they have to work until the contract finishes.\" \n ", "author": "ignore", "title": "Foreign fishermen blocked from U.S. still get isle work"}
