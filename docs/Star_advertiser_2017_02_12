{"date": "February 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend talked with an Iraqi officer during a tour north of Baghdad on Feb. 8. \n BAGHDAD >>Reverberations from President Donald Trump's travel ban and other stances are threatening to undermine future U.S.-Iraqi security cooperation, rattling a key alliance that over the past two years has slowly beaten back the Islamic State group. \n Iraq's prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, has sought to contain any backlash from public anger sparked by Trump's executive order banning Iraqis from traveling to the U.S. Also breeding resentment and suspicion are Trump's repeated statements that the Americans should have taken Iraq's oil and his hard line against Iran, a close ally of al-Abadi's government. \n Al-Abadi and Trump spoke Thursday night for the first time since Trump's inauguration. The U.S. leader, who has pledged a stronger fight against IS militants, promised increased help for Iraq against terrorism, and al-Abadi asked him to remove Iraq from the travel ban, according to an Iraqi official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the telephone call. \n Iraqi anger at Washington comes at a crucial juncture in a long and often contentious relationship. U.S.-backed Iraqi forces are about to launch an assault aimed at retaking the western half of Mosul that is still under Islamic State control. If Mosul is completely secured, it largely would break the extremist group's \"caliphate\" in the country. \n However, Iraqi and U.S. officials have said maintaining security in a post-IS Iraq will be just as difficult \u2014 preventing a resurgence of the militants and containing political divisions among Iraq's Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds. Both countries have talked of keeping some U.S. troops long term to back Iraq's security forces in that task, a recognition that complete American withdrawal at the end of 2011 was a mistake. \n Now the Iraqi leader is coming under pressure. Lawmakers are demanding he reduce cooperation with Washington in the future, limit or prevent American troops from staying in the country after the defeat of IS, and reciprocate for any travel ban on Iraqis. Members of powerful Shiite militias have outright warned of retaliation against Americans if the U.S. carries out any military action against Iran, their patron. \n \"Trump embarrassed al-Abadi,\" said Saad al-Mutalabi, a lawmaker and long-time ally of former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, one of al-Abadi's most powerful political opponents. \n \"There will be a general consensus that Americans should not stay in Iraq after Mosul, after the statements and the executive order from Trump,\" he said. \"We believed that we had a strategic agreement with the U.S.\" \n \"We are fighting ISIS on behalf of the entire world,\" he added, using an alternative acronym for IS. \"This has been a severe, severe disappointment among all Iraqis.\" \n Publicly, al-Abadi has maintained measured tones. While he called Trump's ban an \"insult,\" he refused to enact a reciprocity measure despite a strong call from Parliament to do so. \n The U.S. government has been reaching out regularly to al-Abadi's government to try to prevent the situation from escalating, sending the message that the U.S. is well aware of the potential consequences if Iraqis turn against it, said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly. \n Thursday's call was seen as a positive step toward defusing some of the tension, with Trump telling al-Abadi he would see what he could do to lessen the impact on Iraqis who shouldn't be kept out of the U.S., the official said. Since Trump announced the order, many in the U.S. government have been encouraging the White House to remove Iraq from the list. Although there has been no indication that Trump plans to delist Iraq entirely, he could take steps to exempt more Iraqis from the ban. \n Within Iraq's military, some are galled at being grouped in with terrorists by the travel ban when they have been engaged in slow, grueling combat against IS for more than two years. \n Iraqi forces backed by U.S.-led air power and American special forces have pushed IS out of cities in western Anbar province, along the Euphrates and up the Tigris river valley to Mosul in the north. Since October, they have taken back the eastern half of Iraq's second-largest city. \n Iraqi special forces Sgt. Maj. Hussein al-Kabii, stationed in Mosul, called Trump's statement about taking Iraq's oil and his travel ban \"just unbelievable.\" \n \"I have fought Daesh in Anbar, Fallujah, Salahuddin and now I'm currently fighting them in Mosul,\" he said using the Arabic acronym for IS. \"We have given a lot of blood fighting Daesh.\" \n Lukman Faily, the former Iraqi ambassador to the United States, said the ban still sways Iraqi perceptions of the U.S. despite being temporarily blocked by a U.S. federal court ruling. \n \"Iraqis will not want to have long-term security cooperation with the United States if the United States views them as terrorists,\" he said. \n Iraq's Kurds, who have autonomous rule in the north, have been more enthusiastic about Trump \u2014 despite the flap over his statements about Iraq's oil, some of which they control. That is in part rooted in the distrust of Iraq's Arab majority by many Kurds. Some Kurds welcome Trump's more unbridled tough talk against Islamic militancy, which many see as an Arab phenomenon, and believe it will bring Trump closer into alliance with them. Some have said they understand why the U.S. would bar Iraqis' entry \u2014 though they argue an exception should be made for Kurds. \n Some in Baghdad and the Iraqi military would likely welcome stepped-up U.S. military help. But Trump's early moves frustrate an already rocky relationship with Washington. \n After the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that ousted Saddam Hussein in 2003, the American troop presence grew as high as 168,000. The war that ensued killed nearly 4,500 American troops and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. \n Many among the Iraqi public, as well as the military and political class acknowledged the need for \u2014 even welcomed \u2014 U.S. forces and political support. But that has been mixed with anger over abuses and civilian casualties caused by U.S. troops, as well as frustration that U.S. policy missteps following the 2003 invasion, including disbanding the Iraq army after Saddam's fall, helped foster the insurgency, eventually leading to the creation of al-Qaida in Iraq and later the Islamic State group. \n The fight for Mosul has brought Iraq and the U.S. closer. There are now some 6,000 U.S. forces inside Iraq, U.S. troops have moved closer to frontline fighting and American special forces have conducted greater numbers of raids into IS-held territory aimed at taking out key leaders. \n But Iraqi politics is still dominated by powerful Shiite blocs with close ties to Iran. Throughout his time in office, al-Abadi has struggled to balance his reliance on the two rivals, the United States and Iran. \n A smaller U.S. presence in Iraq post-IS would likely usher in a larger role for armed groups with close ties to Iran, a scenario similar to what happened in the days following Mosul's fall in 2014. After IS overran nearly a third of the country in a matter of days, Iran swiftly came to Iraq's aid with fighters and weapons, while the U.S. waited for weeks to begin a campaign of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes. \n The spokesman of one Shiite militia, Kataib Hezbollah, warned that his fighters were ready to target U.S. interests if the Trump administration goes too far against Iran. \n \"If the U.S. takes military action against Iran, we will return the favor,\" Jaafar al-Husseini said. \"We have all the details of (U.S. troop) movements. They are right under our eyes. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump moves spark Iraqi anger, calls against future alliance"}

{"date": "February 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Pat Winters Lauro, a journalism professor at Kean University in Union, N.J., led a class discussion talking about fake news. \n WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y. >> Teachers from elementary school through college are telling students how to distinguish between factual and fictional news \u2014 and why they should care that there's a difference. \n \"I think only education can solve this problem,\" said Pat Winters Lauro, a professor at Kean University in New Jersey who began teaching a course on news literacy this semester. \n Like others, Lauro has found discussions of fake news can lead to politically sensitive territory. Some critics believe fake stories targeting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton helped Donald Trump overcome a large deficit in public opinion polls, and President Trump himself has attached the label to various media outlets and unfavorable reports and polls in the first weeks of his presidency. \n \"It hasn't been a difficult topic to teach in terms of material because there's so much going on out there,\" Lauro said, \"but it's difficult in terms of politics because we have such a divided country and the students are divided, too, on their beliefs. I'm afraid sometimes that they think I'm being political when really I'm just talking about journalistic standards for facts and verification, and they look at it like 'Oh, you're anti-this or -that.'\" \n Judging what to trust was easier when the sources were clearer \u2014 magazines, newspapers or something else, said Kean senior Mike Roche, who is taking Lauro's class. Now \"it all comes through the same medium of your cellphone or your computer, so it's very easy to blur the lines and not have a clear distinction of what's real and what's fake,\" he said. \n A California lawmaker last month introduced a bill to require the state to add lessons on how to distinguish between real and fake news to the grade 7-12 curriculum. \n High school government and politics teacher Lesley Battaglia added fake news to the usual election-season lessons on primaries and presidential debates, discussing credible sites and sources and running stories through fact-checking sites like Snopes. There were also lessons about anonymous sources and satire. (They got a kick out of China's dissemination of a 2012 satirical story from The Onion naming Kim Jong Un as the sexiest man alive.) \n \"I'm making you guys do the hard stuff that not everybody always does. They see it in a tweet and that's enough for them,\" Battaglia told her students at Williamsville South High School in suburban Buffalo. \n \"It's kind of crazy,\" 17-year-old student Hannah Mercer said, \"to think about how much it's affecting people and swaying their opinions.\" \n Stony Brook University's Center for News Literacy pioneered the idea of educating future news consumers, and not just journalists, a decade ago with the rise of online news. About four in 10 Americans often get news online, a 2016 Pew Research Center report found. Stony Brook last month partnered with the University of Hong Kong to launch a free online course. \n \"To me, it's the new civics course,\" said Tom Boll, after wrapping up his own course on real and fake news at the Newhouse School at Syracuse University. With everyone now able to post and share, gone are the days of the network news and newspaper editors serving as the primary gatekeepers of information, Boll, an adjunct professor, said. \n \"The gates are wide open,\" he said, \"and it's up to us to figure out what to believe.\" \n That's not easy, said Raleigh, North Carolina-area teacher Bill Ferriter, who encourages students to first use common sense to question whether a story could be true, to look at web addresses and authors for hints, and to be skeptical of articles that seem aimed at riling them up. \n He pointed to an authentic-looking site reporting that President Barack Obama signed an order in December banning the Pledge of Allegiance in schools. A \".co\" at the end of an impostor news site web address should have been a red flag, he said. \n \"The biggest challenge that I have whenever I try to teach kids about questionable content on the web,\" said Ferriter, who teaches sixth grade, \"is convincing them that there is such a thing as questionable content on the web.\" \n Some of Battaglia's students fear fake news will chip away at the trust of even credible news sources and give public figures license to dismiss as fake news anything unfavorable. \n \"When people start to distrust all news sources is when people in power are just allowed to do whatever they want, said Katie Peter, \"and that's very scary.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Detecting fake news added to classroom instruction"}

They were eating at a restaurant when the evacuation order came. \n A driver with a large vehicle and three children of her own gave them a ride to the Red Cross evacuation center at the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds in Chico. \n \"You can't take a chance with the baby,\" Patrick Cumings said of their decision to flee. \n Lake Oroville also serves as a reservoir and levels rose significantly in recent weeks after a series of storms that have dumped rain and snow across California, particularly in northern parts of the state, where the lake lies about 150 miles northeast of San Francisco. \n The high water levels forced the use of the dam's spillway, or overflow, for the first time in the dam's nearly 50-year history on Saturday. \n The threat appeared to ease somewhat today, which officials saying water flows into the lake stood at about 45,000 cubic feet per second with outflows at 100,000 cubic feet per second. \n Sunday afternoon's evacuation order came after engineers spotted a hole on the concrete lip of the secondary spillway for the 770-foot-tall Oroville Dam and told authorities that it could fail within the hour. \n With more rain expected Wednesday and Thursday, officials are rushing to try to fix the damage and hoping to significantly reduce the dam's water level \u2014 by 50 feet \u2014 ahead of the storms. \n The sudden evacuation panicked residents, who scrambled to get their belongings into cars and then grew angry as they sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic hours after the evacuation order was given. \n Raj Gill, managing a Shell station where anxious motorists got gas and snacks, said his boss told him to close the station and flee himself. But he stayed open to feed a steady line of customers. \n \"You can't even move,\" he said. \"I'm trying to get out of here too. I'm worried about the flooding. I've seen the pictures \u2014 that's a lot of water.\" \n A Red Cross spokeswoman said more than 500 people showed up at an evacuation center in Chico, California. \n The shelter had run out of blankets and cots, and a tractor trailer with 1,000 more cots was stuck in the gridlock of traffic fleeing the potential flooding Sunday night, said Red Cross shelter manager Pam Deditch. \n A California Highway Patrol spokesman said two planes would fly today to help with traffic control and possible search and rescue missions. \n At least 250 California law enforcement officers were posted near the dam and along evacuation routes to manage the exodus of residents and ensure evacuated towns don't face looting or other criminal activity. \n Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said a lot was still unknown. \n \"We need to continue to lower the lake levels and we need to give the Department of Water Resources time to fully evaluate the situation so we can make the decision to whether or not it is safe to repopulate the area,\" Honea said. \n About 188,000 residents of Yuba, Sutter and Butte counties were ordered to evacuate. \n Acting Director Department of Water Resources Bill Croyle said officials will be able to assess the damage to the emergency spillway now that the lake levels have come down. \n The erosion at the head of the emergency spillway threatens to undermine the concrete weir and allow large, uncontrolled releases of water from Lake Oroville. \n Those potential flows could overwhelm the Feather River and other downstream waterways, channels and levees and flood towns in three counties. \n Department engineer and spokesman Kevin Dossey told the Sacramento Bee the emergency spillway was rated to handle 250,000 cubic feet per second, but it began to show weakness Sunday after flows peaked at 12,600 cubic feet per second. \n The California National Guard notified all its 23,000 soldiers and airmen to be ready to deploy, the first time an alert for the entire California National Guard had been issued since the 1992 riots in Los Angeles after a jury acquitted four police officers in the beating of Rodney King. \n The sudden decision Sunday to evacuate tens of thousands of people was a departure from earlier assurances, when officials had stressed the Oroville Dam itself was structurally sound. \n Unexpected erosion chewed through the main spillway during heavy rain earlier this week, sending chunks of concrete flying and creating a 200-foot-long, 30-foot-deep hole that continues growing. \n Officials are most concerned about the dam's emergency, earthen spillway that began taking on water after water was diverted from the main concrete spillway because of the damage. \n Engineers do not know what caused the cave-in. Chris Orrock, a Department of Water Resources spokesman, said it appears the dam's main spillway has stopped crumbling even though it is being used for water releases. \n The lake is a central piece of California's government-run water delivery network, supplying water for the state's Central Valley agricultural heartland and residents and businesses in Southern California. \n Associated Press writer Kristin J.

The White House confirmed the talk, but did not mention Peru's deportation request. It said they discussed the need for strong economic group as well as the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Venezuela. \n Last week, a Peruvian court ordered the arrest and detention of ex-President Alejandro Toledo as prosecutors investigate whether he took $20 million in payments from the giant Brazilian construction company Odebrecht. \n Peruvian officials have said they believe Toledo is in San Francisco, where he has been researching a book as a visiting scholar at nearby Stanford University. Local media reported he had intended to fly over the weekend to Israel, where his wife has citizenship, until Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government said he would be denied entry. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said Toledo was not on a flight from San Francisco that landed tonight. \n Authorities across Latin America have been moving fast to charge officials accused of taking some $800 million in bribes from Odebrecht. The company acknowledged the bribes when it signed a plea agreement in December with the U.S. Justice Department. \n Used to win business in 12 countries, the bribes include some $29 million paid in Peru for projects built during the administrations of Toledo (2001-2006) and two of his successors. So far, three officials have been arrested. \n Toledo, a former pro-democracy activist who led street protests that brought down former strongman Alberto Fujimori in 2000, is accused of receiving some $20 million in bribes from Odebrecht in exchange for favoring the company in a contract to build a major highway from Brazil to Peru's Pacific coast. \n In a nationally televised address tonight, Kuczysnki called on Toledo to return immediately to Peru to clarify his legal situation. Earlier, Kuczynski thanked Israel's government for its support in a letter to Netanyahu. \n The White House said Trump expressed concerns about developments in Venezuela. Kuczysnki, a 78-year-old former Wall Street banker, has spearheaded calls among Latin American leaders to punish Venezuela's socialist government for allegedly breaking with the nation's democratic order. \n Kuczynski, a 78-year-old former Wall Street banker has seen his approval ratings fall as a result of a number of ethical slips by members of his Cabinet, though none of those cases are tied to Odebrecht. \n In his address, he announced executive measures meant to strengthen Peru's fight against corruption. They include a bigger budget for prosecutors as well as rewards and protections for whistleblowers and a ban for life on contracting with the state for companies that engage in graft. \n \"We have to act relentlessly and immediately to stop the rot of corruption in Peru,\" the president said. \n Kuczynski's calls for zero tolerance for corruption comes as prosecutors in the Odebrecht case want to speak with the president himself. \n As Toledo's prime minister in 2006, Kuczynski signed a law passed by congress allowing Odebrecht to participate in an auction to build two highways despite a ban on it bidding for government contracts at the time because it was facing legal action for irregularities in another project. Odebrecht eventually was awarded the roads contract. \n Kuczynski has denied any wrongdoing. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Peru's president asks Trump to deport fugitive ex-leader"}

The president, who spent the weekend at his private club in Florida, has yet to comment on Flynn's status. Nor has Vice President Mike Pence, who previously denied that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the U.S. \n Pence and Flynn spoke twice on Friday, according to an administration official. \n Trump has told associates he is troubled by the situation, but he has not said whether he plans to ask Flynn to step down, according to a person who spoke with him recently. Flynn was a loyal Trump supporter during the campaign, but he is viewed skeptically by some in the administration's national security circles, in part because of his ties to Russia. \n The administration official and both people with ties to Trump spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. \n On Friday, The Washington Post reported that Flynn addressed sanctions against Russia in a call with Kislyak. The report contradicted repeated denials from Trump officials, including Pence, who vouched for Flynn in a televised interview. \n Flynn has since told administration officials that sanctions may have come up in the calls, which coincided with the Obama administration slapping penalties on Russia for election-related hacking. \n It's illegal for private citizens to conduct U.S. diplomacy. Flynn's conversations also raise questions about Trump's friendly posture toward Russia after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow hacked Democratic emails during the election. \n Stephen Miller, Trump's top policy adviser, skirted the issue on several Sunday news shows, saying it was not his place to weigh in on the \"sensitive matter\" or to say whether the president retains confidence in Flynn. \n Several other White House officials did not respond Sunday to questions about whether Trump had confidence in his national security adviser. Their silence appeared to reflect some uncertainty about the views of the president, who is known to quickly change his mind. \n New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who led Trump's transition planning before the election, said Flynn would have to explain his conflicting statements about his conversations with Kislyak to Trump and Pence. \n \"Gen. Flynn has said up to this point that he had not said anything like that to the Russian ambassador. I think now he's saying that he doesn't remember whether he did or not,\" Christie said on CNN. \"So, that's a conversation he is going to need to have with the president and the vice president to clear that up, so that the White House can make sure that they are completely accurate about what went on.\" \n The controversy surrounding Flynn comes as the young administration grapples with a series of national security challenges, including North Korea's reported ballistic missile launch. The president, who was joined at his Mar-a-Lago estate by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the weekend, voiced solidarity with Japan. \n Trump meets today with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and later in the week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \n The White House is also dealing with fallout from the rocky rollout of Trump's immigration executive order, which has been blocked by the courts. The order was intended to suspend the nation's refugee program and bar citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. \n Advocacy groups contend the government has rounded up large numbers of people as part of stepped-up enforcement.

Their eyes darted around the room. They stared down at their feet. Others didn't attend at all. \n \"There is a dreadful sense of fear. It's more than palpable. It's radiating. People are terrified,\" said Morris, whose United Methodist mission is in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood of Los Angeles. \"They were just sitting there in stunned silence.\" \n For days, fear and confusion have gripped immigrant communities across the nation after word spread that federal agents were rounding up hundreds of immigrants in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, New York, California, Illinois and Texas. The scope of the operation remained unclear on Sunday. \n The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said the efforts were \"routine\" and no different than the targeted arrests carried out under former President Barack Obama. \n But Trump took to Twitter to claim credit. \n \"The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise,\" he wrote early Sunday. \"Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!\" \n On the Sunday morning talk shows, the president's representatives said the enforcement was a result of Trump's policies. \n White House policy adviser Stephen Miller told \"Fox News Sunday\" that the administration had \"taken new and greater steps to remove criminal aliens\" who pose a threat to public safety. \n Among those arrested were a Salvadoran gang member wanted in his home country and a Brazilian drug trafficker, officials said. \n Nearly 200 people were arrested in the Carolinas and Georgia. More than 150 more were rounded up in and around Los Angeles, and around 40 were arrested in New York City and surrounding areas, ICE confirmed. \n A decade ago, immigration officers searching for specific individuals would often arrest others encountered along the way, a practice that drew criticism from advocates. Under the Obama administration, agents focused more narrowly on specific individuals. ICE now appears to be reverting back to old policies. \n Immigrant rights groups cite the case of Manuel Mosqueda, a 50-year-old house painter, as an example of how they believe ICE agents in the new administration are going too far. \n During last week's enforcement operation, ICE agents showed up at Mosqueda's home looking for someone else. While there, they inquired about Mosqueda, learned he was here illegally and put him on a bus to Mexico. \n Karla Navarrete, a lawyer for the advocacy group CHIRLA, said she sought to stop Mosqueda from being placed on the bus and was told by ICE that things had changed. She said another lawyer filed federal court papers and got a judge to stop the deportation. The bus turned around, and Mosqueda is now jailed in Southern California, waiting to learn his fate. \n Agents who went to a Virginia apartment Thursday looking for a wanted man picked up everyone else in the apartment too, except for one women with a baby in her arms, said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, legal director for Legal Aid Justice Center's immigrant advocacy program in northern Virginia. \n For supporters of Trump's immigration policies, the new and broader approach was welcome news. \n \"The main thing is to send the message that the immigration laws are actually being enforced again. That in itself is an important message that's got to be sent,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates for tighter controls on immigration. \n Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the agency is simply enforcing federal law. \n But immigration advocates said many immigrants are afraid to send their children to school and afraid to go to church or work or the hospital. \n Panicked rumors spread as quickly as the truth. \n \"Every time so much as a white guy with a clipboard is walking around, everyone runs into their apartments and locks the doors,\" he said. \n One case that sowed widespread fear was that of Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a mother of two in Phoenix who was arrested nearly a decade ago for using a false ID to get a job as a janitor. She pleaded guilty to a felony charge, but the government declined to deport her. On Wednesday, she showed up at the ICE building in Phoenix for a scheduled check-in with immigration officers and was deported to Mexico. \n Advocates and immigration attorney across the country scrambled to hold seminars and conference calls teaching people their rights. \n At his Sunday morning service, Morris handed out a double-sided sheet listing congregants' civil rights. The first read \"don't open your door.\" He is planning a community meeting for Monday night with lawyers, immigration advocates and consuls from Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala. \n He has another plan, too. He started organizing a phone chain. If he hears about a raid on a home in his community, he will call five people, who will call five people and so on. They will all show up, stand on the sidewalk and chant: \"ICE go home.\" He hopes \"public shaming\" will prove to be a deterrent. \n \"The only weapon we have is solidarity,\" he said. \"They are deporting people who may be undocumented, but they do have rights under our laws.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Immigrants wait in fear after raids; Trump takes credit"}

On Monday, Feb. 13, 2017, President Donald Trump will welcome Trudeau to the White House. \n OTTAWA, Ontario >> The first face to face meeting between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Trump could be the most important meeting for Canada in decades between leaders of the two neighbors. \n Trudeau will be at the White House on Monday at a time many Canadians fear Trump will enact protectionist measures that could hurt their economy and worry the new president could be as combative as he was with the leaders of Mexico and Australia. \n Trudeau, 45, and Trump, 70, have vastly different outlooks on the world. Trudeau is a liberal who champions global trade and has welcomed 40,000 Syrian refugees. Trump is a protectionist and his moves to restrict entry of refugees and immigrants are expected to come up Monday. But Trudeau is expected to emphasize common economic interests. \n \"We're going to talk about all sorts of things we align on, like jobs and economic growth, opportunities for the middle class \u2013 the fact that millions of good jobs on both sides of our border depend on the smooth flow of goods and services across that border,\" Trudeau said. \n But Trudeau also said they are \"going to talk about things that I'm sure we disagree on and we'll do it in a respectful way. Canada will always stay true to the values that have made us this extraordinary country, a place of openness.\" \n After Trump signed the executive order pausing entries to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority nations, Trudeau tweeted that Canada welcomed people fleeing persecution, terrorism and war. Trudeau said \"diversity is our strength.\" His spokeswoman said Trudeau was looking forward discussing Canada's immigration and refugee policy with Trump. \n But Trudeau isn't expected to poke the new president like his headstrong father, late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, did to previous presidents during the almost 16 years he was in office. \n Tall and trim, Justin Trudeau channels the star power of his storied father but is less confrontational. \n American relations are crucial for Canada as more than 75 percent of the country's exports and 98 percent of its oil exports go to the U.S. About 18 percent of U.S. exports go to Canada. There are fears Canada could be sideswiped if Trump targets Mexico in a re-negotiation of the North American Free Trade agreement. \n But Wall Street tycoon and Trump adviser Stephen Schwarzman has said \"things should go well for Canada\" if the president reopens NAFTA because the northern neighbor has a balanced trade relationship with the United States. Schwarzman, who leads Trump's economic advisory group, said other countries have large trade unbalances and markets that aren't as open to American trade as Canada's. \n There's no indication Trump views Canada as a problem or an economic adversary but Trump is unpredictable, said Roland Paris, a former senior foreign policy to Trudeau. Paris called it a very important moment in U.S.-Canada relations and said he's cautiously optimistic the two will can have a constructive relationship focused on increasing economic ties. \n \"Canadians expect their prime minister to do two things: uphold Canadian values and to have an effective constructive relationship with the president of the United States. That's a balancing act and it's not necessarily going to be easy,\" Paris said. \n Canada has not been the subject of a Trump tweet but fears remain about Trump's impulsiveness. \n \"We're dealing with someone who has abused the Mexican president and the Australian prime minister,\" said Robert Bothwell, a professor at the University of Toronto. \n Bothwell said Trudeau should avoid confrontation considering the stakes and how delicate the situation is. \n \"Most American presidents have been pretty level headed. You have to go back to the monarchs of the Middle Ages or Roman Emperors. How does Nero feel today? Is his stomach acting up? What does the emperor decree?\" Bothwell said. \"We're back in the Roman empire. We haven't had anything like this.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump and Trudeau meet face to face for the first time"}

The National Weather Service says up to 19 inches of snow could fall in Boston through Monday, while Connecticut and Rhode Island could see a mix of snow, sleet and rain of more than 6 inches. \n Wind gusts of more than 50 mph, coastal flooding and power outages could hit parts of the region. A blizzard watch was in effect on Cape Cod, with a storm surge of 1 to 3 feet possible, according to the weather service. \n \"It is a dangerous storm because of high winds, low visibility and heavy snow,\" said Lenore Correia, a weather service meteorologist in Taunton, Massachusetts. \"It's a big snowstorm, but nothing we haven't seen before either.\" \n More than 3,000 flights were canceled nationwide by midmorning Sunday, including 155 at Boston's Logan International Airport, according to the flight tracking service FlightAware. Parking bans were in effect in many cities and towns. School closings across the region were expected Monday, but few announcements had been made by Sunday morning. \n Officials across northern New England stressed caution to thrill-seekers looking to make the most out of the heavy snow, especially after two fatal accidents Saturday at Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. \n \"While the heavy snow from our recent winter storm provides for optimum conditions for winter sports like snowmobiling, they also create hazards and we must be cautious,\" New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said. \n The storm was welcome news at ski areas, which faced some of the lowest snowfall totals in years last year. \n \"It's the complete opposite of last year in terms of snow,\" said Rachael Wilkinson, director of marketing at Shawnee Peak in Bridgton, Maine. \"It's night and day and everyone is absolutely thrilled.\" \n The ski area is expected to get 20 to 26 inches of snow by the end of the day Monday. \n The Bangor Police Department in Maine took to Facebook on Sunday to offer its own take on official snowstorm advice. The department reminded people to check with their bosses before staying in and taking the day off, and to take off their ski-masks before checking in on elderly neighbors. \n Those who do go out should bring a blanket, water, working flashlight, small shovel, charged cellphone, snacks and mittens \u2014 not gloves. \n \"Now get to the grocery store and buy things you will never need.

{"date": "February 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump speaks as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe listens as they both made statements about North Korea at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. \n The White House continues to weigh its options following a legal blow last week to Trump's immigration order suspending the nation's refugee program and barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. \n Stephen Miller, Trump's chief policy adviser and one of the architects of the order, maintained in a round of Sunday show interviews that the president has sweeping executive authority when it comes to barring foreigners he deems pose a risk to the country. He said Trump will do \"whatever we need to do, consistent with the law, to keep this country safe\" and slammed judges who've stood in his way. \n \"This is a judicial usurpation of the power. It is a violation of judges' proper roles in litigating disputes. We will fight it,\" Miller said in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \n As for the administration's next steps, Miller said that \"all options\" remain on the table,\" including a Supreme Court appeal. Trump said on the plane ride to Florida on Friday that he was considering signing a \"brand new order\" as early as Monday to try to bypass the legal challenges. \n \"As you know, we have multiple options, and we are considering all of them,\" Miller said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \n The comments come amid an outcry from immigration activists over an \"enforcement surge\" by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers that officials say is targeting immigrants who are in the country illegally and have criminal records. \n Advocacy groups contend the government has rounded up large numbers of people as part of stepped-up enforcement. The agency calls the effort no different from enforcement actions carried out in the past. \n But Trump and Miller appeared eager to take credit for the action. \n \"The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!\" Trump tweeted. \n Added Miller on NBC's \"Meet the Press\": \"We're going to focus on public safety and saving American lives and we will not apologize.\" \n In the meantime, Miller insisted it wasn't up to him to say whether the president retains confidence in national security adviser Michael Flynn, who has come under scrutiny for his contact with the Russians before Trump's inauguration. \n Miller repeated in several interviews that the White House hadn't given him anything specific to say about Flynn during his appearances on the Sunday news shows. Miller called a report that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions in calls with Russia's ambassador while President Barack Obama was still in office \"a sensitive matter\" best answered by Trump, Vice President Mike Pence or chief of staff Reince Priebus. \n Trump has spent the weekend in Florida at his sprawling Mar-a-Lago estate, holding meetings, making calls, golfing and hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. \n For most of Saturday, Trump and the Japanese prime minister played golf under the Florida sun to get to know one another and show the world the U.S.-Japan alliance remained strong. A surprise provocation by the North Koreans provided a more significant example of cooperation. \n After North Korea reportedly launched a ballistic missile, the two leaders appeared for hastily prepared statements in a ballroom of Trump's south Florida estate late Saturday. Abe spoke first and longest. \n \"North Korea's most recent missile launch is absolutely intolerable,\" Abe said through a translator. He added that the North must comply fully with relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, but also noted that Trump had assured him that the U.S. supported Japan. \n \"President Trump and I myself completely share the view that we are going to promote further cooperation between the two nations. And also we are going to further reinforce our alliance,\" he said. \n Trump followed Abe with even fewer words, saying in part: \"I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent.\" With that, they left the room. \n Miller said on ABC that the joint appearance marked \"an important show of solidarity between the United States and Japan.\" \n \"Last night, what you saw was the president of the United States sending a powerful and unmistakable signal to North Korea and the entire world as he stood shoulder to shoulder with the prime minister of Japan and declared our steadfast and unwavering support of the alliance,\" he added on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \n Trump is to remain in Florida through Sunday evening and is scheduled to meet with his pick for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and his longtime friend-turned-Republican National Committee finance chair Steve Wynn, before heading back to Washington. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "White House defends travel ban as provocations mount"}

{"date": "February 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Stormy Patterson and her husband, Roger Kornfeind, get a bite to eat with their 16-month-old daughter Rowan at a mall in Whitehall, Pennsylvania, on February 9, 2017. \n ALLENTOWN, Pa. >> Stormy Patterson makes a distinction between opinion and action as she surveys each new call to boycott Company A or support Brand B. \n It's \"silly\" to penalize Under Armour over its CEO's praise of President Donald Trump, she says. Far more important is how a company behaves toward its customers or employees, especially if it has an impact on their rights. \n \"Hobby Lobby, I won't patronize them. I won't touch them. And I actually used to go there like once a week,\" said Patterson, who opposes the chain's refusal to pay for some kinds of birth control for its employees. \n Long before Trump slammed Nordstrom for dropping his daughter's clothing and accessories line \u2014 spurring the president's supporters to call for a boycott of the department store \u2014 politically active consumers have used their purchasing power strategically. They could punish brands with which they disagreed, and reward those whose views aligned with theirs. \n In the polarized Trump era, the simple act of buying a drink or shoes has never seemed so political. Social media makes it easier than ever for activists and consumers to target or defend stores and brands that take a stand or those they see as proxies for a politician. \n As a result, \"every shopping bag is a potential political statement,\" said Allen Adamson, founder of Brand Simple, a consulting firm. \"It is like carrying a sign in a rally.\" \n Patterson said her political views have \"absolutely\" influenced her buying decisions. \n \"I think everybody has their different extremes, or what they feel is worth taking a stand for,\" said Patterson, who turns 34 on Monday, as she shopped with her husband and 16-month-old daughter at an Allentown mall. \n The weaponized buying can be a minefield for retailers and brands, many of which are already struggling as malls fall out of favor and people buy more online. Some companies deliberately enter the political fray, betting that their customers will support their points of view. Others tread carefully, trying to avoid a backlash. \n With advertising everywhere, Americans are used to seeing brand messages all the time \u2014 but not from politicians. Most Americans would prefer brands to not be political, said Wendy Liebmann, CEO of marketing consulting firm WSL Strategic Retail, and she believes companies should focus on larger messages rather than weigh in on specific political issues. \n Courtney Taylor, 21, of Center Valley, Pennsylvania, said she believes shopping and politics should remain separate. But she has her limits. Taylor, who voted for Trump because she opposes abortion, said she'd stop shopping at her favorite store if it were to start donating to an abortion-rights group. \n Companies \"need to know if they're going to release a political statement, people are going to react,\" she said. \n Monthly surveys have showed that more shoppers are citing politics among the top five factors that influence their buying decisions, according to Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at research firm NPD Group Inc. Chalk it up to election divisions that have lasted into Trump's presidency and his own penchant for mixing politics with commerce. \n Trump had used Twitter to chastise retailers like Amazon and Macy's before complaining that Nordstrom treated his daughter \"so unfairly.\" Nordstrom had said the Ivanka Trump brand's sales were falling, and ethics experts saw the tweet as an implied threat from the White House to businesses rethinking their Trump ties. \n The Ivanka Trump brand says it saw double-digit percentage sales growth in 2016 from the previous year as it expanded its categories, distribution and offerings. \"In recent days, we've seen our brand swept into the political fray, becoming collateral damage in others' efforts to advance agendas unrelated to what we do,\" the company said. \n A social media campaign called \"Grab Your Wallet\" has urged a boycott of stores that stock Ivanka Trump or Donald Trump products, which include Dillard's, Lord & Taylor and Amazon. Belk Inc. has said it will no longer carry Ivanka Trump items on its website, and QVC said it no longer sells her merchandise. \n Even seemingly innocuous Super Bowl ads provoke sharply divided reactions. Ads that touched on immigration and diversity from advertisers including Budweiser, 84 Lumber and Coca-Cola drew Twitter chatter both pro- and anti-, with some even calling for a boycott of Budweiser \u2014 although nothing substantial materialized. \n Other recent campaigns include: \n \u2014A #BoycottStarbucks campaign developed after the company responded to Trump's immigration order by pledging to hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years. \n \u2014 Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quit Trump's council of business leaders after an outcry from customers and employees who were upset about the travel ban, and a social media campaign urged people to delete the app. \n \u2014Cereal maker Kellogg Co. was a boycott target in November after it said it would stop advertising on Breitbart, the conservative news and opinion website formerly run by Trump's chief strategist. \n For all the noise, it remains to be seen whether these boycotts will have staying power. \n Kellogg CEO John Bryant said the company saw no \"discernible\" effect from the boycott calls. And though it initially dropped after Trump's tweet, Nordstrom's stock has gained more than 5 percent since then. \n \"Headlines are flying fast and furious. And it will be last week's news,\" said professor Susan Scafidi, academic director of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University's law school. \"The consuming public has a short memory \u2014 and they're forgiving,\" she added. \n For many shoppers, factors other than politics are just more important. Blake Wilhelm of Plattsmouth, Nebraska, says mainly he wants something that works well, and he tries to balance cost and quality. \n \"I don't see a reason to boycott some company because they have a different viewpoint than I do,\" said Wilhelm, 29, at an Omaha mall. \n Sometimes a latte just a latte. Taylor stopped at a Starbucks at the Allentown mall \u2014 and it had nothing to do with the chain's stance on refugees. \n \"I support them coming, so I support Starbucks. But it's not the reason I went there,\" she said. \"I went there because I wanted hot chocolate.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n D'Innocenzio reported from New York.

{"date": "February 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson speaks at a news conference about a federal appeals court's refusal to reinstate President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, in Seattle. \n SEATTLE >> The legal challenge that would launch Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson into the vanguard of resistance against President Donald Trump's travel ban was already in the works as Ferguson flew home from Florida the morning after Trump issued his executive order. \n In fact, it had been planned for some time. \n \"We were having internal conversations about a potential action by the president along those lines,\" Ferguson recalled in an interview. \"It wasn't like we were starting from ground zero.\" \n The legwork paid off. Within three days, the state's lawsuit over the ban \u2014 a more sweeping challenge than other cases filed over Trump's order \u2014 had been filed. The result? First a decision from a federal judge in Seattle that blocked nationwide enforcement of the ban, then a resounding win at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. \n The strategic thinking that led to the victories is one of Ferguson's hallmarks, say those who have observed his career. Ferguson attributes it to spending his formative years playing competitive chess. He was a two-time state champion by his early 20s. \n \"Chess teaches you to anticipate your opponent's threats and moves,\" he said. \"If your opponent makes a move that surprises you, that's a problem.\" \n Ferguson, a boyish 51-year-old Democrat, is serving his second term as Washington's top lawyer after winning two-thirds of the vote against a Libertarian challenger last fall. The Republicans didn't field a candidate. \n His office has launched significant lawsuits during his tenure, including several that made national headlines. \n He has filed consumer protection lawsuits against major computer technical support and student loan companies over what he described as predatory practices; sued President Barack Obama's administration over cleanup of the Hanford nuclear reservation, where the government made plutonium for weapons; and took a florist to court for refusing to serve clients staging a gay wedding. \n Last fall, Ferguson made Washington the first state to sue the agrochemical giant Monsanto over pervasive pollution from PCBs. An avid backpacker and mountain climber, he spoke of his anger that one of Washington's major rivers, the Skagit, on which his great-grandparents homesteaded in the 19th century, is now contaminated. \n None of those cases generated the interest of the one challenging Trump's order halting refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. Ferguson called it unconstitutional and un-American. \n Ferguson had been attending a meeting of Democratic attorneys general in Florida when the ban was announced late Friday, Jan. 27. When he landed at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Saturday, his voicemail was full of messages alerting him to Gov. Jay Inslee's plans for a news conference at the airport to condemn the ban. \n Ferguson decided to skip it and headed north to Seattle, where his team, led by state Solicitor General Noah Purcell and the head of the office's civil rights unit, Colleen Melody, was already putting together the state's lawsuit. \n They worked through the weekend. Where other lawsuits had sought the release of specific travelers who had been detained on arrival in the U.S., Washington sued on its own sake \u2014 citing widespread harm to its universities, businesses, tax collections and residents. \n \"He's got this smartest-kid-in-your-high-school-class thing, but he's a bulldog when he wants something,\" Chris Vance, former head of the state Republican Party, said about Ferguson. \"He's extremely politically ambitious, and he's unwilling to take no for an answer.\" \n Ferguson was 38 during his first campaign, virtually unknown and taking on the chairwoman of the King County Council, a 20-year incumbent from his own party. That didn't sit well with the local Democratic honchos, but Ferguson says he knocked on 22,000 doors and won by 528 votes after 30,000 ballots were cast. \n \"I remember talking to him saying, 'Hey, Bob, come down to the Seattle Chamber of Commerce for their interview panel because you might have a shot at getting their endorsement,'\" said King County Councilman Rod Dembowski, who helped run Ferguson's campaign. \"He wouldn't do it because it would have taken three hours away from doorbelling.\" \n Two years later, the council reduced its size from 13 members to nine \u2014 and the powers repaid Ferguson by eliminating his district, forcing him to run against another Democratic incumbent. He won again. \n Ferguson has gone his own way as attorney general, too, perhaps no more so than in his 2013 hiring of Purcell, who's been arguing the state's case against the travel ban in court. The solicitor general position normally goes to a seasoned attorney. Purcell, a former clerk for Justice David Souter, was 33. \n \"That Noah was so young and had never argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 or even the state Supreme Court \u2014 did not go unnoticed by many folks in my office,\" Ferguson said. \n Once his staff saw Purcell in action, though, any concerns evaporated. \n Questioned about whether he's comfortable in the national spotlight, Ferguson demurred.

Authorities were clearing out a 1.9-kilometer (1.18-mile) radius around the bomb site, mostly in the western suburb of Kordelio. \n Many people left in their cars, but some were being bused to schools and sports halls elsewhere in the city, where they can find food and shelter. \n \"We heard on TV that, if the bomb explodes, it will be like a strong earthquake,\" a worried Michalis Papanos, 71, told The Associated Press as he and his wife, Yiannoula, headed out of their home. \n Others, like 26-year-old Alexander Bogdani and his wife, Anna Bokonozi, left on foot. The couple, pushing a stroller with their toddler daughter, were going to a place about 1 kilometer (over 1/2 mile) from their home. \n \"They have warned us \u2026 we are afraid for the child,\" Bogdani said. \n The city's main bus station was shut down, trains in the area were halted and churches canceled their Sunday services. The city also booked a 175-room hotel where people with limited mobility and their escorts were taken on Saturday. \n \"This is the largest population move in peacetime. People must be calm and not panic,\" Central Macedonia governor Apostolos Tzitzikostas said. \n Among the evacuees were 450 refugees staying at a former factory, who were transported by bus to visit the city's archaeological museum. \n Army bomb disposal experts will attempt to defuse the bomb's detonator, and then transport it to an army firing range, where they will figure out what further steps to take, said army spokesman Col. Nikos Fanios. \n One resident says he recalls the day the bomb fell. \n \"The bombing was done by English and American planes on Sept. 17, 1944. It was Sunday lunchtime,\" said Giorgos Gerasimou, 86, whose home is half a mile away. \n The Allies were targeting local German rail facilities, he said. \n Nazi Germany occupied Greece from 1941 until October 1944. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "75,000 evacuated in Greece so WWII bomb can be defused"}
