{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Seema Verma, left, then President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, gets on an elevator in the lobby of Trump Tower in January in New York. \n CHICAGO >> The businesswoman President Donald Trump selected to oversee Medicaid, the health care program for 74 million low-income Americans, has said the program is structurally flawed by policies that burden states and foster dependency among the poor. \n Seema Verma heads Indianapolis-based SVC Inc., a consulting firm that works with GOP-led states seeking federal leeway in how they spend Medicaid dollars. Her proposed solutions can be seen most dramatically in Indiana, where Medicaid enrollees pay fees and a missed payment means a six-month lockout from the program. A still-pending proposal she developed for Kentucky includes work requirements for most adults. \n Elsewhere, the poorest Medicaid recipients usually don't pay monthly fees, although many states have experimented with fees for certain groups such as working adults with disabilities. \n Democrats in Washington are concerned Verma's methods may become a favored model as Republicans work to repeal the Affordable Care Act, making it harder for non-disabled adults to get access to health care. Underway for two years, the short track record of Indiana's Medicaid expansion leaves questions about whether Verma's ideas have helped poorer Americans or hurt them. \n Indiana and Iowa, which also has a Verma-designed program with monthly fees, expanded coverage while saving taxpayers' money, said Marcus Barlow, a spokesman for SVC. He extolled the results of Verma's programs, pointing to data showing the two states spent less per capita on newly eligible Medicaid enrollees than the national average while keeping uninsured rates below average. \n \"We're proud of the innovative solutions based specifically on each state's needs,\" Barlow said. \n Verma, who faces a Senate Finance Committee hearing Thursday, has been highly critical of Medicaid. \n \"At Medicaid's core is a flawed structure,\" Verma said in 2013 testimony to a congressional subcommittee. States must endure a \"cumbersome\" and \"capricious\" procedure to get approval for innovative ideas, she said, and \"rigid, complex rules\" have created \"an intractable program that does not foster efficiency, quality or personal responsibility.\" \n Federal Medicaid policies limiting copays and premiums, Verma said, \"disempower individuals from taking responsibility for their health, allow utilization of services without regard for the public cost and foster dependency.\" \n In Indiana, Verma worked with then-Gov. Mike Pence, now Trump's vice president, to win federal permission to expand Medicaid, gaining federal dollars under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act while making the program look more like commercial insurance. Financial carrots and sticks are meant to discourage low-income families from overspending on health care. \n \"The only way Gov. Pence was going to pass coverage expansion was through this means,\" said Doug Leonard, president of the Indiana Hospital Association. Hospital fees and a cigarette tax pay the state's portion of the expansion. \n The program, known as the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, requires people to pay $1 to $100 a month, depending on income, for beefed-up coverage that includes dental and vision care. \n A missed payment means losing coverage and a six-month lockout before reapplying. More than 2,600 individuals were locked out in this way during the program's first year. \n Carol Irvin of Mathematica Policy Research, who led Indiana's evaluation of the program's first incarnation from 2009 through 2014, said its financial incentives are misunderstood by those who are supposed to be motivated by them. \n \"They didn't necessarily understand the connection and, we would argue, they didn't understand the incentives,\" Irvin said. A separate evaluation of HIP 2.0's first year showed similar findings. \n Blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented, and it has been difficult for evaluators to survey non-enrollees to find out why some people haven't signed up, Irvin said. \n Many Indiana residents were able to get coverage because of the expansion, although not as many as the state had hoped. Seventy-three percent of the 559,000 projected to be eligible actually enrolled in HIP 2.0 for at least a month during its first year. \n People below the poverty line don't lose their coverage entirely if they miss a payment, but instead are bounced down to a \"HIP Basic\" plan that requires copays and doesn't include dental or vision. \n That's what happened to 54-year-old fast food cook Michael Boone of Gary, Indiana. He missed a few $12-a-month payments and was moved from \"HIP Plus\" \u2014 under which he'd been able to see a dentist for \"the first time in my adult life\" \u2014 to the basic plan. Still, he said he appreciates the coverage and will be back on the \"HIP Plus\" plan soon. \n \"It's been a godsend,\" said Boone, who says he can afford $12 a month. \"I never had health care before.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump nominee has decried Medicaid for fostering dependency"}

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Misspelled words are highlighted in this photograph made in Washington, today, of a Feb. 6, 2017 White House press release on terror attacks. \n WASHINGTON >> Time to make spellcheck great again. \n The mangled spellings that were a staple of Donald Trump's presidential campaign are flourishing in the White House. \n It started on Trump's first full day in office, when he described himself as \"honered\" to serve as the 45th president. \n (Tweeted at 12:02 p.m.; deleted and replaced at 12:11 p.m.) \n This was probably not a typo: Trump had used the same spelling a year earlier, when he tweeted that it was an \"honer\" to win post-debate polls. \n But on to more serious matters, such as foreign affairs. \n Trump's first presidential visit with a foreign leader was with British Prime Minister Theresa May in January. \n The White House schedule twice referred to the British leader as \"Teresa May\" \u2014 who happens to be a British topless model and porn star. \n Vice President Mike Pence's office made the same mistake. \n (To be fair, so did the British Embassy in Washington a month earlier. And the AP itself at times has botched the spelling.) \n This month brought serial spelling malfunctions when the White House released a list of 78 terrorist attacks that it said had been under-reported by the media. \n The list misspelled \"attaker\" 27 times. San Bernardino came out \"San Bernadino.\" Denmark came out \"Denmakr.\" \n Over the weekend, Trump tweeted that he \"playef golf\" with the Japanese prime minister, then quickly deleted and fixed the typo. \n On Monday, a White House release on the president's phone call with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos referred to the country at one point as \"Columbia.\" \n Just nitpicking? Does it really matter? \n \"It really goes to the heart of credibility,\" says Sue Burzynski Bullard, a board member at the American Copy Editors Society and a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. \"If you can't get basic spelling and grammar right, people start to wonder what else you got wrong.\" \n Little details count, she says, pointing out Trump's errant use of a hyphen in a Wednesday morning tweet in which he referred to \"this Russian connection non-sense.\" \n \"Where does that come from?\" she asked. \n Her advice to the Trump White House: \"They need to slow down and edit themselves, or hire some editors.\" \n She does allow that everyone makes the occasional typo and that people \"get a little more license on Twitter.\" \n Other spelling aficionados are less concerned. \n No less an authority than Jacques Bailly, the University of Vermont professor who once a year calls out the words at the Scripps National Spelling Bee, isn't too bothered. \n \"I can't take it very seriously that somebody doesn't know how to spell,\" he says. \n \"Spelling is not unimportant, but there are a lot more important things, like how you use the words and the content of them.\" \n But Bailly also offers this: \"There are ways to correct this, and perhaps that would be a good idea.\" \n Spellcheck would help a lot, he says, adding, \"A lot of these words aren't rocket science.\" \n The White House stressed it has put out nearly 400 press releases, statements and fact sheets as well as many more social media posts, and said it was \"constantly updating processes to ensure we are communicating the president's agenda as articulately as possible.\" \n While its spelling issues were far more limited, the Obama White House had its own bobbles. February came out as \"Feburary\" on a few press schedules in 2015. And President Barack Obama memorably dropped an important \"E\" in praising Aretha Franklin as the queen of soul in 2014: He was talking about her signature song and said that Franklin \"told us what R-S-P-E-C-T meant to her.\" \n The Trump administration's spelling challenges extend beyond the White House. \n The Education Department last week made a double gaffe when it tweeted a quotation from W.E.B. DuBois that spelled the African-American sociologist's last name with an \"E.\" It later updated the post and offered \"apologizes for the earlier typo.\" The mistakes were blamed on a longtime employee. \n The Library of Congress recently posted sales marketing material for an inauguration poster that included a Trump quotation that said, \"No dream is too big, no challenge is to great.\" That should have been \"too great.\" The mistake was attributed to a third-party vendor. \n The administration's outsized share of spelling mistakes shouldn't come as a surprise, given Trump's track record during the campaign and transition. \n In December, he referred to the Chinese seizure of a U.S. Navy drone as \"unpresidented.\" The tweet was deleted and the word corrected to \"unprecedented.\" \n During the presidential campaign, Trump ridiculed GOP rival Marco Rubio as a \"leightweight chocker,\" faulted Ted Cruz for \"L-Y-E-N',\" and tweeted that commentator Lawrence O'Donnell was \"one of the dummer people on television.\" Obama's first name came out as \"Barrack\" in a Trump tweet, famed basketball coach Bobby Knight morphed into \"Bobby Night\" and the city of Phoenix became \"Phoneix.\" \n Perhaps Trump can get some advice from the next winner of the spelling bee: Seven presidents, including Obama, have met with spelling champs. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hey, Mr. President: It's time to make spellcheck great again"}

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Parents leave a staging area in December 2012 after being reunited with their children following a shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where Adam Lanza fatally shot 27 people, including 20 children. \n WASHINGTON >> Congress today sent President Donald Trump legislation blocking an Obama-era rule designed to keep guns out of the hands of certain mentally disabled people. \n On a vote of 57-43, the Senate backed the resolution, just one of several early steps by the Republican-led Congress to undo regulations implemented by former President Barack Obama. The House had passed the measure earlier this year. The White House has signaled Trump will sign the legislation. \n The Obama rule would have prevented an estimated 75,000 people with mental disorders from being able to purchase a firearm. It was crafted as part of Obama's efforts to strengthen the federal background check system in the wake of the 2012 massacre of 20 young students and six staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. \n Adam Lanza, a 20-year-old man with a variety of impairments, including Asperger's syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder, shot and killed his mother at their home, then went to school where he killed the students, adults and himself. He used his mother's guns in the attack. \n The Obama administration rule required the Social Security Administration to send in the names of beneficiaries with mental impairments who also have a third party manage their benefits. \n But lawmakers, with the backing of the National Rifle Association and advocacy groups for the disabled, opposed the regulation and encouraged Congress to undertake a rarely successful parliamentary tool designed to void regulations that Congress takes issue with. \n With a Republican ally in the White House, the GOP has moved aggressively on several fronts to rescind some of the Obama administration's final regulations on the environment, financial reporting and now guns. Under an expedited process established through the Congressional Review Act, a regulation is made invalid when a simple majority of both chambers pass a joint resolution of disapproval and the president signs it. \n The House also voted to repeal three Labor Department regulations today, including a rule that established when states could require drug testing for certain laid-off workers seeking unemployment insurance. Critics seeking the repeal said the department crafted the regulation so narrowly that it undermined congressional intent to give states more leeway to use drug testing in their unemployment insurance programs. \n On the gun rule, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, spearheaded the repeal effort, saying the regulation unfairly stigmatizes the disabled and infringes on their constitutional right to bear arms. He said that the mental disorders covered through the regulation are filled with \"vague characteristics that do not fit into the federal mentally defective standard\" prohibiting someone from buying or owning a gun. \n Grassley cited eating and sleep disorders as examples of illnesses that could allow a beneficiary to be reported to the background check system if they also have a third party to manage their benefits. \n Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he didn't know how he could explain to his constituents, including those in Newtown, that Congress was making it easier rather than harder for people with serious mental illness to have a gun. \n \"If you can't manage your own financial affairs, how can we expect that you're going to be a responsible steward of a dangerous, lethal firearm,\" Murphy said. \n Gun rights groups weren't the only organizations upset about the Obama administration's regulation. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized it, too. The ACLU said the rule advanced a harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, \"a vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent.\" More than a dozen advocacy groups for the disabled also opposed the Obama administration's regulation. \n \"This heartless resolution puts the most vulnerable Americans at risk,\" countered Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. \"Make no mistake, this vote was really about deepening the gun industry's customer pool, at the expense of those in danger of hurting themselves or others.\" \n On the labor rule, Mississippi, Wisconsin and Texas are among the states seeking more flexibility in using drug tests in their unemployment insurance programs. Republicans complained that the Obama administration regulation undercut that flexibility \u2014 and congressional intent. \n \"I am pretty certain that the people who I am privileged to represent would be very upset if they thought somebody was receiving unemployment compensation while they were on drugs, because they think that is going to make it pretty hard for that person to ever get back into the workforce, and they want to be able to identify that,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. \n Democrats argued that Republicans were simply enabling states to intimidate people from seeking unemployment benefits. \n \"The legislation that we are debating today has nothing to do with fighting drug abuse,\" said Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass. \"It's about allowing states to put one more time-consuming, humiliating obstacle in the way of Americans who work hard, and were laid off from their jobs and need unemployment insurance to pay the bills while they look for new jobs.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Congress blocks rule barring mentally impaired from guns"}

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump calls out to the media after escorting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to his car to depart the White House today. \n NEW YORK >> President Donald Trump stepped up his attacks on the \"fake media\" today but the media was fighting back, objecting to a presidential news conference that avoided tough questions and, in the case of one MSNBC program, banning presidential aide Kellyanne Conway from the air. \n Trump tweeted and voiced complaints about the media's treatment of his ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn and the \"criminal\" leak of details on Flynn's discussion with Russians. Flynn is out after less than a month, with White House saying Trump lost confidence in him for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about talks with the Russian ambassador. \n The president held a news conference prior to meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As he did during the past week following meetings with leaders of Canada and Japan, Trump called on reporters from friendly news outlets. \n Today, he chose David Brody, a columnist for the Pat Robertson-founded Christian Broadcast Network, and Katie Pavlich, editor of the conservative web site townhall.com. \n Brody invoked Flynn, asking if the national security job vacancy would affect the administration's attitude toward the U.S. nuclear deal with Iran. Trump used that question to complain about unfair media treatment of Flynn. He blamed people upset with his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton for being responsible for media leaks. \n Pavlich asked Trump about compromises he would seek from Israel and the Palestinians to achieve peace. \n The questions left other reporters frustrated by a lost opportunity to ask about reports that the Trump campaign had been in contact with Russian officials before his election. Trump smiled and walked away when one reporter shouted out if he could ask about Flynn. \n \"I wanted to jump up and say, 'You fired him. Why did you fire him?'\" said ABC News' Jonathan Karl. \n CNN's Jim Acosta said the administration was clearly trying to avoid questions, adding that Trump could \"only be shielded for so long.\" \n Conway, meanwhile, won't be answering questions on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program, at least for a while. Show co-host Mika Brzezinski said today that Conway wouldn't be allowed on the three-hour public affairs program, which has had a love-hate relationship with Trump over the course of the campaign. \n Brzezinski said she won't book Conway, \"because I don't believe in fake news or information that is not true. Every time I've seen her on television, something's askew, off or incorrect.\" \n It's been a rough stretch for the presidential counselor. She said on MSNBC Monday that Trump had \"full confidence\" in Flynn, hours before he lost his job. A government ethics panel urged the White House to discipline her for urging Fox News Channel viewers to buy Ivanka Trump's products. NBC's Matt Lauer admonished her, \"Kellyanne, that makes no sense,\" during a \"Today\" show interview on Tuesday. \n Then there was Kate McKinnon's portrayal of an unhinged Conway on \"Saturday Night Live.\" \n CNN said last week that it had turned down a chance to book her on Jake Tapper's Feb. 5 program because she had credibility issues; Conway has said she told them she was unavailable that day. Tapper then interviewed Conway on his weekday program two days later, although she hasn't been on the network since. The White House has banned its officials from appearing on the network. \n NBC News said Brzezinski's statement reflected the views of one program, not the network as a whole. The decision is potentially confusing for both viewers and NBC executives, said Mark Feldstein, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland. What are viewers to think if a source is deemed not credible enough to be on one show but appears on the same network three hours later? \n While she wasn't on \"Morning Joe,\" she was on NBC News' higher-profile \"Today\" show on Tuesday. \n She's not the only Trump administration official who has clashed with the media over facts. Trump aide Stephen Miller was scolded by an angry George Stephanopoulos on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday for not giving evidence to support a claim of voter fraud. White House press secretary Sean Spicer was criticized after his first White House briefing for giving untrue statements about the inauguration. \n \"Where do you stop?\" Feldstein said. \"Conway isn't the only member of the administration who has a truth-telling problem. It starts at the very top. Can you stop putting Donald Trump on the air if what he says is false? You can't. He's the president of the United States.\" \n CBS News \"Face the Nation\" host John Dickerson, while emphasizing he's not talking about the \"Morning Joe\" decision, said it's important to get the administration's views on the record, whether or not they prove accurate. \n \"Part of my job is allowing the administration to explain itself to people and not interrupt them so much they can't ever get their point of view across,\" Dickerson said. \"They say what they believe, and then you interrogate them.\" \n He said he wished he could ask questions that came with a dose of the truth serum sodium pentothal \"to get the perfect, truth-filled answers, but that is not going to happen.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump criticizes 'fake media' on Flynn story"}

Kim Riley of the Indiana State police announces that two bodies have been found next to Deer Creek Tuesday east of Delphi, Ind. \n DELPHI, Ind. >> Two bodies found along a northern Indiana stream are those of two teenage girls who went missing Monday and their deaths are being investigated as homicides, authorities said today. \n State Police Sgt. Kim Riley said autopsies performed today determined that the bodies are those of Liberty German, 14, and Abigail Williams, 13, both of Delphi. \n Their bodies were found Tuesday afternoon along Deer Creek near Delphi, about 60 miles northwest of Indianapolis. Police said the girls' bodies were about three-quarters of a mile from an abandoned railroad bridge where they were dropped off Monday to go hiking. \n Riley said an FBI team remains at the crime scene collecting evidence. \n Riley said authorities are not yet releasing the girls' cause or manner of deaths, citing the ongoing double homicide investigation. \n \"The investigation is still in its baby steps, so to speak, and we don't want to put that information out yet,\" he said during a news conference in Delphi. \n Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby said authorities do not yet have a suspect or suspects in the girls' slayings. \n Delphi is known for its historic courthouse square and a restored section of the historic Wabash & Erie Canal that offers trips on a replica 19th century canal boat. \n News of the girls' deaths shook the community of 3,000 residents, where the teens were both eighth-graders at Delphi Community Middle School. \n Greg Briles, the superintendent of Delphi Community School Corporation, called their deaths a \"senseless tragedy\" in an afternoon tweet. \"Our worst fears were confirmed today in the senseless loss of our 2 DCMS students,\" he wrote on Twitter. \n Delphi resident Richard Gardiner said today after the police announcement that the girls' killings had left him and other residents stunned. \n \"I've lived around this town for 50-plus years and things like this are happening every day in bigger cities, like Chicago and Indianapolis and what not,\" he told WLFI-TV. \"And in a small community when it happens, everybody goes berserk.\" \n A local publication, the Carroll County Comet, reported in January that German and Williams were both honor roll students in the fall semester. \n German's Facebook page includes several photos of her clowning around with friends, including one from November showing her and another girl flashing the peace sign, prompting one Facebook friend to comment, \"You goofy girls.\" \n Leazenby and Riley urged the public, particularly people who were hiking Monday in the area where the girls went missing, to contact police with any tips they might have to help authorities in the investigation. Authorities also released two photos of a male who was seen on hiking trails around the time the girls were there and asked the public to help identify him so he could be questioned about what he might have seen. \n \"We're going to get to the bottom of this. We feel confident. And we're going to do everything within our resources to reach justice in this situation,\" Leazenby said. \n Riley said the girls' bodies were found in a wooded area about 50 feet from the banks of Deer Creek in an area less than a mile upstream from the railroad bridge that's known locally as the Monon High Bridge. \n He thanked volunteers who helped search the base of the bridge and surrounding trails for the girls, whose bodies were found by one of those volunteers. \n The girls were reported missing Monday evening after they failed to appear at a predetermined meeting place. Riley said a relative of one of the girls dropped them off Monday near the bridge and another relative had agreed to pick them up later. He said the girls went hiking Monday because the school they attended did not have classes that day. \n Riley said the girls planned to hike a local trail, and authorities have received no information suggesting they planned to meet anyone else on that trail. \n He said authorities are urging local residents to use caution, keep track of their children and report anything unusual to authorities while the criminal investigation continues. \n \"There's somebody out there, somewhere. We don't know if it's a person who came in and left, or if it's somebody in the neighborhood,\" Riley said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police: 2 bodies found in Indiana are missing girls"}

And there will be penetrating inquiries from America's watchful rivals like Russia and China, who will be eager to seize on miscues or gaffes for their own advantage. \n Tillerson arrived in Germany late today for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Group of 20 nations. He will be playing defense amid the chaos and turmoil caused by the firing of national security adviser Michael Flynn for misleading officials about his contacts with Russia. \n In Bonn, the Cold War capital of the former West Germany, Tillerson will come face-to-face on Thursday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, a seasoned and wily diplomat who sparred, often successfully, with past U.S. secretaries of state. \n President Donald Trump chose Tillerson for the job in part because of his business experience and relationship with Russia while he was CEO of oil giant Exxon Mobil. His meeting with Lavrov will be a first test of whether that business acumen \u2014 which led to great profits for Exxon and Russian President Vladimir Putin bestowing a friendship award upon him \u2014 can translate into success in a high-stakes diplomatic arena. \n Tillerson has taken a low-key and reserved approach in his first two weeks on the job and declined the opportunity to speak with reporters traveling with him. As America's top diplomat, he has yet to comment publicly on developments with Russia, its alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election or its actions in Syria and Ukraine. \n At his confirmation hearing last month, he voiced conventional concerns about Russia's behavior and said they should be addressed by projecting a forceful and united front. Like others in the administration, he hasn't been specific about how to repair damaged ties or whether doing so might involve lifting U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia after its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. \n U.S. officials accompanying Tillerson said they didn't expect him to stray from well-honed U.S. demands for Russia to abide by commitments it has made, along with appeals for cooperation in areas in which the two nations have common interests. These include the fight against the Islamic State group. \n Nonetheless, the eyes of many will be focused on Tillerson's meeting with Lavrov for clues as to how the Trump administration intends to deal with Russia, particularly given the revelations about Flynn and the various U.S. investigations into Russian activity before the presidential election. \n In Bonn, Tillerson will also meet privately and in small groups with the top diplomats of Britain, Turkey, Italy, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Japan, Argentina and Brazil. One meeting focuses on the worsening situation in Yemen, where a U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition is battling Shiite rebels believed to be supported by Iran. Another concerns Syria's violence. \n Tillerson will be hoping to reassure his European colleagues of the Trump administration's commitment to trans-Atlantic institutions like NATO and the European Union. It's a similar mission to that of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who is in Brussels and will attend a security conference in Munich this weekend. There, Mattis will be joined by Vice President Mike Pence. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's secretary of state on the spot on 1st foreign trip"}

Burke has said every act of abuse by clergy is a \"grave evil.\" But he has also blamed gay clergy for the church's sexual abuse crisis, saying priests \"who were feminized and confused about their own sexual identity\" were the ones who molested children. \n \"Burke hasn't been open about clergy abuse in the past,\" Terence McKiernan, president of BishopAccountability.org, an online resource about priestly sex abuse, said in an email. \n McKiernan said Burke failed to release lists of accused clerics when he was with two American dioceses, and released data from one that seemed to understate the problem. He also said Burke was reluctant \"to compensate victims or provide for their care.\" \n Burke, a top canon lawyer, had headed the Vatican's high court until 2014, when Francis removed him and named him patron of the Knights of Malta religious order. Francis recently sidelined Burke from that position after Burke was involved in the problematic ouster of a senior knight. \n Burke's defense of church doctrine has made him a hero to conservative and traditionalist Catholics upset with Francis' mercy-over-morals priorities.

Stewart advises people to ignore dealer advertising. \"Probably 99 percent of it is misleading,\" he said. \n DETROIT >> If you do your homework, now is the time to practically steal a new sedan from your car dealer. \n For more than a year, sales of cars have been tanking because Americans have gone nuts over SUVs and trucks. As stockpiles of sedans such as the Chevrolet Malibu and Chrysler 200 stretch across car lots, automakers are forced to offer big discounts to move them. \n There are a few steps to finding the best bargain, but it boils down to this: Figure out which cars aren't selling, research discounts and don't buy until the end of the month when dealers are more desperate to sell. \n Brad Korner, general manager of AIS Rebate, an Ann Arbor, Michigan, firm that follows the labyrinth of automaker discounts, equates buying a car cheap with purchasing discounted baked goods. To get the good deal, you have to really look. \"You go into the store and the day-old bakery stuff is on a different shelf,\" he says. \n Be wary of offers that seem too good to be true, like $69 per month payments. Earl Stewart, a North Palm Beach, Florida, Toyota dealer who is critical of other dealers' sales tactics, advises people to ignore dealer advertising. \"Probably 99 percent of it is misleading,\" he says. The low-price deals often are on stripped-down models that the dealer may not even have. They also can include hefty down payments. \n But armed with the right information, you can navigate the new car sales maze and get 20 percent or more off a car's sticker price: \n FIRST: PICK A TARGET, FIND SLOW SELLERS \n For more than a year, many compact, midsize and large cars, gas-electric hybrids, and many lower-level luxury cars haven't sold well. So dealers have big supplies. Because they're paying interest on the cars, they're eager to sell. So figure out the size of car you want. Then look for automaker monthly sales press releases on the internet and find models with big year-over-year declines. The sales figures are released early in the month. To get the best deal, you can't be too picky about color or equipment because you need to buy what's on dealer lots. \n SECOND: LOOK FOR DISCOUNTS ONLINE \n Many websites, including those from the auto companies as well as kbb.com, truecar.com and Edmunds.com, list publicly available discounts called incentives. Say you decide on a midsize car. Sales of the Nissan Altima were off nearly 15 percent in January, so incentives are likely. On its website, Nissan was offering $4,550 off a nicely equipped $25,460 Altima Midnight edition. That's nearly 18 percent off the sticker without haggling! There often are combinations of zero percent financing and cash back. according to Wards Automotive, midsize cars with the biggest inventories include the Chevrolet Malibu, Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Hyundai Sonata and Ford Fusion \u2014 some of the top-selling cars in the U.S. \n THIRD: VISIT DEALERS \n During the first two weeks of the month, go to a few dealers. Confirm the incentives you found online \u2014 then ask for more. Often automakers add deals by region, or they offer rebates if you own a competitor's model or have one of their models. There also are other discounts for being an AAA member, serving in the military or being a recent college graduate. Most sales people, when they find out you've done your homework, will be honest and give you a good price, says Korner. Michelle Krebs, an analyst for Autotrader.com, says at this point, don't mention a trade-in. Work that into the deal later. Don't agree to buy at this time. \n FOURTH: PICK A DEALER, GO BACK LATER \n You'll get an even better price by waiting until the last few days of a month or quarter. First, dealers offer sales people bonuses to meet monthly sales goals. If they are close to the bonus, they'll be more willing to deal. Also, dealers get what are called \"stair step\" incentives from automakers for hitting sales goals. It's big money, so dealers close to their targets are more willing to bargain. \n For a larger dealer, Stewart says hitting stair step goals can mean $250,000 or more, the difference between a monthly profit and loss. General Motors is helping some dealers get rid of 2016 cars by giving up to 20 percent off the sticker. \n Bigger dealers can get higher payments from automakers and sometimes can offer better prices than smaller ones. \n The bottom line is if you go through all these steps and you're a tough negotiator, you can get a well-equipped car for less than the price of a stripped-down SUV. \n Even if you don't move this month, deals on cars probably will go on for a while. \"Until the buying public loses its appetite for SUVs, it's not going to change,\" says Jeff Rogers, general manager of the Williamson Automotive Group in Miami. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Discounts abound on out-of-fashion sedans; land that deal"}

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "LONDON >> Children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder have several brain regions that are slightly smaller than usual, more evidence that the disorder should be considered a neurological condition, a new study says. \n The study, the largest review of ADHD patients' brain scans ever conducted, might also provide clues for developing new treatments. \n \"If you know what region of the brain is involved in ADHD, you could possibly target that part with medication,\" said Martine Hoogman of Radboud University in the Netherlands, the study's lead author. \n ADHD causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, although a given person may not show all those traits. \n Hoogman and colleagues analyzed MRI scans for more than 3,200 people in nine countries aged four to 63, of whom 1,713 who had ADHD. They found that the brains of children with the condition were slightly smaller in five regions, including those that control emotions, voluntary movement and understanding. \n The scientists reviewed one scan per person and found no effect from ADHD medications. \n Hoogman said the findings support previous theories that the brains of people with ADHD may develop more slowly but that those differences are mostly wiped out by the time children grow up. \n \"By the time they become adults, the differences in their brains are not significant anymore,\" she said. The study was paid for by the National Institutes of Health and was published online today in the journal, Lancet Psychiatry. \n Other experts described the findings as interesting but said there wasn't enough information to link the brain differences to behavioral problems seen in people with ADHD. \n \"The study confirms that there are structural differences in the brains of people with ADHD, but it doesn't tell us what they mean,\" said Graham Murray, a lecturer in psychiatry at Cambridge University, who was not part of the research. \n \"Having less brain in several regions sounds bad but it's not as simple as that,\" he said, pointing out that decreased brain matter can sometimes be beneficial \u2014 like in teenagers, when the outer cortex of their developing brains becomes thinner as their intellectual capacity grows. \n \"The brain is very good at adapting,\" Murray said. \"Just because you have less brain volume doesn't condemn the child to not being able to function well.\" \n Jonathan Posner, an associate professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, also said the research should help families with children diagnosed with ADHD. \n \"To have a solid understanding that ADHD really does originate from brain systems and that it causes alterations in the way the brain is structured and functions, is important information for reducing stigma,\" said Posner, who co-authored an accompanying commentary. \"It will hopefully create more empathy for children who have ADHD.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Kids with ADHD have some smaller brain regions than normal"}

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n An engine and part of a wing from the 100th 787 Dreamliner to be built at Boeing of South Carolina's North Charleston, S.C., facility are seen outside the plant last year. \n NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. >> Production workers at Boeing's South Carolina plant voted today not to join the Machinists, maintaining southern reluctance toward unionization. \n Vote totals weren't immediately available. Under NLRB rules, workers must wait a year before another union vote. In a statement, Machinists organizer Mike Evans said the union was disappointed with the vote but vowed to stay in close touch with Boeing workers to figure out next steps. \n \"Ultimately it will be the workers who dictate what happens next,\" Evans said. \"We've been fortunate enough to talk with hundreds of Boeing workers over the past few years. Nearly every one of them, whether they support the union or not, have improvements they want to see at Boeing. Frankly, they deserve better.\" \n The vote among nearly 3,000 workers preceded by two days a visit by President Donald Trump to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner from the aircraft maker's campus. \n If successful, the balloting on whether employees should join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers would have sent a significant message to politicians in the region and Washington that workers here want the same protections and benefits as those in other areas. And, to leaders trying to recruit businesses by promoting their states' lack of union presence, it'd it would have made their jobs more difficult. \n But this most recent test of Southern acceptance of collective bargaining movements was an uphill battle for the union and its backers. The global aviation giant, which came to South Carolina in part because of the state's minuscule union presence, did so with the aid of millions of dollars in state assistance made possible by officials who spoke out frequently and glowingly with anti-union messages. \n \"It is an economic development tool,\" Gov. Nikki Haley, now President Donald Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 2012 address of how she sold companies on coming to the state. \"We'll make the unions understand full well that they are not needed, not wanted and not welcome in the state of South Carolina.\" \n At least that part of the tactic has worked. Only about 52,000 South Carolina workers have union representation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' 2016 figures. Other major manufacturers in the state, including BMW and Michelin, aren't unionized or haven't experienced major campaigns to do so. The Machinists initially petitioned for a vote at Boeing in 2015 but withdrew the request because of what the union called a toxic atmosphere and political interference. \n Another facet of union opposition in this heavily Republican state is political, given the longstanding relationship between organized labor and Democratic politics. Any lenience toward unions could be seen as giving Democrats a toehold here. \n Southern states for decades have recruited manufacturers by promising freedom from the influences of labor unions, which except for some textile mills have been historically rejected by workers as collective action culturally foreign to a South built around family farms, said Jeffrey Hirsch, a law professor who specializes in labor relations at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \n A successful union vote at Boeing would have had a greater regional impact than Volkswagen workers' efforts to unionize in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Anti-union advocates cited VW as an aberration since representatives of one of its key unions in Germany hold seats on the company's board of directors, Hirsch said. \n \"Boeing is very, very different,\" Hirsch said. \"No one will ever accuse Boeing of being pro-union.\" \n Boeing didn't threaten to move its operations abroad if workers unionized, perhaps abstaining from those threats because of its huge South Carolina plant investment and billions of dollars in federal defense contracts the company does not want to risk. \n The union vote also came after Trump blasted Boeing for the cost of building a new Air Force One. \n \"Costs are out of control,\" Trump tweeted in early December. \"Cancel order!\" \n Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump two weeks later. \n Catherine Templeton, South Carolina's former labor director and successful anti-union lawyer, is no stranger to this fight. When Haley picked Templeton to lead South Carolina's labor department, the governor played up Templeton's union-fighting background and saying she needed her help to \"fight the unions\" at Boeing. \n \"They cannot legally deliver higher wages, better benefits or a different working environment. Even if they are promising it, they certainly can't deliver it,\" Templeton said. \n Asked earlier today about the vote, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he didn't feel unions were needed in this state, where Boeing and other companies have been successful, and where, he feels, workers are generally happy. \n \"I think we're doing just fine without a union presence,\" he said. \n In a statement emailed to reporters, Boeing vice president and general manager Joan Robinson-Berry was already looking toward Trump's visit, the first by a sitting president to the company's North Charleston facilities. \n \"It is great to have this vote behind us as we come together to celebrate that event,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Boeing workers maintain South's anti-unionization history"}

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, left, speaks with Turkish Defense Minister Fikri Isik during a meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels today. \n BRUSSELS >> In an ultimatum to America's allies, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told fellow NATO members today to increase military spending by year's end or risk seeing the U.S. curtail its defense support \u2014 a stark threat given Europe's deep unease already over U.S.-Russian relations. \n Echoing President Donald Trump's demands for NATO countries to assume greater self-defense responsibility, Mattis said Washington will \"moderate its commitment\" to the alliance if countries fail to fall in line. He didn't offer details, but the pressure is sure to be felt, particularly by governments in Europe's eastern reaches that feel threatened by Russian expansionism. \n Trump's Russia policy remains a mystery for many of America's closest international partners. As a candidate, the Republican president steered clear of criticizing Moscow for its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he wanted a new era of cooperation between the former Cold War foes. \n But that possibility grew murkier this week as Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, over the retired Army lieutenant general's communications with Russia before Trump took office. The departure of Flynn, who also promoted the idea of working with Moscow, has added to speculation about how the U.S.-Russian relationship might evolve. \n Amid the uncertainty from Washington, the Kremlin may be testing the West's resolve. A U.S. defense official said this week that Russia has deployed a cruise missile in violation of a Cold War-era nuclear arms control treaty. And violence has sporadically re-ignited in eastern Ukraine, where the U.S. and its partners say Moscow continues to back a separatist insurgency. \n \"No longer can the American taxpayer carry a disproportionate share of the defense of Western values,\" Mattis told the alliance's 27 other defense ministers, according to a text of his remarks. \"Americans cannot care more for your children's future security than you do.\" \n The entire alliance seemed to hang on Mattis' every word today. Officials crowded around televisions at the NATO meeting in Brussels to watch the retired general's initial appearance with Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Defense ministers clustered around Mattis as he entered the meeting room. \n Citing danger from Russia, Mattis told the closed meeting of ministers they must adopt a plan this year that sets dates for governments to meet a military funding goal of 2 percent of gross domestic product. He called the funding increase a \"fair demand\" based on the \"political reality\" in Washington, an apparent reference to Trump's past criticism of NATO as \"obsolete\" and his much-touted \"'America First\" mantra. \n Noting the threat posed by the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, Mattis said: \"Some in this alliance have looked away in denial of what is happening.\" \n \"We have failed to fill gaps in our NATO response force or to adapt,\" he added. \n Trump has challenged the alliance to take on a greater share of military costs, even rattling European nations by suggesting the U.S. might not defend allies unwilling to fulfill their financial obligations as NATO members. \n Mattis didn't go that far, and today's focus appeared to be on simply increasing military funding if not fully reaching the target. Many European governments face hostility to more military spending, especially as their slow economic recoveries force belt-tightening elsewhere. \n The United States is by far NATO's most powerful member, spending more on defense than all the others combined. It devoted 3.61 percent of American GDP last year to military spending, according to NATO estimates \u2014 a level that has somewhat tapered off in recent years. \n Germany, by contrast, spent 1.19 percent of its overall budget on defense. Ten countries commit even less, and seven \u2014 including Canada, Italy and Spain \u2014 would have to virtually double military spending to reach the target. Luxembourg would require a fourfold increase to get close. \n Along with the U.S., the other countries that do reach NATO's benchmark for military spending are Britain, Estonia, Poland and debt-ridden Greece. \n British's defense chief, Michael Fallon, said Mattis appeared to welcome a British proposal to create a road map for increased spending. \"An annual increase that we're asking them to commit to would at least demonstrate good faith,\" he said. \n Asked about Mattis' ultimatum, NATO chief Stoltenberg said allies need time to develop plans. Many are already talking about increasing commitments, he said. \n \"This is not the U.S. telling Europe to increase defense spending,\" Stoltenberg said, noting that allies committed three years ago already to increase spending over the next decade. He said: \"I welcome all pressure, all support, to make sure that happens.\" \n Despite the sharpness of his demand, Mattis appeared to recognize Europe's worries and its leaders' desire for clarity on America's commitment to NATO. \n In a brief public statement, made while standing alongside Stoltenberg, Mattis called the alliance \"a fundamental bedrock for the United States and for all the trans-Atlantic community.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pentagon boss to NATO nations: Increase military spending"}

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump greet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara at the White House in Washington today. \n WASHINGTON >> Charting a striking new course for the Middle East, President Donald Trump today withheld clear support for an independent Palestine and declared he could endorse a one-nation solution to the long and deep dispute between Palestinians and Israel. \n The American president, signaling a new era of comity between the U.S. and Israel after rocky relations under President Barack Obama, said he was more interested in an agreement that leads to peace than in any particular path to get there. Standing beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump broke not only with recent U.S. presidents but also distanced the United States from the prevailing position of much of the world. \n While Trump urged Netanyahu to \"hold off\" on Jewish settlement construction in territory the Palestinians claim for their future state, he offered unwavering support for Israel, a pledge he appeared to substantiate with his vague comments about the shape of any agreement. \n While it once appeared that a two-state solution was the \"easier of the two\" options for the Palestinians and Israel, Trump said he'd be open to alternatives. \"I'm looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like,\" he told reporters. \"I can live with either one.\" \n The United States has formally backed the two-state solution as official policy since 2002, when President George W. Bush said in the White House Rose Garden that his vision was \"two states, living side by side in peace and security.\" \n In practice, the U.S. already had embraced the policy informally. President Bill Clinton, who oversaw the Oslo Accords in the 1990s that were envisioned as a stepping stone to Palestinian statehood, said before leaving office that resolution to the conflict required a viable Palestinian state. \n Separately today, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas called on Netanyahu to end settlement building and expressed \"willingness to resume a credible peace process \" Also today, CIA chief Mike Pompeo secretly held talks in the West Bank with Abbas, the first high-level meeting between the Palestinian leader and a Trump administration official, senior Palestinian officials said. The White House wouldn't comment on the meeting \n All serious peace negotiations in recent decades have assumed the emergence of an independent Palestine. The alternatives appear to offer dimmer prospects for peace, given Palestinian demands for statehood. Dozens of countries, including the U.S., reaffirmed their support for a two-state accord at an international conference in Paris last month, before Trump's inauguration. \n In Cairo today, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: \"There is no Plan B to the situation between Palestinians and Israelis but a two-state solution. \u2026 Everything must be done to preserve that possibility.\" \n At one point today, Trump noted the need for compromise in achieving any Mideast peace. Netanyahu interjected: \"Both sides.\" \n On terrorism and other matters, there appeared little daylight between the leaders. \n Echoing language used by Trump over a need to combat \"radical Islamic extremism,\" Netanyahu said that for peace to be sustainable, two \"prerequisites\" must be met: \"Recognition of the Jewish state and Israel's security needs west of the Jordan\" River. \n While a two-state solution would involve Israel ceding occupied territory that is strategically and religiously significant, many in the country believe a single binational state would be even more difficult to maintain. It would mean granting millions of Palestinians citizenship and voting rights, threatening Israel's Jewish majority and its Jewish character. \n Trump's campaign platform made no mention of a Palestinian state, and his inner circle included allies of the West Bank settler movement. A delegation of settlement leaders was invited to Trump's inauguration. \n But after weeks of dancing around the issue of expanded Israeli settlement construction, Trump asked Netanyahu to \"hold back on settlements for a bit.\" \n In recent weeks, Netanyahu has approved construction of more than 6,000 new settler homes in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast War. He also allowed Parliament to pass a law retroactively legalizing some 4,000 settlement homes built on private Palestinian land. \n Still, Netanyahu indicated he was open to some sort of arrangement. \n \"We'll work something out but I'd like to see a deal be made. I think a deal will be made,\" he said. \n And Naftali Bennet, the head of Israel's pro-settler Jewish Home Party, hailed the new atmosphere between Trump and Netanyahu, saying: \"The Palestinian flag was today lowered from the mast and replaced with the Israeli flag.\" \n American presidents have long struck a delicate balance in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, stressing the close U.S. friendship with Israel but also sometimes calling out Israel for actions seen as undermining peace efforts, such as expanding settlements. \n Trump and Netanyahu also were to discuss Iran and the president's campaign pledge to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Today, Trump said that he'd like to see the embassy move and said his administration is studying the issue closely. Palestinians and Arab governments have warned that such a move could be deeply destabilizing. \n After repeatedly clashing with Obama, including over a U.N. Security Council resolution in December condemning Israeli settlements, Netanyahu has seemed relieved by Trump's arrival. He even recounted his personal relationships with members of Trump's family, including son-in-law Jared Kushner, whom Trump has previously described as the man who could mediate a Middle East peace deal. \n \"Can I reveal, Jared, how long we've known you?\" Netanyahu said with a chuckle. \"I've known the president and his family and his team for a long time and there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump charts new Mideast course; maybe no separate Palestine"}

After China controlled 116 synthetic drugs in October 2015, seizures in the United States of compounds on that list plunged. \n \"It's a substantial step in the fight against opioids here in the United States,\" said Russell Baer, a DEA special agent in Washington. \"We're persuaded it will have a definite impact.\" \n China has emerged as an important source country for opioids like carfentanil, which burst into public view last summer when it appeared in the North American drug supply. Dealers cut fentanyls into heroin and other drugs to boost profit margins. \n Beijing has taken a precedent-setting approach to regulation, even controlling chemicals, like fentanyls, that are not widely abused domestically. Chinese drug enforcement authorities have described the synthetic drug threat as a \"world-wide problem\" and urged \"all countries to strengthen the control of new psychoactive substances and work on decreasing demand.\" \n Beijing already regulates fentanyl and 18 related compounds. China said it is also placing carfentanil's less-potent cousins furanyl fentanyl, acryl fentanyl and valeryl fentanyl under control. All are prevalent in the U.S. drug supply, Baer said. The DEA confirmed more than 400 seizures of carfentanil across eight U.S. states from July through October. Ohio was hardest hit. \n In October, The Associated Press identified 12 Chinese companies that offered to export carfentanil around the world for a few thousand dollars a kilogram (2.2. pounds), no questions asked. That same month China began evaluating whether to add carfentanil and the three other fentanyls to its list of controlled substances. Usually, the process can take nine months. This time, it took just four. \n Both the DEA and U.S. State Department have pressed China to make carfentanil a controlled substance. Though Beijing has said U.S. assertions that China is the top source of fentanyls lack evidence, the two countries have been deepening cooperation as the U.S. opioid epidemic intensifies. \n U.S. opioid demand is driving the proliferation of a new class of deadly synthetic drugs, made by nimble chemists to stay one step ahead of new rules like this one. As soon as one substance is banned, others proliferate. After Beijing tightened its focus on fentanyls late last year, the AP documented how Chinese vendors began to actively market alternative opioids , like U-47700. \n \"We don't think their scheduling actions will end with just these four,\" Baer said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "China carfentanil ban a 'game-changer' for opioid epidemic"}

Herzog is supporting a bill to allow adults who have a terminal illness to get a prescription for medication to end their lives. \n As a stage-four prostate cancer patient, Joe Herzog has been considering how he might die and knows he could face intractable vomiting and starvation in the final days or weeks of his life. \n As a retired veterinarian, Herzog believes he should have the same right that pet owners have to enable their feline and canine companions to die peacefully at home with medication. \n Herzog, 57, was one of dozens of people to testify Wednesday at a hearing on a bill that would allow adult Hawaii residents who have a terminal illness to get a prescription for medication to end their lives. \n \"I've had a good life. I don't want to have a nasty death,\" Herzog said. \n The Hawaii bill, which would allow the medication for people with a confirmed prognosis of six or fewer months to live, was modeled after a law in Oregon. To get the prescription, a patient would have to make an oral and written request. \n Five states \u2014 California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont and Washington \u2014 have laws to allow physician-assisted suicide, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. \n Opponents say people don't have a choice about being born, so they shouldn't have a choice about ending their lives. They also say ill patients may feel pressured to end their lives rather than be a burden to family. \n Jack James, a cancer survivor, said he was undergoing around-the-clock chemotherapy, in constant pain and had lost 96 pounds in about a month when doctors told him they didn't think he would make it through the night. \n \"I fought for life,\" James said. \"I don't want this bill to put the flame of a life in people like me potentially out.\" \n In the emotional and sometimes philosophical hearing, many bill supporters shared stories about watching parents or loved ones drop to weights as low as 45 pounds or unsuccessfully attempt suicide while waiting for the inevitable. \n Malakai Grange, a nurse, talked about treating a 25-year-old dying from AIDS who had unsuccessfully tried to end his own life. \n \"His dignity and his autonomy had been totally lost,\" Grange said. \"He was dying in bed, no control over his bodily functions, he had a few people who were helping him as well as hospice, however his condition had progressed to the point where there was no relief.\" \n The Senate Committee on Commerce, Consumer Protection and Health unanimously passed the bill Wednesday. It goes next to the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n \"I've always thought this was a choice I wanted for myself,\" said Sen. Rosalyn Baker, committee chairwoman. \"I've seen too many of my friends with advanced stages in cancer waste away when they really wanted to be able to have that final control.

The number of hate groups overall tracked by the watchdog group also increased to 917 last year from 892 the previous year, the report said. \n \"2016 was an unprecedented year for hate,\" said Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center. \n The report blamed the increase in part on \"incendiary rhetoric\" from the campaign of now-President Donald Trump, which included threats to ban Muslim immigrants and \"mandate a registry of Muslims in America.\" It also cited as factors \"the unrelenting propaganda of a growing circle of well-paid ideologues\" \u2014 well-paid employees of anti-Muslim groups, the group said \u2014 and radical Islamist attacks such as the June 2016 massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. \n The SPLC's findings come as anti-Muslim posters were discovered this week at a mosque in Bossier City, Louisiana, and on the campuses of the University of Texas and Rutgers University. \n The Council on American-Islamic Relations wants campus officials to assure the safety of Muslim students and to investigate the mosque posters as a hate crime. \"It is clear that these signs, which were used to vandalize a house of worship, are part of a nationwide campaign by racists and Islamophobes to intimidate the American Muslim community,\" spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said. \n The Southern Poverty Law Center, a non-profit organization based in Montgomery, Alabama, monitors the activities of hate groups and other extremists across the country. The SPLC defines hate groups as those that vilify entire groups of people based on immutable characteristics such as race or ethnicity. \n \"Patriot\" or anti-government groups are on the downswing, according to the report. \"The groups had skyrocketed from a low of 149 in 2008 to a high of 1,360 in 2012, in large part as a reaction to the November 2008 election of Barack Obama,\" the report said. \n But now the number of Patriot groups is falling, dropping from 998 in 2015 to 623 last year. Militias, which the report called the \"armed wing of the Patriot movement,\" also fell from 276 to 165 groups. \n Black separatist groups grew from 180 in 2015 to 193 last year, as did neo-Confederate groups, which rose from 35 to 43 groups. \n The number of Ku Klux Klan groups fell from 190 in 2015 to 130 in 2016.

According to two senior Malaysian government officials, the elder Kim died en route to a hospital on Monday after suddenly falling ill at the budget terminal of Kuala Lumpur International Airport. \n KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia >> Malaysian authorities announced two more arrests Thursday in the death of the North Korean leader's half brother, whose apparent assassination this week unleashed a wave of speculation and intrigue: a pair of female assailants, a broad-daylight killing and a dictator-sibling out for blood. \n Investigators were still piecing together details of the case, including the widespread assumption that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un dispatched a hit squad to kill his estranged half-brother, Kim Jong Nam. Known for his love of gambling and casinos, Kim Jong Nam had lived abroad for years, aware he was a hunted man. \n Three suspects \u2014 two women and a man \u2014 were arrested separately Wednesday and Thursday. The women were identified using surveillance videos from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, where Kim Jong Nam, who was 45 or 46, suddenly fell ill Monday morning. \n Malaysian officials said he died on the way to a hospital after telling medical workers at the airport that he had been sprayed with a chemical. \n Multiple South Korean media reports, citing unidentified sources, said two women believed to be North Korean agents killed him with some kind of poison before fleeing in a taxi. \n One of the female suspects had Vietnamese travel documents and was picked up Wednesday at the budget terminal of the airport, the same place where the attack took place. The other woman held an Indonesian passport and was arrested early Thursday. \n Indonesian diplomats met with that suspect and confirmed she is an Indonesian citizen, officials said. Authorities identified her as Siti Aisyah, 25, originally from Serang in Banten, a province that neighbors the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. \n Indonesian Immigration Office spokesman Agung Sampurno said officials from the Indonesian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur met with the woman in Selangor state, where she is being held, and ensured she was safe. \n \"They were allowed to see her but cannot make any questions,\" said Sampurno. \"However, the team can confirm that Aisyah is Indonesian.\" \n News of the third arrest came Thursday afternoon. Police said they had detained a Malaysian man who was believed to be the boyfriend of the Indonesian suspect. \n Medical workers also completed an autopsy on Kim Jong Nam, but the results have not been released. The findings could reveal whether he was actually poisoned. \n North Korea had objected to the autopsy but Malaysia went ahead with it anyway because the North did not submit a formal protest, said Abdul Samah Mat, a senior Malaysian police official. \n On Thursday, Malaysian Deputy Home Minister Zahid Hamidi said security is a top priority for the government and the authorities had acted swiftly and efficiently. \n Asked at a news conference why Malaysia failed to protect Kim Jong Nam, Zahid said: \"What do you mean? Do we have to engage a bodyguard and usher him everywhere? No.\" \n Kim Jong Nam was estranged from his younger half-brother, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and had been living abroad for years. He reportedly fell out of favor when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. \n Kim Jong Nam was the son of Kim Jong Il, North Korea's second leader, and Sung Hye Rim, an actress who analysts say was forced to divorce her first husband to live in secret with the future leader in 1970, a year before their son was born. \n He was reportedly educated in Geneva and Moscow in his early teens and became fluent in English, French and Russian. After Kim Jong Il's death in 2011, Kim Jong Nam complained that Kim Jong Un, the country's new leader, was failing to treat him with respect and send him enough money, according to Cheong Seong-Chang, an analyst at South Korea's Sejong Institute. \n However, Kim Jong Nam refrained from openly criticizing the North and kept a low profile after Kim Jong Un executed his uncle and former protector Jang Song Thaek, once considered the country's second-most powerful person, in 2013. \n Since taking power, Kim Jong Un has executed or purged a number of high-level government officials. \n The National Intelligence Service said North Korea had been trying for five years to kill Kim Jong Nam, and that he had sent a letter to Kim Jong Un in April 2012, begging for the lives of himself and his family. \n Officials from South Korea's spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, told lawmakers that Kim Jong Nam leaves behind two sons and a daughter with two women living in Beijing and Macau. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Malaysia arrests 2 women, 1 man in N.

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Jarrett Adams stands outside the Dane County Courthouse in Madison, Wis. \n MADISON, Wis. >> Jarrett Adams was 17 years old in September 1998 when he made a decision he would regret for the rest of his life. \n He and two friends decided to road trip from Illinois to Wisconsin for a night of partying. The outing ended with a student accusing all three of them of raping her. Adams was sentenced to nearly three decades in prison. \n Others in Adams' situation might have withered away in despair or been consumed by rage, but Adams kept fighting. With the help of the Wisconsin Innocence Project, he eventually walked free. \n Adams, now 36, is one of nearly 200 people the Innocence Project has freed since it was founded in 1992 \u2014 and one of only three exonerees who have become lawyers. \n He made his first appearance in a Wisconsin courtroom as a litigator on Tuesday, arguing that a man locked up since 1990 for sexual assault deserves a new trial. The symmetry isn't lost on Adams. \n \"I see how one Christmas can turn into five or six,\" Adams said. \"I see how when you have evidence of innocence, it is immediately doubted and you are up against a slow, long climb to even just get the evidence heard.\" \n Adams, Dimitri Henley and Rovaughn Hill, all from Chicago, drove to the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater on Sept. 5, 1998, for a party. An 18-year-old freshman told police the three men gang-raped her in her dorm room that night. The men countered that the sex was consensual but prosecutors charged them with multiple counts of sexual assault. \n Prosecutors dropped charges against Hill after dorm resident Shawn Demain testified during Hill's trial that Hill was playing video games in his room while the other two men were in the woman's room, according to court documents. Adams said in an interview it was actually him, not Hill, who stayed behind in Demain's room. Regardless, Demain's testimony cast doubt on the woman's story that the three men came to her room together. Even more problematic for prosecutors, Demain said he saw the men smoking with the woman later that night. \n But Henley and Adams' attorneys never called Demain to testify. Henley was sentenced to 20 years in prison, Adams to 28 years. \n Adams said in an interview that he and Henley had no chance because they were poor and black. \n \"The only thing of color in that courtroom was the judge's robe, the lawyers' suits and us,\" he said. \"It wasn't about the truth.\" \n He had been in prison for about a year and had accepted his fate when his cellmate read his case transcripts and told him the charges against him were flimsy. Spurred by the worry lines and wrinkles he noticed on his mother's face during visits, Adams buried his head in law books seven days a week. The more he learned, the more he was convinced that he deserved a new trial because his attorney hadn't called Demain to the stand. \n He asked the Wisconsin Innocence Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for help. Director Keith Findley, a law professor at the school, said he thought Adams' case was a loser. But his students convinced him to take Adams on. \n Findley discovered he had more than a client. He had a partner. \n \"It was very obvious from early on that Jarrett is smart and perceptive,\" Findley said. \"When we met with him, he had a presence. He would debate with us as a colleague.\" \n Together, they won a ruling from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Adams' attorney was ineffective. Prosecutors dismissed the charges, and Adams walked free in 2007. He was 27, living with his mother with no identification, no credit cards and no insurance. \n He saw how the Innocence Project was working to help the wrongfully convicted and decided he wanted to change a system he says is tilted against blacks. He landed a full-time job as an investigator with the federal defender's office in Chicago and put himself through college, earning a bachelor's degree and then a law degree from Loyola Law School in 2015. He juggled homework in the morning, a nine-to-five job and class at night. \n Whenever he wanted to quit he remembered his mother, Adams said. Getting his law degree was a way of paying her back for supporting him when he was in prison, he said. \n \"I derive my strength from her,\" he said. \"Although this seems like an amazing, impossible feat, it was done. And I'm real. I'm not magic. So it can be repeated with the determination and the will to do it.\" \n He joined the New York Innocence Project in 2016. Now he's trying to win a new trial for Richard Beranek, a Wisconsin man convicted of rape in 1990. \n Adams and Findley are working the case together. They contend witnesses put Beranek in North Dakota the day of the crime and new DNA tests show he wasn't the attacker. They planned to present their evidence to a Madison judge during a three-day hearing this week \u2014 a proceeding that puts Adams back in a Wisconsin courtroom for the first time since his own conviction. \n \"I could have got out, became an attorney and ran off into the sunset in a quest of resources and money to live the way that I wanted to live,\" Adams said. \"But I owe a duty and a responsibility to what I see that is going on.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Freed by Innocence Project, ex-inmate takes up cause"}

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "BISMARCK, N.D. >> Federal and state officials announced plans Wednesday to accelerate cleanup at a camp in southern North Dakota that has housed hundreds and sometimes thousands of Dakota Access pipeline opponents. \n Officials fear the camp near the Cannonball River will soon flood due to warm weather and rapid snowmelt. They worry trash and debris left behind by people who have left in recent weeks might pollute the Missouri River and other nearby waterways. \n \"With the amount of people that have been out there and the amount of estimated waste and trash out there, there is a good chance it will end up in the river if it is not cleaned up,\" Corps spokesman Capt. Ryan Hignight said. \n Local and federal officials estimate there's enough trash and debris in the camp to fill about 2,500 pickup trucks. Garbage ranges from trash to building debris to human waste, according to Morton County Emergency Manager Tom Doering. \n The camp on federal land near the pipeline route has dwindled to a few hundred people as the battle over the $3.8 billion project to move North Dakota oil to Illinois has largely moved into the courts. The Standing Rock Sioux and others believe a pipeline leak under the Missouri River would contaminate water for millions of people. Developer Energy Transfer Partners says the pipeline is safe. \n The tribe has asked protesters to leave the area, and has been coordinating cleanup at the camp since late last month. Chairman Dave Archambault said at the time it was being funded from $6 million in donations the tribe received to support its pipeline fight. \n Gov. Doug Burgum, State Engineer Garland Eberle and state Environmental Health Chief Dave Glatt on Tuesday issued a statement pushing for an accelerated cleanup. \n \"We're really fighting the clock,\" Doering said Wednesday. \"There's more garbage down there than anybody anticipated.\" \n Corps officials and a contractor will travel to the site later this week to assess the situation, though actual cleanup work won't happen until the area is deemed safe for workers, Hignight said. The camp area has seen frequent and sometimes violent clashes between protesters and police. \n North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said the state could start lining up additional contractors as early as Thursday. Who would pay the cost could be decided later, he said. \n \"I don't want to sit around and argue about who's going to pay for it while we've got buildings floating down the Missouri River,\" he said. \n Doering said local authorities are hoping for a presidential disaster declaration to open up the prospect of federal aid. \n The Corps said earlier this month it will close the camp Feb. 22 \u2014 next Wednesday \u2014 to get people out of harm's way and safeguard the environment. Burgum on Wednesday issued an evacuation order to complement the Corps deadline, though he said arresting people would be a last resort. \n Hignight said the Corps was still working out details about how the shutdown would be handled. Once it's accomplished, crews will \"clean up the land to a pre-protest state,\" he said. \n The effort will be funded through the Corps budget, meaning taxpayers ultimately will foot the bill. \n ", "author": "Associated Press Federal and state officials announced plans Wednesday to accelerate cleanup at a camp in southern North Dakota that has housed hundreds and sometimes thousands of Dakota Access pipeline opponents.", "title": "State, feds address cleanup at oil pipeline protest camp"}

Up to 15 helicopters, and over a 100 firefighters have been battling two massive wildfires that have burnt over 700 hectares since erupting on Monday evening. \n WELLINGTON, New Zealand >> Firefighters were battling flames in the hill suburbs of New Zealand's second-largest city Thursday after a wildfire burned down 11 homes and forced hundreds of people to evacuate. \n An increase in humidity was helping efforts although strong winds were also fanning the flames of the wildfire, which was spread over 1,800 hectares (4,400 acres) in Christchurch's Port Hills. A helicopter pilot who was a decorated soldier died in a crash while fighting the blaze Tuesday. \n The mayors of Christchurch City and the adjacent Selwyn District declared a state of emergency Wednesday. Selwyn Mayor Sam Broughton said changing winds had made the fires unpredictable. \n He said the region had been unusually dry for three years and the grass in the hills had turned brown over the Southern Hemisphere summer. \n Smoke and ash were being blown across Christchurch. Broughton said displaced residents were staying at evacuation centers or with relatives. \n \"They need to look after one another, and make sure they have a place to go,\" he said. \n Phil Claude told Radio New Zealand he and his family ran down a grass track to escape the fire, which destroyed their home. \n \"I could see that the smoke and the flames were being blown right up toward our house,\" he said. \"And I just yelled 'Get out.

Washington restaurateur John Andrade said he would close his businesses Thursday, and David Suro, owner of Tequilas Restaurant in Philadelphia and a Mexican immigrant, said he also planned to participate. \n The Davis Museum at Wellesley College in Massachusetts said it would remove or shroud all artwork created or given by immigrants to the museum through Feb. 21. \n In New Mexico, the state with the largest percentage of Hispanic residents in the nation, school officials worried that hundreds of students may stay home on Wednesday. \n \"We respectfully ask all parents to acknowledge that students need to be in class every day to benefit from the education they are guaranteed and to avoid falling behind in school and life,\" principals with the Albuquerque Public Schools wrote in a letter to parents. \n Students who take part in the protest will receive an unexcused absence, Albuquerque school officials said. \n Organizers in Philadelphia said they expect hundreds of workers and families to participate. \n \"Our goal is to highlight the need for Philadelphia to expand policies that stop criminalizing communities of color,\" said Erika Almiron, executive director of Juntos, a nonprofit group that works with the Latino immigrant community. \"What would happen if massive raids did happen?

The bold policy moves that marked Trump's first days in office have slowed to a crawl, a tacit admission that he and his team had not thoroughly prepared an agenda. \n Five days after the administration's signature travel ban was struck down by a federal court, the White House is still struggling to regroup and outline its next move on that signature issue. It's been six days since Trump \u2014 who promised unprecedented levels of immediate action \u2014 has announced a major new policy directive or legislative plan. \n His team is riven by division and plagued by distractions. This week alone, controversy has forced out both his top national security aide and his pick for labor secretary. \n \"Another day in paradise,\" Trump quipped Wednesday after his meeting with retailers was interrupted by reporters' questions about links between his campaign staff and Russian officials. \n Fellow Republicans have begun voicing their frustration and open anxiety that the Trump White House will derail their high hopes for legislative action. \n Sen. John Thune of South Dakota on Wednesday demanded that the White House \"get past the launch stage.\" \n \"There are things we want to get done here, and we want to have a clear-eyed focus on our agenda, and this constant disruption and drumbeat with these questions that keep being raised is a distraction,\" said Thune. \n Sen. John McCain of Arizona blasted the White House's approach to national security as \"dysfunctional,\" asking, \"Who is in charge? I don't know of anyone outside of the White House who knows.\" \n Such criticism from allies is rare during what is often viewed as honeymoon period for a new president. But Trump, an outsider who campaigned almost as much against his party as for it, has only a tiny reservoir of good will to protect him. His administration has made uneven attempts to work closely with lawmakers and its own agencies. \n Officials have begun trying to change some tactics, and some scenery, with the hope of steadying the ship. The White House announced Wednesday that Trump would hold a campaign-style rally in Florida on Saturday, the first of his term. The president has often mentioned how much he loves adoring crowds and affirmation from his supporters. \n To be sure, pinballing from one crisis to the next is not unprecedented, particularly for a White House still finding its footing. But the disruptions that have swirled around Trump achieved hurricane force early and have not let up. \n On Wednesday as his choice for labor secretary, fast food CEO Andy Puzder, withdrew his nomination while the administration continued to navigate the fallout from the forced resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn was ousted on the grounds that he misled the vice president about his contacts with a Russian ambassador. \n Flynn's departure marked the return of an issue Trump is not likely to move past quickly. The president's relationship with Moscow will continue to be scrutinized and investigated, sometimes apparently fueled by leaks from within his own administration. \n Trump on Wednesday blasted what he called \"illegal leaked\" information. \n Not just leaks, but also legal woes, have derailed Trump's early efforts. \n After the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected his immigration ban last week, Trump emphatically tweeted \"SEE YOU IN COURT!\" and the administration vowed that it would re-appeal the block and either revise its original executive order or write a new one from scratch. \n But confusion soon followed. After first indicating they would not take a temporary restraining order to the Supreme Court, administration staffers squabbled audibly, behind closed doors, over the accounts emerging in news reports. \n When the dust settled, a new statement was printed out and handed to journalists, stating, \"to clarify,\" that all options were on the table. But, despite Trump's vow to have a plan in place by Tuesday, one has not emerged. \n The collapse of the ban, which poured fuel on simmering staff rivalries, was followed by a period of stark inaction by a White House suddenly put on the defensive. Trump did sign legislation Tuesday that rolled back a financial regulation, but his administration has not issued any executive orders in days. \n House Republicans have been nudging the White House to get behind Speaker Paul Ryan's tax overhaul, which includes a border adjustability plan of which Trump has been skeptical. GOP aides believed they were making progress, but the matter has been overshadowed by the flood of controversies. \n Other possible executive actions have been bandied about, from a task force on allegations of voter fraud to steps to strengthen cybersecurity, but have yet to be released. Key legislative items such as a massive plan to rebuild roads and bridges and an overhaul of the tax law remain works in progress. \n \"He's a one-man band for all practical purposes, it's how he ran his business,\" said Bill Daley, a former White House chief of staff under Obama. \"When you try to take that and everything revolves around that and he is the beginning, middle and end of everything, that is a tough model. His campaign was the same way.\" \n Trump's new administration has also been plagued by ethics brushfires that are taking up the time and energy of communications and legal staff members. \n In one incident that sparked bipartisan condemnation and calls for ethics investigations, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said on TV that people should \"go buy Ivanka's stuff\" \u2014 an endorsement that came after the president disparaged Nordstrom for dropping his daughter's fashion line. And congressional Republicans also are demanding to know more about the security measures in place at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's weekend White House, where resort members photographed him during a dinnertime national security strategy session after North Korea launched a missile. \n \"When you are the White House, every day is a crisis. Crisis is routine,\" said Ari Fleischer, who was President George W. Bush's first press secretary. \"But when they all come right on top of each other, particularly at the start of an administration, it starts to create the feeling that they don't know how to run the place.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "A crush of crises all but buries the young Trump White House"}

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "DETROIT >> A Michigan county's tradition of Christian-only prayers at public meetings violates the U.S. Constitution by promoting one faith over others, a federal appeals court ruled Wednesday. \n In a 2-1 decision, the court ruled in favor of a resident who was offended after he began attending Jackson County Board of Commissioners meetings in 2013 to discuss environmental issues. One commissioner called Peter Bormuth a \"nitwit,\" and his lawsuit was panned as an attack on Jesus Christ. \n The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said prayer invocations at public meetings can be legal. But in Jackson County, the court noted that only commissioners offered a prayer, not audience members, and the prayer was always Christian, not from other faiths. \n \"There is no distinction between the government and the prayer-giver: They are one and the same. The prayers, in Bormuth's words, are literally 'government speech,'\" said judges Karen Nelson Moore and Jane Branstetter Stranch. \n They said the exclusion of non-Christian prayers puts Christianity \"in a privileged position\" and \"advances one faith over others.\" \n The court reversed a decision by U.S. District Judge Marianne Battani in Detroit, who said Bormuth was being \"hypersensitive.\" \n \"I'm very pleased. I can't wait to read the decision,\" said Bormuth, 61, a non-lawyer who has represented himself during more than three years of litigation. \"One of the greatest gifts we were given by our Founding Fathers was the separation of church and state and religious freedom.\" \n In his lawsuit, Bormuth, a pagan, said he felt compelled to stand and participate in religion in order to speak to elected officials at meetings. He believes his criticism likely cost him appointments on a county solid waste committee and a public works board. \n James \"Steve\" Shotwell Jr., chairman of the county board, declined to comment on the decision. County Administrator Mike Overton said an invocation is offered at monthly meetings. \n \"Each commissioner does whatever they feel is appropriate,\" he said. \"I haven't seen anything other than a Christian prayer or a moment of silence. We aren't trying to proselytize or anything like that.\" \n In dissent, Judge Richard Griffin said the court's majority opinion misapplied U.S. Supreme Court decisions on public prayer.

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington. The Trump administration tooksteps intended to help calm jittery insurance companies and make tax compliance with former President Barack Obama's health law less burdensome for some people. \n WASHINGTON >> The Trump administration took steps Wednesday intended to calm jittery insurance companies and make tax compliance with former President Barack Obama's health law less burdensome for some people. \n But the changes could lead to policies with higher annual deductibles, according to the administration's own proposal. That seems to undercut President Donald Trump's assurance in a recent Washington Post interview that his plan would mean \"lower numbers, much lower deductibles.\" \n The moves announced separately by the Health and Human Services Department and the IRS don't amount to sweeping changes to the Affordable Care Act. That would fall to Congress, where Republicans are struggling to reach consensus over how to deliver on their promise to repeal and replace the health law. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is expected to present elements of a plan to GOP lawmakers Thursday morning. \n But the administration actions do signal a change in direction. Recently confirmed HHS Secretary Tom Price called them \"initial steps in advance of a broader effort to reverse the harmful effects of Obamacare.\" Premiums are up sharply this year, while many communities were left with just one insurer. \n For consumers, the proposed HHS rules mean tighter scrutiny of anyone trying to sign up for coverage outside of open enrollment by claiming a \"special enrollment period\" due to a change in life circumstances such as the birth of a child, marriage, or the loss of job-based insurance. Also, sign-up season will be 45 days, shortened from three months currently. \n For insurers, the curbs on special enrollments are a big item. The industry claimed that some consumers were gaming the system by signing up when they needed expensive treatments, only to drop out later. \n Insurers would also gain more flexibility to design low-premium plans tailored to younger people. But that flexibility could lead to higher deductibles, according to HHS. \n \"The proposed change \u2026 could reduce the value of coverage for consumers,\" the administration proposal said. \"However, in the longer run, providing (insurers) with additional flexibility could help stabilize premiums.\" \n Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation said \"this would allow insurers to offer plans with higher deductibles, which seems counter to President's Trump promise to lower deductibles.\" A deductible is the annual amount consumers pay for medical care before their insurance kicks in. \n Democrats said the HHS changes would undermine consumer protections and make more people uninsured. Some called the move \"sabotage.\" \n Separately, the IRS said it's backing off from a tighter approach to enforcement that was in the works for this tax-filing season. The IRS said that's in line with Trump's executive order directing agencies to ease requirements of the health law. \n Under the law, people are required to have health coverage or risk fines from the IRS \u2014 an unpopular provision. That underlying requirement remains on the books, and taxpayers are still legally obligated to comply, the IRS said. \n But the agency is changing its approach to enforcement. Originally, the IRS had planned to start rejecting returns this year if a taxpayer failed to indicate whether he or she had coverage. Now the IRS says it will keep processing such returns, as it has in the past. \n Administration officials said the HHS rules will help to stabilize the individual health insurance market for next year. That could buy time for Congress to make bigger changes. \n The industry group America's Health Insurance Plans commended the administration, but said more is needed. In particular, insurers want Trump and Congress to remove a legal cloud over billions of dollars in subsidies that the companies are obligated to pay to cover deductibles and copayments for low-income people. \n It remained unclear if insurers would be swayed. Only Tuesday, Humana announced it will not participate in next year in the government-run marketplaces, where insurer exits have already diminished consumer choice. \n \"I don't necessarily think these changes are enough to alter insurers' decision-making about staying in the markets,\" said Caroline Pearson of the consulting firm Avalere Health. \n Pearson said consumer reviews may also be mixed. Healthy people may appreciate more affordable premiums. But people with health problems could see an erosion in coverage. \n Separately, a government report Wednesday said the nation's problem with rising health care spending is back and here to stay, regardless of what happens to the Obama health law. \n Nonpartisan experts at HHS said health care spending will claim a growing share of national resources for the foreseeable future. \n Health care will grow at an annual average of 5.6 percent from 2016-2025, outpacing expected economic growth. Now $3.5 trillion, the nation's health care tab will increase to nearly $5.5 trillion in 2025, accounting for about one-fifth of the economy. \n The unwelcome trend is due to fundamentals such as rising prices for treatments and services, as well as an aging population. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Murphy reported from Indianapolis. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump administration ushers in changes to Obama health law"}

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Medina, Friday, at his father's home, even though he has a work permit under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \n SEATTLE >> Immigration activists and some U.S. lawmakers today called for the immediate release of a Seattle-area man who was detained last week despite his participation in a federal program to protect those brought to the U.S. illegally as children. \n Lawyers for Daniel Ramirez Medina, 23, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested him last Friday morning when they went to his father's house in Seattle to arrest the father. \n Ramirez, who is Mexican, twice passed background checks as part of President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, most recently for a two-year renewal issued last May, his lawyers said in court documents. \n ICE has said Ramirez admitted to the agents that he was a gang member and was arrested as a threat to public safety. But his lawyers and sympathetic lawmakers insisted today has no criminal record, held down a job and is the father of a young child who is a U.S. citizen. \n \"Immigration authorities have no reason and no right to hold someone who has been granted deferred action, holds a valid work permit, and is an asset to his family and his community,\" said U.S. Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, a Democrat from Illinois, in a statement. \"Just let him go.\" \n Unanswered questions about the case include why Ramirez was detained while his brother, also a participant in the program and also present at the house during the arrest, was not, according to Ramirez's lawyers. \n The DACA program \u2014 referred to as \"Dreamers\" by supporters and derided as \"illegal amnesty\" by critics \u2014 has protected about 750,000 immigrants. It allows young people who were brought into the country illegally as children to stay and obtain work permits. \n Ramirez was still being held today at an immigration detention center in Tacoma, said Lara Bergthold, a spokeswoman for his lawyers. \n A federal magistrate has ordered the government to provide details about the case and whether he had been placed in deportation proceedings. ICE spokeswoman Rose Richeson today said she could provide no new information. \n President Donald Trump made illegal immigration a cornerstone of his campaign, saying he will build a wall along the Mexican border and deport millions of people, although actual plans have yet to be revealed. But he has also said he wants to focus on people who have committed crimes. \n During an interview with Time magazine late last year, Trump expressed sympathy for those in the DACA program. \n \"We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud,\" he told the magazine. \n The program is considered an exercise in prosecutorial discretion by the Department of Homeland Security, which warns on its website that \"deferred action may be terminated at any time, with or without a Notice of Intent to Terminate, at DHS's discretion.\" Gang membership or criminal activity is considered grounds for denial of DACA status. \n But Ramirez's legal team argued in a petition to U.S. District Court in Seattle seeking his release that the government's discretion is limited to the rules governing the DACA program. Ramirez's arrest violated his constitutional right to due process and to be free from unlawful seizure, the lawyers argued. \n \"Mr. Ramirez relied on DHS's promise that, so long as he continued to meet the criteria established by DACA, any immigration action against him would be deferred,\" they wrote. \"As such, his detention is an indefensible sort of entrapment.\" \n Greisa Martinez, advocacy director for United We Dream immigrant support group and herself a DACA participant, told reporters that any suggestion Ramirez posed a public safety risk was \"a lie.\" \n Medina had no criminal record, is the father of a 3-year-old, and spent thousands of dollars to maintain his DACA status, she said. \n Matt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, said Ramirez was brought to the U.S. from Mexico when he was 7 and that he has a job. \n He speculated Ramirez's arrest was a mistake. \n \"I don't think this has to do with any change in policy. I just think it was an enforcement procedure gone wrong,\" Adams said. \"Hopefully they're going to come to their senses.\" \n Associated Press reporters Chris Grygiel in Seattle and Amy Taxin in Los Angeles contributed. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lawmakers, activists call for release of Seattle 'dreamer'"}

Forecasters said the first two storms could drop a total of 5 inches of rain in higher elevation. \n However, the third storm, starting as early as Monday, could be more powerful. \n \"There a potential for several inches,\" National Weather Service forecaster Tom Dang said. \"It will be very wet.\" \n Nonetheless, California Department of Water Resources chief Bill Croyle said water was draining at about four times the rate that it was flowing in and the repairs should hold at the nation's tallest dam. \n About 100,000 cubic feet of water was flowing from the reservoir each second, enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool. \n Croyle said work crews had made \"great progress\" cementing thousands of tons of rocks into holes in the spillways. \n \"We shouldn't see a bump in the reservoir\" from the upcoming storms, he said. \n The reservoir has dropped 20 feet since it reached capacity Sunday. Croyle said officials hope it falls 50 feet by this Sunday. \n Still, officials warned residents who have returned to their homes that the area downstream of the dam remained under an evacuation warning and they should be prepared to leave if the risk increases. \n Some 200,000 people were allowed to return home Tuesday after being ordered to evacuate Sunday. \n Sandra Waters, 42, of Oroville initially fled her home with little more than the clothes she was wearing. Now, she's preparing for the possibility of another evacuation by gathering food, clothing and sentimental items like photographs. \n \"You are always cautious when you live under a big dam, but we've always been pretty confident that it was safe and that it wasn't going to fail,\" she said. \n Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said some homes in the evacuation zone had been burglarized and deputies had made of arrests. \n He also called on private drone operators to refrain from flying their devices over the dam. Private drones can interfere with the repair work, which includes helicopters, he said. \n The 770-foot-tall dam is located in Oroville, a small Gold Rush-era town along the Feather River in the Sierra Nevada foothills. \n The region is largely rural, with its politics dominated by rice growers, orchard operators and other agricultural interests. It's dogged by the high unemployment rates endemic to farming communities. \n Dump trucks and helicopters dropped thousands of tons of rocks and sandbags to shore up the spillways over the weekend and avoid what could be a catastrophic failure and flood. \n The swollen lake reached its capacity over the weekend and spilled down an unpaved emergency spillway for nearly 40 hours, leaving it badly eroded. The problem occurred six days after engineers discovered a growing hole in the dam's main concrete spillway. \n Croyle said teams were working on plans for permanent repairs to the dam's main spillway that could cost as much as $200 million. \n As state officials puzzle through how to repair it, federal regulators have ordered California to figure out what went wrong. \n In recent years, construction crews patched cracks \u2014 including in the area where water burrowed a huge pit last week. If the past repairs were not done properly, water could infiltrate and eventually tear through the concrete. \n Inspectors with the state agency that operates and checks the dam went into the half-mile-long spillway in 2014 and 2015 and did not find any concerns, officials said. \n Late Tuesday, President Donald Trump ordered federal authorities to help California recover from severe January storms \u2014 a disaster declaration that also assists state and local officials with the dam crisis. \n Elsewhere in the state, officials say a reservoir in Santa Clara County is on the verge of spilling over for the first time since 2006. But unlike Oroville Dam, the Anderson Reservoir is not at risk of failure or causing major flooding, San Jose television station KNTV reported. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "California officials rush to drain lake before new storms"}

One game was left in the store and available for people to try in-house. The other four were available for purchase. \n Those four were gone within one week. \n It's part of a movement that people, especially millennials, are gravitating toward in droves. \n \"(Tabletop) gaming has received a lot more social acceptance than it did in the past,\" Gino Marinaro said. \"Several years ago Dungeons & Dragons (for example) was looked down upon and had all of these made-up stereotypes about the game and its players.

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Oceti Sakowin camp, where people have gathered to protest the Dakota Access pipeline on federal land, Monday, Feb. 13, 2017, in Cannon Ball, N.D. A federal judge on Monday refused to stop construction on the last stretch of the Dakota Access pipeline, which is progressing much faster than expected. \n WASHINGTON >> A top executive at the company building the controversial Dakota Access pipeline on Wednesday compared pipeline opponents to terrorists. \n Joey Mahmoud, executive vice president of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, said protesters have \"assaulted numerous pipeline personnel,\" destroyed millions of dollars' worth of construction equipment and even fired a pistol at law enforcement during months of demonstrations against the 1,200-mile pipeline, which will carry North Dakota oil to an Illinois terminal. \n Mahmoud said in written testimony to Congress that the protest movement \"induced individuals to break into and shut down pump stations on four operational pipelines. Had these actions been undertaken by foreign nationals, they could only be described as acts of terrorism.\" \n Mahmoud omitted the comment about terrorism as he read his testimony aloud to a House energy subcommittee Wednesday. The comment was included in written remarks submitted to the panel. \n The chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux, one of two tribes suing to stop the project, called Mahmoud's comments unfair to project opponents. \n \"The majority of them are there in prayer,\" Chairman Harold Frazier told reporters after The Associated Press reported Mahmoud's remarks. \"From what I've seen (law enforcement officers) are the terrorists.\" \n Law enforcement has used tactics such as rubber bullets, tear gas and water sprays against protesters during clashes in southern North Dakota near the pipeline route, Frazier said, adding that he personally has been hit by rubber bullets and tear gas. \n In his prepared testimony, Mahmoud also blasted the Obama administration, which twice delayed the project last year. \n \"The Department of the Interior, and most likely senior members of the White House staff, interfered deeply and inappropriately in the waning stages of the regulatory process,\" Mahmoud said. \"Even a company as large as Energy Transfer is helpless in the face of a government which will neither obey nor enforce the law.\" \n Mahmoud called the delays \"politically motivated actions\" that were \"accompanied by a host of half-truths and misrepresentations in both social and mainstream media.\" \n Mahmoud also targeted the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation lies near the pipeline's route and who say the pipeline threatens their water supply and tribal artifacts. \n The pipeline developer reached out to the tribe more than two years ago but has been continually rebuffed, Mahmoud said. \n \"It was clear from their response they had no interest in discussing the project with us,\" he said. \n Mahmoud challenged the tribe's objections and said the pipeline poses little threat to drinking water. The Dakota pipeline will be at least the 15th pipeline to cross the Missouri River, will employ state-of-the-art technology and will be buried more than 90 feet below the lowest part of the river, Mahmoud said. \n \"To cast this as a dispute about protection of water resources is, quite simply, at variance with the facts, and it ignores universally accepted scientific and engineering practices,\" he said. \n Chad Harrison, a councilman at-large for the Standing Rock Sioux, said the federal government and the pipeline company \"ignored the concerns of the tribe\" for almost three years before the Obama administration paused the project last September. On Dec. 4, then-assistant Army secretary for civil works, Jo-Ellen Darcy, declined to issue an easement, saying a broader environmental study was warranted. \n \"To be clear, the tribe does not oppose economic development, energy independence or protecting our national security,\" Harrison said. \"What we oppose is development that is undertaken without our consent and in such a way that it is our community, our people, our cultural sites and our natural resources that are put at the most risk, and when we are the ones who will pay the cost when something goes wrong.\" \n A federal judge on Monday refused to stop construction on the last stretch of the pipeline, which is progressing much faster than expected and could be operational as soon as next month. \n U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that as long as oil isn't flowing through the pipeline, there is no imminent harm to the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River tribes, which are suing to stop the project.

President Donald Trump nominated Sessions for the attorney general's post and the senator was one of his earliest and staunchest backers in Congress. \n But Republicans continued to brush off demands from Democrats for a Watergate-style probe, insisting investigations underway by the House and Senate intelligence committees are adequate. \n \"When the FBI looks into a matter, they do so alongside prosecutors from the Justice Department,\" Schumer said. \"Those prosecutors should not be reporting to the first senator who endorsed Donald Trump's campaign.\" \n Schumer and other Democrats spoke to reporters as Trump criticized the intelligence agencies that he oversees and the media for what he described as unfair treatment of his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and for \"illegally leaked\" information about reported contacts between his campaign aides and Russian officials. \n Flynn was forced to resign Monday following reports he misled Vice President Mike Pence about contacts with a Russian diplomat.

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu participated in a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington today. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump slammed intelligence officials and the media today over what he called \"very, very unfair\" treatment of his ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn and for \"illegally leaked\" information about reported contacts between his campaign advisers and Russian officials. \n Trump's comments come amid a new swirl of controversy over his ties to Russia. The White House said Flynn was forced to resign this week after misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other Trump aides about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. before the inauguration. \n In his first public comments on Flynn's firing, Trump said it was \"really a sad thing that he was treated so badly.\" He spoke during a White House news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \n Trump is said to favor Vice Admiral Robert Harward, a former Navy SEAL, as his next national security adviser, according to a White House official. Harward met with top White House officials last week and has the backing of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. \n Late Tuesday, The New York Times reported that U.S. agencies had intercepted phone calls last year between Russian intelligence officials and members of Trump's 2016 campaign team. Current and former U.S. officials who spoke to the Times anonymously said they found no evidence that the Trump campaign was working with the Russians on hacking or other efforts to influence the election. \n Trump didn't directly address the veracity of the report, but lashed out at what he called the \"criminal act\" of leaking information. Earlier today, Trump tweeted that \"classified information is illegally given out by 'intelligence' like candy. Very un-American!\" \n The White House has not commented on the report, though officials denied as recently as Tuesday afternoon that campaign advisers had communicated with Russia during the election. \n The White House said Flynn was fired not because of his communications with the Russian ambassador, but because he had not been truthful with Pence about the content of those discussions. Flynn maintained for weeks that he had not discussed sanctions in the calls, but later conceded that the topic may have come up. \n White House officials said they conducted a thorough review of Flynn's interactions, including transcripts of calls secretly recorded by U.S. intelligence officials, but found nothing illegal. \n Pence, who had vouched for Flynn in a televised interview, is said to have been angry and deeply frustrated. \n At the White House Tuesday, press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters: \"The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable incidents is what led the president to ask General Flynn for his resignation.\" \n Flynn, in an interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation, said Monday \"there were no lines crossed\" in his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \n The explanation of the episode left many questions unanswered, including why Trump didn't alert Pence to the matter and why Trump allowed Flynn to keep accessing classified information and taking part in the president's discussions with world leaders up until the day he was fired. \n White House officials also struggled to explain why Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway had declared the president retained \"full confidence\" in Flynn just hours before the adviser had to submit his letter of resignation. \n Flynn's firing heightened questions about the president's friendly posture toward Russia. Democrats called for investigations into Flynn's contacts, and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said Congress needed to know whether he had been acting with direction from the president or others. \n Trump initially thought Flynn could survive the controversy, according to a person with direct knowledge of the president's views, but a pair of explosive stories in The Washington Post in recent days made the situation untenable. As early as last week, he and aides began making contingency plans for Flynn's dismissal, a senior administration official said. While the president was said to be upset with Flynn, he also expressed anger with other aides for \"losing control\" of the story and making his young administration look bad. \n Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said Pence became aware that he had received \"incomplete information\" from Flynn only after the first Washington Post report Thursday night. Pence learned about the Justice Department warnings to the White House around the same time. \n The officials and others with knowledge of the situation were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity. \n Ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration, Pence and other officials insisted publicly that Flynn had not discussed sanctions in his talks with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. On Jan. 26, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates contacted White House counsel Don McGahn to raise concerns about discrepancies between the public accounting and what intelligence officials knew to be true about the contacts based on routine recordings of communications with foreign officials who are in the U.S. \n The Justice Department warned the White House that the inconsistencies would leave the president's top national security aide vulnerable to blackmail from Russia, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion. The president was informed of the warnings the same day, Spicer said. \n Flynn was interviewed by the FBI around the same time, according to a U.S. official who was briefed on the investigation. \n McGahn, along with chief of staff Reince Priebus and strategist Steve Bannon, also questioned Flynn multiple times in the ensuing weeks, a White House official said. Top aides also reviewed transcripts of Flynn's contacts with the ambassador, according to a person with knowledge of the review process. \n At the same time, the official said Trump aides began taking steps to put some distance between the president and Flynn. CIA Director Mike Pompeo and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a top Flynn aide, started taking part in Trump's daily security briefings. \n Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire, Eric Tucker, Ken Thomas, Jill Colvin, Erica Werner and Catherine Lucey contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump slams intel officials, media over Flynn and Russia"}

The finalists were Sonny Ramaswamy, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture; Lauren Robel, executive vice president and provost at Indiana University Bloomington; and John Valery White, acting chancellor for the Nevada System of Higher Education. \n \"This was a superb Search Advisory Committee that did everything correctly, and I had no disagreement with their conclusions,\" Lassner wrote. \n He said he could not comment on the reasons for the withdrawal. \"But I will say that the reasons in no way reflected on UH-Manoa or the qualifications, suitability and genuine interest of the candidate in the position,\" Lassner said in the email. \n \"Based on the committee's assessments, with which I am in full agreement after my own meetings with the finalists, I am unable to recommend a new chancellor at this time,\" he added. \"The committee's assessments are confidential and I will not comment further on details and reasons.\" \n Lassner reiterated his view that the president and chancellor positions are two separate jobs. \n \"I recognize, perhaps better than anyone, that the UH presidency and the Manoa chancellorship are two distinct, large and difficult jobs. So I am absolutely not recommending that the positions be combined,\" he said. \"I believe that the question of campus leadership should be revisited in two years to determine how to fill the chancellor position. In the meantime, I believe I can mitigate the conflicts that will naturally arise from time to time. And this arrangement will also provide for a closer relationship with the Board of Regents and with the system vice presidents as we advance the campus.\" \n The regents in August approved a recommendation from Lassner that he serve as interim chancellor with no additional pay for the added duties. (As president, Lassner earns a $375,000 annual base salary.) \n He replaced outgoing interim chancellor Robert Bley-Vroman, who did not want an extension and has returned to a faculty position. \n Bley-Vroman was tapped in August 2014, following the dismissal of Tom Apple as chancellor.

He reportedly fell out of favor when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. \n According to two senior Malaysian government officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case involves sensitive diplomacy, the elder Kim died en route to a hospital on Monday after suddenly falling ill at the budget terminal of Kuala Lumpur International Airport. \n He told medical workers before he died that he had been attacked with a chemical spray, the Malaysian officials said. Multiple South Korean media reports, citing unidentified sources, said two women believed to be North Korean agents killed him with some kind of poison before fleeing in a taxi. \n Malaysia started an autopsy Wednesday to determine the cause of death. But a Malaysian government official, who also demanded anonymity because of the case's sensitivity, said North Korea objected to the procedure because they wanted the body back. But the Malaysian official said the autopsy was still continuing. \n Also Wednesday, Malaysian police arrested a woman carrying Vietnamese travel documents bearing the name Doan Thi Huong at the Kuala Lumpur airport budget terminal, where Kim Jong Nam was attacked. It was not immediately clear whether the passport was genuine. She was identified using earlier surveillance video from the airport, police said. \n Still photos of the video, confirmed as authentic by police, showed a woman in a skirt and long-sleeved white T-shirt with \"LOL\" across the front. \n Police said they were hunting for more suspects. No further details were released. \n Since taking power in late 2011, Kim Jong Un has executed or purged a number of high-level government officials in what the South Korean government has described as a \"reign of terror.\" \n South Korea's spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, said Wednesday that North Korea had been trying for five years to kill Kim Jong Nam. The NIS did not definitively say that North Korea was behind the killing, just that it was presumed to be a North Korean operation, according to lawmakers who briefed reporters about the closed-door meeting with the spy officials. \n The NIS also cited a \"genuine\" attempt by North Korea to kill Kim Jong Nam in 2012, the lawmakers said. The NIS told them that Kim Jong Nam sent a letter to Kim Jong Un in April 2012, after the assassination attempt, begging for the lives of himself and his family. \n The letter said: \"I hope you cancel the order for the punishment of me and my family. We have nowhere to go, nowhere to hide, and we know that the only way to escape is committing suicide.\" \n Details of the Malaysia case were sketchy, but the NIS cited Kim Jong Un's \"paranoia\" about his half brother. The NIS has a history of botching intelligence on North Korea and has long sought to portray the country's leaders as mentally unstable. \n Although Kim Jong Nam had been originally tipped by some outsiders as a possible successor to his late dictator father, Kim Jong Il, others thought that was unlikely because he lived outside the country, including recently in Macau. \n He also frequented casinos, five-star hotels and traveled around Asia, with little say in North Korean affairs. \n But his attempt to visit Tokyo Disneyland reportedly soured North Korea's leadership on his potential as a successor. Kim Jong Nam had said he had no political ambitions, although he was publicly critical of the North Korean regime and his half brother's legitimacy in the past. In 2010, he was quoted in Japanese media as saying he opposed dynastic succession in North Korea. \n Among Kim Jong Un's executions and purges, the most spectacular was the 2013 execution of his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, once considered the country's second-most powerful man, for what the North alleged was treason. \n Kim Jong Il had at least three sons with two women, as well as a daughter by a third. Kim Jong Nam was the eldest, followed by Kim Jong Chul, who is a few years older than Kim Jong Un and is known as a playboy who reportedly attended an Eric Clapton concert in London in 2015. It's unclear what positon he has in the North Korean government. \n A younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, was named a member of the Workers' Party of Korea's Central Committee during a North Korean party congress last May. \n Kim Yong-hyun, professor of North Korean Studies at Dongguk University in South Korea, said Kim Jong Nam could have faced threats from any number of directions. \n He was probably not viewed as a direct threat to his half brother, but as \"an obstacle to Kim Jong Un's plan to maintain the regime for the next 20 to 30 years,\" the professor said. \n \"So there is a possibility of Kim Jong Un directly or indirectly giving orders to get rid of those who could threaten the plan in the long term,\" he said. \"The other possibility that cannot be ruled out is that of North Korean elites, who are competing against each other to show their loyalty to Kim Jong Un, making a move against Kim Jong Nam.\" \n Associated Press writers Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, and Tim Sullivan in New Delhi contributed to this report.  \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Woman arrested in killing of N.

The CBS two-part \"Dr. Phil\" episodes air Monday, Feb. 13th and Tuesday, Feb. 14th. \n COLUMBIA, S.C. >> A South Carolina woman who spent two months chained inside a large metal container says her captor raped her daily and bragged that he was good at killing, claiming that his victims tallied nearly 100. \n Kala Brown says she did what she had to do to survive. \n \"He told me as long as I served my purpose, I was safe,\" Brown told Phillip McGraw, the host of the television show \"Dr. Phil.\" \n It was the first time she has talked publicly since her Nov. 3 rescue, which authorities say helped them solve seven killings in the area dating back 13 years. Police said Todd Kohlhepp, a real estate agent with his own firm until his arrest, killed Brown's boyfriend, a couple who had been missing nearly a year and four people at a motorcycle shop in 2003. \n Brown said she and her boyfriend had gone to Kohlhepp's rural property Aug. 31 to help him clear some underbrush. She'd cleaned houses for him previously to prepare them for sale. After the couple followed him to a two-story garage on the 95-acre property in Spartanburg County, Kohlhepp handed them hedge clippers and bottles of water. He said he needed to get something inside and came out shooting, Brown said. \n He shot Charles Carver three times in the chest, she said. He gagged Brown and handcuffed her ankles and wrists. Kohlhepp took her to a \"pitch black,\" 30-foot-long storage container nearby, chained her by the neck in a back corner and raped her, she said. \n He \"let me know that if I tried to run, he'd kill me. If I tried to hurt him, he'd kill me. If I fought back, he would kill me. And then he raped me,\" Brown said in episodes that aired this week. \"He would rape me twice a day, every day.\" \n The days evolved into a pattern, she said. \n He took her to the garage twice a day, where she ate, used the bathroom and was allowed to bathe every other day using a washcloth and a small plastic bowl of water. But she was never unchained, she said. \n \"He would put more chains on before he took other chains off,\" she said. \n Kohlhepp, 45, faces murder, kidnapping and weapons charges. He is not charged with sexual assault. Spokesmen for the sheriff and prosecutor declined to address the rape allegations or whether more charges are forthcoming. His attorney did not return messages. \n The Associated Press normally does not identify victims of sexual assault but is naming Brown after she publicly identified herself. \n The day after her rescue, investigators found Carver's body in a shallow grave on Kohlhepp's property. Brought to the site in handcuffs, Kohlhepp showed authorities the graves of the couple missing since December 2015. Kohlhepp told Brown he held that woman captive, too, before killing her. \n Police said Kohlhepp acknowledged the grisly 2003 cold case after authorities granted him several requests, including letting him speak to his mother. \n Brown said Kohlhepp told her he killed Carver because \"it was easier to control someone if you took someone they loved.\" \n She thought Kohlhepp was infatuated with her and didn't want to kill her, even saying he would let her go and give her money \"if he ever got old and sick,\" she said. He explained Stockholm syndrome, in which a hostage starts feeling sympathetic toward their captor, and said \"it would kick in and we'd be happy together.\" \n He twice let her see parts of the property beyond the garage and container, including once chained to a four-wheeler. \n \"I had been in a dark, small, enclosed space and couldn't move more than a few feet. I was thrilled to be outdoors,\" she said. \n When Brown heard people talking outside the container the morning of Nov. 3, she panicked, thinking maybe he had brought someone else.

{"date": "February 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Officer Geronimo Yanez's defense attorney Paul Engh makes his way out of the courthouse after a hearing about whether or not charges against Officer Jeronimo Yanez in the fatal shooting of Philando Castile should be dismissed, Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017 in St. Paul, Minn. \n ST. PAUL, Minn. >> A Minnesota judge on Wednesday declined to dismiss charges against a police officer who shot and killed a black man during a July traffic stop, saying it's fair and reasonable for the case to go to trial. \n Ramsey County District Court Judge William Leary III said St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez will enter a plea at a Feb. 27 hearing. His attorneys have indicated he will plead not guilty to manslaughter and other counts in the shooting death of Philando Castile. \n Castile was killed July 6 after he was pulled over in the St. Paul suburb of Falcon Heights. The shooting's gruesome aftermath was streamed live on Facebook by his girlfriend, who was in the car along with her young daughter. Prosecutors said the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker told Yanez he was armed and then was shot seven times. Authorities later discovered Castile had a permit to carry a weapon. \n Attorneys for Yanez, who is Latino, argued their client had no choice but to shoot Castile after he saw a gun and perceived a threat to his life. Defense attorneys have also argued that Castile was negligent in his own death, that he was impaired by marijuana, and that he had no right to be carrying a gun or driving while under the influence. \n Prosecutors argued the case should proceed because the defense raised several issues that prosecutors dispute \u2014 including whether or not Yanez saw Castile's gun and whether Castile was impaired. Prosecutors said those issues should be decided by a jury. \n Leary said a victim's alleged unreasonable conduct does not, by itself, require that a charge be dismissed. \n Leary also wrote that, given the evidence disclosed by prosecutors, it is fair and reasonable for the case to proceed. He said both sides interpret the evidence differently, and if a jury accepts the state's interpretation, there is a chance it could prevail. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Judge declines to dismiss case against cop in man's death"}
