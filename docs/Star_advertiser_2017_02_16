And once you get a second chance to have it back, you never forget it.\" Just having a nose and mouth are blessings, Sandness says. \"The looks are a bonus.\" \n ROCHESTER, Minn. >> He'd been waiting for this day, and when his doctor handed him the mirror, Andy Sandness stared at his image and absorbed the enormity of the moment: He had a new face, one that had belonged to another man. \n His father and his brother, joined by several doctors and nurses at Mayo Clinic, watched as he studied his swollen features. He was just starting to heal from one of the rarest surgeries in the world \u2014 a face transplant, the first at the medical center. He had the nose, cheeks, mouth, lips, jaw, chin, even the teeth of his donor. Resting in his hospital bed, he still couldn't speak clearly, but he had something to say. \n He scrawled four words in a spiral notebook: \n \"Far exceeded my expectations,\" he wrote, handing it to Dr. Samir Mardini, who read the message to the group. \n \"You don't know how happy that makes us feel,\" Mardini said, his voice husky with emotion as he looked at the patient-turned-friend he had first met nearly a decade earlier. \n The exchange came near the end of an extraordinary medical journey that revolved around two young men. Both were rugged outdoorsmen and both just 21 when, overcome by demons, they decided to kill themselves: One, Sandness, survived but with a face almost destroyed by a gunshot; the other man died. \n Their paths wouldn't converge for years, but when they did \u2014 in side-by-side operating rooms \u2014 one man's tragedy offered hope that the other would have a second chance at a normal life. \n \u2014 \n It was two days before Christmas in 2006 when Andy Sandness reached a breaking point. \n He'd been sad and drinking too much lately. That night after work while \"super, super depressed,\" he grabbed a rifle from a closet. He stared at it for a while, then put a round in the chamber. He positioned the barrel beneath his chin, took a deep breath and pulled the trigger. \n Instantly, he knew he'd made a terrible mistake. When the police arrived, an officer who was a friend cradled him in his arms as Sandness begged, \"Please, please don't let me die! I don't want to die!\" \n He was rushed from his home in eastern Wyoming, treated at two hospitals, then transferred to Mayo Clinic. When he woke, his mother was holding his hand. She'd always been a strong woman but that day, her face was a portrait of unfathomable pain. The bullet had obliterated his mouth, so he motioned for a pen and paper. \n \"I'm sorry,\" he wrote. \n \"I love you,\" she replied. \"It's OK.\" But all Sandness could think about was how he'd hurt his family \u2014 and just wonder what was next. \n The answer came quickly when he met Mardini, a plastic surgeon whose specialty is facial reconstruction. As a newcomer at Mayo, the doctor was on call Christmas Eve. Over the next few days, he reassured Sandness that he'd fix his face as best he could. \n \"I just need you to be strong and patient,\" he said. \n It would take time and much surgery. And despite their skills, the doctors couldn't miraculously turn him back into that guy with the orthodontist-perfected smile \n Sandness couldn't bear to see himself, so he covered his hospital room mirror with a towel. He had no nose and no jaw. He'd shot out all but two teeth. His mouth was shattered, his lips almost non-existent. He'd lost some vision in his left eye. He needed breathing and feeding tubes at first. \n Mardini and his team removed dead tissue and shattered bones, then connected facial bones with titanium plates and screws. They reconstructed his upper jaw with bone and muscle from the hip; they transferred bone and skin from a leg to fashion the lower jaw. They used wires and sutures to bring together his eyelids, which had been spread apart because of the powerful blast. \n They made progress, even if it didn't always look that way. \n After about eight surgeries over 4\u00bd months, Sandness returned home to Newcastle, Wyoming, a hamlet of 3,200, where friends and family embraced him. He worked at a lodge, in the oil fields and as an electrician's apprentice. \n But his world had shrunk. When he ventured to the grocery store, he avoided eye contact with children so he wouldn't scare them. Occasionally, he heard them ask their mothers why he looked that way. \n He sometimes lied when folks asked what had happened. \"I would tell them it was a hunting accident,\" he says. \"I felt like they didn't need to know.\" \n He had almost no social life; on a rare night out to shoot pool, a guy taunted him about his appearance. He retreated to the hills, where he could hunt elk and fish walleye, unseen. \n \"Those were real tough times for him,' says his father, Reed. \"He was insecure. Who wouldn't be?\" \n Sandness learned to adapt. His mouth was about an inch wide \u2014 too small for a spoon \u2014 so he tore food into bits, then sucked on them until he could swallow the pieces. He wore a prosthetic nose but it constantly fell off outdoors; he carried glue to reattach it. It discolored often, so he had to paint it to match his skin. \n \"You never fully accept it,\" he says. \"You eventually say, 'OK, is there something else we can do?'\" \n There was, but the prospect of 15 more surgeries Mardini had mapped out scared him. He didn't want more skin grafts, more scars or dental implants Even then, he'd still look deformed. \n Over the next five years, Sandness made yearly visits to Mayo. Then in spring of 2012, he received a life-changing call. \n Mardini told him it looked like Mayo was going to launch a face transplant program and Sandness might be an ideal patient. The doctor had already begun traveling to France, Boston and Cleveland to meet doctors who'd done face transplants. \n Mardini tried to temper his patient's enthusiasm. \"Think very hard about this,\" he said. Only about two dozen transplants have been done around the world, and he wanted Sandness to understand the risks and the aftermath: a lifelong regimen of anti-rejection drugs. \n But Sandness could hardly contain himself. \"How long until I can do this?\" he asked. \n He followed Mardini's advice to research the surgery. It was far more complicated than he'd imagined, but he was undeterred. \n \"When you look like I looked and you function like I functioned, every little bit of hope that you have, you just jump on it,\" he says, \"and this was the surgery that was going to take me back to normal.\" \n \u2014 \n Three more years passed as Sandness waited. \n By then, Mayo Clinic had completed a long internal review to get the face transplant program approved. Sandness had to undergo a rigorous psychiatric and social work evaluation to address, among other things, a key question: Should this surgery be performed on someone who'd attempted suicide? \n Several factors were in his favor: His resilience and motivation, a strong support network of family and friends, a long-standing rapport with Mardini and a gap of several years since the shooting. Doctors also noted others with self-inflicted injuries, such as excessive drinkers, have received liver transplants. \n \"I don't think there's anybody who doesn't deserve a second chance,\" Mardini says. \n Asked by the doctors what he expected from the transplant, to make sure he had realistic goals, Sandness said he wanted a working nose, the ability to bite, swallow, chew, and to \"get good stares as opposed to bad stares.\" \n These incremental steps benefited everyone, says Dr. Hatem Amer, Mayo's medical director of reconstructive transplantation. \n \"He wasn't rushing us, and we weren't rushing him,\" he says. \"He really understood what he was embarking upon.\" \n Sandness says he was concerned both about the possibility of rejection and potential side effects of anti-rejection drugs, including skin cancer, infection, diabetes and weakening of the bones. \n Mardini and his team devoted more than 50 Saturdays over 3\u00bd years to rehearsing the surgery, using sets of cadaver heads to transplant the face of one to another. They used 3-D imaging and virtual surgery to plot out the bony cuts so the donor's face would fit perfectly on Sandness. \n In January 2016, Sandness' name was added to the waiting list of the United Network for Organ Sharing. \n Mardini figured it would take up to five years to find the right donor: a man with matching blood and tissue types, roughly the same size as Sandness, within a 10-year age range and a close skin tone. \n But just five months later, Mardini got a call: There might be a donor. He phoned Sandness, cautioning it was just a possibility. \n The next day, Mardini got the final word: The donor's family had said OK. \n \u2014 \n The decision came from a 19-year-old newlywed mourning the sudden loss of her husband. \n In early June, Calen \"Rudy\" Ross fatally shot himself in the head. His devastated widow, Lilly, was eight months pregnant. \n Despite her grief, she was committed to carrying out her husband's wishes: On his driver's license, Ross, who lived in Fulda, Minnesota, had designated he wanted to be an organ donor. Lilly met with a coordinator from LifeSource, a nonprofit group that works with families in the upper Midwest to facilitate organ and tissue donation. \n Since Ross had been healthy and just 21, his heart, lungs, liver and kidneys could be donated. But additional screening determined he could do even more: He was a good match for a man awaiting a face transplant at Mayo Clinic. \n In a second conversation, LifeSource broached the idea to Lilly. \n \"I was skeptical at first,\" she says. \"I didn't want to walk around and all of a sudden see Calen.\" She was reassured the donor had his own eyes and forehead and would not be recognizable as her husband. After consulting with her husband's best friend, she gave her consent. \n A CT scan, other tests and a photo sent to Mardini by LifeSource confirmed the two men were a good match. Mardini said when the doctors studied Ross' photo, \"we got chills when we actually saw how close they were in hair color, skin \u2014 just the overall look. It could be his cousin.\" \n Late on June 16, Sandness was wheeled into surgery, accompanied by Mardini, who was showing him photos of his two small children. Over the years, the two say they've become as close as brothers. \n \"There was not a second of doubt that everything was going to go well,\" Sandness says. \n \"Everybody went into this totally knowing their role, knowing what to expect,\" Mardini recalls. \"Every step has been thought out 1,000 times.\" \n Mardini had a parting message: \"We're looking forward to seeing you with a new face.\" \n In adjoining operating rooms, some 60 surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists and others had gathered for what would be a 56-hour marathon. \n \u2014 \n The surgery that started shortly before midnight Friday was over early Monday morning. \n It took about 24 hours to procure the donor's face, which involved taking bone, muscle, skin and nerves, and almost the same time to prepare Sandness. His entire face was rebuilt below his eyes, taking an additional 32 hours. The medical team rotated, many taking four-hour breaks through the weekend. \n One of the most intricate parts of the surgery was identifying facial nerve branches on both men and stimulating them with an electric current to determine their function. That allowed doctors to make the correct transfers, so when Sandness thinks about smiling or closing his eyes, for example, those movements actually happen. \n After the surgery ended, Mardini proclaimed it \"a miracle.\" \n Sandness, who was sedated for several days, wasn't allowed to see himself immediately. His room mirror and cell phone were removed. His father, Reed, served as his eyes. \n \"I said, 'Andy, I've never lied to you. I'm telling you you're going to be happy with what you see,'\" he recalls. \"He was quizzing me and the nurses all the time.\" \n Three weeks later, when he finally did see his face \u2014 a scene captured on a Mayo video \u2014 his father says it \"was just a real tearful, hard-to-hold-back time \u2026 beyond our wildest dreams.\". \n Sandness was overwhelmed. \"Once you lose something that you've had forever, you know what it's like not to have it,\" he says. \"And once you get a second chance to have it back, you never forget it.\" \n Just having a nose and mouth are blessings, he says. \"The looks are a bonus.\" \n Months earlier, both he and Lilly Ross had expressed interest in learning about each other. She particularly wanted him to know about her husband, an adventurous, spontaneous guy. \n Last fall, she wrote to Sandness and the five others who received her husband's organs. She described Ross, her high school sweetheart, as a \"giving person\" who loved hunting, trapping and being with his dog, Grit. \"I am filled with great joy knowing that he was able to give a little of himself to ensure a better quality of life for someone else,\" she wrote. \n As for the face transplant, she thought of her baby son when she agreed to it. \"The reason that I decided to \u2026 go through with it was so that I can later down the road show Leonard what his dad had done to help somebody,\" she said in a video produced by LifeSource. \n Lilly was given photos of Sandness before and after the transplant. That's when she learned of uncanny similarities between the two men \u2014 not just their passion for the outdoors, but the way they stood in their hunting photos. \"It was amazing how good he looked and how well he's doing,'\" she says of Sandness. \"I'm excited for him that he's getting his life back.\" \n She also noticed one small detail \u2014 a small bare patch in the middle of his bearded chin, just as on her husband's face. \n Both she and Sandness hope to meet one day. For now, he wrote her a letter of appreciation. Referring to her husband's favorite things, he said: \"He's still going to continue to love hunting and fishing and dogs \u2014 through me.\" \n \u2014 \n Andy Sandness can pinpoint the day he looked normal. \n About three months after the transplant, he was in an elevator when a little boy glanced at him, then turned to his mother without appearing scared or saying anything. \"I knew then,\" he says, \"that the surgery was a success.\" \n Last December, he had follow-up surgery to tighten skin on his face and neck and build up bone around his eyes so they're not so recessed. \n His facial muscles are growing stronger. He received speech therapy to learn to use his tongue in a new mouth and jaw, and enunciate clearly. \n He's thrilled to smell again, breathe normally and be eating foods that were off-limits for a decade: apples, steak and pizza that he shared with his doctors. \n His transformation isn't just visible. After the shooting, he says, when he dreamed, he still had his old face. Now, his new face appears in his dreams. \n Sandness, now 31, plans to return to Wyoming, work as an electrician and, he hopes, marry and have a family someday. \n For now, he savors his anonymity. Recently, he attended a Minnesota Wild game. He bought some popcorn. He watched some hockey. He didn't see any stares or hear any whispers. \n He was, as he says, \"just another face in the crowd.\" Just thinking about that makes him smile. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Twin tragedies give survivor a new face \u2013 and a new life"}

{"date": "February 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Buddhist monks stood in front of Thai policemen outside Wat Dhammakaya temple in Pathum Thani province, Thailand, today. \n PATHUM THANI, Thailand >> Thai police raided the head temple of a controversial Buddhist sect but failed to find and arrest the abbot, who faces criminal charges over accepting $40 million in embezzled money. \n The action today followed several earlier failed attempts to seize Phra Dhammajayo, 72, head of the Dhammakaya sect. Police were previously thwarted when crowds of monks and followers blocked the way, risking a violent confrontation. \n The prime minister of Thailand's military government, Prayuth Chan-ocha, this time invoked an emergency order declaring the area around the temple a temporary \"restricted area\" to stop people from entering. \n Police deployed about 3,000 personnel to surround the temple before dawn, blocking hundreds of monks and followers who sat outside the compound's gates, chanting Buddhist texts in protest. \n The temple's senior monks agreed around noon to admit some police. Several hundred officers swept the grounds, honing in on an inner residence compound where intelligence suggested the abbot resided, but he was nowhere to be found. \n \"We found nothing illegal, we couldn't find him,\" said Kolvit Bunnag, director of special operations at the Department of Special Investigation, Thailand's FBI. \"We expected to find him, but the news spread around. He could (have) run away.\" \n Some devotees believe the raids are politically motivated because the temple and its followers are seen as supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was deposed in a 2006 military coup. \n The Dhammakaya sect is controversial for fusing Buddhism theology with what critics call a bourgeois, money-friendly ideology. It appeals to Thailand's burgeoning middle class. \n Temple spokesmen claim they haven't seen Dhammajayo for months at the temple, which is known for its vast golden dome that appears to hover over the grounds like a gilded UFO. \n \"(The police) tried to make it as smooth and peaceful as possible,\" said Phra Pasura Dantamano, a Dhammakaya spokesman. However, he said it was an \"excessive use of force for nearly 4,000 police to come and block the road just because someone did not appear for a summons.\" \n Pasura said Dhammajayo was innocent and estimated that 10,000 followers came to support him at the vast compound, which covers an area almost 10 times the size of Vatican City. \n One of Dhammajayo's followers, the head of a credit union, was convicted of embezzling money to donate to the temple, and was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Dhammajayo was charged with money-laundering and receiving stolen property. The sect says he did not know the money was tainted. \n In an evident effort to put pressure on him, three unrelated charges of land encroachment were later filed against him. \n The sect was founded in 1970 and ballooned in Thailand's 1980s economic boom. Dhammajayo was forced to temporarily step down as the temple's abbot following embezzlement accusations in 1999 and 2002. He resumed his post in 2006 after clearing his name. \n The DSI first summoned Dhammajayo last March in connection with the money-laundering charges. After he repeatedly failed to show up for questioning, saying he was ill, a criminal court issued an arrest warrant last May, prompting police to try to raid the temple several times. \n The raids have been complicated by a law which forbids the arrest of a monk in his robes, for fear that would mar the sanctity of the clergy. Buddhism is the national religion and a core pillar of Thai society. \n Police said they would be back Friday and Saturday to continue the hunt, after which their search agreement with the monks will expire. \n The temple's supporters, too, will be back. \n \"Lots of things happened to the temple, it's not fair,\" said Tiparaphan Up-prakan, a decades-long Dhammakaya devotee from Bangkok. \"I think Dhammakaya will be OK. We will fight for that.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n https://www.facebook.com/APNews/photos/a.10150366988291623.355082.249655421622/10154328574761623/?type=3&theater \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Thai police raid temple belonging to Buddhist sect"}

Executive director Ted Mondale also announced his own exit as top Republicans charting massive changes to stadium governance ramped up calls for him to also step aside. \n MINNEAPOLIS >> The two top leaders of the authority overseeing the Minnesota Vikings' stadium resigned abruptly Thursday after weeks of criticism over the questionable use of luxury suites by officials' family and friends, a practice that auditors labeled an ethical violation. \n Authority Chairwoman Michele Kelm-Helgen announced her resignation first in a Thursday morning letter, saying it was in the public interest for her to step down from the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority. Hours later, executive director Ted Mondale announced his own exit as top Republicans charting massive changes to stadium governance ramped up calls for him to also step aside. \n The pair, and the authority as a whole, had been taking heat for months since their use of two luxury suites was first reported by the Star Tribune. A recent report from the Office of the Legislative Auditor last week found that nearly half of the tickets for those two suites were issued to friends and family members of top oversight officials, including Kelm-Helgen and Mondale. \n \"If I could go back and start over again, MSFA would have had a public discussion on the use of these suites and forbid the use of them by family and friends from the start,\" Kelm-Helgen wrote. \n Their departure leaves a leadership vacuum at the oversight board as Minnesota gears up to host the 2018 Super Bowl. \n Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton appointed them both. And while he said he didn't ask for either resignation, he credited them for recognizing their continued roles on the authority would \"be a detriment.\" \n Kelm-Helgen repeatedly apologized to legislators during a hearing on the audit last week, but she and Mondale also defended the practice as commonplace among stadiums around the country. \n No state laws were broken, but the auditor's report said the practice violated a \"core ethical principle\" and that the marketing purpose of inviting friends, family and certain government employees to games and special events wasn't clear. Several Democratic officials paid $200 or more back to the authority for games they attended after the Star Tribune first wrote about the scandal. \n The authority has since changed its rules to bar the practice. \n Republican legislators have been pursuing major changes to the authority's structure. A bill that would drastically reshape the authority by giving the Legislature the power to appoint most of its members and eliminating Kelm-Helgen's salary was due for another hearing Thursday afternoon. \n Rep. Sarah Anderson, a Plymouth Republican behind that bill, said both officials' resignations were the right move. But she called it \"the tip of the iceberg when it comes to addressing the problems\" at the oversight board, and said the four remaining authority commissioners should consider following suit. . \n \"Given the actions of Ms. Kelm-Helgen and Mr. Mondale, hopefully they take that as motivation,\" Anderson said. \n Dayton said he hasn't decided whether he'll appoint an interim chair once Kelm-Helgen formally departs in early March. But he bristled at the suggestion that the remaining authority members should also be removed, calling it an unfounded step for the new, $1.1 billion stadium, which just hosted its first NFL season. \n \"We need the stability of the existing members of the board to carry this thing forward,\" the Democratic governor said. \n The legislative auditor noted that lawmakers may have let their oversight of the authority slip. A panel charged with overseeing construction and operation of the stadium met just once in 2016, and Republicans have not yet appointed any members for 2017. \n Anderson said they may have \"took things for granted\" that the stadium was being run properly. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Amid suite heat, top Vikings stadium leaders resign"}

So far, only one medal out of 23 has been returned. \n MOSCOW >> Russian track and field athletes haven't been giving up their medals in Olympic doping cases, and local officials have vowed to kick them off the national team until they do. \n The Russian track federation said Thursday only one medal has been returned out of 23 which must be handed back because of failed retests of samples from the 2008 and 2012 Games. \n The only medal returned so far is a bronze won by Anton Kokorin in the men's 4\u00d7400-meter relay at the 2008 Olympics. Kokorin didn't test positive, but teammate Denis Alexeyev's disqualification for a banned steroid means the whole team must give their medals back. \n In an effort to speed up the process and win goodwill while under pressure for doping, the Russian track federation said athletes who don't return medals won't have the right to compete in its sports events and won't be eligible for national teams or for drug-testing pools which could allow them to compete internationally as neutral athletes. \n The federation itself has been suspended from international competition since November 2015 over widespread drug use. It said the new insistence on returning medals was part of the process of persuading the IAAF that Russia deserves to be reinstated. \n The federation said it \"is issuing a reminder that during work on reinstatement with the IAAF there are some criteria which have so far been ignored by a number of people.\" Giving back prize money won by dopers at non-Olympic events is another priority, the federation said. \n The decision not to select athletes who don't return Olympic medals is unlikely to have an immediate effect in most cases, since athletes disqualified for Olympic doping are likely to face two-year bans from any sporting involvement anyway. Others are already retired. \n However, it could affect runners from relay teams who tested clean but were disqualified because of a teammate's failed test. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Russia to punish athletes who don't return Olympic medals"}

She asked Trump at his East Room press conference on Thursday whether he planned to include the CBC \"in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner-city agenda.\" \n The president responded by asking Ryan whether the CBC are \"friends of yours\" and remarking, \"I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?\" \n Ryan herself responded over Twitter: \"I am a journalist not a convener! But thank you for answering my questions.\" \n And the CBC noted over Twitter that the group sent Trump a letter in January outlining areas where they could work together, \"but you never wrote us back. Sad!\" The organization later issued a statement saying they were in talks with the White House about a possible meeting. \n Richmond's statement said it was remarkable that Trump had not responded to their letter. \n \"President Trump has been in office for almost a month and the Congressional Black Caucus \u2013 which at a historic 49 members is almost a fourth of the House Democratic Caucus and represents millions of African-Americans \u2013 did not hear from the White House until we introduced ourselves on Twitter after the White House press conference today.\" \n Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio said: \"We have a rich history, we have some almost 50 members of the Congressional Black Caucus. We're not new. What a president should say is, yes, it's already on my agenda to talk to them.\" \n Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., called Trump's remarks another \"abuse of protocol.\" \n \"Donald Trump knows how to call Cedric Richmond, our chair, and that is what he should do. And then we'll (the CBC) sit together and see if it's in our interest\" to meet with Trump, Ellison said. \n Trump specifically mentioned a meeting with Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and said the lawmaker canceled because it would be bad for him politically. Cummings, in response, said, \"I have no idea why President Trump would make up a story about me like he did today.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Black lawmakers dismayed by Trump's invite to black reporter"}

It views Sufi shrines like the one targeted Thursday as a form of idolatry. \n Raja Somro, who witnessed the attack, told a local TV network that hundreds of people were performing a spiritual dance known as the Dhamal when the bomber struck. \n \"I saw bodies everywhere. I saw bodies of women and children,\" he said. \n Local TV showed graphic footage of the aftermath of the blast, with wounded worshippers crying out for help and the floors covered with shoes, blood and body parts. Women cried and beat their chests in grief. \n Ghazanfar Shah, the custodian of the site, said security was lax at the shrine, which is entered through two gold-plated doors. \n Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed that security forces would track down the perpetrators of the attack, according to Pakistani state TV. \n \"Each drop of the nation's blood shall be avenged, and avenged immediately,\" Pakistan's army chief, Gen.

{"date": "February 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A U.S. Border Patrol agent guarded a fence gate along the U.S.-Mexico border today in Brownsville, Texas. \n SAN DIEGO >> The United States does not have a way to measure how well fencing works to deter illegal crossings from Mexico, according to a report released Thursday by Congress' main watchdog as President Donald Trump renewed his pledge to build \"a great wall\" on the border. \n The Government Accountability Office said the government spent $2.3 billion from 2007 to 2015 to extend fences to 654 miles of the nearly 2,000-mile border and more to repair them. \n Despite those investments, the Customs and Border Protection agency \"cannot measure the contribution of fencing to border security operations along the southwest border because it has not developed metrics for this assessment,\" the agency said in a 75-page review. \n Efforts to better measure success were aborted in 2013 because of a budget showdown between President Barack Obama and Congress, according to the report, which recommends developing new measures to justify more spending. \n Trump, speaking at a news conference today, reiterated plans for a wall with Mexico \u2014 one of his signature campaign pledges \u2014 and promised to negotiate a lower price. \n Border Patrol leaders have struggled to say with any degree of precision how well fences work, in part because it's unknown how many people get away. Another unknown is the extent to which fences or other factors such as the number of agents explain why people are caught. \n The GAO estimated capture rates in areas with and without fencing but cautioned that no cause-and-effect relationship has been established. \n Construction cost estimates have varied widely. The GAO report stuck with its 2009 estimate of an average of $6.5 million a mile for a fence to keep out people on foot and $1.8 million a mile for vehicle blockades. There are currently 354 miles of pedestrian fencing and 300 miles of vehicle barriers. \n Republican leaders in Congress have said Trump's wall would cost between $12 billion and $15 billion. Trump has suggested $12 billion. \n An internal Homeland Security Department report prepared for Secretary John Kelly estimates the cost of extending the wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border at about $21 billion, according to a U.S. government official who is involved in border issues. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the report has not been made public. \n The Homeland Security report proposes an initial phase that would extend fences 26 miles and a second wave that would add 151 miles, plus 272 \"replacement\" miles where fences are already installed, according to the official. Those two phases would cost $5 billion. \n Few people dispute that fences contributed to a sharp drop in crossings in cities like San Diego and El Paso, Texas, where people can easily blend in once they enter the country. Before fences were built in San Diego, crossers played soccer on U.S. soil as vendors hawked tamales, waiting until night fell to overwhelm agents. \n San Diego was the busiest corridor for illegal crossings until the late 1990s, when an enforcement surge pushed traffic to Arizona and other more remote areas where many crossers died from heat. As fencing critics note, border crossers continue to perish in isolated areas under extreme weather conditions. \n Border Patrol agents the told authors of the GAO report that fencing has made it more difficult for people to ambush or assault them. Attacks on agents dropped 81 percent two years after fencing was erected in the Nogales, Arizona, area. \n On the flip side, holes are often cut. The GAO reported 9,287 breaches in pedestrian fencing from 2010 to 2015. \n Kelly told lawmakers last week that he would like to see wall construction well underway within two years, but he held open the possibility that it would not extend to areas where natural physical barriers already exist. \n After a tour of the border in Arizona and California, he said he got \"an earful\" of suggestions from employees on where to build first. \n \"I'll take that on board. We'll bring it back to Washington, put in the blender and come up with a solution,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Watchdog: No way to measure U.S.-Mexico border wall success"}

{"date": "February 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and CEO of Facebook, waved at the CEO summit during the annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Lima, Peru, on Nov. 19, 2016. \n NEW YORK >> Mark Zuckerberg's long-term vision for Facebook, laid out in a sweeping manifesto , sometimes sounds more like a utopian social guide than a business plan. Are we, he asks, \"building the world we all want?\" \n While most people now use Facebook to connect with friends and family, Zuckerberg hopes that the social network can encourage more civic engagement, an informed public and community support in the years to come. Facebook now has nearly 2 billion members, which makes it larger than any nation in the world. \n His 5,800-word essay positions Facebook in direct opposition to a rising tide of isolationism and fear of outsiders, both in the U.S. and abroad. In a phone interview with The Associated Press, Zuckerberg stressed that he wasn't motivated by the U.S. election or any other particular event. Rather, he said, it's the growing sentiment in many parts of the world that \"connecting the world\" \u2014 the founding idea behind Facebook \u2014 is no longer a good thing. \n \"Across the world there are people left behind by globalization, and movements for withdrawing from global connection,\" Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in a Harvard dorm room in 2004, wrote on Thursday. \"In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.\" \n Zuckerberg, 32, said he still strongly believes that more connectedness is the right direction for the world. But, he adds, it's \"not enough if it's good for some people but it's doesn't work for other people. We really have to bring everyone along.\" \n COMMUNITY SUPPORT  \n The letter is short on specific details and plans Facebook has in the works. And it doesn't mention anything about Facebook as a business, its billions in advertising revenue or the targeting it is often criticized for. Zuckerberg said Facebook provides regular updates on how its business is doing and product launches \u2014and this is meant to be different. \n Today, most of Facebook's 1.86 billion members \u2014 about 85 percent \u2014 live outside of the U.S. and Canada. The Menlo Park, California-based company has offices everywhere from Amsterdam to Jakarta to Tel Aviv. (It is banned in China, the world's most populous country, though some people get around it.) Naturally, Zuckerberg takes a global view of Facebook and sees potential that goes beyond borders, cities and nations. \n And that could allow the social network to step up as more traditional cultural ties fray. People already use Facebook to connect with strangers who have the same rare disease, to post political diatribes, to share news links (and sometimes fake news links ). Facebook has also pushed its users to register to vote, to donate to causes, to mark themselves safe after natural disasters, and to \"go live .\" For many, it's become a utility. Some 1.23 billion people use it daily. \n Facebook groups, which allow people to come together based on shared interests, could play a bigger role in this respect, Zuckerberg suggests. In groups, people talk about everything from knitting to parenting to political activism . More than 100 million people are in at least one Facebook group, though Zuckerberg wants way more. He laments the fading of traditional social communities such as churches, labor unions and local groups. \n \"A healthy society needs these communities to support our personal, emotional and spiritual needs,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"In a world where this physical social infrastructure has been declining, we have a real opportunity to help strengthen these communities and the social fabric of our society.\" \n LONG VIEW  \n Zuckerberg has gotten Facebook to this position of global dominance \u2014 one that Myspace and Twitter, for instance, never even approached \u2014 partly thanks to his audacious, long-term view of the company and its place in the world. \n Rather than getting fixated on the next quarter's profit or the next day's user uproar, he tends to consider Facebook 5, 10 or more years into the future. It's as grandiose as it's been successful, at least so far. \n \"For the past decade, Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families. With that foundation, our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community \u2014 for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all,\" he wrote. \n Last fall, Zuckerberg and his wife, the doctor Priscilla Chan, unveiled the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative , a long-term effort aimed at eradicating all disease by the end of this century. Then, as now, Zuckerberg preferred to look far down the road to the potential of scientific and technological innovations that have not been perfected, or even invented yet. This includes artificial intelligence. \n \"The long term promise of AI is that in addition to identifying risks more quickly and accurately than would have already happened, it may also identify risks that nobody would have flagged at all \u2014 including terrorists planning attacks using private channels, people bullying someone too afraid to report it themselves, and other issues both local and global,\" he wrote. \"It will take many years to develop these systems.\" \n Speaking to the AP, Zuckerberg said he understands that we might not \"solve all the issues that we want\" in the short term. \n \"One of my favorite quotes is this Bill Gates quote, that 'people overestimate what they can get done in two years and underestimate what they can get done in 10 years.' And that's an important mindset that I hope more people take today,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "The Zuckerberg manifesto: How he plans to debug the world"}

{"date": "February 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Lee Jae-yong, the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, center, was questioned by reporters upon his arrival for a hearing at the Seoul Central District Court in Seoul, South Korea, today. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> A South Korean court approved on Friday the arrest of a billionaire heir to Samsung accused of bribery and other charges in connection to a massive corruption scandal. \n The Seoul Central District Court's decision to issue a warrant to arrest Lee Jae-yong, 48, a vice chairman at Samsung Electronics and the only son of Samsung chair Lee Kun-hee, makes him the first leader in Samsung's history to be arrested on criminal charges. \n The arrest of the princeling of the country's richest family will likely shock the business community and cheer the critics of chaebol, the South Korean family-controlled business conglomerates that dominate the economy. It was seen as a test of the country's judicial system that in the past had been lenient toward the powerful business elite families at chaebol for their white collar crimes, citing their contributions to the national economy. \n The Seoul court said new criminal suspicion and additional evidence show there were enough reasons to take Lee into custody. Prosecutors can detain him for up to 20 days before formally indicting him. \n The court dismissed prosecutors' request to arrest Park Sang-jin, a president at Samsung Electronics overseeing external relations, saying that it was difficult to justify Park's arrest given his position and role within the company. \n Lee avoided arrest last month when the court dismissed the prosecutors' request citing the lack of evidence. The special prosecution team, probing the influence-peddling scandal that led to the impeachment of the country's president, said they have gathered more evidence to strengthen their case and made a second request. \n The 48-year-old was groomed to succeed his father. He stepped up his leadership role in recent years after the elder Lee fell ill in 2014. Though the ailing Samsung chair was convicted before, the 75-year-old has never spent time in prison. \n Prosecutors accused Lee of giving bribes worth $36 million to President Park Geun-hye and her close friend Choi Soon-sil to win government favors for a smooth leadership transition. They are also investigating Lee on allegations of embezzlement of Samsung funds, hiding assets overseas and lying under oath during a parliamentary hearing. \n The court's decision will likely embolden the special prosecution team, which has less than two weeks to investigate the scandal, unless the parliament extends the Feb. 28 deadline. It would also help the team bring bribery charges against President Park Geun-hye whose powers were suspended in December by parliament. She is awaiting a decision by the Constitutional Court on whether she will be permanently removed from the presidency. \n Samsung has denied that it has offered bribes or sought any wrongful favors from the president. The company did not immediately respond to request for comment. \n Samsung was the biggest donor among dozens of South Korean companies that donated a total of nearly $70 million to two nonprofit foundations controlled by Choi, the president's friend. It also transferred millions of euros to Choi's company in Germany that financed equestrian training of her daughter and funded money to a winter sports center operated by her niece. \n Prosecutors suspect that Samsung won government support for a controversial merger of two Samsung groups in 2015 that was a key step in the transition of leadership from father to son. \n The merger was opposed by many minority shareholders, who said the deal would hurt them while unfairly benefiting Lee and other members of Samsung's founding family. But Samsung narrowly secured shareholder approval thanks in part to support from the National Pension Fund, its key investor. The current head of the pension fund was indicted last month over his role in pressuring the fund to support the merger. \n The special prosecution office is also reportedly looking into whether the value of Samsung Biologics, which went public last year, was overpriced to benefit the Samsung founding family and also whether the fair trade commission gave any favors to Samsung in relation to its complex cross shareholding structure, which allows the Lee family to control the sprawling businesses with only a minority stake. \n Lee's father and ailing Samsung chair has been convicted in the past of embezzlement, tax evasion and breach of trust but was never imprisoned. After his latest conviction in 2008, he was pardoned a year later by the president, who said he would help South Korea's bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "South Korean court approves arrest of Samsung heir"}

Trump said he would announce a \"new and very comprehensive order to protect our people\" next week. \n \"This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine,\" Trump declared in a lengthy news conference that saw the new commander in chief repeatedly interrupting reporters' questions and airing his grievances. \n Throughout the encounter the new president delivered recurring criticism of the news media, accusing it of being \"out of control\" and promising to take his message \"straight to the people.\" \n He dismissed recent reports in The New York Times and on CNN that Trump campaign aides had been in contact with Russian officials before his election. Trump called Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager who has ties to Ukraine and Russia, a \"respected man.\" \n Pressed repeatedly, Trump said that \"nobody that I know of\" on his campaign staff had contacted Russian officials. He called such reports a \"ruse\" and said he had \"nothing to do with Russia.\" Trump added, \"Russia is fake news. This is fake news put out by the media.\" \n Amid reports of widespread leaks within his administration, Trump also warned that he would clamp down on the dissemination of sensitive information, saying he had asked the Justice Department to investigate. \"Those are criminal leaks,\" adding, \"The leaks are real. The news is fake.\" \n He blamed any problems on the outgoing Obama administration. \"I inherited a mess at home and abroad \u2014 a mess,\" Trump said. \n Democrats said Trump's refusal to say for sure that his campaign staff wasn't in contact in the Kremlin underscored the need for an independent investigation through a special congressional select committee, a commission styled after the review of the 9/11 attacks or an independent counsel from the Justice Department. \"His silence speaks volumes,\" said Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. \n The president announced that Alexander Acosta, the dean of the Florida International University law school, would be his nominee for Labor secretary. That came a day after fast-food executive Andrew Puzder withdrew his nomination for Labor after losing support among Republican senators. \n Trump, a reality television star and real estate mogul who was elected as an outsider intent on change, said his ousted national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was \"just doing his job\" in talking with Russian officials before the inauguration. But he said he was \"not happy\" with how Flynn described his phone call with a Russian diplomat to Vice President Mike Pence. \n Trump knew for weeks that Flynn had misled Pence but did not inform the vice president, according to a timeline of events supplied by the White House. \n Trump said he had identified a strong replacement for Flynn, which made the decision to let him go easier. \n Trump is said to favor Vice Admiral Robert Harward, a former Navy SEAL, as his next national security adviser, according to a White House official. Harward met with top White House officials last week and has the backing of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. He was meeting with officials later today. \n Addressing immigration, one of the biggest issues of the past campaign, Trump said it was difficult dealing with the policy known as DACA, which allows young adults to get work permits and Social Security numbers and protects them from deportation. Referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals rule, he said he would \"deal with DACA with heart.\" \n While Trump has promised to halt illegal immigration as a cornerstone of his administration, he has also promised to focus on people who have committed crimes. He said he had the \"best lawyers\" working on the policy now and the \"new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got from the court.\" \n Earlier in the day, Trump had a breakfast meeting with some of his staunchest House supporters. \n The White House has said Trump asked for Flynn's resignation because he had misled Vice President Mike Pence over his dealings with Russia and whether he had discussed sanctions with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. before Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. Flynn previously had denied those conversations to Pence and other top officials. \n He warned in a pair of tweets today that \"low-life leakers\" of classified information will be caught. As journalists were being escorted out of the breakfast meeting, Trump responded to a reporter's question on the subject by saying: \"We're going to find the leakers\" and \"they're going to pay a big price.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump says White House 'fine-tuned machine,' despite turmoil"}

Restaurant owners with immigrant roots of their own were among those acting in solidarity with workers. \n Expensive restaurants and fast-food joints alike closed, some perhaps because they had no choice, others because of what they said was sympathy for their immigrant employees. Sushi bars, Brazilian steakhouses, Mexican eateries and Thai and Italian restaurants all turned away lunchtime customers. \n \"The really important dynamic to note is this is not antagonistic, employee-against-employer,\" said Janet Murguia, president of the Hispanic rights group National Council of La Raza. \"This is employers and workers standing together, not in conflict.\" \n She added: \"Businesses cannot function without immigrant workers today.\" \n At a White House news conference held as the lunch-hour protests unfolded, Trump boasted of his border security measures and immigration arrests of hundreds of people in the past week, saying, \"We are saving lives every single day.\" \n Since the end of 2007, the number of foreign-born workers employed in the U.S. has climbed by nearly 3.1 million to 25.9 million; they account for 56 percent of the increase in U.S. employment over that period, according to the Labor Department. \n Roughly 12 million people are employed in the restaurant industry, and immigrants make up the majority \u2014 up to 70 percent in places like New York and Chicago, according to the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, which works to improve working conditions. An estimated 1.3 million in the industry are immigrants in the U.S. illegally, the group said. \n The construction industry, which likewise employs large numbers of immigrants, also felt the effects of Thursday's protest. \n Shea Frederick, who owns a small construction company in Baltimore, showed up at 7 a.m. at a home he is renovating and found that he was all alone, with a load of drywall ready for install. He soon understood why: His crew, five immigrants, called to say they weren't coming to work. They were joining the protests. \n \"I had an entire day of full work,\" he said. \"I have inspectors lined up to inspect the place, and now they're thrown off, and you do it the day before the weekend and it pushes things off even more. It sucks, but it's understandable.\" \n Frederick said that while he fundamentally agrees with the action, and appreciates why his crew felt the need to participate, he feels his business is being made to suffer as a result of the president's policies. \n \"It's hurting the wrong people,\" he said. \"A gigantic part of this state didn't vote this person in, and we're paying for his terrible decisions.\" \n There were no immediate estimates of how many students stayed home in various cities. Many student absences may not be excused, and some people who skipped work will lose a day's pay or perhaps even their jobs. But organizers and participants argued the cause was worth it. \n Marcela Ardaya-Vargas, who is from Bolivia and now lives in Falls Church, Virginia, pulled her son out of school to take him to a march in Washington. \n \"When he asked why he wasn't going to school, I told him because today he was going to learn about immigration,\" she said, adding: \"Our job as citizens is to unite with our brothers and sisters.\" \n Carmen Solis, a Mexico-born U.S. citizen, took the day off from work as a project manager and brought her two children to a rally in Chicago. \n \"I feel like our community is going to be racially profiled and harassed,\" she said of Trump's immigration policies. \"It's very upsetting. People like to take out their anger on the immigrants, but employers are making profits off of them. \" \n On Ninth Street in South Philadelphia's Italian Market, it was so quiet in the morning that Rani Vasudeva thought it might be Monday, when many of the businesses on the normally bustling stretch are closed. \n Produce stands and other stalls along \"Calle Nueve\" \u2014 as 9th Street is more commonly known for its abundance of Mexican-owned businesses \u2014 stood empty, leaving customers to look elsewhere for fresh meat, bread, fruits and vegetables. \n \"It's actually very sad,\" said Vasudeva, a 38-year-old professor at Temple University. \"You realize the impact the immigrant community has. We need each other for our daily lives.\" \n In New Orleans' Mid-City neighborhood, whose Latino population swelled after the damage wrought by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 created lots of jobs for construction workers, the Ideal Market was closed. The place is usually busy at midday with people lining up at the steam tables for hot lunches or picking from an array of fresh Central American vegetables and fruits. \n In Chicago, Pete's Fresh Market closed five of its 12 grocery stores and assured employees they would not be penalized for skipping the day, according to owner Vanessa Dremonas, whose Greek-immigrant father started the company. \n \"It's in his DNA to help immigrants,\" she said. \"We've supported immigrants from the beginning.\" \n Among the well-known establishments that closed in solidarity were three of acclaimed chef Silvana Salcido Esparza's restaurants in Phoenix; Michelin star RASA in San Francisco; and Washington's Oyamel and Jaleo, run by chef Jose Andres. \n Tony and Marie Caschera, both 66, who were visiting Washington from Halfmoon, New York, thought a tapas restaurant looked interesting for lunch, but then realized the lights were off and the place was closed. \n \"I'm in support of what they're trying to say,\" said Marie Caschera, a registered Democrat, adding that immigrants are \"fearful for their communities.\" \n Her husband, a registered Republican whose family emigrated from Italy before World War II, said he supports legal immigration, but added: \"I don't like illegal aliens here.\" \n Associated Press writers Sophia Tareen in Chicago; Juliet Linderman in Baltimore; David Saleh Rauf in Austin, Texas; Alex Brandon in Washington; Kevin McGill in New Orleans; and Russell Contreras in Albuquerque contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'Day Without Immigrants' protest closes U.S. restaurants"}

{"date": "February 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n R. Alexander Acosta talked to reporters during a Jan. 2008 news conference in Miami. President Donald Trump said he's chosen Acosta to be labor secretary. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump announced he would nominate Alexander Acosta for Labor Secretary, today, in the East Room of the White House in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump today announced law school dean R. Alexander Acosta as his new labor secretary nominee, one day after his original pick abruptly withdrew from consideration. \n Trump said Acosta, who did not appear with the president, \"has had a tremendous career.\" He noted that, unlike Andrew Puzder, Acosta has been confirmed by the Senate three times and \"did very, very well.\" \n If confirmed anew by the Senate, Acosta would become the first Hispanic member of Trump's Cabinet. He is now dean of the Florida International University law school. \n Puzder, a fast-food CEO, pulled out on Wednesday after it became clear he lacked the votes to win Senate confirmation. \n Trump said he had spoken with Acosta before coming to the East Room for the hastily arranged news conference, where he made the announcement. \n \"I wish him the best,\" Trump said. At a White House event earlier, he had described Acosta \u2014 without identifying him \u2014 as a \"star\" and a \"great person.\" \n Acosta has served on the National Labor Relations Board and as a federal prosecutor in Florida. He was named assistant attorney general for civil rights by President George W. Bush. \n Hispanic groups praised the nomination, and Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican who backed Puzder and will chair Acosta's confirmation hearing, said Acosta's prior Senate confirmations means the \"nomination is off to a good start.\" \n Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, called Acosta an \"outstanding choice.\" \n \"His record reflects a skill set and expertise both in the private and public sector which will serve the administration and the nation greatly,\" Palomarez said in a statement. He said the chamber looks forward to working with Acosta on a host of economic and labor issues. \n Puzder pulled out of the process on the eve of his confirmation hearing, which had been scheduled for today, because Republicans balked at an array of personal and professional issues that dogged him. Puzder said he had employed \u2014 and belatedly paid taxes on \u2014 a housekeeper not authorized to work in the United States. \n Puzder's withdrawal was the latest example of the disorganized nature of the new administration, not known for thorough vetting of its people or its plans. Contentious confirmation fights, a botched rollout of Trump's refugee order and the ouster this week of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn have nearly paralyzed the administration. \n With regard to Puzder, Republicans grumbled about the stream of \"distractions,\" including the torrent of criticism about his personal life and record as CEO of CKE Restaurants, Inc. \n What ultimately drained Puzder of enough Republican support for confirmation was his acknowledgment \u2014 well after Trump had become president \u2014 of employing a housekeeper who was not authorized to work in the U.S. \n Puzder said he had fired the employee about five years ago. But he did not pay the related taxes until after Trump nominated him on Dec. 9. Puzder said he paid the taxes as soon as he found they were owed, but there was no explanation of why he didn't know or pay for five years. \n Spokesman George Thompson said Wednesday that Puzder did not tell the White House about the housekeeper issue until after he had been nominated. \n It's unclear whether Trump's aides asked the immigration question before the nomination even though such issues have sunk past presidential nominees. Trump has also taken a hard line on people in the U.S. illegally. \n Individuals interviewed during the transition said Trump's team did not ask them to provide vetting information, raising questions about the level of scrutiny. \n Ultimately, Republicans made it clear that Puzder lacked the votes in a chamber narrowly split between Republicans and Democrats. \n Democrats, labor and other groups also had other reasons for opposing Puzder, including his corporate background and opposition to such proposals as a big hike in the minimum wage. They argued that that stance made him an unfit advocate for American workers at the top of an agency charged with enforcing worker protections. They rolled out stories from workers who said they were treated badly at Puzder's company. And they were ready to make women and his workers part of the confirmation hearing. Puzder was quoted in Entrepreneur magazine in 2015 as saying, \"I like beautiful women eating burgers in bikinis.\" He said the racy commercials for Carl's Jr., one of his companies, were \"very American.\" \n Democrats also said Puzder had disparaged workers at his restaurants. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump names Acosta as new choice to become labor secretary"}

Chris Christie and his wife Mary Pat Christie watched, on Feb. 14, as President Donald Trump signed House Joint Resolution 41 in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. \n HACKENSACK, N.J. >> A New Jersey judge ruled for the second time that a criminal complaint against Gov. Chris Christie can go forward, saying today there's probable cause to believe he knew lane closings at the George Washington Bridge in 2013 were more than just a routine traffic study. \n Applause erupted in Municipal Court Judge Roy McGeady's courtroom when he said there was probable cause to charge the Republican with official misconduct for failing to act to stop the lane closures and subsequent gridlock, part of an alleged political retribution scheme against a Democratic mayor who didn't endorse Christie. \n There is \"probable cause to believe the governor knew this was more than just an ordinary and productive traffic study and the consequences were upsetting to the mayor of Fort Lee,\" McGeady said. The judge set a March 10 date for Christie to answer the criminal summons, though it's unclear if he will have to appear in person. \n Christie's office called McGeady's ruling \"a complete non-event\" and said that he ignored a previous ruling that finding probable cause was flawed. Neither Christie nor his attorney attended the second probable cause hearing two weeks ago or today's hearing. \n The misconduct complaint was filed last fall by William Brennan, a retired firefighter who has mounted a campaign for governor. Last fall, McGeady issued a finding of probable cause, but a higher court sent the case back to him after ruling Christie should have been represented at the initial hearing and Brennan should have been subject to cross-examination. \n For Christie to go on trial, the case would have to be presented to a grand jury, which would have to hand up an indictment. \n Today's development comes as Christie, whose approval ratings have sunk below 20 percent in recent months, has gained traction with the passage of anti-opioid legislation, a cause he has championed. This week, he met with President Donald Trump to discuss the opioid crisis. \n It is unclear how quickly \u2014 or even whether \u2014 the case will move forward. Last month, the Bergen County prosecutor's office, which would prosecute the case, wrote in a letter that it wouldn't pursue charges because it didn't feel the evidence could prove official misconduct beyond a reasonable doubt. \n Brennan has contended that demonstrates bias inherent in the relationship between Christie and the prosecutor's office, and he renewed his call today for a special prosecutor to be named. \n \"This judge has once again violated the Governor's constitutional rights and intentionally ignored the earlier ruling by Assignment Judge Mizdol,\" Christie spokesman Brian Murray said in a statement. \"The judge is violating the law, pure and simple. This concocted claim was investigated for three months by the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, which summarily dismissed it, after concluding that the very same evidence relied upon again by this judge was utter nonsense.\" \n Two former Christie aides were convicted of federal charges in November. Brennan based his complaint on testimony during that trial, which he said shows Christie lied about when he knew about the alleged plot or its motives. Christie didn't testify at the federal trial and has denied prior knowledge of the plot. \n McGeady quoted directly from the trial testimony of former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly, who testified she told the governor about the traffic study and Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich's complaints that he was being targeted. \n He also quoted from former bridge authority official David Wildstein, who testified Christie laughed and made a joke about the traffic jams and Sokolich's calls not being returned when told about it at a Sept. 11 memorial ceremony, while the lane closures were in progress. \n McGeady said he found it \"very puzzling that the governor of New Jersey would seem to be pleased with the fact that the mayor of a major city expressing concern about traffic jams would go unanswered seemingly with the governor's approval.\" \n Christie knew about the purported traffic study and about Sokolich's concerns and had inherent control over Kelly, his subordinate, McGeady said, and \"at the very least could have had her reach out to Fort Lee \u2014 but he chose not to do that.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Judge: Bridge case complaint against New Jersey governor can proceed"}

Antonio Trillanes IV first alleged Duterte had unexplained wealth during the presidential campaign last year. He told a news conference he was raising the issue again because Duterte has not yet bared details of the more than $40 million he allegedly kept in bank accounts as a former city mayor. \n Trillanes, one of Duterte's harshest critics and a navy officer once detained for a failed coup plot against a former president, said he would resign if Duterte can disprove the allegations. \n Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said Duterte would not release those bank details \"in response to grandstanding,\" but suggested the president may do so as part of a legal process. \n Duterte, who took office in June, has denied amassing ill-gotten wealth. His daughter, Mayor Inday Sara Duterte of southern Davao city, reacted to the allegations by saying if Trillanes could show where her alleged unexplained wealth \"is right now and how it became illegal, let's get it and I'll give it to all of you.\" \n \"I know he will not release and he will not accept my challenge because it will be proven that he is really a corrupt official,\" Trillanes said. \n In May, Trillanes released documents he said were handed to him by a concerned citizen purportedly showing $48 million flowed into Duterte's various bank accounts from 2006 to 2015, representing alleged unexplained wealth the mayor failed to declare as required by law. \n Trillanes and Duterte's lawyer then went to a branch of the Bank of the Philippines Islands, where Duterte and his daughter allegedly had an undeclared deposit of more than $4 million in a joint account. \n Lawyer Salvador Panelo said that Duterte had authorized him to request the bank to open the account but that bank officials told him it would take seven days to study the request. Trillanes said the account has not been opened to scrutiny. \n Duterte has projected himself as a politician who rose from poverty and still lives a modest life in a rundown house in Davao city, where he served as a longtime mayor.

Earl Blumenauer of Oregon says he's initiating this effort in response to Republican Donald Trump's presidency, even though there have been no signs of an effort to remove him. \n \"Like many people, I've noticed a renewed interest in the 25th Amendment as we've seen erratic behavior out of the White House,\" Blumenauer said in a statement. \"As I examined the amendment, it became clear that in the case of mental or emotional incapacity, there is a glaring flaw.\" \n The 25th Amendment was ratified in 1967 as a response to President John F. Kennedy's death in 1963. It made clear that the vice president becomes president if a president is removed from office or dies or resigns, and that the new president nominates a new vice president. \n It also allows members of the executive branch to essentially force Congress to vote on whether to remove the president from office. The amendment states that the vice president and \"a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide\" can begin the process of removal if they believe the president is \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\" \n The flaw, Blumenauer says, is that the Cabinet may be fired by the president, \"undermining this ostensible check on an unstable president.\" He notes that the \"some other body\" is undefined, and there is no guidance for how it should operate. Blumenauer says he believes that living former presidents and vice presidents could form that body. \n It's unclear if anyone else has signed on to Blumenauer's effort.
