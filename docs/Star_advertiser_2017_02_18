Local firefighters were also assisting in the operation, the Coast Guard said. \n There were no reports of anyone missing or in distress at the time. \n Anyone with information that may help identify the ring's owner is asked to call Coast Guard Sector Honolulu at 842-2600. \n The Coast Guard urged the public to notify the Coast Guard of any lost survival or recreational gear to assist responders in determining actual distress situations. Commercial operators should also mark all life rings with the vessel name, the Coast Guard said. \n Earlier this month, the Coast Guard launched two searches after gear was found adrift. \n On Feb. 12, the Coast Guard launched an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter to search for the owner of dive gear found about a mile offshore of Hookipa Beach Park on Maui. The gear consisted of an orange dive boat, a dive flag and a wooden spear gun. The Maui Fire Department and county lifeguards assisted in that case. \n On Feb. 5, a Coast Guard helicopter crew was joined by a boat crew from Marine Corps Base Hawaii Waterfront Operations to search for the owner of a blue-and-white surfboard found adrift off Kaneohe Bay. \n ", "author": "By Rob Shikina rshikina@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Coast Guard seeks help identifying adrift life ring off Na Pali Coast"}

Your success is our success,\" Pence said. \"And ultimately, we walk into the future together.\" \n Merkel, speaking before Pence, told him and other leaders that \"acting together strengthens everyone.\" \n Her address came amid concerns among allies about the Trump administration's approach to international affairs and fears that the U.S. may have little interest in working in international forums. \n \"Will we be able to continue working well together, or will we all fall back into our individual roles?\" Merkel asked. \"Let's make the world better together and then things will get better for every single one of us.\" \n Trump has praised Britain's decision to leave the 28-nation EU. And a leading contender to be the next U.S. ambassador to the EU, Ted Malloch, has said Washington is \"somewhat critical and suspicious\" of the bloc and would prefer to work with countries bilaterally. \n Pence did not mention the European Union in his speech, something picked up on by French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault who wrote on Twitter: \"In Munich, Vice President Pence renews America's commitment to the Atlantic alliance. But not a word on the EU.\" \n Pence did say, however, that the U.S. was on a path of \"friendship with Europe and a strong North Atlantic alliance.\" \n German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel also indicated skepticism about Pence's pledges, saying that he agreed Europe needed to work with the U.S. on the basis of common values. But in a barely veiled reference to Trump, he said \"both countries must define their interests, and our foreign policies should not be driven by ideology.\" \n \"Ideologies lead to hostile concepts that might not be able to be overcome,\" said Gabriel, who is chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Merkel's junior coalition partner. \n Going ahead, he said Europeans \"should hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.\" \n In pledging the Trump administration's support for NATO, Pence said the U.S. expected all countries to live up to commitments to spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product spending into defense. \n \"Europe's defense requires your commitment as much as ours,\" he said. \n Merkel reiterated that Germany is committed to the 2 percent goal though Germany currently only contributes about 1.3 percent. \n \"We will do everything we can in order to fulfill this commitment,\" she said. \"But let me add, however, that I believe while NATO is very much in the European interest, it's also in the American interest \u2014 it's a very strong alliance where we are united together.\" \n Gabriel suggested that development aid and humanitarian moves \u2014 such as in Germany's decision to take in nearly 900,000 refugees last year \u2014 should also be part of the consideration when looking at defense spending. \n NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told The Associated Press, however, that both things were necessary. \n \"We need a comprehensive approach and of course development aid and funding for refugees is also very important,\" he said. \"But there's no contradiction between being focused on development aid and security \u2014 actually the only way we can create development is to preserve the peace. We need security to be able to facilitate economic development.\" \n Merkel, who met with Pence one-on-one following their speeches, acknowledged that Europeans couldn't fight global issues like Islamic extremist terrorism alone. \n \"We need the military power of the United States,\" she said. \n She renewed a call for Islamic religious authorities to speak \"clear words on the demarcation of peaceful Islam and terrorism in the name of Islam.\" \n U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told the security conference that Trump is working on a \"streamlined\" version of his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim nations to iron out the difficulties that landed his first order in the courts. \n Kelly said next time Trump will \"make sure that there's no one caught in the system of moving from overseas to our airports\" during the travel ban. \n The nations affected by the original ban were Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Kelly mentioned \"seven nations\" again on Saturday, leading to speculation they will all be included in Trump's next executive order on immigration. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pence offers 'unwavering' NATO pledge but leaves open questions"}

{"date": "February 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2016 \n Members of the industry group Club Owners Against Sex Trafficking attended a presentation given by a U.S. Department of Homeland Security agent on spotting sex traffickers held in Burbank, Calif. \n LAS VEGAS >> A yearlong academic study of sex trafficking in Las Vegas is providing a glimpse into a shadowy world beneath the neon glow where underage girls, threatened by pimps, solicit for business in casinos, on streets and online. \n Of 190 identified sex-trafficking victims in 2014, Arizona State University researchers found two-thirds were under 18 years old, one in five was brought to southern Nevada from somewhere else and more than half were never reported as missing. \n \"These are kids that nobody even cares enough about to report missing,\" said Laura Meltzer, a Las Vegas police officer involved in the report's roll-out. \"As a mom, that breaks my heart.\" \n A victim advocate in the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Elynne Greene, called them \"throwaway kids.\" She said many are products of the foster care system. \n The average underage victim in the study was 16. The youngest was 12. \n About one in three victims was recruited by a boyfriend-turned-\"violent, fear-based\" abuser, with more than half reporting being forced through physical assault involving a gun, knife, razor or cord. \n The average trafficker was 29 years old, and 80 percent of them had criminal histories. Most came from outside Nevada, and most of those were from California. \n Some said they were told their families would be targeted if they didn't cooperate. \n \"They are violently forced into this,\" said Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, director of the ASU Office of Sex Trafficking Intervention Research, which conducted the study of a sex trade that's been made part of a \"Sin City\" image and reinforced by a misperception that prostitution is legal in Las Vegas. \n While brothels are legal in rural counties, prostitution is illegal in Clark and Washoe counties, home to Nevada's largest cities, Las Vegas and Reno. And while sex trafficking has drawn increasing attention in recent years from local, state and federal elected officials, it has been hard to measure and difficult to stop. \n The report aims to provide data for police, prosecutors, parents and the public about who sex traffickers are and how they recruit, sell and keep victims, Roe-Sepowitz said. \n The report also pointed to difficulties prosecuting accused sex traffickers. Only 34 of the 159 cases studied, or a little more than one in five, resulted in convictions. \n \"It's a fight that will never be easy,\" said Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson, whose office offers victim advocates and a prosecutor who specializes in sex-trafficking cases. \"As prosecutors, we need witnesses to come to court to be able to prosecute cases. Often, they're young, unwilling, uncooperative and fearful.\" \n Roe-Sepowitz called the report a snapshot, but she said the ASU School of Social Work planned updates based on reports of prostitution arrests from 2015 and 2016. \n \"We really have to find new tools for law enforcement to work to get that trafficker off the streets, or he'll find someone else to traffic in five minutes,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Study finds underage, fearful women in Vegas sex trafficking"}

{"date": "February 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Inspectors examined a sinkhole in Studio City today. Two vehicles fell into the 20-foot sinkhole on Friday night and firefighters had to rescue one woman who escaped her car but was found standing on her overturned vehicle. \n LOS ANGELES >> A huge Pacific storm that parked itself over Southern California and unloaded, ravaging roads, opening sinkholes and leading to the deaths of at least three people, eased off today. But it was only a temporary reprieve as new storms took aim farther north. \n The National Weather Service predicted drying weather through Sunday followed by the return of wet weather in the region. But while flash-flood watches for Southern California were canceled, Northern California and the San Francisco Bay Area were facing a weekend return of heavy rain and winds that lashed them earlier in the week before the storm moves out. \n \"Stronger southerly winds and widespread flooding will be likely as an atmospheric river (of moisture) takes aim somewhere along the central California Coast,\" a weather statement warned. \n The approaching rain could cause more problems in the far north, where damage to spillways of the Lake Oroville dam forced the evacuation of 188,000 people last weekend. As of today, the lake's water elevation had fallen more than 45 feet. \n Meanwhile, authorities up and down the state were dealing with the fallout, including overflowing creeks, mudslide threats in foothill areas denuded by previous fires, road collapses and hundreds of toppled trees in neighborhoods. \n Northwest of Sacramento, nearly 200 people were evacuated today as overflowing creeks turned the town of Maxwell into a brown pond, with some homes getting 2 feet of water. Fire Chief Kenny Cohen said nearly 100 homes and the elementary school filled with a couple inches of water before the water began receding. The area received about 3 inches of rain as of this morning. \n No injuries were reported. \n Cheri Azevedo said her garage had 2 feet of water, but her home had been spared. Others on her block and nearby were not as lucky, as all of them were evacuated. \n \"It is heartbreaking,\" she told the San Francisco Chronicle. \n Southern California appeared to dodge any major disasters, but in the desert town of Victorville, several cars were washed down a flooded street, and one man was found dead in a submerged vehicle after others were rescued, San Bernardino County fire spokesman Eric Sherwin said. \n And in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles, a man was electrocuted when a tree falling in heavy rain downed power lines that hit his car. \n In the Studio City area of Los Angeles, a sinkhole swallowed two cars, the second on live TV as viewers watched it teeter on the edge before plunging in. One driver was taken to the hospital in fair condition. \n Inland at the Cajon Pass, the shoulder of Interstate 15 crumbled and sent a parked firetruck spilling over the side, but no one was hurt. The California Department of Transportation estimated emergency repairs to the freeway would cost $3 million. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Rain eases in Southern California; north facing renewed storm"}
