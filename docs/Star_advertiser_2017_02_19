Pictures shows Batman, voiced by Will Arnett, in a scene from \"The Lego Batman Movie.\" \n NEW YORK >> \"The Great Wall\" was a hit in China. In North America, it was a dud. \n The most expensive film ever made in China and with a budget of $150 million, \"The Great Wall\" was intended to prove that the world's No. 2 movie marketplace could produce Hollywood-sized blockbusters of its own. Though it ran up $171 million in ticket sales in China, \"The Great Wall\" pulled in $18.1 million in its North American debut over Presidents Day weekend, according to studio estimates today. \n That was good enough for third place, falling behind last weekend's top two films, \"The Lego Batman\" and \"Fifty Shades Darker.\" The Warner Bros. animated release easily led the box office again with $34.2 million in its second week, sliding only 35 percent. Universal's \"Fifty Shades Darker\" sold $21 million in tickets in its second week. The erotic sequel continues to play well overseas, where it led international business with $43.7 million over the weekend. \n Slammed by critics, \"The Great Wall\" didn't measure up to its initial ambitions. It was produced by Legendary Entertainment, which has since been acquired by Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group. The film, directed by Zhang Yimou, originated with an idea by Legendary chief executive Thomas Tull, who exited the company last month. \n But \"The Great Wall\" isn't a bomb. It has made $244.6 million overseas and performed over the weekend in North America slightly better than some pundits expected. \n \"This is absolutely a strategy that's worldwide,\" said Nick Carpou, distribution chief for Universal. \"Worldwide, we are one of many markets.\" \n Universal could still claim four of the top 10 films, the other two being \"A Dog's Purpose\" ($5.6 million in its fourth week) and \"Split\" ($7 million in its fifth week), so far the top film of 2017. \n More East-West productions like \"The Great Wall\" are sure to follow. Studios already regularly partner with Chinese film companies on everything from \"Transformers: Age of Extinction\" to \"Warcraft,\" a flop in the U.S. and Canada with $47.4 million, but a $220.8 million hit in China. \n Films like \"The Great Wall\" and \"Warcraft,\" however, prove that finding the right balance between American and Chinese tastes remains a difficult balancing act. \n For Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore, the more significant factor for \"The Great Wall\" wasn't its multi-national origins but its Rotten Tomatoes rating: a dismal 36 percent \"fresh.\" \n \"Just like every movie irrespective of country of origin, reviews matter,\" said Dergarabedian. \"Audiences only care about the movie. They don't necessary care where it came from.\" \n Two other new releases, both from 20th Century Fox, also failed to catch on. The comedy \"Fist Fight,\" starring Ice Cube and Charlie Day as feuding high-school teachers, opened with $12 million. \n And Gore Verbinski's gothic horror \"A Cure for Wellness\" \u2014 his follow-up to the box-office bomb \"The Lone Ranger\" \u2014 made just $4.2 million, a result that won't help the director's standing in the industry.

{"date": "February 19, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chaired the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem today. \n JERUSALEM >> Israel's prime minister turned down a regional peace initiative last year that was brokered by then-U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, former American officials confirmed today, in apparent contradiction to Benjamin Netanyahu's stated goal of involving regional Arab powers in resolving Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. \n Netanyahu took part in a secret summit that Kerry organized in the southern Jordanian port city of Aqaba last February and included Jordan's King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi. The secret meeting was first reported by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz1 \n According to two former Obama administration officials, Kerry proposed regional recognition of Israel as a Jewish state \u2014 a key Netanyahu demand \u2014 alongside a renewal of peace talks with the Palestinians with the support of the Arab countries. \n Netanyahu rejected the offer, which would have required a significant pullout from occupied land, saying he would not be able to garner enough support for it in his hard-line coalition government. \n The initiative also appeared to be the basis of short-lived talks with moderate opposition leader Isaac Herzog to join the government, a plan that quickly unraveled when Netanyahu chose to bring in nationalist leader Avigdor Lieberman instead and appoint him defense minister. \n Herzog tweeted today that \"history will definitely judge the magnitude of the opportunity as well as the magnitude of the missed opportunity.\" \n Two former top aides to Kerry confirmed that the meeting took place secretly on Feb. 21, 2016. According to the officials, Kerry tried to sweeten the 15-year-old \"Arab Peace Initiative,\" a Saudi-led plan that offered Israel peace with dozens of Arab and Muslim nations in return for a pullout from territories captured in the 1967 Mideast war to make way for an independent Palestine. \n Among the proposed changes were Arab recognition of Israel as the Jewish state, recognition of Jerusalem as a shared capital for Israelis and Palestinians, and softened language on the \"right of return\" of Palestinian refugees to lost properties in what is now Israel, the former officials said. \n The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were still not authorized to discuss the secret meeting publicly, said the Egyptian and Jordanian leaders reacted positively to the proposal, while Netanyahu refused to commit to anything beyond meetings with the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. \n One of the officials said the main purpose of the meeting was to start a regional peace process that Netanyahu said he wanted. However, he said it was not clear if the Arab states would have gone along with it either. \n He said it appeared that Netanyahu was not interested in more than meeting Abbas and some Arab leaders and promising unspecified confidence building steps. This was not enough for anyone at the meeting and would not have been enough to get other Arab states to even express willingness to pursue a regional approach, the former official said. \n \"We saw it as building on, or updating, but certainly not superseding\" the 2002 Arab initiative, one of the officials said. \n A second former official said other Gulf Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, along with the Palestinians, the Europeans and the Russians, were also consulted as part of the process. \n The officials said opposition inside Netanyahu's hard-line government, which is dominated by nationalists opposed to Palestinian independence, presented a formidable obstacle. But he said the Arab partners also showed varying degrees of enthusiasm, with the Palestinians most concerned about concessions forced on them. \n In Cairo, el-Sissi's office issued a statement late Sunday that appeared to implicitly confirm that the meeting took place. It said Egypt been working toward a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \"It is in this framework that Egypt has sought to bring closer the positions of the relevant parties and supported any meetings or initiatives aimed at discussing Practical ideas that would revive the peace process,\" said the statement without directly mentioning the Aqaba meeting. \n Netanyahu himself did not address the newspaper report in his weekly Cabinet meeting and his office refused to comment. Instead, the prime minister focused on last week's visit to Washington to meet new President Donald Trump. \n At that meeting, both Trump and Netanyahu talked of searching for new ways forward with the Palestinians and raised the possibility of involving the broader Arab world in a new peace process. \n Netanyahu called the meeting \"historic\" and one that strengthened the two countries' longtime alliance. He said at the end of meeting, Trump shook his hand and told him it was a \"new day\" in Israeli-American relations. \n After eight years of testy ties with Barack Obama, Netanyahu seems to be relishing Trump's warm embrace. The new president has broken from his predecessor in adopting friendlier positions to the Israeli government regarding a tough line on Iran, a vaguer stance on Palestinian statehood and a more lenient approach to West Bank settlements. \n Netanyahu said the two leaders see \"eye to eye\" on Iran and a host of other issues. \"There is a new day and it is a good day,\" he said. \n But in a joint press conference last week, behind the warm smiles there were signs of trouble ahead. \n Trump asked Netanyahu to \"hold off\" on Jewish settlement construction in occupied territories the Palestinians claim for a future state. Netanyahu said Sunday that the sides have formed joint teams to coordinate settlement construction. \n In a striking departure from longtime American policy, Trump also refrained from supporting a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \n While this pleased Netanyahu's hard line coalition partners, Trump still said whatever solution is reached would have to be acceptable to both sides. \n That has raised questions about what kind of agreement could be reached. The alternative, a single binational state, could require Israel to grant citizenship to millions Palestinians under its control, threatening its status as a Jewish-majority democracy. \n Lieberman, the Israeli defense minister, said that for him a Palestinian state remains the preferred outcome \u2014 and it should come through the type of regional structure Netanyahu reportedly rejected. \n \"My vision, it's the endgame no doubt, two-state solution. I believe that it's necessary for us to keep the Jewish state,\" he said at the Munich Security Conference. \"The Palestinians don't have capacity to sign a lone final status agreement with Israel. It's possible only as a part of an all-regional solution, not an incremental process but simultaneously.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ex-officials say Israeli leader spurned secret peace offer"}

{"date": "February 19, 2017", "text": "NASA TV via AP \n In this image from NASA TV, the SpaceX Falcon rocket launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sunday. \n CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. >> A SpaceX rocket soared from NASA's long-idled moonshot pad today, sending up space station supplies from the exact spot where astronauts embarked on the lunar landings nearly a half-century ago. \n It was the first flight from NASA's legendary Launch Complex 39A since the shuttle program ended almost six years ago, and SpaceX's first liftoff from Florida since a rocket explosion last summer. \n The crowds at Kennedy Space Center watched eagerly as the unmanned Falcon 9 rocket took flight with a cargo ship bound for the International Space Station. They got barely 10 seconds of viewing before clouds swallowed up the Falcon as it thundered skyward. \n As an extra special treat, SpaceX landed its leftover booster back at Cape Canaveral several minutes after liftoff, a feat accomplished only twice before. Most of the company's booster landings \u2014 rocket recycling at its finest \u2014 have used ocean platforms. As they did during the shuttle era, sonic booms heralded the booster's return. \n Flight controllers at SpaceX headquarters in Southern California cheered as the 15-story booster landed upright at its designated parking spot at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. \n SpaceX chief Elon Musk celebrated the successful touchdown via Twitter. \n \"Baby came back,\" he tweeted. \n The celebratory roar grew when the Dragon cargo ship successfully reached orbit a few minutes later. It will reach the space station Wednesday, delivering 5,500 pounds of food, clothes and experiments. \n It was SpaceX's second launch attempt in a row. Saturday's effort was foiled by last-minute rocket concerns. The repairs paid off, and even the clouds parted enough to ensure a safe flight. \n Musk said he's honored to use Launch Complex 39A. The company hopes to launch astronauts from this very spot next year, bringing U.S. crew launches back to home soil after a longer-than-intended hiatus. SpaceX Mars missions, first robots then people, could follow from here. \n Kennedy Space Center's director Robert Cabana, a former shuttle commander who flew four times from 39A, is thrilled to see the pad used for commercial flights like this \"instead of just sitting out there and rusting away.\" It's a stark contrast, he noted, to the depression that followed the final shuttle mission in 2011. \n \"It's just really an exciting time,\" Cabana said minutes before liftoff. \n It was a momentous comeback for SpaceX. The last time SpaceX had a rocket ready to fly from Florida, it blew up on a neighboring Cape Canaveral pad during prelaunch testing on Sept. 1. Although the company successfully returned to flight last month from California, the focus was on getting leased Launch Complex 39A ready for action given that the pad with the accident was left unusable. \n Built in the mid-1960s for the massive Saturn V moon rockets, Launch Complex 39A has now seen 95 launches. Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins left Earth from here on July 16, 1969, on the first moon-landing mission. The very first space shuttle pilots, John Young and Robert Crippen, soared from here on April 12, 1981. And in a grand shuttle finale, Atlantis took off from here on July 8, 2011. \n NASA signed over 39A to SpaceX in 2014 under a 20-year lease. \n Last week, the U.S. Government Accountability Office warned the commercial crew launches by SpaceX and Boeing are at risk of slipping into 2019. \"The hell we won't fly before 2019,\" SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told reporters in response. \n In a tweet Saturday, Musk said the company has already \"retired\" so much research and development risk on the crew Dragon capsule \"that I feel very confident of 2018.\" \n As for the second-stage steering issue that cropped up Saturday, SpaceX hustled to replace an engine part before Sunday morning's try. Musk said he personally called Saturday's launch off, saying he was unwilling to risk something going wrong. \n SpaceX has spent tens of millions of dollars to make 39A Falcon-ready. By the time astronauts climb into a Dragon capsule for liftoff, Shotwell said, pad renovations will exceed $100 million. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "SpaceX launches rocket from NASA's historic moon pad"}

{"date": "February 19, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People carried posters during a rally in support of Muslim Americans in Times Square today. \n WASHINGTON >> A draft of President Donald Trump's revised immigration ban targets the same seven countries listed in his original executive order and exempts travelers who already have a visa to travel to the U.S., even if they haven't used it yet. \n A senior administration official said the order, which Trump revised after federal courts held up his original immigration and refugee ban, will target only those same seven Muslim-majority countries \u2014 Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya. \n The official said that green-card holders and dual citizens of the U.S. and any of those countries are exempt. The new draft also no longer directs authorities to single out \u2014 and reject \u2014 Syrian refugees when processing new visa applications. \n The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before it's made public. The official noted that the draft is subject to change ahead of its signing, which Trump said could come sometime this week. \n Asked about the revised order, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the document circulating was a draft and that a final version should be released soon. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n The Wall Street Journal also reported that the current draft of the revised order focused on the seven countries but excluded those with green cards. \n Trump's original executive order triggered chaos at airports around the world, as travelers were detained when the order rapidly went into effect, U.S. permanent residents known as green-card holders among them. Attorneys provided legal assistance to those held and protesters descended on the airports as news of the order's implementation spread. In its original form, the order temporarily suspended all travel to the U.S. for citizens of those seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. \n The original order also called for Homeland Security and State department officials, along with the director of national intelligence, to review what information the government needs to fully vet would-be visitors and come up with a list of countries that can't or won't make the information available. It said the government will give countries 60 days to start providing the information or citizens from those countries will be barred from traveling to the United States. \n Even if Syrian refugees are no longer automatically rejected under the new order, the pace of refugees entering the U.S. from all countries is likely to slow significantly. That's because even when the courts put Trump's original ban on hold, they left untouched Trump's 50,000-per-year refugee cap, a cut of more than half from the cap under the Obama administration. \n The U.S. has already taken in more than 35,000 refugees this year, leaving less than 15,000 spots before hitting Trump's cap, according to a U.S. official. That means that for the rest of this fiscal year, the number of refugees being let in per week will likely fall to a fraction of what it had been under the Obama administration's cap of 110,000. \n Earlier this month, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco refused to reinstate Trump's ban, unanimously rejecting the administration's claim of presidential authority, questioning its motives and concluding that the order was unlikely to survive legal challenges. The pushback prompted Trump to tweet \"SEE YOU IN COURT!\" and he has since lashed out at the judicial branch, accusing it of issuing a politically motivated decision. \n Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said Saturday that Trump is working on a \"streamlined\" version of his executive order banning travel from the seven nations to iron out the difficulties that landed his first order in the courts. \n Speaking at the Munich Security Conference about combating terrorism, Kelly said Trump's original order was designed as a \"temporary pause\" to allow him to \"see where our immigration and vetting system has gaps \u2014 and gaps it has \u2014 that could be exploited.\" \n He said the Trump administration was surprised when U.S. courts blocked the executive order and now \"the president is contemplating releasing a tighter, more streamlined version\" of the travel ban. \n Kelly said this next time he will be able to \"make sure that there's no one caught in the system of moving from overseas to our airports.\" \n Kelly mentioned \"seven nations\" again on Saturday, leading to speculation they will all be included in Trump's next executive order. \n Trump's order sparked an immediate backlash and sowed chaos and outrage, with travelers detained at airports, panicked families searching for relatives and protesters marching against the sweeping measure \u2014 parts of which were blocked by several federal courts. \n Protests were held across the country, including in sight of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York City, and at international airports where travelers were temporarily detained. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's revised travel ban targets same countries, source says"}

The American president now says he was referring to something he saw on television. \n During a rally in Florida on Saturday, Trump said \"look what's happening last night in Sweden\" as he alluded to past terror attacks in Europe. It wasn't clear what he was referring to and there were no high-profile situations reported in Sweden on Friday night. \n The comment prompted a barrage of social media reaction on Sunday, with hundreds of tweets, and a local newspaper published a list of events that happened on Friday that appeared to have no connections to any terror-like activity. \n On Sunday, Trump took to Twitter to explain: \"My statement as to what's happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.\" A White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, says that Trump was talking about rising crime and recent incidents in general, not referring to a specific issue. \n The president may be referring to a segment aired Friday night on the Fox News Channel show \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" that reported Sweden had accepted more than 160,000 asylum-seekers last year but that only 500 of the migrants had found jobs in Sweden. The report, which was illustrated with video of broken windows and fires, went on to say that a surge in gun violence and rape had followed the influx of immigrants. \n Reacting to Trump's original remarks, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Catarina Axelsson said that the government wasn't aware of any \"terror-linked major incidents.\" Sweden's Security Police said it had no reason to change the terror threat level. \n \"Nothing has occurred which would cause us to raise that level,\" agency spokesman Karl Melin said. \n Former Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt tweeted , \"Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound.\" \n Sweden, which has a long reputation for welcoming refugees and migrants, had a record 163,000 asylum applications in 2015.

He said that while most people like Presidents Day for the sales, \"It's awesome to have that one designated day just to say 'Thank you.'\" \n PROVIDENCE, R.I. >> The United States on Monday marks Presidents Day, a holiday that's taking on a new meaning for some Americans this year as President Donald Trump \u2014 to the dismay of some and delight of others \u2014 upends traditional notions of the office. \n The holiday began as a celebration of George Washington's birthday, Feb. 22, and its official name remains Washington's Birthday. \n Throughout the 19th century, communities celebrated with parades and fireworks, said Evan Phifer, a research historian at the White House Historical Association. In the late 1800s, Feb. 22 became a federal holiday. \n The holiday was moved to the third Monday in February in 1971, creating a three-day weekend for many workers. \n \"There was fear when the holiday was moved to the third Monday that it would lose the distinction of Washington's birthday, and people would forget his legacy,\" Phifer said. \n To some extent, that has happened. Abraham Lincoln's birthday is Feb. 12, and many people now associate both presidents with the holiday. It has also become a retail holiday, where shoppers can get deals on cars, furniture and other goods during Presidents Day sales. \n The Associated Press spoke with people around the country about their ideas about Presidents Day, the presidency and how it is changing. \n Jack Warren is executive director of the Society of the Cincinnati, the nation's oldest patriotic organization, founded in 1783. George Washington was the first president general of the group. \n He calls the idea of Presidents Day \"wrongheaded\" and said referring to Washington's Birthday as Presidents Day is a reflection of how out of touch we are with our revolutionary origins. \n \"The revolution George Washington led created the first great republic since antiquity. It articulated ideals of universal liberty, natural rights and equality that have shaped the entire history of our country and have reached beyond it,\" he said. \n \"We don't need a holiday to commemorate the presidency. We do need one to commemorate our greatest national leader.\" \n Curt Viebranz is president and CEO of George Washington's Virginia estate, Mount Vernon. He expects between 10,000 and 15,000 people to visit on Monday. \n \"We wouldn't have a country without him,\" he said. \"We wouldn't have a republic.\" \n Many of the formal traditions of the presidency that survive today were established by Washington, he said, such as the open-air inauguration. But recent presidents are also different. \n \"He's not a man who would have been tweeting, for sure. It's not going to happen,\" he said. \n These days, people have a more informal connection to the institution: \"It's sort of the end of leadership as we know it, where the leader sets himself apart.\" \n Juathawala Harris, 67, of Baltimore, was on a trip to Dallas that included a visit to the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, which is dedicated to telling the story of the assassination of President John F.

That is not so for me now,\" said Harris, who voted for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. \n \"I am fearful now, and I've never been fearful in all of my years,\" she said, adding that she is scared the country may be moving toward a war. \n Presidents Day, she said, now feels tarnished. \n Robin Allweiss, a 56-year-old attorney from Tampa, Florida, considers herself a patriot and takes Presidents Day seriously \u2014 especially so this year. She is a Trump supporter and thinks he's vastly different than any other president in the country's history. \n \"He relates to us. He gives us a feeling that he could be our father, our brother, he could be our cousin or our best friend, and that's what makes him so different. He doesn't care what anybody thinks. What he wants to do is make America great again,\" she said. \n \"Donald Trump cares about us.

Kennedy speak one month before he was elected. \n Children as young as 6 have a sense of the president \u2014 who he is and what he does \u2014 long before they understand Congress or the judiciary, she said, and teaching children about the president is an important way to help them understand our government. \n \"I still have somewhat of a childlike vision of the presidency,\" she said. \"I know my faith is not misplaced. I know we have had heroic presidents. Even the ones who were not great still were, by and large, great people.\" \n The presidency began to demystify under Franklin Roosevelt, who created personal connections with Americans through his radio \"fireside chats\" in the depths of the Great Depression, she said. That familiarity eventually \"ended up breeding contempt, I think, for normal presidents, or traditional presidents.\" \n \"In the end, this has led to a Donald Trump, a populist demagogue in the White House,\" she said. \"The Trump presidency, based on the baser instincts of people, is painful to me. It feels like a desecration.\" \n Deen Brown, 94, of Oakdale, Connecticut, conducted submarine war patrols for the Navy during World War II. \n Brown said he has early memories of conversations in his home about Herbert Hoover, president from 1929 to 1933. \n \"What is most impressive to me, and I still believe this firmly today, is the awe of the momentous decisions that they're called on to make. It is just beyond belief. And this was true for President Roosevelt and also for President Harry Truman, and it may be coming true today,\" he said. \"And very often, they don't get to choose between right and wrong. That's too simple. \u2026 They must choose one of the wrongs and maybe the one that's least wrong.\" \n President Donald Trump has already changed the way people see the presidency, he said, because he's a businessman who is being more decisive than some of his predecessors. \n \"He certainly deserves the respect of the nation,\" he said. \n Rhonda Bicknell, 39, who is in real estate investment, is based in Phoenix but spends most of the year traveling in a motor coach. \n She said Presidents Day to her is \"really a day to honor that person that actually does a pretty thankless job \u2014 not matter what party you are in.\" \n A Democrat who voted for Hillary Clinton, she said presidents she has admired include Barack Obama and John F. Kennedy. \n She feels that President Donald Trump is \"disgracing\" the presidency. \n \"I don't think that this president has much class, or integrity, or even intelligence, to be honest,\" Bicknell said. \"So I think he's affected the presidency in a negative way, and I think that the rest of the world feels the same.\" \n George Davenport, 23, works two jobs \u2014 one as a dishwasher and the other as a street sign-holding Statue of Liberty for a tax preparation service in St. Petersburg, Florida.

{"date": "February 19, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n United States Vice President Mike Pence, left and Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, talk prior to their meeting during the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany. \n MUNICH >> U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was the latest in a trio of high-ranking Trump emissaries to tell European allies in person that the United States will steadfastly support NATO and demand that Russia honor its commitments to end fighting in Ukraine. \n Some European leaders, however, remain skeptical of whether Pence and the U.S. secretaries of state and defense actually speak for President Donald Trump. And they worry those declarations might easily be swept away at the whim of the mercurial American president. \n \"We are waiting for actions,\" said Polish President Andrzej Duda. \"We only know what the media has reported and the statements that we've got. Now we are waiting for actions of the new government of Donald Trump.\" \n European countries along Russia's border have been rattled by the prospect of deeper U.S.-Russia ties after Trump bucked the opinions of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders by suggesting that sanctions imposed on Russia over its intervention in Ukraine could be eased in exchange for a nuclear arms deal. \n Trump also raised eyebrows when he appeared to draw parallels between Russia and the U.S. when Bill O'Reilly of Fox News referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as \"a killer.\" Trump replied: \"We've got a lot of killers. What do you think? Our country's so innocent?\" \n In the days before his inauguration, Trump referred to NATO as \"obsolete\" in an interview, but said the 28-nation alliance remained important to him. He has since tempered his language and stressed the importance of NATO during telephone conversations with multiple foreign leaders. \n Pence, on his first overseas trip as vice president, tried to allay some of those fears in Munich on Saturday, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to NATO and promising that the U.S. would \"hold Russia accountable.\" \n Michael Chertoff, U.S. homeland security secretary under President George W. Bush, noted that Pence's comments were in line with similar assurances given by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis during a NATO meeting in Brussels this past week. \n \"They've all been consistent about the fact that there is a strong, deep and enduring commitment to Europe and to NATO and I think that message has been received,\" Chertoff said. \n The same day Mattis was in Brussels, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met with his Russian counterpart in Bonn, Germany, saying afterward that Russia must adhere to a 2015 deal to end fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. \n But whether Trump intends to put Pence's words into action remained a front-and-center issue at the Munich Security Conference. \n German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel was pressed after Pence's speech on whether he had doubts about Trump's commitment to NATO. \n \"I have no doubts that the American vice president, and also the defense minister, will do everything to take responsibility within NATO as in the past, and I don't think there is a big argument inside the American government,\" said Gabriel, who also is Germany's foreign minister. Asked about Trump's commitment, he said, \"Since I haven't spoken to him, I can only say what I discussed with Mr. Pence \u2014 I did that and there are no doubts there.\" \n U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee, also was in Munich and told NBC on Sunday: \"There's a lot of concern here about just who speaks for the administration and even certainly when things when a vice president and others say the right things, they wonder does the president stand behind this.\" \n Jeff Rathke, a senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Pence's words were likely reassuring to Europeans in light of the similar affirmations from Mattis and Tillerson. \n \"But everyone is aware that this is tentative until it is reaffirmed by the president in his own words,\" Rathke said in an email. \"One tweet or statement casting doubt on the Europeans or on NATO will call back into question all of what Pence and Mattis have been saying.\" \n Democrats are still stung by the conclusion by intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.

{"date": "February 19, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The auxiliary spillway, right, is under construction at Folsom Dam, in Folsom, Calif. Twelve years ago, widespread destruction from Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast helped compel federal engineers to spend nearly $1 billion constructing the auxiliary spillway at Folsom Dam, scheduled to be completed in 2017. \n LOS ANGELES >> Twelve years ago, widespread destruction from Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast helped compel federal engineers 2,000 miles away in California to remake a 1950s-era dam by constructing a massive steel-and-concrete gutter that would manage surging waters in times of torrential storms. \n The nearly $1 billion auxiliary spillway at Folsom Dam, scheduled to be completed later this year, stands in contrast to the troubles 75 miles away at the state-run Oroville Dam, where thousands of people fled last week after an eroded spillway threatened to collapse \u2014 a catastrophe that could have sent a 30-foot wall of floodwater gushing into three counties. \n Together, the two dams illustrate widely diverging conditions at the more than 1,000 dams across California, most of them decades old. The structures also underscore the challenge of maintaining older dams with outdated designs. \n \"Fifty years ago, when we were evaluating flood risk, the fundamental assessment was the climate was stable, not changing. We now know that is no longer true,\" said Peter Gleick, chief scientist with the Pacific Institute, a California-based think tank specializing in water issues. \n \"We need to look at the existing infrastructure with new eyes,\" he warned. \n Back in 2005, Katrina's deadly path became an arguing point for U.S. Rep. Doris Matsui, a California Democrat who was among those pushing Washington for improvements at Folsom Dam, perched 25 miles from 500,000 people living in Sacramento, the state capital. \n \"I used that, vigorously, to say we are the second-most at-risk river city in the nation,\" Matsui said, after the Category 5 storm swept through New Orleans. \n State officials now face questions about maintenance at Oroville Dam, the nation's tallest at 770 feet, and why a decade ago they dismissed warnings from environmentalists that more needed to be done to strengthen its earthen emergency spillway. \n After years of drought, Northern California has become waterlogged this winter from heavy rain and snow. Oroville Lake is brimming, and water managers have been using the main spillway, which is lined with concrete, to lower the water level. \n The emergency spillway is a brush-covered hillside below a masonry lip and had never been used until last weekend. When water gushed onto it, the ground began eroding, and it was feared the intake lip could collapse and water would surge down the hill. \n An investigation into what went wrong could take months. \n John France, vice president and technical expert on dams for the engineering consulting firm AECOM, said the problems at Oroville should raise alarms across the country. \n \"Most of the dams in the United States are over 50 years old, when we didn't understand floods as well as we do now. So we have a number of dams in the U.S. that have spillways that aren't large enough for the floods that they should be designed for,\" France said. \n Arguments over water, how it's stored and who gets it are as old as the state, and California has often been criticized for not doing more to improve its water systems as the population edges toward 40 million. \n In a place known for alternating cycles of prolonged drought and biblical rainfall, the idea of asking reservoirs to store extra water for dry times frequently clashes with environmentalists, who want to see rivers flow freely. \n At Oroville, opened in 1968, construction crews recently patched cracks on the main spillway, and a state inspector judged the repairs \"sound\" in a February 2015 report. However, a gaping hole ripped open on that spillway two weeks ago, starting the series of events that led to use of the emergency spillway and evacuation orders for nearly 200,000 people. \n Since then, crews dumped thousands of tons of rocks to shore up the damaged spillways and residents were allowed to return home Tuesday, after the lake level dropped. \n Butte County Supervisor Bill Connolly, whose district includes the dam, has criticized dam managers for years. \n \"They never spend money unless they have to,\" he said. \"If we were a federal facility, you don't see this happening.\" \n At 340-foot high Folsom Dam, operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the huge concrete-and-steel chute being constructed by the Army Corps of Engineers is expected to add as much as 40 percent capacity to the main spillway that controls water flowing from the reservoir behind it. \n It's designed to allow safer releases during times of high water, precisely the challenge that led to fears of catastrophic flooding at Oroville. \n Rick Poeppelman, chief of the Army Corps engineering division in the Sacramento district, said extensive data about probable maximum flood levels, not available decades ago, helped prompt the decision to build the auxiliary spillway at Folsom Dam. \n When completed, the spillway can act like a second dam, allowing operators to release water through a series of gates and lower the reservoir level when a major storm is approaching. It includes a chute more than half a mile long. Another advantage: The new spillway gates will be 50 feet lower than those on the dam, allowing for earlier releases of water. \n The government needs to test the spillway this year to see how it will work. Meanwhile, there are proposals to increase the height of the dam with the potential for extreme weather. \n In light of the Oroville crisis, Republican state Sen. Ted Gaines said he is considering asking the federal government for a safety review at Folsom Dam, the new spillway and nearby levees, given their proximity to Sacramento. \n It's not an abstract concern. \n During heavy storms in 1986, a temporary dam broke open, sending roaring waters downstream to Folsom Dam. In response, officials released more water from the dam than flood levees that guard Sacramento were designed to handle. \n That time they held. \n Given the scare at Oroville, \"I don't think we are out of the woods yet,\" Gaines said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "2 dams illustrate challenge of maintaining older designs"}

He is believed to have two sons and a daughter with two women living in Beijing and Macau. \n \"We haven't met the next of kin,\" Noor Rashid said. \"We are working, we are trying very hard to get the next of kin to come and to assist us in the investigation.\" \n The case has raised tensions between Malaysia and North Korea. Pyongyang demanded custody of Kim's body and strongly objected to an autopsy. The Malaysians went ahead with the procedure anyway, saying they were simply following procedure. \n Kang Chol, North Korea's ambassador to Malaysia, said that Malaysia may be \"trying to conceal something\" and that the autopsy was carried out \"unilaterally and excluding our attendance.\" \n South Korea has been quick to blame its enemies in North Korea for Kim's death. \n \"Considering North Korea has so far committed crimes against humanity and terror acts, we, together with the international community, are closely watching this brutal, reckless incident with serious concerns,\" South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon Hee told reporters Sunday. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Malaysia searches for 4 N.
