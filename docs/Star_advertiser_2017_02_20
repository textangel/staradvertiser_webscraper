{"date": "February 20, 2017", "text": "BEIJING >> A prefecture in China's far western Xinjiang region is requiring all vehicles to install satellite tracking systems as part of stepped-up measures against violent attacks. \n Traffic police in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture announced the regulation on Sunday, shortly after thousands of heavily armed police paraded in the Xinjiang capital and ruling Communist Party officials vowed to ramp up their campaign against separatists and Islamic militants. \n The vehicle-tracking program in Bayingolin will utilize China's homegrown Beidou satellite system, launched in recent years to reduce China's reliance on U.S.-based GPS providers for sensitive applications. Authorities said they will also track cars using RFID technology embedded in license plates. \n \"In recent years, the terrorist situation around the world has become severe, and cars are the main means of transport for terrorists,\" said prefectural authorities in an online statement. Authorities aimed to register and track up to 20,000 vehicles, the statement said. \n Gas stations will only serve cars equipped with the tracking system, according to a separate local news report. Police officials in the prefecture confirmed the tracking program to the AP on Tuesday but declined to answer questions. \n Xinjiang officials have sharply increased surveillance, street searches and police patrols in recent years amid bombings, vehicle and knife attacks blamed on separatist militants from the native ethnic Uighur minority. Uighur activists say economic marginalization and a repressive government presence \u2014 including restrictions on Muslim religious and cultural practices \u2014 have fueled resentment and feed a vicious cycle of radicalization and violence. \n Xinjiang shares a border with Afghanistan, Pakistan and several unstable Central Asian states. \n The Chinese government denies religious discrimination and says its policies are needed to maintain stability in a region targeted by militant Islamic radicals. \n Despite the constant state of police lockdown, three knife-wielding attackers killed five and injured five others in Xinjiang's far western Pishan county last week, while several clashes between police forces and militants have been reported in recent months in the region's southern towns. \n At a Saturday rally in the regional capital of Urumqi, Xinjiang party official Zhu Hailun exhorted rows of rifle-toting soldiers and police in tactical anti-riot uniforms to use their \"hot blood and loyalty\" to defend the people and deal a \"crushing, obliterating blow\" against separatist and radical Islamic forces from Central Asia. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Prefecture in China's Xinjiang to track cars by satellite"}

{"date": "February 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman speaks during a news conference in New York. Schneiderman, already a champion of New York's liberal elite, is emerging as a major player in the broader Trump resistance. \n NEW YORK >> More than most, Eric Schneiderman understands the risks of taking on Donald Trump. \n New York's attorney general was a target of Trump's Twitter feed years before the president's assaults on \"Little Marco\" Rubio or \"Lyin' Ted\" Cruz. \n He was once depicted as a deranged Clockwork Orange character on the cover of a newspaper owned by Trump's son-in-law. And he faced intense anti-Semitic attacks from Trump loyalists on social media that continue even today. \n \"It's really vile stuff. It's a picture of your face going into a gas chamber, your face on a lampshade,\" Schneiderman told The Associated Press, acknowledging a new rash of anti-Semitism in recent weeks as he fought the new president's travel ban. \n Even Schneiderman's daughter was targeted in one social media post. \n \"If there's something that they take seriously as a threat, they tell me. I don't pay attention to it,\" Schneiderman said. He later added, \"I have a responsibility to fight.\" \n Indeed, this 62-year-old Democrat with little national profile is maneuvering to be a key player in the broader Trump resistance. Backed by one of the nation's largest public law firms, he is positioned to challenge Trump's agenda in ways his Democratic allies in Washington cannot \u2014 even as critics question whether he has the fortitude to effectively challenge the brash billionaire's aggressive agenda. \n Trump called Schneiderman a \"lightweight\" on Twitter in 2013, when the attorney general was investigating Trump University. \n Schneiderman is quick to point out he has already beaten Trump. \n The ambitious attorney led a lawsuit against Trump University alleging fraud, ultimately helping to secure a $25 million settlement after the election. Trump had vowed never to settle. \n Schneiderman also investigated Trump's family foundation, and he played a role recently in organizing legal opposition by Democratic attorneys general to Trump's travel ban. \n \"Eric, who leads a very large public law firm, he brings significant resources to bear,\" said Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson. \n But others note he has struggled to build the same national profile as recent New York attorneys general like Eliot Spitzer and Andrew Cuomo, both hard-charging Democrats who took on Wall Street and eventually became governor. \n Schneiderman insists he's planning to run for re-election in 2018, dismissing speculation he may run challenge Cuomo instead. He has more than $6 million in his campaign account, a haul dwarfed by Cuomo's $22 million. \n In the meantime, Schneiderman and his legal team of nearly 700 attorneys are focused on the Republican president. Targeting the new administration is also good politics in a state Trump lost by 22 percentage points. \n \"All these things Trump is trying to do are very unpopular in the state of New York,\" New York Democratic consultant Bruce Gyory said. \n Beyond immigration, Schneiderman's team is preparing to challenge the White House on the environment, civil rights, women's health care, labor rules and consumer protection, among other issues. \n Schneiderman said it's nothing personal. \n \"No matter how rich or powerful you are, if you're hurting people of the state of New York, we will go after you,\" he said. \"I'm concerned about real harm to real people.\" \n The New York City native's path to politics began in a Washington, D.C., abortion clinic more than four decades ago. \n At age 17, he said, he helped transport women from the airport to the clinic in one of the few cities where abortion was legal in the early 1970s. \n He was drawn to public service years later while working pro bono cases for his corporate law firm. He won a state Senate seat representing a Manhattan district in 1998, becoming attorney general in 2010. \n In style perhaps more than substance, the silver-haired Schneiderman doesn't match the profile of some of New York's more street-hardened politicians. He loves yoga, jazz and history. He still lives in the neighborhood in Manhattan's Upper West Side where he grew up as the only child of an attorney father who would become a prominent city philanthropist. \n The profile may limit his appeal in blue-collar America, but he was celebrated by New York City's tech community during a recent reception in the posh Hotel Jane. At an event catered by a company that hires only refugees, Schneiderman reminded the packed hotel lounge that New York has been a city of immigrants dating to the 1600s. \n Trump's immigration order, he told the fresh-faced tech executives, would \"shut down this flow of ideas and energy and human spirit that is so vibrant in our city. To me that's not just unconstitutional, which it is, it's un-American.\" \n After the remarks, some in the audience said they didn't know enough about Schneiderman to comment on his political standing. But Ed Zimmerman, who leads a tech group at a local law firm, praised the attorney general for taking on the president despite the risks. \n \"He's Trump's No. 1 enemy,\" Zimmerman said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New York attorney general bids to become Trump's No. 1 enemy"}

{"date": "February 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump speaks last week during a news conference, in the East Room of the White House in Washington. Andrew Jackson's triumph over John Quincy Adams in 1828 bore striking similarities to Donald Trump's win over Hillary Clinton last year and the president's team has seized upon the parallels, equating Trump's message of disruptive economic populism with Jackson's pledge to represent the common man. \n NEW YORK >> It was an ugly, highly personal presidential election. \n An unvarnished celebrity outsider who pledged to represent the forgotten laborer took on an intellectual member of the Washington establishment looking to extend a political dynasty in the White House. \n Andrew Jackson's triumph in 1828 over President John Quincy Adams bears striking similarities to Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton last year, and some of those most eager to point that out are in the Trump White House. \n Trump's team has seized upon the parallels between the current president and the long-dead Tennessee war hero. Trump has hung a portrait of Jackson in the Oval Office and Trump's chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, who has pushed the comparison, told reporters after Trump's inaugural address that \"I don't think we've had a speech like that since Andrew Jackson came to the White House.\" \n Trump himself mused during his first days in Washington that \"there hasn't been anything like this since Andrew Jackson.\" \n It's a remarkable moment of rehabilitation for Jackson, a figure whose populist credentials and anti-establishment streak has been tempered by harsher elements of his legacy, chiefly his forced removal of Native Americans that caused disease and the death of thousands. \n \"Both were elected presidents as a national celebrity; Jackson due to prowess on the battlefield and Trump from making billions in his business empire,\" said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. \"And it's a conscious move for Trump to embrace Jackson. In American political lore, Jackson represents the forgotten rural America while Trump won by bringing out that rural vote and the blue collar vote.\" \n The seventh president, known as \"Old Hickory\" for his toughness on the battlefield, gained fame when he led American forces to a victory in the Battle of New Orleans in the final throes of the War of 1812. He did serve a term representing Tennessee in the Senate, but he has long been imagined as a rough and tumble American folk hero, an anti-intellectual who believed in settling scores against political opponents and even killed a man in a duel for insulting the honor of Jackson's wife. \n Jackson also raged against what he deemed \"a corrupt bargain\" that prevented him from winning the 1824 election against Adams when the race was thrown to the House of Representatives after no candidate received a majority in the Electoral College. Even before the vote in November, Trump railed against a \"rigged\" election and has repeatedly asserted, without evidence, widespread voter fraud prevented his own popular vote triumph. \n Jackson's ascension came at a time when the right to vote was expanded to all white men \u2014 and not just property-owners \u2014 and he fashioned himself into a populist, bringing new groups of voters into the electoral system. Remarkably, the popular vote tripled between Jackson's loss in 1824 and his victory four years later, and he used the nation's growing newspaper industry \u2014 like Trump on social media \u2014 to spread his message. \n Many of those new voters descended on Washington for Jackson's 1829 inauguration and the crowd of thousands that mobbed the Capitol and the White House forced Jackson to spend his first night as president in a hotel. \n Once in office, he continued his crusade as a champion for the common man by opposing the Second Bank of the United States, which he declared to be a symptom of a political system that favored the rich and ignored \"the humble members of society \u2014 the farmers, mechanics, and laborers \u2014 who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves.\" \n Jackson, as Trump hopes to do, expanded the powers of the presidency, and a new political party, the new Democratic party, coalesced around him in the 1820s. He was the first non-Virginia wealthy farmer or member of the Adams dynasty in Massachusetts to be elected president. \n \"The American public wanted a different kind of president. And there's no question Donald Trump is a different kind of president,\" Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said this past week. \"He's now comparing himself to Andrew Jackson. I think it's a pretty good, a pretty good comparison. That's how big a change Jackson was from the Virginia and Massachusetts gentlemen who had been president of the United States for the first 40 years.\" \n But there are also limits to the comparison, historians say. \n Unlike Jackson, who won in 1828 in a landslide, Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots. Jon Meacham, who wrote a 2008 biography of Jackson, \"American Lion,\" said Jackson was \"an outsider in style but not in substance\" and his outlandish public pronouncements would often be followed by hours of deep conversations and letter-writing hashing out political calculations. \n \"He was a wild man during the day but a careful diplomat at night,\" said Meacham, who said it was too early to know whether Trump, like Jackson, \"had a strategy behind his theatrics,\" and whether Trump had the ability to harness the wave of populism that has swept the globe as it did in the 1820s. \n \"The moment is Jacksoninan but do we have a Jackson in the Oval Office?\" Meacham asked. \n Trump's appropriation of Jackson came after his victory. Trump never mentioned Jackson during the campaign or discussed Jackson during a series of conversations with Meacham last spring \n But it is hardly unique for a president to adopt a previous one as a historical role model. \n Barack Obama frequently invoked Abraham Lincoln. Dwight Eisenhower venerated George Washington. Jackson himself had been claimed by Franklin Roosevelt and his successor, Harry Truman, both of whom \u2014 unlike Trump \u2014 interpreted Jackson's populism as a call for expanded government, in part to help the working class. \n There could be other comparisons for Trump. A favorable one would be Eisenhower, also a nonpolitician who governed like a hands-off CEO. A less favorable one would be Andrew Johnson, a tool of his party whose erratic behavior helped bring about his impeachment. \n Trump's embrace could signal an about-face for Jackson's legacy. Historians have recently soured on the slave-owning president whose Indian Removal Act of 1830 commissioned the forced removal of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands in the southeastern United States. More than 4,000 died along their journey west, a brutal match that became known as the \"Trail of Tears.\" \n Jackson's standing had fallen so much that in 2015, when the U.S. Treasury announced plans to replace Alexander Hamilton on the $10 bill with Harriet S. Tubman, the outcry in defense of the Founding Father \u2014 in part due to the success of the Broadway musical that tells his story \u2014 was so loud that the government changed course and opted to remove Jackson from the $20 instead. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump election has parallels to Andrew Jackson's presidency"}

Her Love Wins campaign, created with a local teacher, builds on the existing curriculum and also brings therapists into the schools. \n She is one of several people touched by the December 2012 shooting inside Sandy Hook who have become involved in the broader movement to incorporate social and emotional learning in American schools. \n Scarlett Lewis, whose son Jesse was among the 20 children killed, was involved in pushing for a 2015 law that allows federal funds to be used by schools for such things as recognizing the early signs of mental illness and crisis-intervention training. She has a foundation that has developed its own social-emotional learning curriculum and is being used on a pilot basis in four schools: Rippowam Middle School in Stamford; Ka'elepulu Elementary School in Kailua; Washington Elementary School in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Mission Achievement and Success Charter School in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \n \"I believe this is an urgent matter,\" Lewis said. \"I believe it would have saved my son's life, as well as the lives of other victims across the United States and reduce bullying.\" \n In the years before the 20-year-old Lanza carried out the massacre, he spent long stretches of time isolated in his mother's home and had psychiatric ailments that went without treatment, according to investigators, who never pinpointed a motive for the shooting. \n Marquez-Greene connected with the New Britain school district after she received a letter of condolence from Craig Muzzy, a teacher at Chamberlain Elementary School in New Britain. \n Marquez-Greene and Muzzy together developed the program for city schools. Muzzy already had been taking pointers from the Ana Grace Project's website, making a reading-comprehension assignment, for example, about a student who moves into the area from a different country, and leading discussions about how to make people feel welcome. \n On Valentine's Day, Muzzy's students took part in \"Friendship Day\" activities, which included making bracelets and cards for exchange. Marquez-Greene attended and helped introduce a new student, Jaden Garcia, to Muzzy's class. She showed students how to get to know him better by asking about his favorite food (pizza), his pets (he has a cat) and his favorite sports (soccer). \n Araceli Buchko, 10, made a bracelet for a friend by using similar conversation starters. \n \"I wanted to try it out and see if they would like me,\" she said. \"I tried one person and it was good. We found out we had a lot in common, and she became my best friend.\" \n A federal grant covers the $48,000 that New Britain schools spend annually on the Love Wins campaign in the four elementary schools. \n The New Britain school district spends $48,000 per year to implement the Love Wins campaign in the four elementary schools. That money comes from a federal Safe Schools/Healthy Students grant. The Ana Grace Project and a private nonprofit agency provide another $40,000 per year. \n School officials say they believe the Love Wins campaign is helping. They say there are fewer reports of bullying, and fewer office referrals for fights. \n \"But you really know it's working when you see the children interacting with one another, when they spontaneously go over to a classmate and say, 'How are you feeling? You look sad today,'\" said Jane Perez, the Chamberlain principal. \"You see it in how they work with each other now and collaborate with each other.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Movement to teach empathy in schools reaches Kailua"}

By noon, the forces entered the village and gained control over much of the strategic hill as fighting was still raging. \n Separately, militarized police in armored vehicles were moving toward the sprawling Ghazlani military base on the southwestern outskirts of the city. \n A U.S.-led coalition has been providing close air support throughout the campaign to retake Iraq's second-largest city. U.S. special operations forces are embedded with some Iraqi units and thousands of U.S. troops are in Iraq providing logistical and other support. \n Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis was holding discussions with U.S. and Iraqi officials, a week before he is expected to present a new strategy to President Donald Trump for defeating the Islamic State group. \n \"We're going to make certain that we've got good situational awareness of what we face as we work together and fight alongside each other,\" Mattis told reporters traveling with him. \n Trump has repeatedly vowed to eliminate the extremist group but has provided few details about how his approach might differ from that of the Obama administration, which had partnered with Syrian and Iraqi forces to drive IS out of several towns and cities. \n The battle for western Mosul, the extremist group's last major urban bastion in Iraq, is expected to be the most daunting yet. \n The streets are older and narrower in that sector of the city, which stretches west from the Tigris River, forcing Iraqi soldiers to leave the relative safety of their armored vehicles. The presence of up to 750,000 civilians also poses a challenge. \n Two suicide car bombers struck army and paramilitary forces west of Mosul on Monday, killing and wounding a number of troops, two army officers said, without specifying the number of casualties.

Self-driving vehicles could begin tooling down a bustling Atlanta street full of cars, buses, bicyclists and college students. \n ATLANTA >> Self-driving vehicles could begin tooling down a bustling Atlanta street full of cars, buses, bicyclists and college students, as the city vies with other communities nationwide to test the emerging technology. \n Atlanta would become one of the largest urban areas for testing self-driving vehicles if plans come together for a demonstration as early as September. \n Nationwide, 10 sites were designated last month as \"proving grounds\" for automated vehicles by the U.S. Department of Transportation. \n They include North Carolina turnpikes, the eastern Iowa prairie and a Michigan site where World War II bombing aircraft were produced in a factory built by automobile pioneer Henry Ford. Atlanta isn't on the list, but city officials nevertheless hope to make an impact. \n Backers of driverless cars say they could be part of a broader effort to rebuild the nation's infrastructure, something President Donald Trump has pledged to do. As roads and highways are rebuilt, \"we think it would be very, very wise to build modern infrastructure with 21st-century capability in mind,\" said Paul Brubaker, president and CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based Alliance for Transportation Innovation. \n Self-driving vehicles, he said, \"should be a national priority.\" \n The Trump administration hasn't revealed its approach to the technology, but two U.S. senators this month announced a bipartisan effort to help speed deployment of the vehicles on the nation's roads. Republican John Thune of South Dakota and Democrat Gary Peters of Michigan said they're considering legislation that \"clears hurdles and advances innovation in self-driving vehicle technology.\" \n Atlanta has sought proposals from companies for a demonstration of an autonomous vehicle on North Avenue later this year, city documents show. \n The street, which connects the Georgia Institute of Technology campus to some of the South's tallest skyscrapers, would be among the busiest urban environments yet for such testing. \n In Atlanta, city officials say a key goal is to create optimal conditions on North Avenue for such vehicles to operate. \n The goal of September's demonstration is to show how such a vehicle would navigate in real-world traffic, though a driver will be inside and can take the controls if needed, said Faye DiMassimo, an Atlanta official involved in the North Avenue project. \n \"We still think that autonomous vehicles are sort of 'The Jetsons,' right?\" DiMassimo said. \"When you looked at all the information, you realize not only is this here and now, this has been in development for quite some time.\" \n North Avenue would first be equipped with devices and sensors, enabling vehicles to communicate with traffic signals and warning self-driving cars of red lights or treacherous conditions such as snow or ice, the city documents show. \n Cameras would provide live video of traffic, and computers would analyze data on road conditions, concerts or other events likely to clog streets. \n Security is a key concern, however. \n \"Imagine if these vehicles were hacked.

{"date": "February 20, 2017", "text": "CHICAGO >> Teen suicide attempts in the U.S. declined after same-sex marriage became legal and the biggest impact was among gay, lesbian and bisexual kids, a study found. \n The research found declines in states that passed laws allowing gays to marry before the Supreme Court made it legal nationwide. The results don't prove there's a connection, but researchers said policymakers should be aware of the measures' potential benefits for youth mental health. \n Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for all U.S. teens. Suicidal behavior is much more common among gay, lesbian and bisexual kids and adults; about 29 percent of these teens in the study reported attempting suicide, compared with just 6 percent of straight teens. \n Laws that have the greatest impact on gay adults may make gay kids feel \"more hopeful for the future,\" said lead author Julia Raifman, a researcher at Johns Hopkins' Bloomberg School of Public Health. \n The measures also could create more tolerance and less bullying, making these teens feel less stigmatized. Those effects could also benefit straight teens but more research is needed to determine how the laws might influence teen behavior, Raifman said. \n The study was published today in JAMA Pediatrics . \n The researchers analyzed data on more than 700,000 public high school students who participated in government surveys on risky youth behavior from 1999 through 2015, the year the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage. \n About 230,000 students reported being gay, lesbian or bisexual.

There was no change in suicide attempts in states without those laws. \n The study only included suicide attempts, not deaths. \n The new work makes an important contribution to identifying how laws limiting gay rights may affect psychological and physical health, said Columbia University public health researcher Mark Hatzenbuehler. \n But more research is needed to determine which teens are most vulnerable to policies that limit gay rights, he wrote in an accompanying editorial. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Teen suicide attempts fell as same-sex marriage became legal"}

{"date": "February 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Retired police officer Arthur Lascanas spoke about President Rodrigo Duterte at a news conference today. \n MANILA, Philippines >> A retired Philippine police officer said today that President Rodrigo Duterte, when he was a mayor, ordered and paid him and other members of a so-called liquidation squad to kill criminals and opponents, including a kidnapping suspect, his family and a critical radio commentator. \n Human rights lawyers who presented Arthur Lascanas at a news conference said the allegations could be grounds for impeaching Duterte, adding that his alleged role in the killings may not be covered by his presidential immunity. \n Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV, who helped the lawyers from the private Free Legal Assistance Group present Lascanas in a news conference at the Senate, said he would ask his colleagues to immediately investigate the explosive allegations. \n Duterte's communications secretary, Martin Andanar, dismissed the claims as a \"demolition job\" by unspecified people affected by Duterte's reforms and aimed at forcing Duterte from power. He did not respond to Lascanas's detailed claims. \n \"The press conference of self-confessed hitman SPO3 Arthur Lascanas is part of a protracted political drama aimed to destroy the president and to topple his administration,\" Andanar said, without elaborating or offering any evidence. \n Duterte has denied his administration backs unlawful killings of suspects in his crackdown on illegal drugs that is feared to have killed more than 7,000 mostly poor drug users and petty drug pushers since he took office last June. \n The killings under the crackdown, an expansion of his anti-drug campaign when he was the longtime mayor of southern Davao city, have alarmed the United States, other Western governments and U.N. human rights officials. \n In many public speeches, Duterte has ordered policemen to defend themselves if drug suspects fight back and has openly threatened drug lords and dealers with death. \n Lascanas's comments came after he denied to a Senate hearing last year that he had been involved in any extrajudicial killings in Davao, Duterte's hometown. He testified at the inquiry last October after he was implicated by another witness, Edgar Matobato, a former militiaman who said Duterte ordered him and others to kill criminals in gangland-style assaults that left hundreds of people dead. \n Breaking into tears at one point, Lascanas said Monday he was speaking up now because he was bothered by his conscience, including his role in the deaths of his two brothers, whom he ordered killed because they were drug users. \n \"I had my own two brothers killed. Even if I end up dead, I'm content because I've fulfilled my promise to the Lord to make a public confession,\" he said. \n Lascanas described several killings and attacks that he said Duterte had ordered, permitted or financed as mayor of Davao, including the 1993 bombing of mosques as retaliation after Muslim rebels were blamed for bombing a Roman Catholic cathedral. \n One of their first victims, a suspected drug lord, was gunned down and left with a message that warned others: \"Don't emulate.\" Lascanas said he and other killers identified their group in the message as \"Davao Death Squad,\" which spread and sparked fear in the sprawling city. \n Lascanas said he and his group shot dead a kidnapping suspect along with the man's pregnant wife, young son, father-in-law and two others in another attack with Duterte's approval. \n After his group informed Duterte about the capture of the suspected mastermind of a kidnapping in Davao, Lascanas quoted the mayor as saying, \"All right, make it clean.\" \n Another target was radio commentator Jun Pala, who had angered Duterte with critical commentaries. He was killed in 2003 by gunmen, who Lascanas said included him. They twice failed to kill him but succeeded in the third attempt, Lascanas said, adding that he personally received a financial reward from the then mayor. \n \"I'm one of those who killed Jun Pala,\" Lascanas said. \n Another criminal suspect, an ex-soldier, was captured and presented to the mayor, who ordered his men to \"kill him,\" Lascanas said. \n Killing the suspect was problematic, he said, because policemen from another town knew he was alive when he was arrested. Lascanas said he and his companions convinced a police official to sign a logbook stating that the suspect was arrested but later escaped. \n Lascanas said he and his companions later killed the suspect and dumped his body in a nearby province. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ex-cop says Duterte paid him, others to kill crime suspects"}

{"date": "February 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin spoke in Washington on Tuesday. Federal authorities are stepping up investigations at Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers due to a sharp increase in opioid theft and missing prescriptions. \n WASHINGTON >> Federal authorities are stepping up investigations at Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers due to a sharp increase in opioid theft, missing prescriptions or unauthorized drug use by VA employees since 2009, according to government data obtained by the Associated Press. \n Doctors, nurses or pharmacy staff at federal hospitals \u2014 the vast majority within the VA system \u2014 siphoned away controlled substances for their own use or street sales, or drugs intended for patients simply disappeared. \n Aggravating the problem is that some VA hospitals have been lax in tracking drug supplies. Congressional auditors said spot checks found four VA hospitals skipped monthly inspections of drug stocks or missed other requirements. Investigators said that signals problems for VA's entire network of more than 160 medical centers and 1,000 clinics, coming after auditor warnings about lax oversight dating back to at least 2009. \n \"Drug theft is an area of concern,\" Jeffrey Hughes, the VA's acting assistant inspector general for investigations, told AP. He said the monthly inspections could help the VA uncover potential discrepancies and root out crime. \n Both the inspector general's office and the Drug Enforcement Administration said they have increased scrutiny of drug thefts from the VA, with the DEA reporting more criminal investigations. \n It's not clear if the problem is worse at the VA than at private facilities, where medical experts and law enforcement officials say drug theft is also increasingly common in a time of widespread opioid abuse in the U.S. But the VA gets special scrutiny from lawmakers and the public, given Americans' esteem for ex-servicemembers served by the agency and because of past problems at the VA, especially a 2014 wait-time scandal in which some patients died. \n \"Those VA employees who are entrusted with serving our nation's wounded, ill and injured veterans must be held to a higher standard,\" said Joe Davis, spokesman for Veterans of Foreign Wars. \n The drug thefts will be among the challenges facing newly confirmed VA Secretary David Shulkin, who served as the department's undersecretary of health while the drug problem was growing. At his confirmation hearing this month, Shulkin said he was proud that the VA identified the opioid addiction problem before others did and \"recognized it as a crisis and began to take action.\" \n Still, the VA acknowledges it has had problems keeping up with monthly inspections and said it was taking steps to improve training. It also said it was requiring hospitals to comply with inspection procedures and develop plans for improvement. \n It did not respond to AP requests made three weeks ago to provide a list of VA facilities where drugs had been reported missing or disciplinary action was taken, saying it was still compiling the information. \n Reported incidents of drug losses or theft at federal hospitals jumped from 272 in 2009 to 2,926 in 2015, before dipping to 2,457 last year, according to DEA data obtained by AP. \"Federal hospitals\" include the VA's more than 1,100 facilities as well as seven correctional hospitals and roughly 20 hospitals serving Indian tribes. \n The inspector general's office estimates there are nearly 100 open criminal probes involving theft or loss of VA controlled substances. \n Three VA employees were charged this month with conspiring to steal prescription medications including opioids at the Little Rock, Arkansas, VA hospital. The inspector general's office says a pharmacy technician used his VA access to a medical supplier's web portal to order and divert 4,000 oxycodone pills, 3,300 hydrocodone pills and other drugs at a cost to the VA of $77,700 and a street value of $160,000. \n Christopher Thyer, the U.S. attorney overseeing the case, said the employees were abusing their position to steal from taxpayers and \"poison the communities we live in with dangerous drugs.\" \n The drug thefts from VA also raise the possibility that patients will be denied medication they need or that they will be treated by drug-impaired staff. \n In one case, a former VA employee in Baltimore pleaded guilty on charges that he injected himself with fentanyl intended for patients heading into surgery, then refilled the syringes with saline solution. Patients received solution tainted with the Hepatitis C virus carried by the employee. \n Dr. Dale Klein, a VA pain management specialist, said some of his patients suspected they weren't getting the drugs they needed, including one patient with an amputated leg who had to do without morphine because a VA pharmacy said it did not have enough in supply. \n Klein, who is part of a whistleblowers network called VA Truth Tellers, ran a VA pain clinic from 2015 to 2016 and has filed a retaliation claim against VA, saying the VA restricted his work after he voiced complaints. The VA has said it was looking into the claims. \n Klein described several of VA's inventory lists as inconsistent or a \"slapdash rush job.\" That concern was underscored by the findings from the Government Accountability Office, released last week, that drug stockpiles were not always being regularly inspected. Klein's attorney, Natalie Khawam, says she's heard similar complaints from other clients at their VA hospitals. \n The GAO review, covering January 2015 to February 2016, found the most missed inspections at VA's hospital in Washington, D.C., according to a government official familiar with confidential parts of the audit. Monthly checks were missed there more than 40 percent of the time, mostly in critical patient care areas, such as the operating room and intensive care units. That adds to the risk of veterans not receiving their full medications. \n The Washington hospital also missed inspections of the facility's pharmacy for three straight months, violating VA policy, according to the official, who insisted on anonymity to reveal findings that weren't public. In the last year, the hospital had at least five incidents of controlled substances that were \"lost\" or otherwise unaccounted for, according to the DEA. \n Other problems were found in VA hospitals in Seattle, Milwaukee and Memphis, Tennessee. Milwaukee had the fewest, which the GAO attributed to a special coordinator put in place to ensure inspection compliance. \n Responding to the findings, the House Veterans Affairs Committee planned a hearing on the inspection issue. Its chairman, Rep. Phil Roe, a physician, said failing to follow protocol is serious and \"should not be tolerated within VA.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Drugs vanish at some VA hospitals"}

{"date": "February 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Fans cheered the New England Patriots riding on duck boats during a celebration parade on Feb. 7. \n BOSTON >> With their festive, party-like ambiance and ability to travel on land and in water, duck boats have long been tourist attractions for sightseers around the U.S. But a string of deadly accidents has left the industry reeling, forced safety improvements and led some advocates to call for a total ban on the vehicles. \n In Seattle, after five college students were killed in a 2015 duck boat collision with a bus, the company pulled half its fleet out of service. In Philadelphia, a duck boat operator suspended its tours indefinitely after three people were killed in two separate crashes. And in Boston, new safety regulations are set to go into effect in April after a duck boat ran over and killed a 28-year-old woman last spring. \n Boston has a special fondness for duck boats, which have become a mainstay of parades celebrating sports championships. Earlier this month, two dozen duck boats carried the New England Patriots through the streets of Boston for a \"rolling rally\" to celebrate the team's Super Bowl win. \n But duck boats have lost some of their appeal in Boston and other places where people have been seriously injured or killed. \n \"We believe that duck boats in their current design should be banned,\" said Ivan Warmuth, the father of Allison Warmuth, who was killed on April 30, 2016, when a duck boat ran her over on her motor scooter. \n Duck boats were originally used by the U.S. military in World War II to transport troops and supplies over land and water, most famously during the invasion of Normandy in 1944. They were later modified for use as sightseeing vehicles. There are now about 130 duck boats operating in more than a dozen U.S. cities, including Boston, Seattle, Miami, San Diego, Honolulu and Washington. \n Critics say the 2\u00bd-ton amphibious passenger vehicles are inherently dangerous because their design creates numerous blind spots for drivers, who sit 10 to 12 feet behind the bow, making it difficult to see directly below and in front of them. \n Allison Warmuth's parents have pushed the industry to adopt new safety measures. They successfully lobbied for a Massachusetts law that requires duck boats to have blind spot cameras and proximity sensors. The new law also requires a second employee \u2014 separate from the driver \u2014 to narrate the tours. \n Kevan Moniri, who was on the scooter with Warmuth, recalls seeing the duck boat accelerate behind them when a light turned green, then realizing the driver did not see them. Video examined by the National Transportation Safety Board showed the driver taking his eyes off the road and turning in his seat to point out landmarks during the tour. \n \"I hear again and again from Boston Duck Tours and any of these other companies that safety is their No. 1 priority, and if that's the case, you can't argue that the safest way to operate the vehicles is for the driver to also be giving the tour,\" Moniri said. \n Ten weeks after Warmuth was killed, a New Jersey woman was struck and seriously injured by a duck boat at another Boston intersection. \n Boston Duck Tours chief executive officer Cindy Brown said the company \"places a premium on the safety of its passengers\" and touted additional cameras, a second person to narrate tours and new back-up sensors. \n Safety advocates have sought improvements since 1999, when 13 people died after a duck boat sank near Hot Springs, Arkansas. \n In the past seven years, a series of accidents have claimed lives, including a 2010 collision between a stalled duck boat in the Delaware River and a tug-boat guided barge, which killed two Hungarian tourists; a 2015 crash that killed a Texas woman as she crossed a Philadelphia street; and the 2015 collision in Seattle. \n The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration determined the front axle on the Seattle duck boat broke, causing the driver to lose control. The manufacturer agreed to pay up to $1 million after NHTSA said it violated federal laws when it failed to notify regulators of a safety defect in the axle and did not issue a full recall. \n The operator of the Philadelphia duck boat tours suspended operations indefinitely in October, citing a 330 percent increase in its insurance premiums. \n Critics say part of the problem is that a myriad of agencies regulate duck boats, including the U.S. Coast Guard, NHTSA, and cities and states with varying safety requirements. \n Ride the Ducks of Seattle stopped using its older \"stretch ducks\" after the accident and is now only using newer \"truck ducks,\" said spokesman Mark Firmani. The company also added 365-degree video coverage and a second employee to narrate tours, he said. \n Stacey Soto's mother, 63-year-old Rosemary Hamelburg, died in 2003 after falling backward off a duck boat onto a Boston parking lot. Soto said that despite being longtime Patriots season ticket holders, her family has been unable to enjoy the team's victory rallies. \n \"None of us can watch any of the duck boat parades,\" she said. \"It's too painful.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Duck boats face increasing calls for improvements, bans"}

{"date": "February 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Dr. Scarlett Gard at Wellspring Family Healthcare in Garden City, Kan. Gard came to this meatpacking town to work with Somali immigrants. \n GARDEN CITY, Kan. >> Dr. Scarlett Gard's passion for humanitarian work took her to India and Bangladesh. After finishing her medical training, she set off for a place she knew had a diverse population in need of doctors: western Kansas. \n Gard came to the meatpacking town of Garden City to work with Somali immigrants \u2014 a population that's become the cornerstone of an effort by a growing network of rural hospitals to entice doctors to come practice in sparsely populated hamlets across western Kansas. \n The innovative recruiting effort grew out of the realization that many millennials graduating from medical schools have a burning desire for international medical service. It also comes amid the backdrop of President Donald Trump's attempts to restrict the influx of refugees into the United States from seven predominantly Muslim nations, including Somalia. \n \"It just kind of drew me because it surprised me that this existed in southwest Kansas,\" said Gard, who moved to Garden City in September after finishing her medical residency in Wichita. \"I don't think I saw myself necessarily staying here until I realized that the same things I wanted to do \u2014 go to underserved people of different cultures \u2014 I assumed I would have to go overseas to do that and I clearly don't.\" \n The hospitals are encouraging doctors like Gard to come work with immigrant populations and learn a language and culture before heading overseas. They also offer generous time off for medical trips abroad. \n The doctors are finding that people from the oppressed and war-torn countries where they want to work are in western Kansas, said Benjamin Anderson, an administrator for the Kearney County Hospital in Lakin who is behind the recruiting effort. \n \"So what is normally a deterrent for recruiting traditional candidates has become a cornerstone of this recruiting effort,\" Anderson said, adding that all local residents \u2014 not just immigrants \u2014 benefit from having highly trained doctors working there. \n So far, 25 Kansas doctors have joined the loose network of physicians working in medical facilities in Garden City, Lakin, Santana, Scott City, Ashland, Minneola, Tribune and Leoti, Anderson said. The group is working to solidify that arrangement by forming a nonprofit organization to help support their medical work overseas and in rural Kansas. \n Although Trump's ban on travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen isn't expected to affect the hospitals' recruiting efforts, it has generated concern among Garden City's Somalis immigrants. A judge put the ban on hold, but two Somali refugees who had been living in Garden City haven't been able to come back after traveling to their home country. Refugees also worry about how long it will be before they see their loved ones who had been expected to come to the U.S., said Ifrah Ahmed, a 27-year-old Somali immigrant. \n Ahmed said the doctors' work has helped residents see that people still want to help them. \n \"It is a way to see that in spite of everything that is going on, there is still good out there,\" Ahmed said. \"There are still people who believe in us, there are people that want the best for us.\" \n Ahmed changed her shift at the meatpacking plant where she works as a translator so she could volunteer at a walk-in clinic at a Somali apartment complex. Gard is the volunteer medical director of the clinic, which opened Saturday and is staffed by volunteer doctors who've dubbed it New Hope Together. \n The Tyson Foods plant outside Garden City has long been a magnet for various immigrant populations, transforming the western Kansas city into a multicultural haven of about 27,000 people where more than a dozen languages are spoken. The hundreds of Somali refugees who began settling here around 2008 are just the latest wave. Other immigrant groups who have come to western Kansas for jobs in meatpacking plants or on farms include Hispanics and people who speak low German. \n The doctors have become so important to the Somalis that when 27-year-old Mursal Naleye learned that Anderson and two physicians were going to Africa in November, he felt obligated to join them. Naleye, who is now a U.S. citizen, bought his own plane ticket so he could show them the ropes and, if necessary, protect them from any problems. \n For the doctors, the work is a calling. \n \"It is fulfilling for a lot of us as physicians to realize that we can make a big difference for these people coming from all over the world right here in Garden City, which is not something you would expect in rural Kansas,\" said Dr. John Birky, who helped put in the new walk-in clinic. \n Anderson got the idea to recruit doctors interested in international work from the Via Christi Health International Family Medicine Fellowship in Wichita. Similar recruiting efforts by hospitals in Iowa, Michigan and Tennessee offer time off for overseas medical work. \n It's been a boon to hospitals in western Kansas that once struggled to hire doctors. \n \"In the past we had to wait a long amount of time to be seen,\" said Kearney County Commissioner Shannon McCormick. \"We had to travel to be seen, to get health care that now we can get easily.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Refugee populations drawing doctors to rural towns"}

{"date": "February 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Debris awaiting pickup by cleanup crews at the Dakota Access oil pipeline protest camp on Thursday. \n CANNON BALL, N.D. >> As dawn breaks over an encampment that was once home to thousands of people protesting the Dakota Access oil pipeline, a few hundred holdouts rise for another day of resistance. \n They aren't deterred by the threat of flooding, nor by declarations from state and federal authorities that they must leave by Wednesday or face possible arrest. They're determined to remain and fight a pipeline they maintain threatens the very sanctity of the land. \n \"If we don't stand now, when will we?\" said Tiffanie Pieper, of San Diego, who has been in the camp most of the winter. \n Protesters have been at the campsite since August to fight the $3.8 billion pipeline that will carry oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners began work on the last big section of the pipeline this month after the Army gave it permission to lay pipe under a reservoir on the Missouri River. The protest camp is on Army Corp of Engineers land nearby. \n The protests have been led by Native American tribes, particularly the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux, whose reservation is downstream. They say the pipeline threatens drinking water and cultural sites. ETP disputes that. \n Faced with the prospect of spring flooding, some protesters are considering moving to higher ground, though not necessarily off the federal land. Some may move to the Standing Rock Reservation, where the Cheyenne River Sioux is leasing land to provide camping space even though Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault has urged protesters to leave. \n \"We have the same goals,\" Cheyenne River Chairman Harold Frazier said of himself and Archambault. \"We don't agree on whether or not the water protectors should be on the ground.\" \n Those urging the protesters to leave say they're concerned about possible flooding in the area as snow melts. \n \"The purpose of this is to close the land to ensure no one gets harmed,\" said Corps Capt. Ryan Hignight. \n One concern is that floodwaters could wash tons of trash and debris at the encampment into the nearby rivers. \n \"One of the biggest environmental threats to the Missouri is the camp itself,\" said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. \n Many in camp think authorities are exaggerating the flood threat and trying to turn public sentiment against them. \n \"They're talking like it will be a flood that will wipe out all of existence,\" said Luke Black Elk, a Cheyenne River Sioux from South Dakota. Some flooding is likely, he said, but \"most of it won't be that bad.\" \n The camp has been the site of numerous and sometimes violent clashes between police and protesters who call themselves \"water protectors,\" with more than 700 arrests. The camp's population has dwindled as the pipeline battle has largely moved into the courts. \n Protesters who remain say they're prepared to be arrested, but will remain peaceful. \n \"We'll make it difficult for them to handcuff us, but there will be no forceful opposition,\" said Bryce Peppard, from Oregon. \n The Corps and the governor say they would rather there were no arrests. \n \"The ideal situation is zero arrests are made because everybody figures out that it's not a place where you want to be when the flood starts to happen,\" Burgum said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Deadline looms for Dakota Access pipeline protest camp"}

{"date": "February 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, center, was greeted by U.S. Ambassador Douglas Silliman as he arrived at Baghdad International Airport today. \n BAGHDAD >> U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said today the United States does not intend to seize Iraqi oil, shifting away from an idea proposed by President Donald Trump that has rattled Iraq's leaders. \n Mattis arrived on an unannounced visit in Iraq as the battle to oust Islamic State militants from western Mosul moved into its second day, and as the Pentagon considers ways to accelerate the campaign against IS in Iraq and Syria. \n Those efforts could be complicated by Trump's oil threat and his inclusion of Iraq in the administration's travel ban \u2014 twin blows that have roiled the nation and spurred local lawmakers to pressure Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to reduce cooperation with Washington. \n \"I think all of us here in this room, all of us in America have generally paid for our gas and oil all along, and I'm sure that we will continue to do that in the future,\" Mattis told reporters traveling with him. \"We're not in Iraq to seize anybody's oil.\" \n His comments may provide some reassurance to the Iraqis. But the tensions come at a critical point in the war against IS, with two key battles in the works: the fight to take control of west Mosul, and the start of a campaign in Syria to oust IS from Raqqa, the capital of its self-declared caliphate. \n Al-Abadi has taken a measured approach, but the issues can roil already difficult internal politics. \n Under the president's deadline, Mattis has just a week to send Trump a strategy to accelerate the fight and defeat the Islamic State group. And any plan is likely to depend on U.S. and coalition troops working with and through the local forces in both countries. \n \"We're going to make certain that we've got good situational awareness of what we face as we work together and fight alongside each other,\" Mattis said. \n His key goal during the visit is to speak about the military operations with political leaders and commanders on the ground, including his top commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend. \n Asked about the tensions, Mattis said he has been assured that the travel ban \u2014 it has been stalled by a legal challenge \u2014 would not affect Iraqis who have fought alongside U.S. forces. \n The oil issue, however, may be more difficult. Trump brought it up during the campaign, and he mentioned it again late last month during a visit to the CIA. \n \"To the victor belong the spoils,\" Trump told members of the intelligence community. He said he first argued this case for \"economic reasons,\" but added it made sense as a counterterrorism approach to defeating IS \"because that's where they made their money in the first place.\" \n \"So we should have kept the oil,\" he said. \"But, OK, maybe you'll have another chance.\" \n Trump, however, has also been clear that defeating IS is a top priority. In his inauguration address, he pledged to eradicate radical Islamic terrorism \"completely from the face of the Earth.\" And he talked during the campaign about greatly increasing the number of U.S. troops in order to \"knock out\" IS. \n He signed an order Jan. 28 that gives Mattis and senior military leaders 30 days to come up with a new plan to beef up the fight. \n Mattis would not discuss specifics, saying he wants to gather information first. But he has been talking with military leaders about the possible options, and has largely supported the U.S. strategy of fighting IS with and through local forces. \n The military options range from putting more troops in Iraq and Syria to boosting military aid to Kurdish fighters backed by the U.S.-led coalition. \n More specifically, officials have talked about expanding efforts to train, advise and enable local Iraqi and Syrian forces, increasing intelligence and surveillance, and allowing U.S. troops to move forward more frequently with Iraqi soldiers nearer the front lines. \n The Pentagon also would like more freedom to make daily decisions about how it fights the enemy. Former and current U.S. officials discussed the likely options on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk publicly. \n In Syria, a possible option would be sending more U.S. forces, including combat troops, there as the Raqqa fight heats up. \n Another move would be to provide heavy weapons and vehicles to the U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds, known as the YPG, and boost training. They have been the most effective force against IS in northern and eastern Syria, but the proposal is sensitive. Turkey, a key U.S. and NATO ally, considers the group a terrorist organization. \n There are more than 5,100 U.S. forces in Iraq, and up to about 500 in Syria. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. Defense Secretary Mattis says no plan to seize Iraqi oil"}

{"date": "February 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n North Korea's Ambassador to Malaysia Kang Chol speaks to the media outside the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur today. \n KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia >> North Korea's top envoy in Kuala Lumpur denounced Malaysia's investigation into the apparent killing of the exiled half brother of North Korea's ruler, calling it politically motivated and demanding a joint probe into the death. \n The comments today from Ambassador Kang Chol came amid rising tensions between North Korea and Malaysia over the death, with Malaysia recalling its ambassador to Pyongyang over what it called \"baseless\" allegations. \n Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half brother of North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un, died last week after apparently being poisoned in a Kuala Lumpur airport. Security camera footage obtained by Japanese television appeared to show a careful and deliberate attack in which a woman comes up from behind him and holds something over his mouth. \n Pyongyang demanded custody of Kim's body and strongly objected to an autopsy. The Malaysians still went ahead; an official with knowledge of the investigation said they conducted a second autopsy because the first was inconclusive, though police denied that. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. \n Malaysian authorities say they were simply following procedures, but Kang questioned their motives. \n \"The investigation by the Malaysian police is not for the clarification of the cause of the death and search for the suspect, but it is out of the political aim,\" Ambassador Kang Chol told reporters Monday. He referred to the dead man as \"Kim Chol,\" the name on the passport found with Kim Jong Nam. \n Police had \"pinned the suspicion on us,\" Kang said, calling on Malaysia to work with North Korea on a joint investigation. \n Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters later Monday that he has \"absolute confidence\" that police and doctors have been \"very objective\" in their work. \n Najib said Malaysia had no reason to \"paint the North Koreans in a bad light\" but added, \"We expect them to understand that we apply the rule of law in Malaysia.\" \n Kang previously said Malaysia may be \"trying to conceal something.\" The Malaysian foreign ministry said today it had recalled its ambassador to Pyongyang \"for consultations\" and had summoned Kang to a meeting, \"to seek an explanation on the accusations he made.\" \n The statement called Kang's comments \"baseless\" and said it \"takes very seriously any unfounded attempt to tarnish its reputation.\" \n Police investigating the killing have so far arrested four people carrying identity documents from North Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Those arrested include two women who were allegedly seen approaching Kim on Feb. 13 as he stood at a ticketing kiosk at the budget terminal of the Kuala Lumpur airport. \n Surveillance video footage, obtained by Fuji TV and often grainy and blurred, seems to show the two women approaching Kim Jong Nam from different directions. One comes up behind him and appears to hold something over his mouth for a few seconds. \n Then the women turn and calmly walk off in different directions. More footage shows Kim, a long-estranged scion of the family that has ruled North Korea for three generations, walking up to airport workers and security officials, gesturing at his eyes and seemingly asking for help. He then walks alongside as they lead him to the airport clinic. \n Fuji TV has not revealed how it acquired the video footage, which was taken by a series of security cameras as Kim arrived for a flight to Macau, where he had a home. \n Kim, in his mid-40s, died shortly after the attack, en route to a hospital after suffering a seizure, Malaysian officials say. \n Malaysia's deputy national police chief, Noor Rashid Ibrahim, said Sunday that Kim had told airport customer service workers that \"two unidentified women had swabbed or had wiped his face with a liquid and that he felt dizzy.\" \n Investigators are still looking for four North Korean men who arrived in Malaysia on different days beginning Jan. 31 and flew out the same day as the attack. \n \"I am not going disclose where they are,\" Noor Rashid told a room packed with journalists. He said Interpol was helping with the investigation. \n The four suspects, who range in age from their early 30s to late 50s, were traveling on regular \u2014 not diplomatic \u2014 passports, he said. \n Indonesian officials said three of those men transited through Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport after the apparent assassination, leaving on a 10:20 p.m. flight to Dubai. That was about 12 hours after the attack on Kim Jong Nam. \n Dubai police and the Dubai government media office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. State-owned airline Emirates declined to comment, citing policies on passenger confidentiality. \n Police also want to question three other people. Noor Rashid said one was North Korean, but that police had not yet identified the other two. It was not clear if they were suspects or simply wanted for questioning. \n Autopsy results on Kim Jong Nam could be released as early as Wednesday, said Health Minister S. Subramaniam. \n Investigators want to speak to Kim Jong Nam's next of kin to formally identify the body. He is believed to have two sons and a daughter with two women living in Beijing and Macau. \n \"We haven't met the next of kin,\" Noor Rashid said. \"We are trying very hard to get the next of kin to come and to assist us in the investigation.\" \n Noor Rashid said charges against the four suspects in custody would be determined by prosecutors. \n According to police, the Indonesian woman is a spa masseuse and the Malaysian man, a caterer, is believed to be her boyfriend. The Vietnamese woman works at an entertainment outlet and the North Korean man works in the information technology department of a Malaysian company. \n The Indonesian woman has told investigators that she was duped into thinking she was part of a comedy show prank. \n The Malaysian foreign ministry said the government has kept the North Korean Embassy informed, telling them that because \"the death occurred in Malaysian soil under mysterious circumstances, it is the responsibility of the Malaysian Government to conduct an investigation to identify the cause of death.\" \n South Korea has been quick to blame North Korea for the death of Kim Jong Nam, who as the eldest son of the late dictator Kim Jong Il was once widely seen as the ruler-in-waiting of the isolated nation. However, he fell out of favor more than a decade ago, and has spent most of his time since then living in China or Southeast Asia. \n The attack \"showed the reckless and brutal nature of the North Korean government,\" Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn said Monday during a National Security Council meeting. \n A later statement from Hwang's office said South Korea will cooperate with the international community to make an unspecified \"strong\" response to North Korea over the killing. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Associated Press writers Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo, Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, and Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n This story has been corrected to eliminate an erroneous reference to Indonesian officials saying a North Korean suspect flew from Jakarta to Bangkok after Kim Jong Nam died. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "North Korean envoy blasts Malaysians, calls for joint probe"}

Bush and Barack Obama \u2014 have been invited for state visits since the 1950s. \n State visits are distinct from official visits, and see foreign leaders welcomed with royal pomp and military ceremony; most stay at Buckingham Palace as guests of Queen Elizabeth II. \n Flynn said Trump had shown an \"Orwellian\" disregard for the truth and behaved \"like a petulant child.\" He said a state visit would make it appear as if the queen were \"approving the acts of Donald J. Trump.\" \n He urged the Conservative government to \"consider this with a bit of humility \u2026 and change the invitation to one for a visit, not a state visit.\" \n Both Bush and Obama made their state visits several years into their tenures. Prime Minister Theresa May invited Trump a week after his Jan. 20 inauguration. \n Some lawmakers said May's haste to bolster the trans-Atlantic \"special relationship\" as the U.K. prepares to leave the European Union had an edge of desperation. \n \"We didn't do this for Kennedy,\" Labour lawmaker David Lammy said. \"We didn't do this for Truman. We didn't do this for Reagan. But for this man, after seven days, we say 'Please come and we will lay on everything because we are so desperate for your company?'\u2026 I am ashamed that it has come to this.\" \n All petitions on the government's e-petitions website that receive more than 100,000 signatures are eligible for debate in Parliament, though not binding votes. \n Lawmakers also considered an opposing petition, with more than 300,000 signatures, backing the state visit. \n During her 65-year reign, Elizabeth has welcomed many leaders with less-than-spotless records, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and the late Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. A 2015 state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping drew protests from Tibetan groups and human rights activists. \n Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg said critics of Trump's pending visit were being hypocritical. \n \"What complaint did the honorable member make when Emperor Hirohito came here?\" he asked Flynn. The Japanese emperor's 1971 state visit was highly controversial at the time. \n Flynn replied that Britain should not \"try to imitate the errors of the past.\" \n Trump's invitation has sparked unprecedented opposition, especially after he issued an executive order temporarily barring citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. The order has since been suspended by U.S. courts. \n Thousands of people demonstrated against the order in British towns and cities, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan urged the government to reconsider its invitation in light of Trump's \"cruel\" migrant ban. \n House of Commons Speaker John Bercow set aside his customary political neutrality to say that Trump should not be invited to address Parliament when he comes to Britain. \n The government insists Trump's visit is still on for later this year, though dates have not been announced. \n The government said in a statement responding to the petition that the state visit \"reflects the importance of the relationship between the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\" \n \"We look forward to welcoming President Trump once dates and arrangements are finalized,\" it said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Amid protests, U.K. lawmakers debate Trump visit invitation"}

And he has suggested that the EU itself could soon fall apart. \n Tusk, who chairs meetings of the 28 EU states, said he had been reassured after \"open and frank talks\" with Pence. \n \"I heard words which are promising for the future, words which explain a lot about the new approach in Washington,\" Tusk said. \n He underlined that \"too many new and sometimes surprising opinions have been voiced over this time about our relations \u2014 and our common security \u2014 for us to pretend that everything is as it used to be.\" \n \"We are counting as always in the past on the United States' wholehearted and unequivocal \u2014 let me repeat, unequivocal \u2014 support for the idea of a united Europe,\" Tusk said. \"The world would be a decidedly worse place if Europe were not united.\" He asserted: \"The idea of NATO is not obsolete, just like the values which lie at its foundation are not obsolete.\" \n Tusk added, \"Both Europeans and Americans must simply practice what they preach.\" \n Pence voiced the administration's strong support for NATO over the weekend and was due to visit the alliance's headquarters later today. \n Pence's meetings were aimed at assuring European leaders that his words reflected the views of Trump and would not easily be swept away at the whim of the U.S. president or undermined by statements issued on Twitter. \n Pence, as he did in an address Saturday at the Munich Security Conference, reaffirmed U.S. support for the NATO alliance and said Trump would demand that Russia honor its commitments to end the fighting in Ukraine. \"In the interest of peace and in the interest of innocent human lives, we hope and pray that this ceasefire takes hold,\" he said. \n The vice president also noted the \"heartbreaking\" deadly suicide bombings at the Brussels airport and subway system in March 2016, and said the U.S. would continue to collaborate with EU partners to address safety and combat terrorism. \n \"The United States' commitment to the European Union is steadfast and enduring,\" he said. \n Pence was expected in his meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to push for members of the security alliance to increase military spending. Trump has urged NATO members to live up to the target of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pence tries to reassure Europeans on U.S. support"}
