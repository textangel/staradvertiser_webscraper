Baker McKenzie declined to comment. \n The threat of enforcement marks a sea change for a church that for some 2,000 years has seen popes venerated on all manner of flags, banners and medals. But the popularity of Francis and the ease with which his image can be copied in the internet age has spawned a flood of papal trinkets, causing the Holy See to worry that they are losing control of his image. \n \"The pope's image rights are no different from those of any other famous celebrity and so it's not surprising that the Vatican is giving notice that it will protect its (intellectual property) rights as necessary,\" said Nick Kounoupias, the founder of an intellectual property consultancy in London. \"What will be interesting to see, however, is how vigorously these rights are pursued, given who the IP owner is.\" \n Francis' many travels have taken him to countries like the Philippines and Sri Lanka, where factories can quickly churn out pope hats, T-shirts and towels. Vatican officials have grown fearful the faithful will think that the church is making money off the merchandise, experts say. Worse still, they see the conditions in which some of the items are made and worry about being associated with labor abuses. \n The decision reflects an evolution in the last decade as the Vatican adapted to modern markets. While in the past the Holy See might get word of improper use of the pope's image through local church organizations around the globe, the approach was random. \n \"It's not new that people were selling T-shirts of the pope, but (previously) those were probably little local vendors,\" said Mark McKenna, an intellectual property expert at the Notre Dame Law School in Indiana. \n What's changed is the magnitude of what can be produced and how quickly it can be distributed through online platforms. \n \"In a world of Etsy, you are able to do it on a bigger scale,\" he said. \n Although the Vatican did not elaborate on how it would crack down, the warning seemed a pre-emptive move to explain why the Vatican is going after the unauthorized commercial uses of the pope's image. There was no immediate indication that souvenir buyers would risk fines or legal action. \n It's not as if the church refrains from selling its own pope-themed material. \n On the Vatican website, one can buy Francis medals, icons and rosary boxes. The Vatican museum boutiques offer silk ties and scarves and watches showing scenes from Michelangelo's frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. And that may be part of the Vatican's motivation in safeguarding Francis' face \u2014 and warning that they will challenge the copycats. \n \"It's probably also the case that there is some genuine commercial motivation,\" McKenna said. \"They want to be sure they're the only ones selling this stuff.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Vatican stakes out rights to Pope Francis' image"}

{"date": "February 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2015 \n Members of the European Parliament at a plenary session at the European Parliament in Brussels. \n BRUSSELS >> With the specter of populism looming over a critical election year in Europe, the European Parliament has taken an unusual step to crack down on racism and hate speech in its own house.  \n In an unprecedented move, lawmakers have granted special powers to the president to pull the plug on live broadcasts of parliamentary debate in cases of racist speech or acts and the ability to purge any offending video or audio material from the system. \n Trouble is, the rules on what is considered offensive are none too clear. Some are concerned about manipulation. Others are crying censorship. \n \"This undermines the reliability of the Parliament's archives at a moment where the suspicion of 'fake news' and manipulation threatens the credibility of the media and the politicians,\" said Tom Weingaertner, president of the Brussels-based International Press Association. \n After Britain's decision to leave the European Union, the rising popularity of anti-immigrant candidates like Geert Wilders in the Netherlands or far-right Marine Le Pen in France is worrying Europe's political mainstream. Le Pen, who is running for the French presidency this spring, has promised to follow Britain's lead. \n At the European Parliament, where elections are due in 2019, many say the need for action against hate speech, and strong sanctions for offenders, is long overdue. \n The assembly\u2014 with its two seats; one in the Belgian capital of Brussels, and the other in Strasbourg in northeast France \u2014 is often the stage for political and sometimes nationalist theater. Beyond routine shouting matches, members occasionally wear T-shirts splashed with slogans or unfurl banners. Flags adorn some lawmakers' desks. \n Yet more and more in recent years, lawmakers have gone too far. \n \"There have been a growing number of cases of politicians saying things that are beyond the pale of normal parliamentary discussion and debate,\" said British EU parliamentarian Richard Corbett, who chaperoned the new rule through the assembly. \n \"What if this became not isolated incidents, but specific, where people could say: 'Hey, this is a fantastic platform. It's broad, it's live-streamed. It can be recorded and repeated. Let's use it for something more vociferous, more spectacular,'\" he told the Associated Press. \n In a nutshell, rule 165 of the parliament's rules of procedure allows the chair of debates to halt the live broadcast \"in the case of defamatory, racist or xenophobic language or behavior by a member.\" The maximum fine for offenders would be around 9,000 euros ($9,500). \n Under the rule, not made public by the assembly but first reported by Spain's La Vanguardia newspaper, offending material could be \"deleted from the audiovisual record of proceedings,\" meaning citizens would never know it happened unless reporters were in the room. Weingaertner said the IPA was never consulted on that. \n A technical note seen by the AP outlines a procedure for manually cutting off the video feed, stopping transmission on in-house TV monitors and breaking the satellite link to halt broadcast to the outside world. A videotape in four languages would be kept running to serve as a legal record during the blackout. A more effective and permanent system was being sought. \n It is also technically possible to introduce a safe-guard time delay so broadcasts appear a few seconds later. This means they could be interrupted before offending material is aired. \n But the system is unwieldy. Lawmakers have the right to speak in any of the European Union's 24 official languages. An offending act could well be over before the assembly's President Antonio Tajani even has a chance to hit the kill switch. Misunderstandings and even abuses could crop up. \n During a debate in December, Gerolf Annemans, from Belgium's Flemish independence party Vlaams Belang, expressed concern that the rule \"can be abused by those who have hysterical reactions to things that they qualify as racist, xenophobic, when people are just expressing politically incorrect views.\" \n Even those involved in the move acknowledge that it's a sensitive issue. \n Helmut Scholz, from Germany's left-wing Die Linke party, said EU lawmakers are elected \u2014 indeed the EU parliament is the bloc's only popularly elected institution \u2014 and must be able to express their views about how Europe should work. \n \"You can't limit or deny this right,\" he said. \n He worries about fake news too, but of the kind made from selective extracts of debates. \n \"If you are following the whole debate that is one thing, but if you have certain media who are taking out individual sentences you could falsify the whole issue,\" he said. \n Still, Nazi rallying cries and racist obscenities are relatively rare but not unheard of. \n \"We need an instrument against that, to take it out of the record, to stop distribution of such slogans, such ideas,\" Scholz said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "European lawmakers, in unusual move, pull the plug on racist talk"}

{"date": "February 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Hazmat crews investigated the kiosk machines at Kuala Lumpur International Airport today. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> Was it a poorly executed assassination or did North Korea want to showcase its stockpile of banned chemical weapons? \n The use of the highly toxic VX warfare agent to kill the estranged half brother of North Korea's leader has raised questions about Pyongyang's real motives in one of the strangest killings the world has seen. \n Some say North Korea, in allegedly bringing a U.N.-classified weapon of mass destruction to kill a man at a busy international airport, intended to show the world what it can do with chemical weapons, which are easily forgotten amid concerns about the country's advancing nuclear missile technologies. \n But other experts believe it's unlikely that North Korea wanted VX to be discovered. There's no reason for Pyongyang to risk taking another hit when it's already under heavy international sanctions over its nuclear program. It's also doubtful that the country would be suddenly willing to showcase its chemical weapons as a deterrent when it has never acknowledged their existence, the experts say. \n For Pyongyang, killing Kim Jong Nam, who might have been seen as a potential threat to leader Kim Jong Un, would have been the clear priority that made any other consideration secondary, said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University. \n \"They probably picked the deadliest chemical at their disposal because they absolutely didn't want to fail at killing Kim Jong Nam,\" Koh said. \"The fallout of using VX at an international airport could turn out to be significant for the country, but I doubt that the North Koreans thoroughly thought this through.\" \n North Korea has denied involvement in the Feb. 13 attack on Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur's airport, and also refused to confirm that it was Kim who died. Saying that one of its nationals died from a \"heart stroke,\" North Korea has strongly criticized the investigation by Malaysia, which has been one of its few legitimate diplomatic partners, and made repeated demands for Kim's body. \n The overwhelming presumption that North Korea's government organized a hit job on Kim only strengthened after Malaysian police announced they found VX on his eyes and face. Analysts say it's almost certain that the highly powerful nerve agent, which scientists say is capable of killing 500 people through skin exposure with an amount weighing as much as just two pennies, would have been sourced from North Korea's state laboratories as its materials are tightly controlled internationally and hard to obtain. \n South Korea's military believes North Korea has one of the world's largest stockpiles of chemical weapons with up to 5,000 tons that include sarin, mustard, tabun and hydrogen cyanide, in addition to V-type nerve agents. \n If North Korea really did use VX to assassinate Kim, it would indicate a new level of sophistication in its handling of chemical weapons. The North Koreans probably needed to conduct many tests before figuring out the precise amount of VX that would kill Kim Jong Nam without harming the assailants or anyone else nearby in one of the world's busiest airports. \n While some Western analysts have argued through the media that North Korea might have used Kim's assassination to draw attention to its chemical weapons, most South Korean experts doubt it. \n North Korea, which has been pursuing nuclear weapons as an ultimate deterrent, has little to gain by highlighting its chemical weapons, which would only bring harsher punitive measures and put further pressure on the United States to relist the country as a state sponsor of terrorism, analysts say. \n \"North Korea was already under immense pressure over its efforts to develop nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and also its human rights issues. Things will get even more complicated for Pyongyang if its chemical weapons issues are thrown into the mix,\" said Chang Yong Seok, an analyst at Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies. \n Perhaps North Korea expected that its use of VX would go undetected because only a tiny amount would have been needed to kill Kim, experts say. \n Or maybe using VX might have been a logical choice for North Korea because it relied on two lightly trained foreign women to do the job. North Korea would have been reluctant to directly use its own operatives when it had no plans to acknowledge its involvement. A less powerful chemical, including those needing injection devices or other equipment, would have increased the possibility of the women failing to kill Kim or would require larger dosses that might have put more lives at risk. \n It's still unclear how the two women handled the VX without contaminating themselves and others, including travelers and medical workers who handled Kim's body. \n Some analysts say that North Korea probably produced VX in the form of a binary agent, where two chemicals that aren't separately deadly become a nerve agent when mixed together. \n But a South Korean military researcher, who didn't want to be named because he wasn't authorized to talk to reporters, has doubts. While it can be made as a binary agent, VX doesn't synthesize easily, so wiping a person's face separately with two of its component chemicals may not be a surefire way to kill him, said the researcher. \n What's more likely is that the North Koreans who allegedly organized the assassination coated the women's hands with protective chemicals before putting VX on them, he said. Aside from the two suspects, police have also arrested a North Korean who worked at a Malaysian company and are seeking seven more North Koreans who are believed to have been involved in Kim's death, including an embassy official and an airline employee. \n \"The security camera footage shows one of the women heading to the bathroom to wash her hands after attacking Kim. If she touched VX with her bare hands, she wouldn't have had the time to do even that,\" said the researcher. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Why N.

{"date": "February 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Pope Francis has quietly reduced sanctions against a handful of pedophile priests. Many canon lawyers and church authorities argue that defrocking pedophiles can put society at greater risk because the church no longer exerts any control over them. \n VATICAN CITY >> Pope Francis has quietly reduced sanctions against a handful of pedophile priests, applying his vision of a merciful church even to its worst offenders in ways that survivors of abuse and the pope's own advisers question. \n One case has come back to haunt him: An Italian priest who received the pope's clemency was later convicted by an Italian criminal court for his sex crimes against children as young as 12. The Rev. Mauro Inzoli is now facing a second church trial after new evidence emerged against him, the Associated Press has learned. \n The Inzoli case is one of several in which Francis overruled the advice of the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and reduced a sentence that called for the priest to be defrocked, two canon lawyers and a church official told AP. Instead, the priests were sentenced to penalties including a lifetime of penance and prayer and removal from public ministry. \n In some cases, the priests or their high-ranking friends appealed to Francis for clemency by citing the pope's own words about mercy in their petitions, the church official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the proceedings are confidential. \n \"With all this emphasis on mercy \u2026 he is creating the environment for such initiatives,\" the church official said, adding that clemency petitions were rarely granted by Pope Benedict XVI, who launched a tough crackdown during his 2005-2013 papacy and defrocked some 800 priests who raped and molested children. \n At the same time, Francis also ordered three longtime staffers at the congregation dismissed, two of whom worked for the discipline section that handles sex abuse cases, the lawyers and church official said. \n One is the head of the section and will be replaced before leaving March 31. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said the others too will be replaced and that staffing in the office, which has a yearslong backlog of cases, would be strengthened after Francis recently approved hiring more officials. \n \"The speed with which cases are handled is a serious matter and the Holy Father continues to encourage improvements in this area,\" Burke told AP. \n He also dispelled rumors that sex-abuse cases would no longer be handled by the congregation, saying the strengthened office would handle all cases submitted. \n Burke said Francis' emphasis on mercy applied to \"even those who are guilty of heinous crimes.\" He said priests who abuse are permanently removed from ministry, but are not necessarily dismissed from the clerical state, the church term for laicization or defrocking. \n \"The Holy Father understands that many victims and survivors can find any sign of mercy in this area difficult,\" Burke said. \"But he knows that the Gospel message of mercy is ultimately a source of powerful healing and of grace.\" \n St. John Paul II was long criticized for failing to respond to the abuse crisis, but ultimately he said in 2002 that \"there is no place in the priesthood or religious life\" for anyone who would harm the young. Francis has repeatedly proclaimed \"zero tolerance\" for abusive priests and in December wrote to the world's bishops committing to take \"all necessary measures\" to protect them. \n But he also recently said he believed sex abusers suffer from a \"disease\" \u2014 a medical term used by defense lawyers to seek mitigating factors in canonical sentences. \n Marie Collins, an Irish abuse survivor and founding member of Francis' sex-abuse advisory commission, expressed dismay that the congregation's recommended penalties were being weakened and said abusers are never so sick that they don't know what they're doing. \n \"All who abuse have made a conscious decision to do so,\" Collins told AP. \"Even those who are pedophiles, experts will tell you, are still responsible for their actions. They can resist their inclinations.\" \n Victim advocates have long questioned Francis' commitment to continuing Benedict's tough line, given he had no experience dealing with abusive priests or their victims in his native Argentina. While Francis counts Boston's Cardinal Sean O'Malley as his top adviser on abuse, he has also surrounded himself with cardinal advisers who botched handling abuse cases in their archdioceses. \n \"They are not having zero tolerance,\" said Rocio Figueroa, a former Vatican official and ex-member of the Peru-based Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, a conservative Catholic lay society rocked by sex scandals. The Vatican recently handed down sanctions against the group's founder after determining that he sexually, psychologically and physically abused his recruits. His victims, however, are enraged that it took the Vatican six years to decide that the founder should be isolated, but not expelled, from the community. \n The church official stressed that to his knowledge, none of Francis' reduced sentences had put children at risk. \n Many canon lawyers and church authorities argue that defrocking pedophiles can put society at greater risk because the church no longer exerts any control over them. They argue that keeping the men in restricted ministry, away from children, at least enables superiors to exert some degree of supervision. \n But Collins said the church must also take into account the message that reduced canonical sentences sends to both survivors and abusers. \n \"While mercy is important, justice for all parties is equally important,\" Collins said in an email. \"If there is seen to be any weakness about proper penalties, then it might well send the wrong message to those who would abuse.\" \n It can also come back to embarrass the church. Take for example the case of Inzoli, a well-connected Italian priest who was found guilty by the Vatican in 2012 of abusing young boys and ordered defrocked. \n Inzoli appealed and in 2014 Francis reduced the penalty to a lifetime of prayer, prohibiting him from celebrating Mass in public or being near children, barring him from his diocese and ordering five years of psychotherapy. \n In a statement announcing Francis' decision to reduce the sentence, Crema Bishop Oscar Cantoni said \"no misery is so profound, no sin so terrible that mercy cannot be applied.\" \n In November, an Italian criminal judge showed little mercy in convicting Inzoli of abusing five children, aged 12-16, and sentencing him to four years, nine months in prison. The judge said Inzoli had a number of other victims but their cases fell outside the statute of limitations. \n Burke disclosed to AP that the Vatican recently initiated a new canonical trial against Inzoli based on \"new elements\" that had come to light. He declined to elaborate. \n Amid questions about how the battle against abuse was faring, Francis recently named O'Malley, who heads his sex-abuse advisory commission, as a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. But it's not clear what influence he can wield from his home base in Boston. \n Francis scrapped the commission's proposed tribunal for bishops who botch abuse cases following legal objections from the congregation. The commission's other major initiative \u2014 a guideline template to help dioceses develop policies to fight abuse and safeguard children \u2014 is gathering dust. The Vatican never sent the template to bishops' conferences, as the commission had sought, or even linked it to its main abuse-resource website. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pope quietly trims sanctions for sex abusers seeking mercy"}

Recent catch surveys show less than 5 percent of the peak they reached in the 1970s, the report stated. \n However, the skates \"remain numerous throughout the greater portion of their range, numbering in the hundreds of millions,\" the report stated. \n The thorny skate ranges from Greenland to South Carolina. Animal Welfare Institute and Defenders of Wildlife called on the federal government to offer the fish Endangered Species Act listing, which could've led to habitat protection or new fishing restrictions. \n The skates live in the Gulf of Maine, a key commercial fishing area, and the call to protect them generated some resistance from fishing groups. \n Tara Zuardo, an attorney for Animal Welfare Institute, said Saturday that the group is disappointed by the government's ruling, and disagrees that the skate is not being subjected to overfishing. \n \"Climate change and other factors continue to impact this species,\" Zuardo said. \n Fishermen have been prohibited from harvesting the thorny skate commercially since 2003. The fish are sometimes taken as bycatch in other fisheries, including by vessels that seek cod and some that seek other skates. \n Skates have commercial value as bait as well as food, with the meat frequently appearing as \"skate wing\" on menus. It tends to be a little less expensive to consumers than other kinds of fish. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Thorny skate will not be added to endangered species list"}

Analysts at the Homeland Security Department's intelligence arm found insufficient evidence that citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries included in President Donald Trump's travel ban pose a terror threat to the U.S. \n Muhammad Ali's son, who bears the boxing great's name, was detained by immigration officials at a Florida airport and questioned about his ancestry and religion in what amounted to unconstitutional profiling, a family friend said Saturday. \n Returning from a Black History Month event in Jamaica, Muhammad Ali Jr. and his mother, Khalilah Camacho Ali, were pulled aside and separated from each other on Feb. 7 at the immigration checkpoint at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, said Chris Mancini, a family friend and attorney. \n Camacho Ali was released a short time later after showing a photo of herself with her ex-husband, the former heavyweight boxing champion, Mancini said. But Ali Jr. was not carrying a photo of his world-famous father \u2014 a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \n Ali Jr., 44, who confirmed his Muslim faith, was detained about two hours, despite telling officials that he's Ali's son and a native-born U.S. citizen, Mancini said. It was the first time Ali Jr. and his mother have ever been asked if they're Muslim when re-entering the United States, he said. \n \"From the way they were treated, from what was said to them, they can come up with no other rational explanation except they fell into a profiling program run by customs, which is designed to obtain information from anyone who says they're a Muslim,\" Mancini said in a phone interview. \"It's quite clear that what triggered his detention was his Arabic name and his religion.\" \n Reached for comment Friday, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman said in an email: \"Due to the restrictions of the Privacy Act, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection cannot discuss individual travelers; however, all international travelers arriving in the U.S. are subject to CBP inspection,\" according to The Courier-Journal's report about the detention. \n An airport spokesman referred questions on Saturday to customs and border protection officials. \n During his detention, Ali Jr. was asked repeatedly about his lineage and his name, \"as if that was a pre-programmed question that was part of a profile,\" Mancini said. \n Ali Jr. and his mother have been frequent global travelers. The family connects their treatment to President Donald Trump's efforts to restrict immigration after calling during his campaign for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. \n \"This has never happened to them before,\" Mancini said. \"They're asked specifically about their Arabic names. Where they got their names from and whether they're Muslims. It doesn't take much to connect those dots to what Trump is doing.\" \n Camacho Ali and Ali Jr. live in Florida. They have not traveled abroad since, and are considering filing a federal lawsuit, he said. \n Asked why the matter was just now coming to light, Mancini said: \"Khalilah had prior commitments as did I and when she finally got in to see me for a legal opinion of what they did, I brought it to the media immediately.\" \n Ali, the three-time heavyweight champion and humanitarian, died last June at age 74 after a long battle with Parkinson's disease.

American Samoa's longest serving non-voting delegate to the U.S House of Representatives Faleomavaega died Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2017, at age 73. \n PAGO PAGO, American Samoa >> American Samoa's longest-serving non-voting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives, Eni H. Faleomavaega, has died. He was 73. \n His sister-in-law, Therese Hunkin, didn't disclose how the former 13-term delegate died Wednesday but said he was at his home in Provo, Utah. \n \"He passed away peacefully at his home surrounded by family and a few close friends,\" Hunkin said in a brief phone interview from Provo. \n The House delegate for American Samoa, which is a U.S. territory about 2,300 miles south of Hawaii, can vote in committee but not on the House floor. Faleomavaega, a Democrat, became a congressional delegate in 1989 and held the position for 13 consecutive terms. \n He \"had served the people and government of American Samoa faithfully for many years,\" said American Samoa's acting Gov. Lemanu Palepoi Peleti Mauga. \n Faleomavaega began his political career in 1973 as an administrative assistant to Paramount Chief A.U. Fuimaono, the territory's first elected representative to Washington. He served as staff counsel to the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs from 1975 to 1981 before returning to American Samoa as its deputy attorney general. \n In 1985, he was elected lieutenant governor before becoming a congressional delegate. \n He was a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, where he was a ranking member of the subcommittee on Asia, and the House Committee on Natural Resources. \n In 1996, Faleomavaega participated in a boycott of an address by French President Jacques Chirac before a joint session of Congress. Just days before Chirac's speech, France conducted a series of nuclear tests at the Moruroa and Fangatauga atolls in the South Pacific, despite worldwide protests. \n \"It is with pleasure that I say that life with Eni was far from dull,\" his wife, Hinanui Hunkin, told The Associated Press via email from Provo on Wednesday night. \"I am so grateful for the trust that the people of American Samoa, for so many years, placed in him as their servant. I love and miss you, American Samoa.\" \n Born in Eni Hunkin in Vailoatai village on the U.S. territory, Faleomavaega graduated from Kahuku High School in Hawaii in 1962. He then earned a bachelor of arts in political science and history from Brigham Young University in Utah in 1966. \n After serving three years in the U.S. Army with a stint in Vietnam, Faleomavaega earned a law degree from the University of Houston in 1972. A year later, he earned a master of laws degree from the University of California, Berkeley. \n During his time in the House, Faleomavaega was challenged over the use of his surname, which is a Matai orator title bestowed upon him by the Faiivae family of Leone when he was known as Eni Hunkin. \"Faleomavaega\" is the Samoan chieftain title of the family. \n High Chief Faiivae Apelu Galeais, who lost an election to Faleomavaega, asked the High Court of American Samoa in 1997 to strip the delegate of his title. Galeais, leader of the family clan, said Faleomavaega did not attend family and village meetings and did not contribute to their functions. \n Faleomavaega dismissed the complaint as \"vindictive.\" \n Faleomavaega was unseated in 2014 by Republican Aumua Amata Radewagen. He is survived by his wife, five children and 10 grandchildren. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "American Samoa's longest-serving U.S. House delegate dies"}

{"date": "February 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez, who is a candidate to run the Democratic National Committee, speaks during the general session of the DNC winter meeting in Atlanta, Saturday, Feb. 25, 2017. \n ATLANTA >> Democrats elected former Labor Secretary Tom Perez as their new national chairman Saturday over a liberal Minnesota congressman, capping a divisive campaign that reflected the depths of the party's electoral failures as well as the energy from resistance to President Donald Trump. \n Perez, the first Latino to hold the post, edged Rep. Keith Ellison in the second round of voting by Democratic National Committee members gathered in Atlanta. The new chairman must rebuild a party that in the last decade has lost about 1,000 elected posts from the White House to Congress to the 50 statehouses, a power deficit Democrats have not seen nationally in 90 years. \n In a nod to his winning margin of 35 votes out of 435 cast, to say nothing of the lingering friction between old-guard Democrats and outspoken liberal upstarts, Perez tapped Ellison to serve as deputy chair. \n \"We are all in this together,\" Perez said, calling on Democrats to fight \"the worst president in the history of the United States.\" \n Ellison, who had backing from many liberals, including 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, added his own call for unity and noted that both men had promised to rebuild state and local Democratic parties across the country. \n \"We don't have the luxury of walking out of this room divided,\" he said, as the two men stood together on stage as some young Ellison supporters jeered from the gallery. \n Republicans control the White House, Congress and 33 governorships, while the GOP is one Senate confirmation from a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Despite President Barack Obama's personal electoral successes, the party suffered crushing defeats, losing the House majority in 2010 and the Senate in 2014. \n President Donald Trump said via Twitter: \"Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!\" \n Perez had told party activists earlier in the day that Democrats face a \"crisis of confidence\" and \"a crisis of relevance.\" \n Perez first entered the race upon urging from Obama and his inner circle, and the former president released a statement praising both men after the vote. \n \"I know that Tom Perez will unite us under that banner of opportunity,\" Obama said, \"and lay the groundwork for a new generation of Democratic leadership for this big, bold, inclusive, dynamic America we love so much.\" \n The son of Dominican immigrants, Perez comes to the job with a demonstrably liberal record as a civil rights attorney and backer of organized labor, but he carried the establishment label as a Maryland resident who's spent years in the Washington orbit, working in the Justice Department and ultimately as an Obama Cabinet officer. \n Former Vice President Joe Biden endorsed him; one of Obama's closest aides, Valerie Jarrett, made calls to DNC members on Perez's behalf as late as Friday night. \n The new chairman will not be the undisputed \"leader of the party,\" even with Democrats out of power. \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California will remain the highest ranking Democrats in Washington. But Perez must now join with Schumer and Pelosi as part cheerleader, part fundraiser, part organizer and recruiter, part public messenger, helping frame the party's arguments and identity, while charting a strategy to turn energy into votes in upcoming elections. \n Perez and Ellison appeared together for a joint news conference afterward in a session that was originally planned to be the winner's opportunity to address reporters. Perez said they \"are going to put our values in action\" for a country he described as \"fearful\" over Trump's priorities. \n Ellison had the endorsement of Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, but also from Schumer. \n Liberal groups that backed Ellison ranged from guarded to despondent with the outcome. \n Sanders released a statement congratulating Perez but warning that \"it is imperative that Tom understands that the same-old, same-old is not working.\" \n Jim Dean, chair of Democracy for America, called Perez's election \"incredibly disappointing\" and said the \"resistance will persist \u2026 with or without the leadership of the Democratic National Committee.\" \n Jeff Weaver, who managed Sanders' presidential campaign and now runs the offshoot \"Our Revolution\" group, said Perez and Ellison have to prove themselves now. \n \"Do they really invest in 50 state parties? Are they really going to engage with people in the streets?\" Weaver asked. \"Are they really going to bring those people into the party, so that you have a much broader cross-section of Democratically aligned voters represented?\" \n Ellison told reporters that he \"trusts\" Perez, and he encouraged other liberal activists to do the same. \n Perez succeeds Chairwoman Donna Brazile, who led the party as interim chief in the fallout from disclosure of the DNC hacking. \n Brazile said the party has worked with cybersecurity experts to address vulnerabilities. She chided Trump for his mockery of DNC cybersecurity and his doubts that Russians are at fault. \n \"No, Donald Trump,\" she said, \"you can't go to Staples and buy anti-Russian hacking software.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Democrats elect Perez party chairman on second ballot"}

The river drains into the Pacific Ocean on the U.S. side. \n Serge Dedina, the mayor of Imperial Beach, California, said residents of his city and other coastal communities just north of the border have complained about a growing stench. \n Dedina criticized federal officials in the U.S. and Mexico for not alerting people to the spill. \n \"Border authorities charged with managing sewage infrastructure and reporting these spills must do better and be held accountable for this act,\" Dedina said in a statement Saturday. He called for the resignation of Edward Drusina, chief of the international water commission, over his lack of attention to cross-border sewage flows. \n Officials with the commission didn't immediately return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment Saturday. \n The mayor said his office will seek an investigation into the spill and its aftermath, adding that U.S. officials \"must make fixing sewage infrastructure a priority and issue of national security.\" \n San Diego County beaches, which typically would be closed by such a spill, already were off-limits to swimmers and surfers because of runoff as a result of recent storms, Dedina said. \n Over the years, several large sewage spills on both sides of the border have worsened conditions in the Tijuana River, one of the most polluted waterways in the country, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper. Old sewage infrastructure in Tijuana, Mexico, and the lack of any plumbing in some residences there have been blamed for the problem. \n Imperial Beach, popular among surfers, was closed for days in 2012 after a pipe broke in Tijuana and spewed nearly 3 million gallons of sewage into the ocean. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Large sewage spill in Tijuana, Mexico, flows north of border"}

Both are on federal land. \n Authorities this week cleared the last holdouts from the camp near the Standing Rock Reservation, which straddles the North Dakota and South Dakota border. Thousands of people stayed there before the area was buried in winter blizzards. \n Corps officials say about 240 dumpsters have been hauled out of the main camp, each brimming with debris of old food stores, structures, tents, building materials and abandoned personal belongings. Officials estimate another 240 loads or so will get the job done, the Bismarck Tribune reported (http://bit.ly/2lVklJS). \n The corps and the tribe are doing a cultural survey to see if any special items, such as teepees, require separate handling and consultation. The contract also included a special environmental crew to deal with any potentially hazardous or toxic materials. \n Tribal contractors were helping to clear the Rosebud site, including Logan Thompson, who brought skid steers, loaders and a crew of 10. \n \"The mud is killing us,\" Thompson said. \"I'm hoping if it stays cold like this, by Monday we could be done.\" \n Many protesters moved into other camps on the reservation. Tribal officials, along with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, are moving to clear those camps and may get some help from the state. \n A spokesman for North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said the office supports Standing Rock's efforts, but there are no definite plans to deploy any state resources. He said the North Dakota Highway Patrol can assist on public roadways, but using the National Guard requires an official request from either Sioux County or the Bureau of Indian Affairs. \n \"There are no specific plans, but he stands ready to assist, if requested,\" Mike Nowatzki said. \n The concrete barricades that have been used to blockade and route traffic near the Oceti Sakowin camp were also being moved Friday, but Highway 1806 remains closed north and south of the camp. \n Highway Patrol Lt.

A permanent 15,000 square-foot e-sports facility is scheduled to open in Las Vegas. \n LAS VEGAS >> The arena has all the features that a professional sports venue needs: stands, warm-up areas for teams, massive screens for spectators and a broadcast platform for commentators. But what distinguishes this new Las Vegas arena is its dozens of video game consoles. \n The 15,000-square-foot e-sports venue slated to open Friday will host competitive video game tournaments. It's part of a trend that the casino industry hopes will attract the millennial crowd, the 15- to 34-year-olds who are becoming majority spenders in today's economy but aren't necessarily interested in traditional gambling. \n \"Las Vegas needs to consistently reinvent itself to remain relevant to the up-and-coming generation,\" said Seth Schorr, CEO of Fifth Street Gaming and a member of the board of directors of Millennial Esports, the company behind the arena. \"We've always come up with ways to maintain our position as the entertainment capital of the world.\" \n Athletes participating in a tournament at the arena will emerge from a tunnel surrounded by roaring crowds in the stands. They will then go on a podium and sit at stations equipped with game consoles, monitors and other equipment. \n The venue will open its doors March 3 with a three-day, $50,000-prize-pool Halo World Championship qualifier and host an EA Sports-sanctioned Madden 17 NFL tournament later in March. \n The arena is within walking distance of downtown hotel-casinos. It will host 200 people in stadium-style seating overlooking the main stage, but hundreds more can be accommodated in another hall outfitted with screens showing the live competition. The entire facility was built in an area that once housed movie theaters and a nightclub. \n More than 3 miles of CAT cable were needed to wire the facility. Its dozens of ports offer internet speeds of one-gigabit. When no tournaments are in progress, the facility will be open to casual gamers and others interested in using the high-speed internet. \n Las Vegas casinos have invested in numerous non-gaming amenities to attract the elusive millennials, from rooms with bunk beds for the young travelers who don't want to spend a minute apart to a lounge that features pool, foosball and air hockey. The Downtown Grand, a short walk from the new arena, has an e-sports lounge, where tournament competitors, casual gamers and fans play and socialize. \n \"The younger people don't get enamored by the glitz and the glitter of something; it's all about authenticity for them,\" said Alex Igelman, CEO of Millennial Esports. \n Vegas is betting on e-sports as its popularity has evolved from a niche genre of gaming to a lucrative sport thanks to new technologies, more reliable internet speeds and a generation of gamers that has grown up watching competitive matches on YouTube and other sites. Nevada sportsbooks have already taken wagers on matches. \n The sport now draws tens of millions of spectators to online platforms and real-world venues, including New York City's Madison Square Garden, the Los Angeles' Staples Center and Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena, which earlier this month saw 16 of the world's best CS:GO teams compete. Estimates show 323 million people watched e-sports in 2016.

{"date": "February 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Adam Purinton, who has been charged with murder and attempted murder in the Wednesday night shooting at a crowded bar in the Kansas City suburb of Olathe. One man was killed and two were injured in the shooting. \n OLATHE, Kan. >> A Kansas man accused of shooting two Indian immigrants and a third man at a bar, in what some believe was a hate crime, was always a drinker but became a \"drunken mess\" after his father died about 18 months ago, a longtime neighbor said Saturday. \n Andy Berthelsen said his neighbor Adam Purinton, who is charged with murder and attempted murder in Wednesday night's attack, was very close to his father, who died of pancreatic cancer. \n He said in the past year, Purinton bounced from one menial job to the next and was sometimes drunk by mid-morning. But in the 15 years he's lived across the street from Purinton in Olathe, Berthelsen said he's never heard him make a racist remark or talk politics. He said he doesn't believe the shooting stemmed from hatred, and that it likely resulted from Purinton's physical and mental deterioration. \n \"This is someone who's gone downhill very quickly,\" Berthelsen told The Associated Press by phone Saturday. \"He was a drunken mess.\" \n Purinton, 51, was arrested hours after the attack at a restaurant and bar about 70 miles (110 kilometers) from Olathe in Clinton, Missouri. He is jailed on murder and attempted murder charges, and he didn't have a lawyer as of Saturday, according to court records. His first court appearance is scheduled for Monday. \n Purinton's mother, Marsha Purinton, told The New York Times that her son \"snapped, and this is not his typical self.\" The newspaper said she declined to elaborate, and calls by the AP to a home listing believed to be hers got a busy signal. \n According to witnesses to the attack at Austins Bar and Grill, which is about a mile from Purinton's home, Purinton yelled \"get out of my country\" at the two Indian men before he opened fire. \n Srinivas Kuchibhotla, a 32-year-old engineer at GPS device-maker Garmin, was killed. His friend and colleague, 32-year-old Alok Madasani, and a man who tried to intervene, 24-year-old Ian Grillot, were wounded. Madasani was released from the hospital Thursday. Grillot remains hospitalized. \n Authorities on Friday declined to discuss a possible motive for the attack or to say if they were investigating it as a possible hate crime. But Madasani's father in India described it as such, and the incident has stoked fears about the treatment of immigrants, who feel targeted by President Donald Trump's promises to ban certain travelers, build a wall along the Mexico border and put \"America first.\" \n The Kansas City Star, without citing its sources, reported that Purinton allegedly told a bartender at the Missouri restaurant where he was arrested that he needed a place to hide because he had just killed two Middle Eastern men. \n Madasani, also a Garmin engineer, told The New York Times on Friday that Purinton had been sitting near him and Kuchibhotla on the bar's patio. Madasani said he asked them what type of visas they were on and whether they were in the U.S. illegally. Both were in the country legally. \n \"We didn't react,\" Madasani said. \"People do stupid things all the time. This guy took it to the next level.\" \n Madasani said he went to get a manager, but when he got back to the patio, the man was already being escorted out. \n Authorities say Purinton returned a short time later and opened fire. \n Berthelsen said Purinton owned shotguns for bird hunting and inherited handguns from his father. He said neighbors did not feel unsafe around Purinton. \n While Purinton is a registered Republican, Berthelsen said he didn't ever hear him mention Trump or former President Barack Obama. \n Purinton is a Navy veteran and former air traffic controller, and Berthelsen, a 57-year-old contractor, said his neighbor did IT work in the past. But over the past year, Purinton worked at liquor and hardware stores and washed dishes at a pizza parlor, Berthelsen said. \n Austins reopened on Saturday. Many of the people who trickled in for lunch hugged staff members or other patrons. A makeshift shrine of flowers continued to build beneath a tree near the main entrance. And police in three vehicles monitored across the parking lot. \n One of the co-owners, Brandon Blum, said the bar has been a neighborhood fixture for 30 years and that everybody's upset by the attack. He declined to discuss it further or to say whether Purinton frequented the bar. \n John Teegarden, a regular who has been going to Austins for two decades, said Saturday that he didn't know the victims well but had seen them around. He said the bar staff and guests are \"like one big family,\" and his older son even works there, though he wasn't on duty when the attack happened. \n He called Grillot's attempt to intervene in the attack unsurprising. \n \"If it wasn't him, it would've been someone else,\" Teegarden said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Neighbor: Bar attack suspect a 'drunken mess,' not political"}

The group rejected $500,000 in federal funding earlier this month, saying the actions and statements of President Donald Trump are anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant. \n MINNEAPOLIS >> The leaders of a Minnesota nonprofit that works to improve the lives of young Somalis knew the stakes were high when they rejected $500,000 in federal funding earlier this month. \n Eighty students who were expected to go through a career mentoring and job placement program over the next two years now might not get the chance. Workshops designed to help hundreds of Somali parents might have to be cancelled. And plays meant to get people talking about difficult topics may have to be scaled back. \n Still, Ka Joog is proud of its decision. The group was among several U.S. nonprofits that rejected federal grant money designed to counter violent extremism, citing actions and statements made by President Donald Trump that they view as anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant, including the ban on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries that he tried to impose. \n Ka Joog is planning an April fundraising event to try to make up for the half-million dollars it turned down, in hopes that it can expand its programs as planned to help as many young people as possible. \n \"This money would have impacted Ka Joog and the community and young people in so many ways,\" said executive director Mohamed Farah. \"But it's not about the money, to be honest. It's about the principle and about what we stand for, and that's priceless.\" \n The name Ka Joog is Somali for \"stay away\" and is symbolic of the group's message: Stay away from negative influences of drugs, violence and radicalism and keep your life on a positive track by attaining higher education and serving your community. The group hosts fun activities, such as arts events, barbeques and wilderness experiences, as well as serious forums that give young Somalis a platform to share their opinions. \n Though the group wasn't started specifically to combat terrorism, its programming to keep kids engaged has been welcome in Minnesota, which has the largest Somali population in the U.S. and has been a target for terror recruiters. Since 2007, roughly three dozen young Somalis have left the state to join militant groups in Somalia or Syria. \n Farah said Ka Joog served about 500 young Somalis last fiscal year, up from about 330 the year before. Most were between the ages of 12 and 24, though it serves younger children as well. \n Ka Joog relies on donations, and aside from a handful of paid staffers, most of its workers are volunteers. The federal grant \u2014 $250,000 in each of the next two years \u2014 would have comprised a large part of its operating budget, which was $423,260 for the fiscal year that ended July 31, Farah said. \n Jon Pratt, executive director of the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits, said it's rare for groups to turn down grants. In most cases, groups simply don't apply for grants that might pose a conflict. But in this case, a change of national leadership came in the middle of the funding process, he said. \n \"When it comes to government funding, there's an old saying, 'If you take the king's shillings, you do the king's billing.' Sometimes there are conditions attached to something that organizations do not want to accept,\" he said. \"It's a lost financial opportunity, but probably the right decision in terms of serving their community.\" \n Farah said there were no conditions attached to this money, which was part of $10 million awarded nationwide from the Department of Homeland Security to counter violent extremism. The money was awarded shortly before President Barack Obama left office, but had not been distributed. \n Farah said his group had planned to use the money to expand programs it already operates and to reach even more people in need. The funds were destined for three programs: a career mentoring program, which helps place students in jobs; a parent-engagement program designed to strengthen families, and the arts. \n Farah said that last year, 25 students applied to participate in the career mentoring program, but Ka Joog only had funding for 18. Because of the increasing need, Ka Joog planned to use the federal money to expand the program to help 80 students overall \u2014 40 in each of the next two years. Nearly 30 have already applied for this year, and Farah said unless money can be raised, Ka Joog will have to tell them that the money isn't there for them to participate. \n Still, he's confident, and said donations have been coming in from around the country since the group announced it would reject the federal funding. \n \"We are going to get that 500,000 back one way or the other,\" he said. \"We believe that this White House is really against everything that we stand for. We thought it was best for us to really stay away.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Amy Forliti on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/amyforliti .

{"date": "February 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Willie Nelson, the children of the late reggae icon Bob Marley and comedian Whoopi Goldberg are just a few of the growing number of celebrities publicly jumping into the marijuana industry and eyeing the California pot market. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> Country singer Willie Nelson, the children of the late reggae icon Bob Marley and comedian Whoopi Goldberg are just a few of the growing number of celebrities publicly jumping into the marijuana industry and eyeing the California pot market, which is expected to explode after voters legalized the recreational use of weed. \n Regulators are still scrambling to get California's recreational pot market launched and are racing to issue licenses to growers and sellers by early 2018. Still to be decided is who will receive the first licenses to grow, distribute and sell recreational marijuana. \n Growers already cleared to sell medical marijuana in California could be the first in line. \n Analysts say brands already established in legal medical marijuana dispensaries \u2014 including celebrities who partner with approved California growers \u2014 will have a leg up when the first licenses are issued. Several pot-loving celebrities are in prime positions because of their fame and backstory with the drug, including Marley's children. \n The late Jamaican singer was at the vanguard of the global legalization movement. \n Backed by a Seattle venture capital firm, Marley's oldest daughter launched Marley Natural in 2014. Cedella Marley says California is now the world's largest legal cannabis market since voters approved Proposition 64 in November. Marley Natural products already are available in California medical dispensaries. \n There is enormous opportunity for growth in the state, Cedella Marley said in an email interview. \n \"It also carries enormous cultural significance and influence, so it will be an important place to help people understand the herb the way my dad enjoyed it,\" she said. \n Bob Marley's youngest son, Damian Marley, runs a competing operation, Stony Hill, and recently joined with another weed company to buy a vacant 77,000-square-foot prison for $4.1 million in Coalinga, in California's Central Valley. They turned it into a marijuana factory. \n All uses of pot remain illegal under federal law, keeping most banks and Wall Street companies out of an industry that could grow from $6 billion to $50 billion in the next decade, according to the financial services firm Cowen & Co. \n Nonetheless, Wall Street has taken notice. \n Beer and spirit companies have warned investors that legal weed could threaten profits. Boston Beer Co., brewer of Samuel Adams, and Brown-Forman Corp., distiller of Jack Daniels, say they fear consumers will cut down on drinking and start using marijuana more as it becomes legal in more locales. \n In California, the new marijuana law calls for nearly 20 types of licenses, including permits for farmers; delivery services that will take pot to a buyer's front door; testing labs; distributors; and dispensary operators at the retail level. \n But because the drug is still illegal under federal law, the U.S. Patent and Trademark office won't issue trademarks to protect marijuana brands. So marijuana companies and their advocates have turned to state lawmakers for help. \n Rob Bonta, a Democratic assemblyman from Alameda, has introduced a bill that would grant cannabis companies state trademarks. \n It also would ban marijuana billboards near freeways and provide money to develop standards for testing impaired drivers. Law enforcement officials have taken no position on it even though they opposed the legalization of recreational pot. \n Hezekiah Allen, head of the California Growers Association, a marijuana farmers' trade group, said California has a mature marijuana marketplace in which consumers expect high-quality pot and have more than price and quality in mind when shopping. \n \"California consumers are interested in how their products were grown, how workers were treated,\" Allen said. \n Celebrities who have associated themselves with social causes that also sell weed will stand out in California, he said. \n Few stars have invested so publicly \u2014 and heavily \u2014 in the marijuana industry as Calvin Broadus, better known as rapper Snoop Dogg. He has branded his own line of bud called Leafs by Snoop, created a marijuana news website and launched a $25 million venture capital fund for pot investing called Casa Verde, Spanish for \"greenhouse.\" \n In turn, Casa Verde has invested $10 million into Eaze, a marijuana delivery service. \n Snoop Dogg and other deep-pocketed celebrities investing in the industry are paving the way for broader acceptance, advocates argue. \n \"They're helping to legitimize marijuana,\" said Cheryl Shuman, founder of the Beverly Hills Cannabis Club. \"Marijuana is fast becoming cool and glamorous.\" \n Some 26 states and Washington, D.C., have legalized the medical use of marijuana, and polls show a majority of Americans support repealing the federal ban on marijuana. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Celebrities launch pot brands as California legalizes drug"}

{"date": "February 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Supreme Court's task is deciding whether the law, meant to prevent communications between sex offenders and minors via social media, is so broad that it violates the Constitution's free-speech protections. \n RALEIGH, N.C. >> Fresh from a trip to traffic court, Lester Packingham Jr. celebrated his turn of good fortune by announcing to friends on Facebook that his pending ticket was dismissed without him saying a word. \n \"No fine. No Court costs. No nothing. Praise be to God. Wow. Thanks, Jesus,\" Packingham wrote in a 2010 post that led to a lawsuit being heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday. \n Packingham, 36, was forbidden by a 2008 North Carolina law from using commercial social networking sites like Facebook that children could join. That's because he's a registered sex offender who was convicted of indecent liberties with a minor when he was 21. He served 10 months in prison. \n A Durham police officer investigated Packingham's post and determined he used an alias rather than his real name. Packingham was prosecuted, convicted of a felony and received a suspended prison sentence. His lawyers say no evidence pointed to Packingham using Facebook or his computer to communicate with minors or that he posted anything inappropriate or obscene. \n Now the Supreme Court's task is deciding whether the law, meant to prevent communications between sex offenders and minors via social media, is so broad that it violates the Constitution's free-speech protections. \n The case reaches the Supreme Court after it was upheld by North Carolina's highest court in a divided ruling. The law addressed websites that might allow sex offenders to gather information about minors, the state court said. But dissenting justices argued the ban extends further and could outlaw reading the New York Times and Food Network website. \n Lawyers arguing on Monday are expected to continue that dispute. \n Groups including the libertarian Cato Institute and the American Civil Liberties Union argue the North Carolina law could ban sex offenders from online life that includes looking for jobs or reading the daily musings of President Donald Trump and is unconstitutional. \n \"Everyday Americans understand that social media \u2014 which includes Twitter, Facebook, Instagram \u2014 are absolutely central to their daily life and how the First Amendment is exercised in America today,\" said Stanford law professor David Goldberg, who will represent Packingham at the Supreme Court on Monday. \n Though the intent of North Carolina lawmakers may have been to block sexual predators from finding and grooming prey online, Goldberg said the law goes further and makes it a crime for someone on a sex-offender registry to say anything about any subject on social media. \n \"That goes way, way too far,\" Goldberg said. \"It's a crime to do anything, including what Mr. Packingham did, which was to say 'God is good' because he was victorious in traffic court. There's never been any suggestion that he was up to anything but exercising his freedom of speech.\" \n Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana also have laws restricting sex offenders' use of use of social media sites. Nine other states require offenders to disclose their online usernames and profiles, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. \n \"We have to protect young people wherever they are, whether that's at school, or at summer camp or increasingly online,\" said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, whose office is defending the law. \"This North Carolina law keeps registered sex offenders off of social networking websites that kids use without denying the offenders access to the Internet. It just keeps them off of certain web sites.\" \n The law's supporters contend that it doesn't regulate what sex offenders say, just the time, place and manner of their speech, which most people understand through the legal maxim that you can't yell \"fire\" in a crowded movie theater. The law doesn't ban offenders from using the internet entirely, just social media sites like Facebook, said Louisiana Deputy Solicitor General Colin A. Clark, who wrote a brief supporting the law joined by attorneys general in 12 other states. \n \"There's nothing that a sex offender can't say on the Internet. They just can't say it on Facebook,\" said Clark. His state, Nebraska and Indiana have had laws that federal courts ruled violated the free-speech rights of sex offenders. Louisiana amended its statute to comply with the court decision. \n The vast majority of the more than 800,000 sex offenders nationwide are required to register their names, addresses and photographs on registries maintained by states, Clark said. \n States are trying \"to come up with a practical solution to the practical problem of sex offenders being on social media and harvesting information about our children and then soliciting them online,\" he said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Emery P.

In the middle of a crowded bar, a 51-year-old former air traffic controller yelled at two Indian men - Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani - to \"get out of my country,\" witnesses said, then opened fire in an attack that killed one of the men and wounded the other, as well as a third man who tried to help on Thursday in Olathe, Kan. \n OLATHE, Kan. >> GPS device-maker Garmin long has revered diversity in its workforce, even when the locale of its ever-sprawling operational headquarters \u2014 a largely white Kansas City suburb \u2014 didn't reflect it. \n It's the place 32-year-old Srinivas Kuchibhotla came to work a few years ago. By his wife's account Friday he willingly spent long hours on an aviation systems engineering team alongside Alok Madasani, a friend and colleague also 32 and from India. \n Kuchibhotla's trek led him to have a kinship with his boss, Lebanese native Didier Popadopoulos, who says he moved to America at Kuchibhotla's age and once held the same Garmin job. \n But Garmin \u2014 a billion-dollar tech giant launched in Kansas as a startup by two men nearly three decades ago \u2014 now is reeling, trying to digest Kuchibhotla's shooting death Wednesday at a bar just a mile down the road from work. Madasani was wounded, along with a stranger who tried to help. \n Witnesses say the gunman, Adam Purinton, yelled at the two Indian men to \"get out of my country\" and opened fire. Purinton, who was arrested hours later at a bar in Missouri, remains jailed on murder and attempted murder charges. \n The shooting happened at a time when many have concerns about the treatment of immigrants in the U.S., some of whom feel targeted by the current administration. President Donald Trump has promised to ban certain travelers and been especially vocal about the threat posed by Islamic terrorist groups. \n On Friday, Garmin tried to comfort grieving employees at a closed-door vigil inside the auditorium on its campus in Olathe, Kansas. Kuchibhotla's widow, Sunayana Dumala, addressed the group of about 200 workers that included Madasani, who was released from the hospital Thursday. \n Laurie Minard, Garmin's vice president of human resources, doesn't believe the shooting will jeopardize its recruitment of workers from overseas. \n \"We tend to be a family here,\" she said at the Garmin campus, which is waging a $200 million expansion, with plans announced last August for a new manufacturing and distribution center. \"We want people to feel safe. We embrace it. We encourage it. We support it. It's extremely important to us about acceptance.\" \n At any given time, she said, more than 100 Garmin employees are in the H-1B program, which lets American companies bring foreigners with technical skills to the U.S. for three to six years. \n In an eight-year period until fiscal year 2016, Garmin on average obtained 49 certifications for foreign labor \u2014 a prerequisite for hiring with an H-1B visa \u2014 for an average of 70 positions, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. During that time, 81 percent of the certified positions were in Olathe, the Labor Department says. \n Olathe, whose name means \"beautiful\" in the Shawnee language, is a well-to-do Kansas City suburb where the median household income is above $77,000 a year. \n Worldwide, Switzerland-based Garmin Ltd. \u2014 the Kansas operation's corporate parent \u2014 has more than 11,400 workers in 60 offices and last year logged $3.02 billion in revenue. Roughly 2,800 workers are at the Kansas headquarters, which Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Pam Whiting cast as regionally \"one of our entrepreneurial success stories\" and biggest employers. \n Recruiting from overseas isn't at all unusual in the tech industry, which contends there aren't enough Americans with specialized skills the companies need. \n Indian immigrants in the U.S. has spiked from about 200,000 in the 1980s to more than 2 million today, as Indian-born scientists and engineers fueled the American tech boom. India received more H-1B visas in the U.S. for its temporary high-skilled workers, about 70 percent, than any other country in 2014. \n Stunned by Kuchibhotla's death, Popadopoulos, the Lebanese native who was the man's boss, said he plans to stay the course. \n \"When this happened, one of the things I started to think about with my wife (was) 'Is it time to leave?'\" he said. \n Then he thought: \"Leave where? I'm from here. I really think Srinivas would want us to stick together and stand up for what's right.\" \n U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran said he left a message with Olathe's mayor, offering to help assure people from India who live in Kansas that the actions leading to Kuchibhotla's death are \"not the norm.\" \n \"This is not the nature of Kansas, and we welcome people to the United States, particularly a company like Garmin and many others,\" the Kansas Republican said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "GPS device-maker Garmin reeling after Kansas worker killed"}

Ellison maintains that he is still a viable candidate. A handful of other candidates are holding out hope that neither Ellison nor Perez can command a majority, opening up the race for an upset in later rounds of voting. \n Each of the front-runners promises an aggressive counter to the Trump administration, while rebuilding a depleted organization at the state and local level \u2014 a tacit admission that party infrastructure withered during Barack Obama's eight years in the White House, despite the president's personal electoral success. The results have shown: Republicans now control the White House, Capitol Hill and nearly two-thirds of state legislatures and governorships. \n \"We are fighting for a party that is not the status quo,\" Ellison told his supporters late Friday, arguing that Democrats have become too timid and lost touch with too many voters across much of the country by abandoning working people. The key, he said, is too \"knock on doors and engage people\" while pushing policies that benefit them. \"Let's have a debate it,\" he said. \"You're not scared. I'm not scared. Let's do it.\" \n At a nearby reception, Perez said the party must be the center of Trump resistance. \n \"The most important word in a democracy is that simple two-letter: 'We,'\" he said, promising he would help Democrats capitalize on the budding opposition movement. \"It's amazing what we can accomplish when we have strong parties everywhere that allow us to put those values into action,\" he said. \n Perez got into the race at Obama's urging, but he has pushed back on the notion that represents the same \"establishment\" label that dogged Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.
