{"date": "February 26, 2017", "text": "INVISION/AP \n Dr. Firouz Naderi, left, and Anousheh Ansari posed in the press room at the Oscars. \n LOS ANGELES >> A political context larger than that of films themselves swept Iran's \"The Salesman\" into the limelight and effectively solidified its win in the best foreign language category at the Oscars on Sunday. Iranian astronaut Anousheh Ansari accepted the award on behalf of director Asghar Farhadi, who was absent from the ceremony in protest of Donald Trump's travel ban. \n \"I'm sorry I'm not with you tonight,\" Ansari read in a statement. \"My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S.\" \n Firouz Naderi, a former NASA director, and an Iranian, stood beside Ansari as she read Farhadi's words. \n It's the second Oscar for director Farhadi, and Iran, who previously won in the same category for \"A Separation\" in 2012, but the context surrounding this win is stunningly different. \n Farhadi's film, about a couple performing Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman,\" was barely even in the conversation a few months ago, overshadowed by Maren Ade's popular German comedy \"Toni Erdmann,\" but became a rallying cry for immigrant rights after President Donald Trump's seven country travel ban. \n The ban not only led to Farhadi announcing that he would not attend the awards in protest of the ban, targeted toward predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran, but also to an unprecedented show of solidary between the six nominated directors in the foreign language category. Two days before the Oscars, the six directors issued a joint statement decrying the climate of \"fanaticism\" in the United States. They said that no matter who won, the award would be dedicated to people working to foster \"unity and understanding.\" \n In Tehran, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered his congratulations to Farhadi for the prize and saw it as a move against Trump's executive order. Both state radio and TV in Tehran briefly reported about Farhadi's win based on international reports. \n \"Dividing the world into 'us' and 'enemies' categories creates fear,\" Ansari continued in Farhadi's statement, which concluded with a passionate defense of the power of film to create empathy \"between us and others, an empathy that we need today.\" \n Backstage, Naderi said that Farhadi could have chosen any number of prominent Iranians to represent him at the Oscars, but that he chose two scientists who focus on space because, \"if you go away from the earth and look back at the earth you don't see the borders and the lines.\" \n \"The Salesman\" won over the early favorite, \"Toni Erdmann,\" which in already in the early stages of development for an English language remake starring Jack Nicholson and Kristen Wii, Sweden's \"A Man Called Ove,\" Denmark's \"Land of Mine,\" and Australia's \"Tanna.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Iran's Farhadi, absent at Oscars, pleads for empathy in win"}

The float of samba school Paraiso de Tuiuti crashed into a fence that separates the stands from the pavement, injuring spectators, revelers and journalists. One reporter had an exposed fracture. \n Police began an investigation as soon as the float finished its transit through the Sambadrome. Police investigator William Lourenco Bezerra said the three conductors of the float would be questioned Monday morning, adding that one driver already had been identified as the main focus of the probe. \n \"The last float went into reverse and ended up pressing revelers against the fence on one side. That caused chaos. Then the conductors made a quick maneuver to the opposite direction and injured more people,\" Bezerra said. \"The main conductor of the float mixed with the rest of the samba school and left. But he has already been identified and will be investigated.\" \n Anna Maria Ciarlini, a medical coordinator at the sambadrome, told the Associated Press that most injuries were minor, but two people had to be rushed to a nearby hospital, one of them with severe head injuries. \n Ciarlini said 12 people were injured in total. Brazilian media reports counted 20 people seeking medical attention. \n The pavement of the Sambadrome was wet because of a persistent drizzle. Rain can make the big floats harder to guide. \n The drizzle also created more difficulties for fire fighters to cut a fence to remove two women drenched in blood. \n In a statement, samba school Paraiso do Tuiuti said it \"deeply regrets\" the incident. \"Our board offers its deepest sentiments and is open to make any clarifications as soon as all the causes of the accident are investigated. We will offer all the assistance to the victims of this irreparable incident,\" the samba school said. \n Despite the accident, the head of the Rio parade, Elmo dos Santos, said that \"the show must go on.\" \n \"The rain made the car veer to the left. Organizers tried to adjust, but then they lost control. It is all regrettable, but we cannot stop,\" dos Santos told journalists. \n Elmano Santos, a reveler from Rio, said the float missed him by inches (centimeters). \n \"It was very quick. I saw a few journalists taking pictures close to the float get injured.

Many who found out later agreed with the decision to carry on. \n \"It is all very sad, but to stop Carnival would create an even bigger problem,\" said Jonas Elias, a tourist from Salvador. \"Of course this spoils the party a bit, but to frustrate all this crowd would make the tragedy even bigger.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Float crashes, injuring 12 at Rio's Carnival parade"}

Wapner, right, as he was enrobed as a Municipal Court judge in Los Angeles. \n LOS ANGELES >> Joseph Wapner, the retired Los Angeles judge who presided over \"The People's Court\" with steady force during the heyday of the reality courtroom show, died Sunday at age 97. \n Son David Wapner told The Associated Press that his father died at home in his sleep. Joseph Wapner was hospitalized a week ago with breathing problems and had been under home hospice care. \n \"The People's Court,\" on which Wapner decided real small-claims from 1981 to 1993, was one of the granddaddies of the syndicated reality shows of today. His affable, no-nonsense approach attracted many fans, putting \"The People's Court\" in the top five in syndication at its peak. \n Before auditioning for the show, Wapner had spent more than 20 years on the bench in Los Angeles, first in Municipal Court and then in Superior Court. At one time he was presiding judge of the Los Angeles Superior Court, the largest court in the United States. He retired as judge in November 1979, the day after his 60th birthday. \n \"Everything on the show is real,\" Wapner told the AP in a 1986 interview. \"There's no script, no rehearsal, no retakes. Everything from beginning to end is like a real courtroom, and I personally consider each case as a trial.\" \n \"Sometimes I don't even deliberate,\" he added. \"I just decide from the bench, it's so obvious. The beautiful part is that I have carte blanche.\" \n \"The People's Court\" cases were tried without lawyers by the rules of Small Claims Court, which has a damage limit of $1,500. Researchers for the producer, Ralph Edwards Productions, checked claims filed in Southern California for interesting cases. \n The plaintiff and defendant had to agree to have the case settled on the show and sign a binding arbitration agreement; the show paid for the settlements. \n In some metropolitan counties, the number of small claims cases more than tripled during the 1980s; some cited Wapner as a cause. \n Johnny Carson invited Wapner him to come on \"The Tonight Show\" and settle a dispute between himself and David Letterman. Carson wanted to do it as a skit, but Wapner said no and conducted it like a trial. \n The dispute was over an old truck that Letterman kept parked by his property in Malibu. Carson said it was an eyesore and had it hauled away. When Letterman got it back, the headlights had been broken. \n \"I awarded Letterman $24.95,\" said Wapner. \n By the time Wapner left the show, in 1993, interest in the genre had cooled, but trials such as the Simpson trial and the courtroom theatrics of \"Judge Judy\" revived the TV-court craze starting in 1997. \n Wapner returned to \"The People's Court\" show in 2000 to help celebrate its 3,000th episode, judging the case of a man suing over a piece of sports memorabilia. He said he had seen snippets of Judge Judy's work, but generally never watched such shows. \n \"I never watched myself,\" he said. \"Why should I watch them?\" \n He also had a series on the Animal Planet cable channel called \"Judge Wapner's Animal Court.\" \n Wapner was a Los Angeles native and received a law degree from the University of Southern California. He is survived by his wife of 70 years, Mickey, and by two sons, both of whom joined the legal profession. A daughter, Sarah, died in 2015. \n During his days as presiding Superior Court judge, Wapner was credited with innovations aimed at saving time for trial participants. A 1971 Los Angeles Times article described his steps to streamline jury selection or even dispense with juries altogether by increasing the number of cases heard solely by a judge chosen to be acceptable to both sides in the case. \n His courtroom was also used in 1971 in a brief test of a system to videotape trials to save on the cost of making a trial transcript. \n Wapner said he was often amazed at the lengths people would go to to prove a point: \"A woman bought a birthday cake for her daughter for $9. She said it was moldy, and the baker offered to refund only $4.50. She picketed the bakery for six hours, then filed the claim. I found against the baker for $9.\" \n He generally turned down guest shots on other shows, saying, \"I'm not an actor, I'm a judge.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Joseph Wapner, star of 'The People's Court,' dead at 97"}

{"date": "February 26, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is followed by reporters as he leaves a health care meeting during the National Governors Association Winter Meeting in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> A sobering report to governors about the potential consequences of repealing the Obama-era health care law warns that federal spending cuts probably would create funding gaps for states and threaten many people with the loss of insurance coverage. \n The Affordable Care Act has two main components for expanding coverage: subsidized private health insurance available in all 50 states, and an optional Medicaid expansion that has been accepted by 31 states and the District of Columbia. Those two components of the health law cover more than 20 million people. \n A report by the consulting firms Avalere Health and McKinsey & Company concluded that the changes under consideration by the GOP-led House would reduce significantly federal dollars for Medicaid and subsidized private insurance. \n The effect on Medicaid would be far-reaching. The federal-state program for low-income people covers more than 70 million Americans, many of whom have high health care needs. \n The Associated Press obtained a copy of a slide presentation made by the consultants to governors meeting this weekend in Washington. \n The report said the combination of phasing out Medicaid expansion money from the U.S. government, plus transforming the overall program from an open-ended federal entitlement to one that operates under a cap would likely result in state funding gaps. States that expanded Medicaid would face the deepest cuts. \n States would get more flexibility to design their programs, but the money crunch could lead to cuts in eligibility, benefits, or payments to hospitals and other service providers. The impact of federal spending reductions would compound over time. \n Reduced Medicaid spending could also hurt states with dampened economic activity and fewer jobs, the consultants said. Hospitals, which benefit from Medicaid coverage, are big employers in local communities. Costs of care for uninsured patients could become an issue. \n In addition, the private insurance subsidies provided under Obama's law would also be scaled back, according to the report. \n Although states would get some additional safety-net funding, reductions in federal insurance subsidies would expose some consumers to new costs for their coverage. That would probably result in fewer people covered, as some consumers drop their plans. \n According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicaid consumed an average 19 percent of state budgets in 2015, the most current year available, ranging from 7 percent in Utah to 41 percent in New Hampshire. \n Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, said he thinks \"there's going to be a problem in the House of getting anything out of there that still provides coverage to people. That's why the Republicans have to reach out to some of the Democrats. I don't know whether this is going to happen,\" he told CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \n With President Donald Trump set to give his first speech to Congress on Tuesday night and his words on health care to be closely watched, a White House spokeswoman said the administration's goal is ensure people do not lose their coverage and that costs are lowered. \n \"So we're looking at every possible way to do exactly that: repeal a terrible, failed system and replace with something better,\" Sarah Huckabee Sanders told ABC's \"This Week.\" \n She depicted the current system as \"collapsing under itself,\" a view not shared by independent experts. It is widely acknowledged that affordability is a serious problem, but the system is not regarded as teetering on the edge. \n Governors on Saturday met privately with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who according to several of the state leaders said the Trump administration wanted to work with states to overhaul health care, but he did not provide specifics. \n A Medicaid proposal by GOP governors, a draft of which was obtained by the AP, urges Congress to change Medicaid from an open-ended federal entitlement to a program designed by each state within a financial limit. \n Some of the governors behind the proposal, including Kasich, opted to expand Medicaid in their states despite pressure from conservatives. \n \"I think there are some very conservative Republicans in the House who are going to say just get rid of the whole thing. And that's not acceptable,\" he said. \n He added: \"Republicans can go and do what they want, and I'm going to talk to them. But at the end of the day I'm going to stand up for the people that wouldn't have the coverage if they don't get this thing right. And I happen to believe that the best way to get this right over time is for actually both parties to work together. I know that's considered an impossibility now, but what's at stake is not some political thing. What's at stake here are 20 million Americans.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Report warns of state money fallout from health law repeal"}

{"date": "February 26, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n New Trier High School parent Betsy Hart, poses at a coffee shop in Evanston, Ill. The school is holding a daylong seminar on civil rights designed to help students in the largely white and affluent school see things from other perspectives on Feb. 28, 2017. \n WINNETKA, Ill. >> When a largely white public school nestled in Chicago's wealthiest suburbs planned a daylong civil rights seminar, it drafted two National Book Award winners as keynote speakers and crafted a syllabus that would be the envy of most liberal arts colleges. \n But New Trier, a high-achieving, 4,000-student high school regularly ranked among the nation's best, found itself stepping into the minefield of the national dialogue on race and civil rights. Some parents and conservative groups have deemed the event during Black History Month \"radical\" and \"divisive.\" Dueling petitions circulated, heated emails were exchanged and hundreds of people packed a school board meeting beyond capacity. \n While New Trier's demographics and resources aren't reflective of many public schools, the debate highlights the complications of teaching civil rights when much of the country struggles to discuss race. Some educators worry their work will become more difficult after a polarizing election that's fueled divisions, even in homogenous and largely Democratic areas like the upscale Lake Michigan suburbs making up New Trier. \n For educators the goal is simple. \n \"One of the things we most hope happens is for the kids to be able to see the world through someone else's eyes,\" said Superintendent Linda Yonke. \n Dozens of workshops Tuesday will cover such topics as voter suppression, affordable housing and police brutality. Colson Whitehead, whose historical fiction \"The Underground Railroad\" has won literary accolades, will speak. \n Organizers want students to think about how race might affect daily life and be moved to action, if necessary. Administrators and many parents say it's particularly important because of the school's population: Roughly 85 percent of the students are white with similar demographics among the teachers. In Winnetka, home to the main campus, the median household income is more than $200,000 and stately brick mansions are common. \n New Trier began all-school seminar days in the early 1990s, though it's not an annual event. Students and teachers write the curriculum and regular attendance rules apply. Topics vary. In previous years, the school has addressed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. \n The first hint of a pushback started last year, when the event coincided with Martin Luther King Jr. Day and one workshop included ways to explore white guilt. \n As this year's Seminar Day approached, opposition spread. \n Breitbart News \u2014 once led by White House chief strategist Steve Bannon \u2014 deemed the event \"a major left-wing indoctrination project.\" The National Review weighed in, as did the Illinois Family Institute, calling it a \"smorgasbord of ideologically non-diverse seminars.\" A local publication backed by a conservative activist and businessman dug up school administrators' voting records. A Wall Street Journal opinion piece proclaimed it a \"racial indoctrination day.\" \n Parents, some linked to conservative organizations, formed a small but vocal opposition group. \n \"The school went about this in a way that ensures it will be narrow and divisive,\" said Betsy Hart, who has two children enrolled. Hart, a senior writer at the conservative Heritage Foundation who says her school activism is separate from her day job, expects the parent group to continue pushing for more conservative voices at New Trier High. \n Among its numerous and nuanced requests, the group wants to add research supporting voter identification laws to a session on voter suppression and ensure a panel on affirmative action includes contrasting views such as the suggestion that it's detrimental for minorities. The group has presented the district with a three-ring binder full of research and an annotated schedule for the day: yellow highlights for language the parents find objectionable and green for suggested alternatives. \n Still, most students and their parents have expressed support for the day. About 450 people signed a petition seeking different speakers versus roughly 5,000 signatures for keeping the lineup as is. \n School administrators said parents had opportunities to air concerns, and adding last-minute speakers doesn't boost the seminar's quality. \n \"Critical thinking is about more than having two opposing views,\" said Tim Hayes, an assistant superintendent. \n He and others worry the opposition is in reaction to the nation's political climate and not the educational content. Experts say most schools already struggle with teaching civil rights. \n A 2012 study by the Southern Poverty Law Center examined curriculums in every state and concluded the majority failed to require teaching about the movement while others oversimplified it. \n Isabelle Hauser, a 17-year-old junior, said she won't attend the seminar. The biracial teen, whose father is white and mother's family is from Ecuador, said she was turned off by last year's talk about white guilt. \n \"It's a matter of the day being balanced. I see it as being too progressive and liberal,\" she said. \"You shouldn't feel guilty for attending such a great school and having a great education. You should feel blessed.\" \n Other students argue that's the point. Some have prepared for Seminar Day by watching Spike Lee's 1989 film, \"Do The Right Thing,\" which tells the story of simmering racial tension in a New York neighborhood that erupts in violence. \n \"When the thing that your community is most worried about is that your education is too liberal, I feel like that's a motivating factor to get out more,\" said 17-year-old Celia Buckman, a senior at New Trier. She writes for the Huffington Post, including an article supporting the seminar. \"It really makes you think about the kind of privilege that your community really has.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "School event near Chicago sparks civil rights, race debate"}

They said the proposal would give the military greater flexibility to launch airstrikes against extremists that appear to be a threat. \n Beefing up the military effort in Somalia fits with President Donald Trump's broader request for a Pentagon plan to accelerate the U.S.-led battle against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, and defeat other extremist groups, including al-Qaida and its affiliates. U.S. concerns about al-Shabab escalated in recent years as young Americans from Somali communities traveled to training camps in Somalia, raising fears they might return to the United States and conduct terror attacks. \n Somalia was one of the seven predominantly Muslim countries included in Trump's travel ban last month. The executive order has since been suspended by federal courts. \n Somalia is \"our most perplexing challenge,\" Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the head of U.S. Africa Command, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \n The United States is \"trying to take a look at Somalia from a fresh perspective in the way ahead,\" he said, describing the need to weaken the decade-old al-Shabab insurgency so that the African nation's military forces can defeat it. \n Waldhauser declined to provide details of the new options that have been proposed. \n But other officials said elements include giving U.S. special operations forces greater ability to accompany local troops on military operations against al-Shabab and easing restrictions on when the U.S. can conduct airstrikes against the group. The officials weren't authorized to publicly discuss the confidential review and spoke on condition of anonymity \n Currently there are about 50 U.S. commandos rotating in and out of Somalia to advise and assist the local troops. The new authorities could result in a small increase in the number of U.S. forces in Somalia, officials said. \n Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has approved the recommendations and sent the plan to the White House earlier this month, they added. But no final decisions have been made, and the proposal could prove politically sensitive because of the disastrous downing of two U.S. helicopters over Mogadishu in 1993 that killed 18 American troops. \n The White House declined to comment, deferring questions to the Defense Department. \n Somalia has been without a truly functioning government for two-and-a-half decades. After warlords ousted dictator Siad Barre in 1991, they quickly turned on one another, making Somalia infamous for its extreme rates of violence and the proliferation of pirates operating off its coasts. Security has improved in recent years as international efforts against al-Shabab gained ground. \n After the bodies of American soldiers were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu when the helicopters were shot down, the U.S. withdrew from the country. Since then, Islamist hard-liners have vied for power and al-Shabab's attacks have spread to Uganda and Kenya. \n Some of the U.S. officials with knowledge of the new military proposal said it is aimed at improving the U.S. advisory mission because the African Union is planning to pull out its 20,000 peacekeeping forces in Somalia in 2020. Observers say Somali troops are unprepared to fight the extremist threat on their own. \n Currently, U.S. forces can transport and accompany local troops. But they must keep their distance from front lines and can only engage the enemy if they come under attack or if Somali forces are in danger of being defeated. The new proposal would give U.S. forces the ability to move along with Somali troops into the fight if needed. \n While the American military right now can conduct airstrikes in self-defense or to protect Somali troops if they come under attack and request help, the new authorities would be broader. \n Officials said that under the new recommendations, the military would be able to launch airstrikes against militants on a more pre-emptive basis. For example, the U.S. could target al-Shabab fighters gathering for an attack rather than waiting until friendly forces were under fire. \n Al-Shabab has been ousted from most Somali cities and towns, but its suicide bombers continue to kill across large parts of the south and center of the country. That includes Mogadishu, the capital. \n Somalia's new president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, inaugurated Wednesday, warned that it will take another two decades to \"fix\" his country. Mohamed, who also holds U.S. citizenship, won election earlier this month as Somalia tries to restore effective governance. \n Waldhauser said the U.S. sees an opportunity to work with Mohamed to \"train the Somalia national security forces to a level that they can take on al-Shabab on their own.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pentagon seeks to expand fight against extremists in Somalia"}

{"date": "February 26, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2016 \n The Interior Department has put on hold changes to how it values coal extracted from public lands after mining companies sued in federal court to challenge the rules. Interior officials say in a Federal Register announcement, due to be published on Monday, that current rules will remain in place pending a court decision. The changes, crafted under the administration of President Barack Obama, were aimed at ensuring companies don't shortchange taxpayers on coal sales to Asia and other markets. \n BILLINGS, Mont. >> The Interior Department has put on hold changes to how the federal government values huge volumes of coal extracted from public lands, primarily in the Western United States, after mining companies challenged the agency in federal court. \n The move by the Trump administration means current rules governing the industry will remain in place pending decisions in the courts, according to an agency notification due to be published Monday in the Federal Register. \n The changes, crafted under the administration of President Barack Obama, were aimed at ensuring companies don't shortchange taxpayers on coal sales to Asia and other markets. Coal exports surged over the past decade even as domestic sales declined. \n Yet federal lawmakers and watchdog groups have long complained that taxpayers were losing hundreds of millions of dollars annually because royalties on coal form public lands were being improperly calculated. \n In 2016, companies sold 316 million tons of coal from federal and Indian lands valued at $5.4 billion. Those sales generated almost $600 million in reported royalties, according to Interior department data. Most coal from public lands is mined in Wyoming. Mines in Montana, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico also play a significant role. \n The fuel is used to produce about one-third of the nation's electricity, a figure that has dropped sharply in recent years as cheap natural gas has gained a much larger share of the power market. \n Rules in place since the 1980s have allowed companies to sell their fuel to affiliates and pay royalties to the government on that price, then turn around and sell the coal at higher prices, often overseas. Under the suspended rule change, the royalty rate would be determined at the time the coal is leased, and revenue will be based on the price paid by an outside entity, rather than an interim sale to an affiliated company. \n Conservationists criticized the administration's move, saying it was a \"sweetheart deal\" for the industry and will deprive states of much-needed revenues. About half the coal royalties collected by the federal government is disbursed to states. \n \"This announcement is a gift to coal companies trying to avoid paying their fair share,\" said Steve Charter, a Montana rancher who lives next to the Bull Mountain coal mine near Roundup, which has sold fuel to customers in Asia. \n Companies including Gillette, Wyoming-based Cloud Peak Energy argue that the higher price includes transportation expenses and other logistical costs that shouldn't be factored into royalty payments. \n The hold placed on the rule was welcomed by lawmakers from Western states. Montana U.S. Sen. Steve Daines said the rule would have had \"immediate detrimental effects\" on the mining industry. \n U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said the rule change threatened to increase electricity rates for rural communities by raising the cost utilities pay for coal. \"The Trump administration made the right decision to suspend this illogical and legally dubious rule,\" Bishop said. \n The Interior Department rule also included changes to oil and gas valuations, but those changes have attracted far less attention than coal royalties. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump administration blocks changes on coal mining royalties"}
