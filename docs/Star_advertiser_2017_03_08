Regulators also approved 48 people as backup drivers who must sit behind the wheel in case the prototype cars malfunction, agency spokeswoman Jessica Gonzalez said. \n The permit resolves a conflict dating to December. That's when Uber \u2014 an aggressive player in the self-driving race to bring the technology to the market \u2014 rolled out a pilot program in San Francisco, its hometown. The DMV revoked the registrations for 16 Uber vehicles, shutting down the test. \n Uber knew about the DMV's requirement to receive permission before testing in public, but the company argued that its cars do not meet the state's definition of an \"autonomous vehicle\" because they need a person to monitor them and intervene if needed. That argument raised eyebrows both among regulators and other companies with similar technology that did get permits. \n The pilot program caught the state \u2014 and San Francisco city officials \u2014 off guard. Amid a showdown that last several days, during which a few self-driving Uber SUVs did not stop for red lights, state prosecutors threatened to haul Uber before a judge if the service was not suspended immediately. \n Uber responded by packing up its cars for Arizona, where it began picking up passengers last month. \n Uber said in a statement today that it does not plan to ferry paying passengers for now, as it does in Pittsburgh and a Phoenix suburb.

{"date": "March 8, 2017", "text": "SEATTLE >> Federal prosecutors have dropped child pornography charges against a Washington teacher after the U.S. Justice Department refused to disclose information about a software weakness it exploited during an investigation last year. \n Charges against Vancouver, Washington, teacher Jay Michaud in U.S. District Court in Seattle were dismissed Monday. \n In 2015, Michaud was arrested and accused of downloading child pornography. During the child porn investigation, the FBI allowed a secret child porn website on the largely anonymous Tor network to run for two weeks while it tried to identify users by hacking into their computers. \n The child porn website, called Playpen, operated on Tor, which provides users anonymity by routing their communications through numerous computers around the globe, and it had more than 150,000 members. The Tor browser is based on Firefox. While the network is used for various reasons \u2014 including circumventing free-speech restrictions in some parts of the world \u2014 it has also provided sanctuary for child pornography, drug trafficking and other criminality. \n After arresting Playpen's operator in Florida in early 2015, the FBI let the website continue running for two weeks while trying to identify users, a move the agency said was necessary to apprehend those posting and downloading images of children being sexually abused. Defense attorneys criticized the tactic as unethical. \n A magistrate in Virginia issued a search warrant allowing the agency to deploy what it calls a \"network investigative technique\": code that prompted the computers that signed into Playpen to communicate back to the government certain information, including IP addresses, despite the anonymity normally afforded by Tor. \n The FBI then obtained further warrants to search suspects' homes. At least 137 people were charged. Defendants have challenged the FBI's hacking on numerous grounds. \n A federal judge in Washington state threw out the government's evidence against Michaud last year, saying that unless the FBI detailed the vulnerability it exploited, the man couldn't mount an effective defense. \n The DOJ said previously the information is not relevant. Defendants have been offered or provided all the evidence they need, including limited source code and data streams showing what the program did, the FBI has argued. \n Michaud's lawyer, Colin Fieman, said in an email to The Associated Press that they are relieved and grateful his case is done but that many unanswered questions remain about the FBI's investigation, known as Operation Pacifier. \n \"Mr. Michaud maintained his innocence from the outset, and the dismissal is a result of the FBI's overreaching and misuse of its computer hacking capabilities, including its operation of the world's largest child pornography web site and attacks on computers in over 120 countries,\" Fieman said. \"It remains to be seen whether the FBI will ever be held fully accountable for those aspects of its investigation that put core privacy rights at risk and violated common standards of decency when it comes to how law enforcement agencies do their job.\" \n A school district spokeswoman says Michaud hasn't returned to work, KGV-TV reported. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Child porn case dropped as U.S. refuses to show software code"}

Shelter personnel gave them pieces of paper to write down their children's names so they could try to locate them. \n The head of Guatemala's social welfare agency, Carlos Rodas, said youths at the shelter started rioting Tuesday in an effort to escape. Complaints about abuse and living conditions at the overcrowded shelter have been frequent. \n Then today, about 5 a.m. Hawaii time, \"Some of the adolescents lit their mattresses on fire,\" Rodas said. \"We don't shirk responsibility, we accept it, but we can't get those lives back.\" \n Julia Barrera, spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, said late in the day that at least 20 children and teenagers perished. Two hospitals said they received 41 injured girls between the ages of 13 and 17, many with second- and third-degree burns. Dr. Carlos Soto, director of Roosevelt Hospital, said some of the injured had life-threatening burns. \n A short time later, Sharon Avila, the spokeswoman for Roosevelt Hospital, said the 21st victim had died there. Late today, the Hospital San Juan de Dios reported another death, raising the toll to 22. \n Rodas said the shelter had an official capacity of 500, but was housing at least 800 youths. \n The federal government said in a statement that it had fired the shelter's director. It also said that before the fire the government had asked that youths with criminal records housed at the shelter be moved to other facilities, but that had not occurred. \n A 15-year-old girl being treated for minor injuries at Roosevelt Hospital said the uprising followed rumors of an escape attempt. Some boys, or even young men who were still housed at the center after turning 18, entered the girls' area, she said. She said she fled to her dormitory's roof with others fearing the boys would attack them. \n Early this morning the fire began. \"I saw the smoke in the place. It smelled like flesh,\" the girl said. \n Mario Cruz, spokesman for volunteer firefighters, said the fire appeared to have started in one of the girls' living areas and spread to another dormitory. \n The government-run shelter, known as the Virgin of the Assumption Safe Home, is in a rural area outside the capital. The campus is surrounded by trees and a 30-foot wall. It houses at-risk children who were victims of abuse as well as youths who completed sentences at youth detention centers and had nowhere else to go. \n President Jimmy Morales' office said there would be three days of mourning and issued a statement confirming at least 15 deaths and said the cause of the fire was under investigation. The president held a moment of silence to mark the tragedy during a previously scheduled event to commemorate International Women's Day. \n Attorney General Annabella Morfin said children in a protective situation should not be housed with children who have problems with the law and called for an investigation of those responsible. \n Jorge de Leon, Guatemala's human rights prosecutor, said in a statement that at least 102 children had been located after escaping from the shelter and more had managed to flee. De Leon said younger children fled the shelter because they were being abused by the elder children. \n \"According to what they say, the bigger kids have control and they attack them constantly,\" de Leon wrote. \"They also complain that food is scarce and of poor quality.\" \n He called on authorities \"to evaluate whether it is appropriate to have these different groups concentrated in one place.\" \n In 2013, a 14-year-old girl was murdered at the facility.

Dawlat Waziri, a Defense Ministry spokesman, said there were \"more than 30 killed and more than 50 wounded\" in the attack. Afghan forces battled the attackers floor by floor, he added. The ministry said the attackers were dressed like health workers. \n According to Waziri, four gunmen were involved, including two suicide bombers who detonated their explosives vests once the group was inside the hospital. \n The two other attackers were shot dead by security forces, the spokesman said. A member of the security forces was killed in the shootout and three other security officers were wounded.

{"date": "March 8, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer talks to the media during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington today. \n WASHINGTON >> When WikiLeaks published the hacked emails of Hillary Clinton's campaign manager last year, then-candidate Donald Trump had one thing to say: \"I love WikiLeaks.\" \n But there wasn't a lot of love from the Trump administration today, after WikiLeaks published thousands of documents described as secret files about CIA hacking tools. \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer answered questions on the latest WikiLeaks disclosure by saying that leaks of national security or classified information should have everybody \"outraged.\" \n \"This is the kind of disclosure that undermines our country, our security and our well-being,\" he said. \n The hacking tools described in the documents published Tuesday by WikiLeaks are used to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. The documents describe clandestine methods for bypassing or defeating encryption, antivirus tools and other protective security features intended to keep the private information of citizens and corporations safe from prying eyes. U.S. government employees, including Trump, use many of the same products and internet services purportedly compromised by the tools. \n Spicer wouldn't confirm the authenticity of the hacks, saying it is not the government's policy to do so. But he insisted there is a \"double standard\" in the way Congress and other Democrats are responding to this latest revelation. \n Regarding Clinton, Spicer said, \"There was complete outrage about the leaks that occurred; members calling for investigations to the leaks.\" \n After WikiLeaks released the hacked emails of Clinton campaign manager John Podesta last summer, Trump noted, \"It's amazing how nothing is secret today!\" \n WikiLeaks had also published thousands of emails hacked from the Democratic National Committee. Back then, Trump dismissed suggestions by Democrats, including his general election opponent, that the Russian government was behind the hacking, saying it was \"probably China, or it could be somebody sitting in his bed.\" \n Trump added, \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\" referring to personal emails Clinton held back during an investigation into her use of a personal server while she was secretary of state. \"I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens,\" he said. \n After the election, Trump acknowledged the intelligence community's assessment, saying Russia was probably behind the DNC hacking. \n But on Tuesday, Spicer staunchly pushed back on suggestions that the administration was changing its tune now that it has been targeted. \n Spicer said there is a \"big difference\" between disclosing Podesta's private emails \"and his undermining of Hillary Clinton and his thoughts on her on a personal nature, and the leaking of classified information. There is a massive, massive difference between those two things.\" \n He added, \"It's interesting that we're hearing not as much outrage now when it comes to some of our issues of national security.\" \n Trump echoed the distinction in his February news conference, adding, \"If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "No more love for WikiLeaks from Trump after CIA hacked"}

{"date": "March 8, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The U.S. Border Patrol's parent agency may exempt many veterans and law enforcement officers from a requirement that new hires take a lie-detector test. \n SAN DIEGO >> The Border Patrol's parent agency would exempt many veterans and law enforcement officers from a hiring requirement to take a lie-detector test under a proposal to satisfy President Donald Trump's order to add 5,000 agents, according to a memo released by the agents' union. \n The memo by Kevin McAleenan, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner, calls the polygraph a \"significant deterrent and point of failure\" for applicants and a recruiting disadvantage against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a separate agency that is responsible for deporting people settled in the U.S. ICE is under Trump's orders to hire 10,000 people, and it does not require lie detectors. \n The Associated Press reported in January that about two-thirds of job applicants fail CBP's polygraph, more than double the average rate of law enforcement agencies that provided data under open-records requests. Those failures are a major reason why the Border Patrol recently fell below 20,000 agents for the first time since 2009. Many applicants have complained about being subjected to unusually long and hostile interrogations. \n The undated memo lays out a plan for the agency to build a force of 26,370 agents in five years, which would deprive Trump of hitting his target during his current term. \n Any waiver of the lie-detector mandate may require congressional approval due to a 2010 law that introduced the requirement to root out corruption and misconduct after an earlier hiring surge doubled the size of the Border Patrol in eight years. McAleenan's memo is addressed to the Homeland Security Department deputy secretary for approval, suggesting that the Trump administration may not yet back the plan. \n CBP officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who oversees both CBP and ICE, told reporters Tuesday in Dallas that he still thinks the polygraph is \"a good idea,\" while acknowledging that it has hindered hiring. \n The National Border Patrol Council, which represents Border Patrol agents, received the memo Tuesday and has been working closely with the agency on hiring plans, said Shawn Moran, a union vice president. He called the changes to the polygraph \"a more commonsense approach\" and said current failure rates are \"ridiculous.\" \n \"Obviously we want to get the best candidates. We want to make sure that we have stringent background checks, but when it comes to the polygraph, that thing, I think, has been far too excessive in weeding out potentially good candidates,\" Moran said. \n A former official who played a key role introducing the polygraph said Wednesday that the hiring plan was \"a roadmap to further compromise the current and future integrity of CBP.\" \n James Tomsheck, who was the agency's internal affairs chief from 2006 to 2014, said McAleenan \"is attempting to degrade the vetting\" to accommodate a political mandate. \n \"Ultimately this data-deprived decision will greatly reduce security at our borders,\" Tomsheck wrote in an email. \n The memo said the Border Patrol gets 60,000 to 75,000 applications a year and has hired an average of 529 candidates during each of the last four years, which translates to a hiring rate of less than 1 percent. It has lost an average of 904 agents a year through attrition, lowering its workforce to 19,627 in January. \n The acting commissioner estimated that the Border Patrol would need to hire 2,729 agents a year to hit Trump's target in five years, accounting for attrition. \n The hiring plan at the nation's largest law enforcement agency would cost $328 million during the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 and $1.9 billion the following year. McAleenan said the changes would need to take effect within six months for maximum effect. \n The Border Patrol is clearly worried that ICE will poach agents to reach its own highly ambitious hiring requirements. Aside from not requiring a lie detector, McAleenan notes that ICE hires in major metropolitan areas, while Border Patrol jobs are often in remote regions far from medical care, schools and job opportunities for spouses. ICE employees are also often eligible for more overtime pay than Border Patrol agents. \n The proposed waivers would exempt state and local law enforcement officers in good standing who have successfully completed a polygraph with their employers. Federal law enforcement officers who have passed certain types of background checks would also be exempt, and the number of military members and veterans who can skip the test would be expanded. \n McAleenan said CBP is also considering a six-month experiment with an alternative polygraph test that takes less time to administer. \n The memo calls for the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas \u2014 the busiest corridor for illegal crossings \u2014 to get 800 to 1,000 more agents, the largest increase under two proposed scenarios. The Laredo, Texas, sector would get 700 more agents. \n Taking a polygraph became a hiring requirement at CBP after the hiring surge led to more agents getting arrested for misconduct. A Government Accountability Office report in 2013 said the lie detectors flagged applicants who wanted the job to smuggle drugs or engage in other crimes. \n A panel of law enforcement experts appointed during President Barack Obama's administration last year called CBP's polygraph \"an important integrity tool\" in hiring and recommended employees be periodically tested, as the FBI does.

The statue was installed by an investment firm in honor of International Women's Day. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A statue titled \"Fearless Girl\" faces the Wall Street bull today in New York. A big investment firm, State Street Global Advisors, put the statue there to highlight International Women's Day. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Shriya Gupta of Cherokee, N.C. strikes a pose with a statue titled \"Fearless Girl\" today in New York. The statue was installed by an investment firm in honor of International Women's Day. \n NEW YORK >> A new statue of a resolute young girl staring down Wall Street's famous Charging Bull was erected by a major asset managing firm for International Women's Day to make a point: There's a dearth of women on the boards of the largest U.S. corporations. \n State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based investment giant, had the statue created to push companies to increase the number of women directors. \n Artist Kristen Visbal's \"Fearless Girl\" drew crowds Wednesday that initially came to pose for pictures with the bull, but the novelty quickly became a New York hot spot. \n The girl is sculpted in bronze, her hands firmly planted on her waist, ponytailed head held high. \n \"Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference,\" reads a plaque at her feet. \n \"As a steward of nearly $2.5 trillion of assets, we want to engage with boards and management around issues that we think will drive core results,\" said Lori Heinel, State Street's deputy global chief investment officer. \"And what you find repeatedly is having more diverse boards and more diverse senior management will actually drive better results for companies.\" \n Twenty-five percent of the Russell 3000 \u2014 a broad index of U.S. companies \u2014 have no women on their boards, according to State Street, which manages many of their assets. \n According to ISS Analytics, a business research firm, just 16 percent of board seats on companies in the Russell 3000 are held by women; the average board of directors has eight men and one woman. \n \"It's going to happen to the end of time unless you change something,\" says Erik Gordon, a lawyer and professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. \"It's got to not just be the rules. It's got to be the culture.\" \n State Street has three women on an 11-member board. Heinel said her company also will urge those in Great Britain and Australia to add women to their leadership. \n One man working in corporate America needed no convincing. \n Chandrasekar Sundaram says a woman is the CEO of the company he works for in Texas, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and has quite a few women reporting to her. \n \"But when it gets to 50 percent, that's when I think it'll be right,\" said Sundaram, a Dallas resident and native of India who was visiting New York with his family \u2014 with the Charging Bull as one of their stops. \n The mammoth bronze was a \"guerrilla art\" act, dropped in the middle of the night in Bowling Green Park in 1989 without permission, by an artist who created it as a symbol of Americans' survival energy following the 1987 stock market crash. The city gave its permission for the bull to remain. \n This week, McCann New York, a top advertising agency, installed the statue of the girl before dawn Tuesday \u2014 with a city permit for one week. Negotiations are underway for the piece to remain longer. \n Why choose the Charging Bull as the site to place the girl? \n \"Well, we really wanted the bull to have a partner, and a partner that we thought was worthy of him,\" Heinel said. \"And so we got a very determined young woman who is fearless and is willing to drive the change that we believe we need.\" \n Sundaram's 8-year-old daughter, Sankaribriya, got the message. \n She wanted to pose with the sculpted girl \"because I just wanted to look at her and wanted to feel like her.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'Fearless Girl' statue stares down Wall Street's iconic bull"}

But he says Honolulu has the most burdensome regulations when it comes to building housing. \n Economists say a shortage of housing is driving up housing costs, contributing to Hawaii's high cost of living. \n The state should focus on policies that encourage housing development, but that might attract more people to move to Hawaii, they told state lawmakers Wednesday at a hearing at the state Capitol. \n Hawaii has the second-highest consumer debt in the nation and 77 percent of the debt is from mortgages, said Eugene Tiang, economic research administrator for the state Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism. Many homes in the state are being sold to investors on the mainland or abroad, he said. \n \"The situation is getting worse for neighbor islands \u2026 Maui is leading the trend,\" Tiang said. \n On Maui, 44 percent of single family homes and condominiums were sold to mainland residents between 2008 and 2016, and 49 percent were sold to local residents, he said. About 7 percent went to foreign investors. \n On Kauai and the Big Island about 40 percent of homes are sold to mainland residents, Tiang said. \n On Oahu, he said, 85 percent of homes were sold to Hawaii residents. \n Honolulu has the most burdensome regulations when it comes to building housing, and the state should do everything it can to build more affordable housing, said Carl Bonham, executive director of the Economic Research Organization at the University of Hawaii. \n \"Even if we do that, we may not bring down cost of living. \u2026 On the other hand if we don't do that the cost could get worse,\" Bonham said. \n In 2003, the top 1 percent of homes in the state sold for $1 million or more, and in 2013, 10 percent of homes were sold in that price range, said Paul Brewbaker, owner of TZ Economics. \n \"By the early 2020s, you should expect a third or more of houses to be trading at $1 million or more,\" Brewbaker said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Economists: Hawaii has the second-highest consumer debt in the nation"}

HECO beat the 2015 benchmark, which mandated 15 percent of its electricity from renewables. \n At the end of 2016, about 54 percent of electricity used by customers on the Big Island was coming from renewables, up from 49 percent in 2015. In Maui County, 37 percent of the electricity customers used came from renewables, up from 35 percent in 2015.
