He is as he presents himself.\" \n The state Department of Budget and Finance is reviewing the flow of federal funding into Hawaii to see what funds might be at risk from budget cuts or other actions by President Trump's administration, Gov. David Ige said Thursday. \n However, Ige said he learned during his recent visit to Washington, D.C. for a meeting of the National Governors Association that it may take the Trump administration some time to move forward with any meaningful reordering of federal spending. \n \"The devil is in the details, and the question becomes what specific changes would actually be able to be implemented in the agencies,\" Ige told reporters Thursday. \n \"I left the capitol with the feeling that change will be slow to come, that there are lots of pronouncements by different people about significant changes in policy, and I do think that the reality of governing, the reality of being able to get the Congress to pass law changes, the reality of repealing regulations, will slow any specific impact on Hawaii,\" he said. \n Wesley Machida, director of Budget and Finance, said federal funding makes up about 20 percent of the state's $13.7 billion operating budget this year. The department is reaching out to people with ties to the various federal programs \"to figure out how and where we might be impacted.\" \n \"A lot of the polices have not been issued yet, and a lot of the issues may have been discussed, but not enacted and implemented,\" Machida said. \n In all, the state expects to receive $2.7 billion in operating funds from the federal government this year, with much of that money flowing into the Medicaid program to pay for health benefits for the poor and disabled. \n The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, and welfare payments to families with dependent children also account for significant amounts of that federal funding, Machida said. \n The public school system will receive about $250 million of that federal funding this year, and $150 million will go to the Department of Health. \n The federal government will also provide an additional $376 million to the state this year for construction projects, with most of that money going to the state Department of Transportation. That sum amounts to about 15 percent of the state's total $2.5 billion construction budget, he said. \n That federal funding that is incorporated into the state budget does not include the hundreds of millions of dollars in federal defense funding that flows into Hawaii each year. \n Ige said the review of federal funding for Hawaii will include an assessment of how much funding for Hawaii is divided up among the states according to formulas set by law, and how much depends on the state attracting competitive grants. \n He added that \"we certainly are looking at and keeping track of those areas that would be most vulnerable. But my sense is that any changes would be incremental and not as dramatic as it might sound.\" \n This week Hawaii became the first state to go to court to challenge President Trump's new ban on travel to the U.S. for individuals from six Muslim-majority nations if they lack valid U.S. visas. \n The state is seeking a temporary restraining order to block the ban, and the new lawsuit marks the second time Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin has gone to court to oppose a travel ban by the Trump administration. \n When asked if the state's aggressive legal challenges to the new administration might affect federal funding for state programs, Ige replied that \"from our perspective, we just believe that discrimination on the basis of national origin or religion is just flat out wrong.\" \n \"We know that there might be other ramifications, but we trust that people will focus on what's in the best interest of the people, of the people of the state of Hawaii as well as the people of America in moving forward,\" Ige said. \n Ige met with President Trump, and said his impression is that \"what you see on TV is what you get.

Malaysia's prime minister said Wednesday that relatives of the half brother of North Korea's ruler may be too scared to help police investigating his mysterious poisoning death in Kuala Lumpur. \n KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia >> Two Malaysian employees of the U.N.'s World Food Program who were stranded in North Korea because of a travel ban have left the country, the U.N. said Thursday. Nine other Malaysians are believed to still be stuck there after the two countries' diplomatic relations broke down over the killing of the estranged sibling of North Korea's leader. \n The U.N. employees were among hundreds of ordinary citizens caught up in the escalating diplomatic battle. \n The two arrived in Beijing on Thursday, said Jane Howard, the WFP coordinator for global issues. \"The staff members are international civil servants and not representatives of their national government,\" she said. \n When North Korea issued its travel ban earlier this week, Malaysia responded in kind, barring North Koreans from leaving its soil. The nine Malaysians still believed to be there are three embassy workers and their family members. \n About 1,000 North Koreans are believed to be in Malaysia, until recently one of the few countries where North Koreans could travel without a visa. \n Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said the government was \"in the process of establishing the reasons and motives\" behind North Korea's drastic measure. He reiterated that diplomatic relations will not be severed to keep the communication line open for negotiations. \n Najib said he spoke on the phone to Mohamad Nur Azrin, the counselor at the Malaysian Embassy in North Korea, who told him that all Malaysians there are safe. \n \"I have given him my assurance that the government will do everything we can to ensure that they return home safely soon. The whole of Malaysia is praying for them,\" Najib said in a statement on Facebook. \"The government will continue to work on reaching the best solution on this issue.\" \n Malaysia has never directly blamed North Korea for the killing of Kim Jong Nam at the Kuala Lumpur airport Feb. 13. \n In an attack caught on security camera footage, two women approached Kim as he waited for a flight and wiped something on his face. Malaysian authorities say the substance was VX nerve agent and the two attackers were recruited by a team of North Koreans. North Korea has denied any responsibility and accused Malaysia of being swayed by the North's enemies. \n The women, a Vietnamese and an Indonesian, have been arrested and charged with murder. They say they were duped into thinking they were taking part in a harmless prank. \n On Thursday, dozens of Indonesian workers and activists protested the murder charge against the Indonesian suspect, Siti Aisyah, outside the Malaysian embassy in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta. \n Men and women from a trade union and several Islamic groups called on the Indonesian government and the international community to investigate the killing of Kim Jong Nam and work to free Aisyah. \n One of the speakers at the protest told the crowd it was impossible that a naive migrant worker such as Aisyah could be knowingly involved in the murder. Protesters waved green flags and held up banners such that read \"Save Siti Aisyah\" and \"Siti Aisyah is only a victim of political conspiracy interests.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "2 Malaysians leave North Korea after being stranded by travel ban"}

The idea has caught fire, with 12,000 people completing applications so far and thousands more registering interest ahead of the March 20 deadline. \n Wellington Mayor Justin Lester said the city's tech sector has been growing at an annual rate of 14 percent over the past five years. \n \"The problem we need to solve is that we have a whole lot of businesses that are struggling to keep up with recruitment,\" he said. \n The LookSee campaign was first promoted in tech hubs like San Francisco, which is more than 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) from Wellington. \n About one-third of the applicants are from the U.S. but that mix is changing as more people from other parts of the world find out about the offer, said David Jones, who is helping oversee the campaign at the Wellington Regional Economic Development Agency. \n \"This is the first time a city has approached recruitment in this way,\" Jones said. \"We've been absolutely amazed at the level of interest.\" \n Successful applicants get free flights to New Zealand and free accommodation during their four-day stay in Wellington.

They are expected to apply for three jobs each but aren't obliged to accept any offers. \n The 850,000 New Zealand dollar ($588,000) cost of the campaign is paid for from a combination of taxpayer money and contributions from local businesses. \n Nick Piesco, 40, moved to Wellington from Austin, Texas, two weeks ago to take a job as a developer at Xero, an online accounting software company.

John Conyers, D-Mich., ranking member, worked during a markup session on the Protecting Access to Care Act on Capitol Hill in Washington last month. \n WASHINGTON >> The House has approved a bill that would make it harder for individuals or groups to bring legal claims against companies in consumer disputes, employment discrimination cases and other areas. \n Lawmakers approved the Republican-sponsored measure, 220-201, Thursday night. The bill heads to the Senate, where its prospects are less clear. \n The legislation is the latest in a flurry of business-friendly moves by Congress and the Trump administration. Changes mandated in the bill could help reduce legal costs for businesses by putting up more hurdles to bringing class-action lawsuits in federal court. \n Supporters say the bill is needed to curb abuses in class-action suits that often result in a huge payday for lawyers. \n \"The class-action litigation system has morphed into an expensive enterprise where lawyers are often the only winners, and American businesses and consumers are the losers,\" said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and the bill's primary author. \"Trial lawyers often profit at the expense of deserving victims.\" \n The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, representing business interests, also supported the legislation. \n Consumer groups and civil rights advocates said the bill penalizes those who have been mistreated by corporations. \n \"This devastating Republican attack on our federal and state civil courts will severely restrict the hallowed right of the American people to have their day in court when they are wrongfully injured or defrauded,\" said veteran consumer advocate Ralph Nader. \n The bill would ensure that \"judges' and juries' hands are tied by absentee politicians in Washington, greased by corporate campaign contributions,\" Nader said. \n Nader and other critics point to a history of cases in which class-action suits enabled consumers to recoup losses and compelled companies to stop selling unsafe products. A recent example: a suit by Volkswagen owners in the U.S. who won about $11 billion in compensation from the German company in its emissions cheating scandal. \n The bill would require individuals seeking to form a legal class to show that each of them suffered the same type and magnitude of personal injury or economic loss as the group's leader. Attorneys in winning class-action suits couldn't collect payment from companies until after the individuals in the class are paid. \n Republican lawmakers have long cherished the idea of overhauling the legal system. They've looked to rein in trial lawyers \u2014 key campaign donors as a group to Democrats \u2014 whom they portray as greedy and abusing a system tilted toward them. Corporations and businesses, which tend to donate more heavily to Republican candidates, are championed by the GOP lawmakers as bearing excessive legal burdens and costs that raise prices for consumers. \n \"Today, Republicans are championing big corporations with legislation aimed at eroding class actions, an indispensable tool for citizens to hold powerful interests and big corporations accountable for their misdeeds,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "House passes bill to restrict legal claims against companies"}

{"date": "March 9, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Officer Jonathan Schmidt was shot dead during a 2011 traffic stop and video of his final moments continues to make the rounds on the internet six years later. The Arkansas Legislature is considering a bill that would prohibit the general release of videotape depicting the death of a law enforcement officer in the line of duty. The state Senate could vote on the measure as early as today. \n LITTLE ROCK, Ark. >> Nearly six years after Arkansas police Officer Jonathan Schmidt was shot to death while pleading for his life, a dashcam video of his final moments still circulates on the internet \u2014 sometimes landing in the social media feeds of his family members. \n \"It's a very sacred thing,\" the officer's widow, Andrea Schmidt, said Wednesday. \"It's not just a cop getting killed. This is a human being. This is my husband. This is a father.\" \n Now a newly elected Arkansas legislator, a former deputy prosecutor who used the tape to help put Schmidt's killer on death row, wants to prevent other families from suffering. The first bill he introduced since joining the House would prevent the broad release of material showing officers dying in the line of duty. \n \"It's just a video of a murder. There's no general interest in that,\" said Rep. Jimmy Gazaway, a Republican from Paragould, whose measure needs only a final successful vote in the state Senate. He said continued interest in a tape of the shooting is \"something that just violates our sensibilities.\" \n Gazaway was a prosecutor when the Trumann Police Department distributed the 20-minute recording. The video typically shows up in the family's social media feeds around April 12, the day of the shooting. \n \"It's so horrifying to see it happen,\" the officer's father, Donald Schmidt, said. \"I wish to God I had never watched it.\" \n Under the bill, which passed the House on a 94-0 vote Monday, video showing a law enforcement officer's death would be released only if a court decides the public interest outweighs the desire for government secrecy. \n \"Every year, this recirculates. It's just a constant slap in the face,\" Trumann Police Chief Chad Henson said last month before Gazaway's bill came up before the House Judiciary Committee. \n Algorithms are likely at fault: In Schmitt's case, if his name or the name of the Trumann Police Department pops up in a news story, someone might \"like\" it as a form of a tribute. As the story grows more popular online, various apps will seek other, similar items and try to link them. Eventually, that can lead to the police dashcam video Henson and prosecutors released at a news conference in 2012. \n Prosecutor Scott Ellington said police and the lawyers who pressed the capital case against Jerry Lard didn't believe there was any way to keep the video out of the public's hands, especially after it was shown in open court. Faced with numerous records requests, they decided to distribute the tape at a news conference and urged the media to exercise restraint in broadcasting it. \n \"We didn't necessarily want to give it up, but we felt we had to give it up,\" Ellington said. \n The bill is one of many being considered this session that would restrict Arkansas' Freedom of Information Act. Open records advocates oppose Gazaway's bill but understand it is an emotional issue and likely to pass. \n Under Gazaway's bill, if there's a public interest a judge can let it be shown in a public setting, though not for broad release. \n Henson said the video remains a government document and that the public has a right to see it, but perhaps not to spread it widely. \n \"I've never been told, 'Thank you for releasing that video,'\" Henson said. \n Henson said the tape is more appropriately used for law enforcement training. He said the traffic stop that led to Schmidt's death became \"too busy\" for the officer \u2014 and that there were things Schmidt should have done differently after realizing a felon was in the back seat. \n The dead officer's relatives say prosecutors and police notify them when the case comes up in the news so they can prepare to keep the video away from his three children and other young family members. \n \"This hurts our family so deeply,\" Donald Schmidt said. \"You don't want the children to see it. You don't want it made public.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "If officers die on duty, who should have access to video?"}

The meeting of the stadium authority board comes the same week the team presented to the NFL the new proposal with financing backed by Bank of America. \n LAS VEGAS (AP) >> The lease agreement for a proposed Las Vegas NFL stadium will not be ready before league owners meet later this month, when they could potentially vote on whether to approve the relocation of the Oakland Raiders. \n Members of the board that oversees the proposed stadium gathered Thursday in Las Vegas to discuss some of the terms they would like to see in the agreement. They made one thing clear: A final lease agreement for the proposed $1.9 billion, 65,000-seat domed stadium won't be reached within weeks. \n \"There's been a little bit of discussion about the timing necessity of the lease, and certainly, we are going to work expeditiously in order to get that lease done,\" Las Vegas Stadium Authority Board chairman Steve Hill said. \"But I also want to say that we are not going to rush that process.\" \n Three-quarters of the league's owners must approve the Raiders' relocation, and they could decide without a lease agreement being finalized. A vote could come at the owners meetings in Phoenix at the end of March. \n The team has told the board at a previous meeting that the owners wanted to see progress on the agreement and financing before the vote. \n \"My sense is that the approval will probably come, if it comes, with some conditions around what's important to the NFL around what the content of that lease would be,\" Hill said after the meeting. \n It came the same week the team presented to the NFL a new financing proposal backed by Bank of America. The Raiders sought a new partner after casino magnate Sheldon Adelson withdrew a $650 million pledge last month. \n Hotel room tax revenue from the city is slated to pay $750 million toward construction, while the Raiders and NFL would pay the remaining $500 million. \n The team has presented the stadium authority board with a lease proposal that covers the Raiders' use of the stadium, luxury box seats, concession sales, ticket revenue, merchandise and parking. It suggested $1 a year in rent. \n The team has been looking for a new stadium for years as it seeks to move out of the outdated Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, which is the only stadium used by both an NFL and Major League Baseball team and is unable to generate the revenue for the Raiders the way more modern stadiums around the league can. \n The Las Vegas board heard Thursday from the Houston-based attorney it hired for negotiations. Among the issues discussed were provisions that could be included in the deal that would guarantee the stadium features branding from the University of Nevada Las Vegas' football team, which would play home games there. \n \"That's obviously a big concern to UNLV,\" board member Mike Newcomb said. \"They want the fans coming in to see the UNLV Rebels in the end zone.\" \n Under the proposed lease agreement, the Raiders would have to approve any field markings. \n \"The team shall use reasonable efforts to support collegiate field markings, but the team shall have no obligation to compromise its field markings or field conditions for collegiate games at any time,\" documents say. \n The mayor of Oakland, the team's current city, made a presentation Monday to league committees in hopes of persuading owners to prevent the Raiders from moving. \n The Raiders paid $3.5 million in rent to play at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum in 2016, up from $925,000 for the 2015 season. The team has options to remain at the stadium for the 2017 and 2018 seasons. \n A site has not been picked for proposed Sin City stadium, although a parcel of land near the Las Vegas Strip has emerged as a preferred location. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Las Vegas NFL stadium lease won't be ready by end of March"}

{"date": "March 9, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A member of the Border Patrol's Border Tunnel Entry Team walks in a tunnel spanning the border between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, in San Diego. They are known in the Border Patrol as \"tunnel rats\" - agents who go in clandestine passages that have proliferated on the U.S.-Mexico border over the last 20 years to smuggle drugs. \n SAN DIEGO >> They are known in the U.S. Border Patrol as \"tunnel rats\" \u2014 agents who go in clandestine passages that have proliferated on the U.S.-Mexico border over the past 20 years to smuggle drugs. \n The Associated Press joined the Border Tunnel Entry Team, as it is formally known, inside an incomplete tunnel that was discovered in San Diego in 2009 \u2014 70 feet deep, 3 feet wide, 2,700 feet long and equipped with a rail system, lighting and ventilation. \n Here are some questions and answers about the team's work: \n HOW MANY TUNNELS ARE THERE?  \n Authorities discovered 224 border tunnels originating in Mexico from 1990 to March 2016, including 185 that entered the United States, according to the latest U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration annual survey. Many are shallow holes, but some are elaborately constructed with hydraulic lifts, water pumps and rail cars. \n The vast majority are in Arizona, where smugglers connect to underground drainage canals in Nogales, and in California, where construction noise generates less attention amid warehouses of an industrial area of San Diego, across from densely packed homes and businesses in Tijuana. \n WHAT ARE THEY FOR?  \n Tunnels are generally used for multi-ton loads of marijuana because the drug's bulk and odor are difficult to conceal for motorists and pedestrians who enter the United States at official border crossings, the preferred method for smuggling methamphetamine and heroin. \n In 2015, authorities seized cocaine in connection with two California tunnels, including one that ran underwater from a house in Mexicali, Mexico, to the All-American Canal near the city of Calexico. \n The tunnels, which the DEA generally attributes to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, cost between $1 million and $2 million to build and take months to complete, said Chris Davis, supervisory special agent with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations. That investment quickly pays off with profits from smuggling if crews escape detection, he said. \n HOW ARE TUNNELS FOUND?  \n Leads from informants, neighbors and others have been the most trusted technique, but technology plays a part. Lance LeNoir, who leads the Border Patrol's \"tunnel rats\" team in San Diego, says seismic devices, acoustics and ground-penetrating radar complement human intelligence. \n Investigators keep tabs on who owns and rents warehouses in San Diego's Otay Mesa area for suspicious transactions. They also visit businesses to ask them to report telltale signs: construction equipment and piles of dirt, jackhammer sounds, people coming and going at odd hours. \n \"They'll tunnel anywhere they want to. It's wherever they can get a building on the south side and a building on the north side,\" LeNoir said. \"Location, location, location.\" \n Sometimes agents stumble across \"gopher holes\" while on patrol. \n Once the passages are found, the \"tunnel rats\" go inside, a dangerous assignment because there's always a chance the walls can collapse. They map and measure the passages and work on filling them with concrete to prevent them from being used again. \n WHAT HAPPENS AFTER TUNNELS ARE DISCOVERED?  \n On the U.S. side, the tunnels have been filled since 2007 to prevent smugglers from burrowing into them. In Mexico, they are sealed but not plugged with concrete. \n Mexican authorities say they don't have the money to fill them, a vulnerability that is gaining more public scrutiny. LeNoir says smugglers have tapped into existing tunnels at least seven times in recent years. \n \"It gets down to funding and political will,\" he said. \n The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says it spent $8.7 million to fill tunnels from 2007 to 2015. Last week, it awarded a $153,000 contract to inject concrete into the U.S. part of a completed tunnel lined with cobblestone. The tunnel was discovered in October. It ended in a San Diego warehouse 1,200 feet north of the border. \n WHAT DOES PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WANT TO DO?  \n Trump has made construction of a \"great wall\" on the 2,000-mile U.S. divide with Mexico a signature issue of his presidency, prompting critics to say that people will go over, under and around it. \n Trump, as the Republican nominee, promised during an August speech in Phoenix that he would \"find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels.\" His executive order on border security doesn't specifically address tunnels but notes that criminal organizations run sophisticated drug and human smuggling networks on both sides of the border. \n After going inside a San Diego tunnel underneath a highly fortified border fence last month, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said drug profits were so enormous that smugglers would keep trying to burrow through. \n \"I would argue that the fact that they're spending huge amounts of money to tunnel underneath the wall tells you that they can't get through it,\" Kelly said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Border Patrol 'tunnel rats' plug underground passages"}

It houses troubled and abused boys and girls as well as juvenile offenders. \n Nineteen victims were found dead at the scene, and 16 more succumbed one by one to their grisly injuries at hospitals in Guatemala City. Several more girls were fighting for their lives, some with severe burns over more than half their bodies. \n The 35th death was announced by the General Hospital late Thursday while President Jimmy Morales called for a restructuring of the country's youth shelter system, which houses some 1,500 children around the country, during a news conference. Outside the presidential palace, dozens of protesters gathered to demand answers. \n The fire started when someone ignited mattresses in a dormitory that held girls who had been caught the day before during a mass breakout attempt, authorities said. \n On Thursday, distraught parents haunted hospitals and the morgue, passing scraps of paper scrawled with the names of loved ones they hoped to find. \n Geovany Castillo said his 15-year-old daughter Kimberly suffered burns on her face, arms and hands but survived. She was in a locked area where girls who took part in the escape attempt had been placed, he said. \n \"My daughter said the area was locked and that several girls broke down a door, and she survived because she put a wet sheet over herself,\" Castillo said. \n \"She said the girls themselves set the fire,\" he said, adding: \"She said the girls told her that they had been raped and in protest they escaped, and that later, to protest, to get attention, they set fire to the mattresses.\" \n Another surviving 15-year-old girl said that male residents had apparently been able to enter at least some of the girls' dormitories before the fire. She and others took refuge on a roof for fear of being attacked and saw the fire break out in a nearby building. \n \"I saw the smoke in the place,\" she said. \"It smelled like flesh.\" \n The state-run Virgin of the Assumption Safe House has long been the subject of complaints about abuse, inadequate food and crowded and unsanitary conditions behind its 30-foot wall. The shelter was built to hold 500 young residents but housed at least 800 at the time of the fire. \n Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales issued a statement blaming the disaster on the courts for ignoring a request by his administration to transfer juvenile offenders out. \n \"Before the fire, the government had asked the appropriate authorities to immediately transfer youthful offenders to other detention centers, to avoid greater consequences,\" the president's office wrote. \n \"The government regrets the fact that those authorities did not heed that request in an opportune way, something which could have prevented the tragedy.\" \n Jorge de Leon, Guatemala's human rights prosecutor, said in a statement that during the mass breakout the evening before the fire, at least 102 children who escaped had been located, but others managed to flee. He said younger children fled the shelter because they were being abused by older residents. \n \"According to what they say, the bigger kids have control and they attack them constantly,\" de Leon said. \"They also complain that food is scarce and of poor quality.\" \n In 2013, a 14-year-old girl was strangled by another resident, investigators said. \n Authorities said DNA tests might be necessary to identity some remains. A doctor at one hospital asked parents waiting outside for information to come back with photographs, dental records and details about tattoos or other distinctive features. \n Piedad Estrada, a street vendor, arrived with a photograph of her 16-year-old daughter. She said the teen was pregnant and had been at the shelter for nine days because she ran away from home. \n Estrada searched at the hospitals and the morgue but got no information. She showed the photo to workers at one hospital, but they said they had five girls who were completely bandaged so they could not be sure. \n \"They only took her from me to burn her,\" Estrada said. \"I blame the state for what has happened.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Death toll rises to 35 in fire at youth shelter in Guatemala"}

But he expressed an openness to studying whether so-called \"viri probati\" \u2014 or married men of proven faith \u2014 could be ordained. \n \"We must consider if viri probati is a possibility. Then we must determine what tasks they can perform, for example, in remote communities,\" he was quoted as saying. \n The \"viri probati\" proposal has been around for decades, but it has drawn fresh attention under history's first Latin American pope thanks in part to his appreciation of the challenges facing the church in places like Brazil, a huge Catholic country with an acute shortage of priests. \n Brazilian Cardinal Claudio Hummes, a longtime friend of Francis and former head of the Vatican's office for clergy, is reportedly pressing to allow viri probati in the Amazon, where the church counts around one priest for every 10,000 Catholics. \n Francis has shown particular openness to receiving concrete proposals for ordaining married men as well as his own pastoral concern for men who have left ministry to marry. \n He has maintained friendship with the Argentine widow of a friend who left the priesthood to marry, and he spent one of his Friday mercy missions last year visiting with men who had left ministry to start families. He has also said that while he favors a celibate priesthood, celibacy technically can be up for discussion since it's a discipline of the church, not a dogma. \n The church allows some exceptions to the rule. Priests in the eastern rite Catholic Church are allowed to be married, as are married Anglican priests who convert to Catholicism. \n In the first major interview that Francis has given a German newspaper, the pope was asked whether he experienced moments in which he doubted the existence of God. He responded: \"I, too, know moments of emptiness.\" \n But, he pointed out that periods of crisis are an opportunity to grow, saying a believer who doesn't experience that remains \"infantile.\" \n Francis also repeated his warning of the dangers of rising populism in western democracies, saying \"populism is evil and ends badly as the past century showed.\" \n In the interview, Francis also confirmed Colombia was on his travel itinerary for 2017, as well as India and Bangladesh.

Sensing history, hundreds of people gathered ahead of a court ruling on whether impeached South Korean President Park will be removed from office over a corruption scandal or allowed to complete her term. The letters read \"Impeachment, Park Geun-hye.\" \n SEOUL, South Korea >> In a historic ruling Friday, South Korea's Constitutional Court formally removed impeached President Park Geun-hye from office over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into political turmoil, worsened an already-serious national divide and led to calls for sweeping reforms. \n It was a stunning fall for Park, the daughter of a dictator who rode a lingering conservative nostalgia for her father to a big win in 2012, only to see her presidency descend into scandal. The unanimous ruling opens her up to possible criminal proceedings, and makes her South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be removed early from office since democracy came in the country in the late 1980s. \n South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park's successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys. Whoever becomes the next leader will take over a country facing a hostile North Korea, a stagnant economy and deep social and political divides. \n Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans had wanted the court to approve Park's impeachment. But there have been worries that Park's ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents. \n Park's parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they've recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since. \n People on both sides have threatened not to accept a Constitutional Court decision that they disagree with. One of Park's lawyers told the court last month that there will be \"a rebellion and blood will drench the asphalt\" if Park is booted from office. Many participants at anti-Park rallies had said they would stage a \"revolution\" if the court rejected Park's impeachment. \n \"If Park accepts the ruling and soothes those who opposed her impeachment, things will be quiet,\" said Yoon Tae-Ryong, a political scientist at Seoul's Konkuk University. \"But looking at what she's done so far, I think that might be wishful thinking.\" \n Others disagreed, saying violent protests won't be supported by the general public. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "South Korean court decision formally ends president's rule"}

But that didn't help, either. CEO Dene Rogers said Thursday that mobile phone sales were \"surprisingly poor,\" especially in recent months. \n RadioShack said it is in the process of closing 200 stores and will evaluate its options for the remaining 1,300. Of those remaining locations, Sprint Corp. said it will turn \"several hundred\" of them into Sprint-only stores, but declined to give a specific number. \n RadioShack, based in Fort Worth, Texas, has nearly 5,900 employees, according to bankruptcy paperwork filed on Wednesday.

Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee's top Democrat, and other lawmakers on the panel requested corporate and government information about the program in separate letters to the contractor running WebOps, Alabama-based Colsa Corp., and to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. \n WebOps relies on dozens of Arabic-speaking analysts who scour Twitter and other social media platforms for people whose postings suggest they are vulnerable to the Islamic State's sophisticated propaganda. Using fictitious identities, the civilian analysts then reach out to these potential recruits and urge them not to join the extremists. But as AP reported, many of the analysts are not fluent and don't have the cultural background the work requires. \n As one former worker told the AP, translators repeatedly mix up the Arabic words for \"salad\" and \"authority.\" \n \"The news account details several examples where employees mistook words and ISIS recruiters laughed and insulted them,\" the lawmakers wrote in the Feb. 15 letter to Frank Collazo, Colsa's chairman and CEO. \"In one particular instance, WebOps employees repeatedly referred to the Palestinian Authority as the 'Palestinian salad.'\" \n Colsa said it was cooperating with the committee. \n \"Colsa welcomes the chance to share the success of the WebOps program with members of the committee as well as the opportunity to set the record straight,\" the company said in a statement provided by Greg Vistica of Washington Media Group, a reputation management firm. \"Colsa is contractually prohibited from releasing any information related to the program without the government's approval.\" \n The congressional probe adds further scrutiny of the program, which is also under investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. \n The committee also is looking into allegations that the problems were raised with officers at U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, who ignored the concerns. Current and former workers told the AP that they had witnessed WebOps data being manipulated to create the appearance of success and that many other employees were aware of that. Others working on the program say that officers and contractors dodged independent oversight. \n The letter to Mattis cites \"leadership shortcomings\" and a \"general resistance to oversight and reform\" disclosed by AP's reporting. \n Central Command had declined AP's repeated requests for information about WebOps \u2014 including the cost of the contract \u2014 and other counter-propaganda programs, which were launched under the Obama administration. \n The lawmakers also are demanding information about the award of the new $500 million contract to a team of contractors led by defense giant Northrop Grumman in September, along with allegations that a senior U.S. military officer, Col. Victor Garcia, steered the work to the Northrop team because it included a friend's company, the London-based advertising firm M&C Saatchi. \n The AP obtained a screengrab from a Facebook page that shows Garcia and the friend, Simon Bergman, at a tiki bar in Key Largo, Florida, two weeks before the winning team was officially announced. The photo was also turned over to NCIS investigators by a whistleblower, who contended the photo created a \"clear impression and perception of impropriety.\" \n Garcia, a West Point graduate and decorated officer, has denied any impropriety and described allegations of misconduct as \"character assassination.\" Bergman also denied any wrongdoing. \n Northrop Grumman has referred questions from AP about the new contract to U.S. General Services Administration, which said the award of the contract was handled properly. \n The lawmakers ask that the Defense Department and the contractor deliver relevant documents so that the committee \"can better understand the Department's efforts to combat radical Islamic terrorism and resolve the apparent discrepancies about the WebOps unit.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Congress probes Islamic State counter-propaganda operations"}

{"date": "March 9, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Carter Page, then adviser to U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, speaks at the graduation ceremony for the New Economic School in Moscow, Russia. Page, once a little-known investment banker-turned-adviser in the outer circle of the improbable Trump campaign, is emerging as a central figure in the controversy surrounding campaign connections to Russia. \n WASHINGTON >> At Moscow's New Economic School, the annual graduation ceremony often features a prominent political figure. President Barack Obama addressed graduates at the prestigious institution in 2009. The former presidents of Mexico and the Czech Republic have spoken at recent ceremonies. \n Last year, the university invited Carter Page, a little-known former investment banker and foreign policy adviser to then-U.S. presidential hopeful Donald Trump. It wouldn't be the last time Page would draw unexpected \u2014 and some say outsized \u2014 attention for his relationship to Trump, his entanglements in Russia and the murky nexus between the two. \n Page, who left the campaign before the election, has emerged as a key figure in the controversy surrounding Trump associates' connections to Russia. The New York Times has reported that Page is among the Trump associates whose potential contacts with Russia are being investigated by the FBI. Congressional committees probing Russia's hacking during the election and Trump campaign ties have asked Page to preserve materials related to their investigations. \n For those who contend the scrutiny of Trump is overblown, Page is the sort of figure often associated with an understaffed presidential campaign that struggled to recruit policy advisers and spent little time vetting those who did join the team. But to those who believe Trump's campaign was colluding with Russia as it hacked Democratic groups, Page may be the key link between the candidate and Moscow. Page contends he's the target of a plot hatched by Trump's former rival Hillary Clinton and allies who engaged in \"severe election fraud in the form of disinformation, suppression of dissent, hate crimes and other extensive abuses.\" \n Page's appearance at the Russian university immediately raised eyebrows. \n For an adviser to an American presidential hopeful speaking overseas, his message was strikingly critical of the U.S. It came as Trump's calls for warmer relations with the Kremlin were a source of criticism from Democrats and alarm from some fellow Republicans. \n Washington had a \"hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change\" in its dealings with Russia, Page said at the school. \n Page and former Trump campaign officials say he made the trip in a personal capacity and not as a representative of the campaign. But university officials have been clear that Page's connections and insight into the Trump campaign were the draw. \n \"We were interested in what was going on \u2014 already then, Trump's candidacy raised eyebrows, and everyone was really curious,\" said Shlomo Weber, the academic director at the New Economic School, in an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda radio station. \n A newsletter announcing Page's visit read. \"You are invited to a lecture by Carter Page, foreign policy adviser for Donald Trump's election campaign.\" \n Page has said he asked for, and received, permission from the Trump campaign to appear in a personal capacity. \n Page has offered contradictory answers about his contacts with Russian officials during his visit. On Thursday, he told The Associated Press he did not meet with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich, who also spoke at the graduation. But in September, he told The Washington Post that he did speak with Dvorkovich briefly. \n Back in the U.S. a few days later, Page talked with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. at an event on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting. Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke with the Russian envoy at the same event, a conversation he failed to reveal when asked about contacts with Russians during his Senate confirmation hearings. \n Page, a former Merrill Lynch investment banker who worked out of its Moscow office for three years, now runs Global Energy Capital, a firm focused on energy sectors in emerging markets. According to the company's website, he has advised on transactions for Gazprom and RAO UES, a pair of Russian entities. \n In December, Page returned to Moscow, where he noted he had \"the opportunity to meet with an executive from Rosneft,\" the Russian oil giant, according to a video clip of his remarks posted on YouTube. Rosnet's chairman, Igor Sechin, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been targeted by U.S. sanctions, though Page says he was not referring to Sechin in his remarks. \n Some of the suspicion surrounding Page stems from the fact that no one who worked for the campaign can quite explain how he ended up on Trump's list of foreign policy advisers. Page has also sidestepped those questions, saying he doesn't want to put others \"in the same damaged pot as myself.\" \n One campaign official said Page was recruited by Sam Clovis, an Iowa Republican operative who ran the Trump campaign's policy shop and is now a senior adviser at the Agriculture Department. Clovis did not respond to messages from The Associated Press. \n Trump has distanced himself from Page, saying he never met him. Those who served on the campaign's foreign policy advisory committee also said they had limited contact with Page. \n \"Only met him once very briefly,\" said George Papadopoulos, the director of the Center for International Energy and Natural Resources Law and Security in London. \n But in a letter late Wednesday to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Page cast himself as a regular presence in Trump Tower, where the campaign was headquartered. \n \"I have frequently dined in Trump Grill, had lunch in Trump Caf\u00e9, had coffee meetings in the Starbucks at Trump Tower, attended events and spent many hours in campaign headquarters on the fifth floor last year,\" Page wrote. He also noted that his office building in New York \"is literally connected to the Trump Tower building by an atrium.\" \n Page stopped advising the campaign sometime around the end of summer, though the exact circumstances of the separation are unclear. After the campaign, Trump's lawyers sent Page at least two cease and desist letters, according to another campaign official, who like others, insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ex-Trump adviser Carter Page at center of Russia storm"}

All seven climate scientists who responded said Pruitt was wrong and that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of global warming. \n NASA and NOAA reported in January that earth's 2016 temperatures were the warmest ever. The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, \"a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere,\" the agencies said in a joint statement. \n The EPA says on its website that \"carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas that is contributing to recent climate change.\" Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, \"release large amounts of CO2, causing concentrations in the atmosphere to rise,\" the website says. \n Environmental groups and Democrats seized on Pruitt's comments as evidence he is unfit for the office he holds. \n \"The arsonist is now in charge of the fire department, and he seems happy to let the climate crisis burn out of control,\" said Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune. \n Pruitt \"is spewing corporate polluter talking points rather than fulfilling the EPA's mission of protecting our air, our water and our communities,\" Brune said, noting that EPA has a legal responsibility to address carbon pollution. \n Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said the comments underscore that Pruitt is a \"climate denier\" and insisted lawmakers will stand up to him. \n \"Anyone who denies over a century's worth of established science and basic facts is unqualified to be the administrator of the EPA,\" Schatz said in a statement. \n The EPA issued a statement this afternoon reiterating that Pruitt believes the climate is warming, in part due to human activity. \"Many questions remain however that should be debated: how much is the climate changing, to what extent is human activity involved and what to do about it?\" the agency said \n Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes, whose book \"Merchants of Doubt\" reports purposeful rejection of mainstream science, said, \"Mr. Pruitt is not confused. Rather he is part of a campaign designed to confuse us.\" \n Pruitt previously served as Oklahoma attorney general, where he rose to prominence as a leader in coordinated efforts by Republican attorneys general to challenge former President Barack Obama's regulatory agenda. He sued or took part in legal actions against the EPA 14 times. \n Pruitt said during his confirmation hearing in January that climate change is real \u2014 breaking with President Donald Trump and his own past statements. \n Pruitt told Democratic senators that he disagreed with Trump's earlier claims that global warming is a hoax created by the Chinese to harm the economic competitiveness of the United States. \n \"I do not believe climate change is a hoax,\" Pruitt said. \n The Republican has previously cast doubt on the extensive body of scientific evidence showing that the planet is warming and man-made carbon emissions are to blame. In a 2016 opinion article, Pruitt suggested that the debate over global warming \"is far from settled\" and he said \"scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.\" \n AP Science Writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "EPA chief: Carbon dioxide not primary cause of warming"}

Doctors say they have tied infection with the Zika virus to possible new heart problems in adults. \n For the first time, doctors have tied infection with the Zika virus to possible new heart problems in adults. \n The evidence so far is only in eight people in Venezuela, and is not enough to prove a link. It's also too soon to know how often this might be happening. The biggest trouble the mosquito-borne virus has been causing is for pregnant women and their fetuses. \n \"I think as awareness increases, the cases will start to show up more,\" said Dr. Karina Gonzalez Carta, a Mayo Clinic research fellow working in Venezuela who investigated the heart cases. \n She discussed them on an American College of Cardiology press call, ahead of a presentation Saturday at the group's meeting in Washington. \n Many people infected with Zika will have no or only mild symptoms, such as fever, aches, an itchy rash or red eyes. But the virus has caused an epidemic of birth defects in the Caribbean and South America, notably babies with abnormally small heads and brains. \n A report last June in the International Journal of Cardiology describes heart problems that have been seen from other viruses spread by mosquitoes, such as West Nile and ones that cause yellow fever, dengue fever and chikungunya. \n Doctors have been watching for the same from Zika, and \"we were surprised at the severity of the findings\" in the Venezuela cases, Carta said. \n She studied nine patients, ages 30 to 64, treated at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Caracas who developed heart symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath and fatigue an average of 10 days after typical Zika symptoms began. \n Only one had any prior heart-related problem \u2014 high blood pressure that was under control with medications \u2014 and all had lab tests confirming Zika infection. They were given extensive heart tests and were studied for an average of six months, starting last July. \n Eight of the nine developed a dangerous heart rhythm problem, and six of the nine developed heart failure, which occurs when a weakened heart can't pump enough blood. \n Doctors don't know if these problems will be permanent. So far, they haven't gone away although medicines have improved how patients feel. \n \"This is the first time we've considered that cardiovascular disease may be associated with Zika,\" and people who travel to or live in places where Zika is spreading need to watch for possible symptoms, said Dr. Martha Gulati, cardiology chief at the University of Arizona-Phoenix who is familiar with the results. \n Zika infections have been reported in more than 5,000 people in the United States, mostly travelers. After a big outbreak in Brazil in 2015, Zika spread throughout Latin America, the Caribbean and elsewhere. The virus also spread locally in parts of southern Florida and Texas last year. \n The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned pregnant women to avoid travel to Zika zones and to use bug spray and other measures to prevent bites. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Doctors tie Zika virus to heart problems in some adults"}

Joseph Votel, who heads U.S. Central Command, said he sees no need for additional investigations into the January mission that triggered debate in Washington over what went wrong and whether important intelligence was actually gathered. It was the first military raid authorized by President Donald Trump. \n Votel told the Senate Armed Services Committee that a separate investigation into potential civilian casualties found that between four and 12 innocent people were killed. \n During the raid on al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula militants, U.S. special operations forces came under heavy fire. Chief Special Warfare Officer William \"Ryan\" Owens was killed, six other American service members were injured and a helicopter was damaged. \n Among the civilians killed was the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric and U.S. citizen who was targeted and killed by a drone strike in 2011. \n Votel, who presided over an internal review, said he was \"looking for information gaps where we can't explain what happened in a particular situation or we have conflicting information between members of the organization. I am looking for indicators of incompetence or poor decision making or bad judgment throughout all this.\" \n In the end, he said, \"I was satisfied that none of those indicators that I identified to you were present. I think we had a good understanding of exactly what happened on this objective and we've been able to pull lessons learned out of that, that we will apply in future operations.\" He said there was no need for an additional investigation. \n Votel added that he believes the U.S. gained valuable information on al-Qaida militants. \n Trump, who honored Owens' widow during his speech to Congress last week, has repeatedly defended the raid as highly successful. He told Congress that it \"generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\" \n Votel said investigations into the helicopter crash are continuing. One is an aircraft safety investigation, intended to generate any important information for the helicopter fleet.

{"date": "March 9, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spoke in a video made available today. Assange said his group will work with technology companies to help defeat the Central Intelligence Agency's hacking tools. \n WASHINGTON >> WikiLeaks will work with technology companies to help defend them against the CIA's hacking tools, founder Julian Assange said today. The move sets up a potential conflict between Silicon Valley firms eager to protect their products and an intelligence agency stung by the radical transparency group's disclosures. \n In an online news conference, Assange acknowledged that some companies had asked for more details about the CIA cyberespionage toolkit that he purportedly revealed in a massive disclosure earlier this week. \n \"We have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to some of the technical details we have, so that fixes can be pushed out,\" Assange said. Once tech firms had patched their products, he said, he would release the full data of the hacking tools to the public. \n In response to Assange's news conference, CIA spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak said: \"As we've said previously, Julian Assange is not exactly a bastion of truth and integrity. Despite the efforts of Assange and his ilk, CIA continues to aggressively collect foreign intelligence overseas to protect America from terrorists, hostile nation states and other adversaries.\" \n The CIA has so far declined to comment directly on the authenticity of the leak, but in a statement issued Wednesday it said such releases are damaging because they equip adversaries \"with tools and information to do us harm.\" \n Assange began his online press conference with a dig at the agency for losing control of its cyberespionage arsenal, saying that all the data had been kept in one place. \"This is a historic act of devastating incompetence,\" he said, adding that, \"WikiLeaks discovered the material as a result of it being passed around.\" \n Assange said the technology was nearly impossible to keep under wraps \u2014 or under control. \n \"There's absolutely nothing to stop a random CIA officer\" or even a contractor from using the technology, Assange said. \"The technology is designed to be unaccountable, untraceable; it's designed to remove traces of its activity.\" \n The CIA wouldn't confirm Wednesday that the material came from its files, although no one is doubting that it did. The CIA wouldn't talk about whether there was any investigation underway to figure out how the material ended up on the internet for all to see. And the agency wouldn't say whether it suspects that a mole lurking inside the CIA secretly spirited the material to WikiLeaks, or whether the CIA could have been the victim of a hack. \n The WikiLeaks disclosures were an extraordinary coup for a group that has already rocked American diplomacy with the release of 250,000 State Department cables and embarrassed the Democratic Party with political back-channel chatter and the U.S. military with hundreds of thousands of logs from Iraq and Afghanistan. \n The intelligence-related documents describe clandestine methods for bypassing or defeating encryption, antivirus tools and other protective security features for computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs. They include the world's most popular technology platforms, including Apple's iPhones and iPads, Google's Android phones and the Microsoft Windows operating system for desktop computers and laptops. \n WikiLeaks has not released the actual hacking tools themselves, some of which were developed by government hackers while others were purchased from outsiders. However, the group is now saying that it will. \n If sharing were to occur, it would be an unusual alliance that would give companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung and others an opportunity to identify and repair any flaws in their software and devices that were being exploited by U.S. spy agencies and some foreign allies, as described in the material. \n Security experts said WikiLeaks was obligated to work privately with technology companies to disclose previously unknown software flaws, known as zero-day vulnerabilities because consumers would have no time to discover how to defend themselves against their use, and with companies that design protection software. WikiLeaks has said the latest files apparently have been circulating among former U.S. government hackers and contractors. \n \"The clear move is to notify vendors,\" said Chris Wysopal, co-founder and chief technology officer of Veracode Inc. \"If WikiLeaks has this data then it's likely others have this data, too. The binaries and source code that contain zero days should be shared with people who build detection and signatures for a living.\" \n One clear risk is that WikiLeaks revealed enough details to give foreign governments better opportunities to trace any of the sophisticated hacking tools they might discover back to the CIA, damaging the ability to disguise a U.S. government hacker's involvement. \"That's a huge problem,\" said Adriel T. Desautels, the chief executive at Netragard LLC, which formerly sold zero-day exploits to governments and companies. \"Our capabilities are now diminished.\" \n Apple said many of its security vulnerabilities disclosed by WikiLeaks were already fixed. In a statement late Tuesday, it said its initial analysis showed that the latest version of the iOS system software for iPhones and iPads fixed many of those flaws. Apple said it will \"continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.\" \n Associated Press Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "WikiLeaks to help shield tech firms from CIA's hacking tools"}
