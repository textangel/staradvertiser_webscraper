{"date": "March 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This is the front page of a document explaining a certification exam known as the Academic Literacy Skills Test, designed to measure the reading and writing skills of aspiring teachers, in New York. New York state education officials are poised to scrap the test which critics say is racially biased, redundant and a poor predictor of who will succeed as teacher. But backers of the test say eliminating it could put weak teachers in classrooms. \n NEW YORK >> New York education officials are poised to scrap a test designed to measure the reading and writing skills of people trying to become teachers, in part because an outsized percentage of black and Hispanic candidates were failing it. \n The state Board of Regents on Monday is expected Monday to adopt a task force's recommendation of eliminating the literacy exam, known as the Academic Literacy Skills Test. \n Backers of the test say eliminating it could put weak teachers in classrooms. Critics of the examination said it is redundant and a poor predictor of who will succeed as a teacher. \n \"We want high standards, without a doubt. Not every given test is going to get us there,\" said Leslie Soodak, a professor of education at Pace University who served on the task force that examined the state's teacher certification tests. \n The literacy test was among four assessments introduced in the 2013-2014 school year as part of an effort to raise the level of elementary and secondary school teaching in the state. \n Leaders of the education reform movement have complained for years about the caliber of students entering education schools and the quality of the instruction they receive there. A December 2016 study by the National Council on Teacher Quality found that 44 percent of the teacher preparation programs it surveyed accepted students from the bottom half of their high school classes. \n The reformers believe tests like New York's Academic Literacy Skills Test can serve to weed out aspiring teachers who aren't strong students. \n But the literacy test raised alarms from the beginning because just 46 percent of Hispanic test takers and 41 percent of black test takers passed it on the first try, compared with 64 percent of white candidates. \n A federal judge ruled in 2015 that the test was not discriminatory, but faculty members at education schools say a test that screens out so many minorities is problematic. \n \"Having a white workforce really doesn't match our student body anymore,\" Soodak said. \n Kate Walsh, the president of National Council on Teacher Quality, which pushes for higher standards for teachers, said that blacks and Latinos don't score as well as whites on the literacy test because of factors like poverty and the legacy of racism. \n \"There's not a test in the country that doesn't have disproportionate performance on the part of blacks and Latinos,\" Walsh said. \n But she said getting rid of the literacy test would be \"a crying shame.\" \n In implementing the exams, she said, New York had become \"light years ahead of other states\" in its teacher certification regimen. \n \"New York put together a suite of testing products that really got at the lack of rigor in teacher prep,\" Walsh said. \n The Academic Literacy Skills Test consists of multiple-choice questions about a series of reading selections plus a written section. \n A practice test available for $20 on the New York State Education Department website features John F. Kennedy's inaugural address as one of the reading passages and asks questions like this one: \"In which excerpt from the passage do Kennedy's word choices most clearly establish a tone of resolve?\" \n Ian Rosenblum, the executive director of the New York office of the Education Trust, a nonprofit that advocates for high achievement for all students, called the literacy test \"a 12th grade-level assessment\" \u2014 something a high school senior should be able to pass. \n But Pace University student Tabitha Colon took the test last year and failed to get a passing score. She likened it to the English portion of the SAT and said it was \"pretty difficult.\" Plus, she said, she was thrown off by the fact that the test was given online, rather than on paper. \n \"The format on the computer was a bit confusing,\" she said. \n Colon, 21, was still able to pass thanks to a \"safety net\" provision that lets students demonstrate proficiency by submitting grades from a class. She is now working as a student teacher at a middle school in Ossining. \n Several education professors told The Associated Press the test doesn't measure anything that isn't covered in other exams students must take, including subject matter certification tests, the SAT, the GRE and tests that are part of their coursework. Also, they said the test's $131 price tag is too steep. \n Michael Middleton, dean of the Hunter College School of Education in Manhattan, said that of the battery of assessments, \"It's the one that looks like it's the least related to the actual work that teachers do day to day.\" \n Charles Sahm, the director of education policy at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, is a strong supporter of raising the bar for teachers but not a fan of this particular literacy test. \n Sahm took the $20 practice exam and thought it was a poorly designed test with multiple-choice questions that seemed to have more than one correct answer. \n \"I do agree that it's not a great test,\" Sahm said. \"I found the reading comprehension section to be kind of infuriating. I only got 21 out of 40 right.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Test meant to screen teachers instead weeded out minorities"}

Now, the former model is taking her first steps into her very public new role \n Mrs. Trump strode into the State Dining Room for her first solo White House event after an announcer intoned, \"Ladies and gentlemen, the first lady of the United States, Melania Trump,\" and was greeted by the all-female group of about 50 people, including ambassadors, Cabinet members, at least one U.S. senator and stepdaughter Ivanka Trump. \n Mrs. Trump asked guests for suggestions on how best to empower women and girls worldwide, possibly foreshadowing women's empowerment as an issue she would pursue as first lady. Trump said recently that his wife, who turns 47 next month, feels strongly about \"women's difficulties.\" \n \"I will work alongside you in ensuring that the gender of one's birth does not determine one's treatment in society,\" she told guests, according to a tweet by a White House official. \n The White House allowed a small pool of journalists to watch as guests and the first lady arrived for Wednesday's lunch, but they were ushered out as Mrs. Trump began to speak. The White House press office promised to distribute text of her prepared remarks after the event, but a transcript has not been released. \n In recent weeks, Mrs. Trump helped plan their first big White House social event, an annual, black-tie dinner for the nation's governors. She followed up with a trip the next day to Mount Vernon, George Washington's estate in Virginia, where she was hosted by the governors' spouses. \n The first lady has made other quiet appearances, watching her husband sign legislation and executive orders, and accompanying him to the Capitol for a speech to Congress. \n She took her counterparts from Japan and Israel on cultural outings and quickly learned the burden of new scrutiny and protocol when she was criticized for not being at the White House to greet the Japanese prime minister's wife. Instead, Mrs. Trump met the president and Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland for an Air Force One flight to Florida. Trump treated Abe to a weekend at Trump's estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Melania Trump then took Akie Abe to tour a nearby Japanese garden. \n \"We see her physical presence,\" said Jean Harris, professor of political science and women's studies at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania. \n All first ladies go through an adjustment period as they figure out how to handle one of the most unforgiving roles in American political life. Unlike many of Mrs. Trump's predecessors, who were politically experienced through marriage to governors or members of Congress, she is married to a lifelong businessman who never held elective office until he became president. \n Complicating her White House launch is the couple's decision for the first lady to continue living at Trump Tower until their 10-year-old son, Barron, finishes the school year. She's not expected to live full time at the White House for at least several more months, leaving Trump largely on his own and without a traditional source of moral support. \n Mrs. Trump has also been slow to staff the East Wing of the White House, where the first lady's office is based. She so far has named only a social secretary and a chief of staff. The president has said he doesn't want to fill hundreds of government vacancies because they are \"unnecessary,\" which could include the East Wing. \n And the slow pace of building her staff could be complicating operations. \n It's customary for the White House Visitors Office to close temporarily during a change in administration since political appointees do the work. But this year's shutdown lasted longer than usual, frustrating members of Congress who are responsible for distributing White House public tour tickets to constituents. Tours resumed earlier this week after a more than six-week pause. \n Speculation about whether the Trumps would continue the annual Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn had been mounting until they announced this week that it will be held on April 17. \n The first lady's popularity has risen 16 percentage points since the Jan. 20 inauguration, according to recent polling by CNN, climbing to 52 percent, from 36 percent. \n Kate Andersen Brower, author of \"First Women,\" said the public sees Mrs. Trump as a calming force and as someone who has embraced being a mother. \n \"She's really the polar opposite of him,\" she said, noting that the first lady barely tweets, unlike her husband's daily Twitter habit. Mrs. Trump also hadn't been seen in public for several weeks after the inauguration, whereas the president appears on camera most days of the week. \n \"I think most people find it endearing that she doesn't crave the spotlight in a way that he clearly does,\" Brower said. \n Harris said the public is giving Mrs. Trump \"a little bit of a honeymoon period\" but predicted the mood will change if she doesn't move to the White House. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Melania Trump begins to embrace new role as first lady"}

{"date": "March 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara speaks during a news conference in New York. The outspoken Manhattan federal prosecutor known for crusading against public corruption said on Saturday, March 11, 2017, that he was fired after refusing to resign. \n NEW YORK >> A Manhattan federal prosecutor who says \"absolute independence\" was his touchstone for over seven years as he battled public corruption announced he was fired Saturday after he refused a request a day earlier to resign. \n Preet Bharara, 48, made the announcement on his personal Twitter account after it became widely known hours earlier that he did not intend to step down in response to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' request that leftover appointees of former President Barack Obama quit. \n \"I did not resign. Moments ago I was fired,\" Bharara said in the tweet. \n In a statement hours later, he said: \"Serving my country as U.S. Attorney here for the past seven years will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life, no matter what else I do or how long I live. One hallmark of justice is absolute independence, and that was my touchstone every day that I served.\" \n He said Joon H. Kim will serve as acting U.S. attorney in his absence. \n The Justice Department late Saturday confirmed Bharara was no longer U.S. attorney but declined to expound. Spokeswoman Nicole Navas declined comment. \n Just over three months ago, then-President-elect Donald Trump asked Bharara to remain as U.S. attorney in Manhattan and Bharara told reporters after the Trump Tower meeting that he had agreed to do so. \n Bharara was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2009. In frequent public appearances, Bharara has decried public corruption after successfully prosecuting over a dozen state lawmakers, Democrats and Republicans alike. \n Sessions' decision to include Bharara's name on the list of 46 resignations of holdovers from the Obama administration surprised Manhattan prosecutors. \n While it is customary for a new president to replace virtually all of the 93 U.S. attorneys, it often occurs at a slower pace. Sessions lost his position as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Alabama in a similar sweep by then-Attorney General Janet Reno in 1993. \n Robert Morgenthau, a Democratic U.S. attorney in Manhattan, famously held out for nearly a year after Republican President Richard Nixon's 1969 inauguration, saying he needed to see some important cases through. He ultimately left in January 1970, after the White House declared he was being replaced and announced a nominee. \n New York Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat, said in a statement Friday that he was \"troubled to learn\" of the resignation demands, particularly of Bharara, since Trump called him in November and assured him that he wanted Bharara to remain Manhattan's top federal prosecutor. \n After Bharara met Trump on Nov. 30, he emerged from the meeting to say Trump had asked him to remain in the job he has held since his appointment in the summer of 2009 and he had agreed. \n Schumer said that by requesting immediate resignations, Trump was \"interrupting ongoing cases and investigations and hindering the administration of justice.\" \n Bharara, who was once lauded on the cover of Time magazine as the man who is \"busting Wall Street\" after successfully prosecuting dozens of insider traders, has in the past few years set his sights on prosecuting over a dozen state officeholders \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 including New York's two most powerful lawmakers. \n It also recently was revealed that Bharara's office is investigating the financial terms of settlements of sexual-harassment claims against Fox News by its employees. \n The request from Sessions came as Bharara's office is prosecuting former associates of Democratic Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in a bribery case. Also, prosecutors recently interviewed New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as part of a probe into his fundraising. The mayor's press secretary has said the mayor is cooperating and that he and his staff had acted appropriately. \n The request for resignations came just days after Trump last weekend claimed that Obama tapped his telephones during last year's election. FBI Director James Comey privately asked the Justice Department to dispute the claim because he believed the allegations were false. Bharara worked for Comey when he was U.S. attorney in Manhattan under President George W. Bush. \n Last week, the quick-witted Bharara initiated a new personal Twitter feed with one of his first tweets perhaps intentionally delivering multiple messages. \n In it, he linked to an AP video of a Senate hearing focusing on whether federal prosecutors were fired for political reasons. \n \"This Senate hearing on political interference DOJ was 10 yrs ago today,\" Bharara wrote. \"Is that me in the background?

{"date": "March 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Students take part in a role-playing game about the 1676 Bacon's Rebellion, in a class in Murfreesboro, Tenn. The university has staged re-enactments of historical events to help shed light on conflicting perspectives that led to great compromises. Around the U.S., those disheartened by a coarsened culture and caustic state. \n NEW YORK >> In state capitals, lawmakers attend workshops on how to avoid demonizing their opponents. On a college campus, students re-enact hard-fought debates that led to great compromises at the country's founding. Even a summer camp is aiming to give children the tools to show respect in the face of disagreement. \n Americans alarmed and disheartened by a coarsened culture and incivility in politics \u2014 especially following a brutal presidential campaign season that bared new lows in both \u2014 are fighting back with a range of initiatives around the U.S. to restore some semblance of decorum. \n \"It's incumbent on us to be the adults who push back against what we're getting in the popular culture and the political rhetoric,\" said Mary Evins, who directs the American Democracy Project for Civil Learning at Middle Tennessee State University. That's where students have staged classroom role-plays of compromises from the 1787 Constitutional Convention, assuming the parts of the Founding Fathers to act out the give-and-take required to reach agreement on crucial but difficult decisions, such as how large and small states would share power. \n \"There's so many people with a difference of opinion,\" said Brendon Holloway, who participated in various Democracy Project initiatives at Middle Tennessee State, including voter registration drives. \"It's really important to bridge the gap.\" \n The school is training faculty to incorporate civic learning across disciplines, holding a lecture series on rhetoric, and hosting former members of Congress to talk about respectful dialogue. Evins says it's all part of addressing not just college and career, but citizenship. \n \"If we do not address that third C, then we have shamed ourselves,\" she said, \"we have walked away.\" \n Even as polls find Americans say a civil tone in candidates is an important factor in how they vote, surveys have also shown people more accepting of personal attacks in politics. A poll by Zogby commissioned by Allegheny College in October found in the six years since its previous survey, significantly more people viewed it as acceptable to interrupt, shout over, belittle, insult, personally attack, or question the patriotism of those with differing opinions. Respondents also have grown more accepting of commenting on another's sexual orientation, race or ethnicity. \n Fewer people even believe elected officials should pursue friendships with members of other parties: 56 percent in the more recent survey compared with 85 percent in 2010. \n \"If this incivility continues, we're going to lose a generation to politics,\" said Jim Mullen, president of Allegheny, in Meadville, Pennsylvania. \"And that's a very dangerous thing for our democracy.\" \n Allegheny created the Prize for Civility in Public Life in 2011 to highlight public figures who demonstrate respectful behavior and inspire students to consider elected service. Last year, it went to Sen. John McCain and Vice President Joe Biden, who hugged onstage as they received the honor. \n Organized attempts to stir civil discourse have sprouted for at least a decade in response to the continuing degeneration of public debate and increased animosity between Democrats and Republicans. But they've gained new steam following the 2016 campaign and the ascension to the presidency of Donald Trump, with his unrestrained, often caustic commentary. \n Interest has surged in programs offered by the National Institute for Civil Discourse, which was founded at the University of Arizona after the 2011 shooting that left six dead and then-Rep. Gabby Giffords and others badly injured. Its civility-boosting efforts around the country include sessions in state legislatures that bring lawmakers from opposing parties together in hopes they see one another as people and try to understand what has shaped their opinions. \n \"I don't think there's any question that this is a national crisis at this point,\" said Carolyn Lukensmeyer, the institute's executive director. \"This is kind of a dangerous moment.\" \n At Unity College in Maine, one of several civility initiatives aims to improve discourse at the person-to-person level. President Melik Khoury, who established a campus commission to ensure inclusivity and free expression, also made students a special offer: He'd pay for them to dine with someone they don't know in an effort to foster dialogue between people of different points of view, such as avid hunters and devoted environmentalists. A handful of students so far have taken up the offer. \n \"We cannot stop talking,\" Khoury said. \"We cannot be disunited.\" \n Civility efforts have even stretched outside of academia and government into less likely arenas. In Greencastle, Indiana, organizers are preparing for a new summer camp where children will be exposed to elementary philosophy, taught to talk about their values and to listen to competing outlooks. \n Andrew Cullison, who is leading camp planning as director of the Prindle Institute for Ethics at DePauw University, said the goal is to get the first- to fifth-grade participants talking respectfully about their opinions on a range of issues. If they can learn to be composed in, say, a discussion over whether vanilla or chocolate is better, they may be able to translate that skill when they later face disagreement on a weightier topic, like politics. \n \"They sort of realize, the way I was talking about ice cream is the way I can talk about Trump,\" Cullison said. \n As these efforts spread, Evins at Middle Tennessee State acknowledges some frustration that despite so many attempts to improve discourse over the past decade, it has only worsened. \n \"We've been working at this for a long time. Are we making no progress whatsoever? Are we beating our heads against the wall?\" she asked. \"There is a sense that there must be renewed dedication to this.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "As incivility hits new depths, many are working to combat it"}

{"date": "March 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The U.S. Secret Service says a person is under arrest after climbing a fence and getting onto the south grounds of the White House. \n POTOMAC FALLS, Va. >> President Donald Trump praised the U.S. Secret Service today for doing a \"fantastic job\" apprehending a \"troubled person\" who climbed a fence and was approaching a south entrance to the White House while Trump was inside the executive mansion. \n It was the first known security breach at the White House since Trump took office nearly two months ago. \n Washington, D.C., police identified the intruder as Jonathan Tran, 26, of Milpitas, California. \n When approached by a Secret Service officer on the south grounds about 11:38 p.m. Friday and asked whether he had a pass authorizing him to be in the restricted area, Tran replied, \"No, I am a friend of the president. I have an appointment,\" the police report said. \n Asked how he got there, he said he \"jumped the fence.\" \n The Secret Service said in a statement that the intruder, whom it did not identify, had climbed an outer perimeter fence near the Treasury Department and East Executive Avenue. He was arrested without further incident and no hazardous materials were found in his backpack, the agency said. \n Authorities found two cans of Mace on Tran, including one inside his jacket pocket, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court. Tran was also carrying a U.S. passport, an Apple laptop computer, a book written by Trump and a letter he had written to the president, the complaint said. \n \"Secret Service did a fantastic job last night,\" Trump said Saturday from his golf club in Northern Virginia. He described the intruder as a \"troubled person\" and the situation as \"very sad.\" Trump was briefed on the matter Friday night, said his spokesman, Sean Spicer. \n Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was also briefed on the incident, the Secret Service said. Kelly was among several Cabinet secretaries and senior White House staff members who attended a working lunch with the president at the Trump National Golf Club. \n In the letter found on Tran, he mentioned \"Russian hackers\" and said he had information of relevance, according to the criminal complaint. He alleged that he had been followed, that his phone and email communications had been read by third parties, and that he has been called schizophrenic. \n The Secret Service said a search of the north and south White House grounds found \"nothing of concern to security operations.\" Standard practice is to turn intruders over to the local police department. \n Video surveillance footage shows Tran jumping a fence near the Treasury Department adjacent to the White House security fence, the complaint said. At one point, Tran is seen hiding behind a White House pillar before proceeding to the South Portico entrance. \n Friday's security breach follows a series of similar lapses that took place during the eight years that Barack Obama was president. An especially embarrassing breach came in September 2014 when an Army veteran with mental health issues scaled a fence on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it deep inside the building, to the East Room, before the Secret Service could detain him. \n The Obamas were not at home at the time. The incident was one of several breakdowns by the Secret Service that ultimately led to the resignation of the agency's director, Julia Pierson, the following month. Trump has to find someone new to lead the agency: Joseph Clancy, a former agent who came out of retirement to succeed Pierson and stabilize the law enforcement agency, announced his second retirement last month. \n Trump said he brought the Cabinet secretaries, White House staff and some of their spouses to the club for a working lunch to discuss the military, the economy, health care and other issues. \n Besides Kelly, joining Trump were Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon and Spicer. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was absent. \n \"We're having some great discussions,\" Trump said. \"The economy is doing very, very well. Generally speaking we're doing very well.\" He talked about inheriting \"a mess\" when he took office, but said everything would be \"straightened out fast.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump praises arrest of 'troubled person' at White House"}

Pence said that the so-called Obamacare law had failed the nation and the Trump administration would need the backing of rank-and-file Republicans to pass their health care overhaul. \n LOUISVILLE, Ky. >> Vice President Mike Pence defended the House GOP health care proposal today, venturing to Kentucky to counter opposition from the state's Republican governor and its junior GOP senator. \n Pence acknowledged that not all of the state's political leaders back the House leadership's plan, but told small business leaders that President Donald Trump would lean on House Republicans \u2014 including two Kentucky lawmakers in attendance, Reps. Andy Barr and Brett Guthrie \u2014 to vote to replace former President Barack Obama's law. \n \"There's going to be a battle in Washington, D.C.,\" Pence said at an energy company where the business leaders had gathered. The vice president said the health law had \"failed the people of Kentucky, it's failed the people of America and Obamacare must go.\" \n In a sign of the pitched fight over the future of the nation's health care system, Pence's motorcade passed a long line of demonstrators who chanted, \"Save our care.\" His trip was part of an effort to reassure conservatives who have raised objections to the House GOP health care plan. \n Around the time that Pence landed in Louisville, Trump tweeted: \"We are making great progress with healthcare. ObamaCare is imploding and will only get worse. Republicans coming together to get job done!\" \n The former Indiana governor has been the chief salesman for Trump's push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The House is expected to vote on the bill in less than two weeks, but faces fierce resistance from critics, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has called the initial draft \"Obamacare Lite.\" \n Several influential conservative groups, such as Heritage Action, FreedomWorks and the Club for Growth, have come out against the plan. \n Pence suggested this week that the Trump administration was open to negotiating changes to the bill. \n Conservatives have urged the White House to halt the extra money Obama's law gives states to expand the federal-state Medicaid program for 70 million low-income people. The GOP bill would end that additional funding in 2020 except for those already in the program, but conservatives want to accelerate that to 2018 to save money. \n Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, has warned that the state cannot afford to pay for its growing Medicaid program, which has cost the state millions more than initially expected and now covers more than 25 percent of the state's population. He has dismantled Kentucky's state-based exchange but indicated he would not favor eliminating the federal health insurance exchange. \n Bevin told reporters Friday that, like Paul, he was not impressed with the initial proposal. \n But on Saturday he said that while there were different views on how to change the law, \"ultimately these differences of opinion will be rectified.\" He said all could agree that \"change has to come \u2014 the system is broken.\" \n Pence went on a bit of a charm offensive with Bevin, who greeted him at the airport and was given an impromptu tour of Air Force Two along with his children and their friend. After a motorcade ride, Pence sat beside Bevin at a meeting with business leaders that included pizza magnate John Schnatter of Papa John's. \"I was for Matt Bevin before it was cool,\" Pence told the group. \n Paul has been among the Senate's foremost critics of the bill. Even before the legislation was released, he placed a copy machine outside of the room where House Republicans were drafting the bill and asked for a copy, all to draw attention to the secrecy of the plan. \n \"Now I know that not every politician in Kentucky supports our plan to repeal and replace Obamacare,\" Pence said. \"I know your former governor, Steve Beshear, has been defending Obamacare all over America. And he might even have something to say about my visit here today, and I welcome the debate. I really do. \" \n But Pence said that while he collaborated with Beshear while both served as neighboring governors, \"your former governor is wrong about Obamacare.\" \n The event at the Harshaw Trane facility was in the hometown of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whom Pence praised as \"a true friend to me, to our president, and to the people of America. \" \n McConnell, however, did not attend due to a scheduling conflict. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pence makes case for health care overhaul in Kentucky"}

{"date": "March 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this June 2009 file photo, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, left, is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington. A White House official says President Donald Trump is choosing Gottlieb, a conservative doctor-turned-pundit with deep ties to Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry to lead the powerful Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n WASHINGTON >> A conservative doctor-turned-pundit with deep ties to Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry is President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Food and Drug Administration. \n Dr. Scott Gottlieb would be tasked with Trump's goal of cutting red tape at the FDA, which regulates everything from pharmaceuticals to seafood to electronic cigarettes. Trump has called the FDA's drug approval process \"slow and burdensome\" despite changes to speed reviews, particularly of cutting-edge products. \n Gottlieb, 44, is no stranger to the FDA \u2014 he served as a deputy commissioner under President George W. Bush. While he has frequently criticized the FDA for unnecessary regulations and urged changes to get safe and effective drugs onto the market faster, he generally has supported its overall mission. \n A Senate vote is required before Gottlieb can take over as head of the agency. \n Gottlieb is a resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a partner in the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates. He has spent more than a decade in Washington rotating between the worlds of government, health policy consulting and political think tanks. \n Since leaving the FDA in 2007, Gottlieb has served as a board member or adviser to at least nine pharmaceutical or medical technology companies, according to his LinkedIn profile. Gottlieb is a consultant to GlaxoSmithKline's product investment board; a managing director at T.R. Winston & Company merchant bank, which specializes in health care; and a clinical assistant professor at New York University School of Medicine. He also is a policy adviser to the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship. \n There are likely to be questions at his Senate confirmation hearing about how those ties might affect his decisions at the FDA. \n Federal ethics rules do not require government officials to sell off their investments, but they must recuse themselves from matters that would affect those investments. As part of the federal vetting process, FDA nominees typically disclose and sell stocks, funds and other investments that could pose a financial conflict of interest. \n Gottlieb generally supports reduced FDA regulation, particularly for emerging products like health apps and wearable devices like the Apple Watch. But he has never embraced libertarian-leaning proposals that would have the FDA abandon its effectiveness reviews of drugs and medical products. Under those plans, the FDA would simply approve products that appear safe, allowing the private sector to determine how well they actually treat diseases or medical conditions. \n Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., who serves on the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees FDA funding, said the nomination sends the message that Trump is committed to \"rolling back regulations and opening the floodgates to potentially dangerous drugs and medical devices.\" \n The evaluation of medical effectiveness has been a cornerstone of the FDA's mission since the early 1960s and is universally embraced by its staff and the businesses it regulates. \n \"If FDA were not in business of evaluating effectiveness then these companies wouldn't be able to say much. Where companies distinguish themselves is by being able to claim that their product actually does something,\" said Michael Gaba, an industry attorney who specializes in FDA law. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's choice for FDA has ties to Wall Street, drug makers"}
