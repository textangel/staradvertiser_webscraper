{"date": "March 14, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People swim in Waikiki on Monday. Hawaii has filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's revised travel ban, saying the executive order could harm the state's strong tourist economy. \n Hawaii's white sand beaches, towering volcanoes and relaxing tropical vistas attract millions of visitors annually from around the globe. \n But the announcement of President Donald Trump's second travel ban has stoked fears that the state's main economic driver \u2014 tourism \u2014 could take a hit. \n Although visitors from the affected countries are relatively few, Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin has warned of a \"chilling effect\" that could discourage international travel to the U.S. from all corners. \n \"There are already reports that due to these executive orders and travel bans, people are less inclined to travel to the United States,\" he told reporters at a recent news conference. \n Hawaii is suing over the revised ban, saying it goes against the state's welcoming \"aloha\" spirit and could do long-term harm to tourism by creating a global perception that the U.S. is an exclusionary country. \n It also contends the order will interfere with Hawaii's commitment to diversity and nondiscrimination; will hurt Hawaii residents with family in the six predominantly Muslim countries named in the ban; and will hinder the University of Hawaii's ability to recruit talent from those countries. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Wednesday morning. \n \"The legal issue here is whether an executive order that discriminates by national origin or religion results in any harm, major or minor, to a state,\" Chin said in an emailed statement. \"If any harm occurs \u2013 and we believe it does \u2013 the state of Hawaii has standing to sue on the grounds that the order is illegal and unconstitutional.\" \n Six other states \u2014 Washington, California, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York and Oregon \u2014 have filed a separate lawsuit alleging the ban is unconstitutional and hurts states' residents, businesses and educational institutions. \n The Justice Department declined to comment on Hawaii's lawsuit but filed a memo in court opposing it Monday. The agency said Hawaii's claims that Trump's order would deter tourism and hinder recruitment are speculation, and the argument that the order forces Hawaii to tolerate a policy that's antithetical to its spirit does not give the state standing to sue. \n It also said the order does not discriminate based on religion because it applies to all individuals in the affected countries \u2014 Somalia, Iran, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen \u2014 regardless of faith. \n According to Hawaii's lawsuit, more than 6,800 people from the Middle East and 2,000 from Africa visited the state in 2015. During the short time the first executive order was in place, the number of visitors to Hawaii from the Middle East fell from 348 in January 2016 to 278 in 2017. \n \"You never know when the other shoe will drop and it will be hard for you to get out of the country,\" said Mufi Hannemann, the Hawaii Lodging and Tourism Association's president and CEO. \"It flies in the face of the spirit of aloha, a key reason people come to Hawaii.\" \n About 5,000 Muslims live in Hawaii, less than 1 percent of the state's population. \n Soufiane Bouharkat, a 40-year-old Hawaii cafe owner, was among dozens gathered at a Honolulu mosque Friday for prayers. He said many of his friends in Europe, where he grew up, are reluctant to visit the U.S. \n \"They're just afraid they might be stopped or questioned, and that's the last thing you want to be is questioned when you come on vacation,\" Bouharkat said. \"So it will definitely have an impact. As small as it is, it will still be an impact that's negative.\" \n In 2016, Hawaii saw 8.9 million visitors who together spent $15.6 billion, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. On average, that's about $1,750 per visitor. \n The agency doesn't track spending of visitors from the countries named in the travel ban because there are so few. Tourists from the Middle East and other parts of Africa made up less than 1 percent of all Hawaii visitors last year. \n About two-thirds of Hawaii visitors come from elsewhere in the U.S., followed by 17 percent from Japan, 6 percent from Canada, 5 percent from the rest of Asia and 2 percent from Europe, according to 2015 state data. \n \"The Middle East doesn't even factor in,\" said Chuck Gee, dean emeritus at the University of Hawaii School of Travel Industry Management. \n Travel bans related to outbreaks such as bird flu can have a devastating impact on tourism, but those related to security and safety typically don't, Gee said. \n \"If they think the ban would make Hawaii safer, it could actually help us,\" he said, noting the state is seen as a sound location, so \"whenever there is trouble in the world, Hawaii tends to benefit.\" \n Business travelers booking conventions sometimes cancel travel for political reasons, but independent travelers are less likely to call off trips, Gee added. \n Tourists strolling through Waikiki on a sunny afternoon had mixed opinions on the travel ban. \n \"The underlying problem is the Muslims coming in without them having been checked,\" said Peter Broady of Manchester, England. \"And it doesn't have to be a Muslim \u2014 it can be anybody. Any religion, any faith. \u2026They need to be checked. It's only common sense.\" \n But a couple from Sydney, Australia, felt differently. \n \"It's definitely not fair because there's obviously a lot of innocent people who are caught up with it because of their ethnic backgrounds,\" Michael Bills said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hawaii fears travel ban goes against welcoming aloha spirit"}

{"date": "March 14, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Supporters of ousted South Korean President Park Geun-hye gather in front of her private home in Seoul, South Korea, today. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> It was hard to imagine that ousted President Park Geun-hye could get any more unpopular in South Korea \u2014 until she moved out of the presidential palace and left her nine dogs behind. \n Just days after being removed from office by the Constitutional Court over a massive corruption scandal, an animal rights group accused Park of animal abandonment for not bringing the dogs with her. \n Park's neighbors had given her a pair of Jindo dogs, a Korean breed of hunting dogs, when she left for the presidential Blue House in 2013. The dogs recently gave birth to seven puppies, which are now considered too young to be separated from their mother, Kim Dong-jo, a Blue House spokesman, said Wednesday. \n Kim said the dogs would continue to stay at the presidential palace until they're ready to be sent to new owners. Park told staff members to take good care of the dogs before vacating the Blue House on Sunday, he said. \n Kim Ae Ra, who heads the Korea Alliance for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said the group filed a complaint Monday with South Korea's Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission over Park's dogs. The commission then asked the National Police Agency to look into it. Officials from the police agency couldn't immediately confirm how the case would be treated. \n It's unclear whether Park not taking the dogs with her qualifies as abandonment under South Korea's animal protection law, which defines lost or abandoned animals as those \"wandering without an owner in public places\" or \"left deserted in paper boxes or other containers.\" \n Animal abandonment is punishable by a fine of up to 1 million won ($873). People who fail to report an ownership change in pets within 30 days can also face fines of up to 500,000 won ($436). \n Park's decision to leave the dogs behind touched off a heated reaction from dog lovers, who flooded social media with angry remarks. \n \"It seems that Park Geun-hye is a person who entirely lacks empathy, whether it's for humans or for animals,\" Park Jeong-eon, a 38-year-old office worker who is unrelated to the ousted president, told The Associated Press. \n Parliament passed an impeachment motion against Park in December, and the court formally removed her from office on Friday. Prosecutors plan to question her next week over suspicions that she colluded with a friend to extort money and favors from companies and allowed the friend to secretly interfere with state affairs. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "South Koreans angered after ousted leader leaves dogs behind"}

That teaser spread like wildfire, and within the hour, MSNBC was running a countdown clock on its screen counting down the minutes to a \"Trump Taxes Exclusive.\" \n It was actually another reporter's exclusive, and more limited than the tweet made it sound. David Cay Johnston, founder of the web site DCReports.org and a longtime investigative reporter and author of the critical book, \"The Making of Donald Trump,\" had received a copy of two pages from Trump's 2005 federal tax return in the mail from an unknown source. \n Before Maddow even went on the air, the White House confirmed the documents were real and stole the headline by saying that Trump's income exceeded $150 million in 2005 and that he paid $38 million in income taxes that year. \n \"It's been a hullaballoo around here,\" Maddow said as she opened her show. \"I'm sorry if I'm a little flustered.\" \n She spent nearly 20 minutes explaining why many people believe it important that Trump release his tax returns, as presidents have done since Richard Nixon in the 1970s. She pieced together theories on what his returns could show \u2014 sources of his income and whether he was beholden to any foreign sources, whether he personally stood to gain from any changes in tax policies that the Trump administration sought to enact. \n It felt vaguely like a bait-and-switch and there were some complaints on social media that Maddow was taking too long to get to the point. For long-time watchers of her show, the structure was familiar: Maddow frequently opens with long, detailed stories that follow many paths. This has been a winning formula lately, since Maddow's ratings in February were the highest in the nine years her show has been on the air. \n The exclusive she eventually revealed in the tax returns was little more than the White House had announced before she had gone on the air. She said she hoped it could be a first step toward more information about Trump's taxes being released. \n Trump failed to release his taxes during the campaign, claiming that he was under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and he had been advised against it. \n \"It ought to give you pause that his explanations have never made any factual sense,\" Maddow said. \n The White House pronounced Maddow desperate for ratings and said she had violated a law against the unauthorized release or publishing of federal tax returns. Maddow said that First Amendment protections of the press gave her the right to broadcast the information. \n She brought Johnston on her show to discuss the return. He speculated that Trump \u2014 or someone authorized by the president \u2014 could have been a possible source of the leaked document which he said \"came in the mail over the transom.\" \n Maddow wasn't even off the air \u2014 MSNBC kept her on for more than her hour to continue discussing the story \u2014 when she came under attack by one of Trump's most vocal defenders on television: Fox's Sean Hannity. \n Hannity, on his show, called Maddow's story \"a flat-out, pathetic conspiratorial attempt to smear the president.\" He said NBC News was part of the \"deep state\" looking to undermine Trump's presidency. \n \"Night after night this false narrative keeps getting reported,\" he said. \"There's something really twisted and sick that they call themselves a news organization.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tax story puts spotlight on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow"}

DeWine's office provided heavily redacted versions last fall. \n Kessler said the family's concerns were reflected in a statement he made in July regarding the release of the autopsies. \"I do not want to release any information that might impede the criminal investigation or the families' grieving process,\" Kessler said in that July 22 statement. \n Kessler also said he didn't have conversations with criminal investigators about information he redacted in the full autopsy reports. \n The redacted versions confirmed earlier accounts that all but one victim were shot multiple times in the head but otherwise provided few new details in the investigation. \n As has previously been reported, one victim, 44-year-old Kenneth Rhoden, died of a single gunshot wound. His body was the last found by investigators. \n The other victims were shot multiple times in the head and, in the case of 40-year-old Christopher Rhoden Sr. \u2014 Kenneth Rhoden's brother \u2014 in his upper body and torso, as well. \n The other victims were Christopher Rhoden Sr.'s ex-wife, 37-year-old Dana Rhoden; their three children, 20-year-old Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden, 16-year-old Christopher Rhoden Jr. and 19-year-old Hanna Rhoden; Frankie Rhoden's fiancee, 20-year-old Hannah Gilley; and a cousin, 38-year-old Gary Rhoden. \n In the redacted autopsy reports, toxicology results, which could include the use of drugs or alcohol, were blacked out for all the victims. Evidence of injuries beyond the mention of gunshot wounds was also blacked out for all the victims. \n Authorities haven't announced a motive. DeWine's office has said Christopher Rhoden Sr. \"was operating a large-scale marijuana growing operation on his property,\" leading some to speculate the killings were drug-related. \n DeWine has said those responsible for the killings were familiar with the victims, their homes and the surrounding area in rural southern Ohio. His office, which is investigating along with the Pike County sheriff's office, has also said authorities are operating under the theory there were multiple attackers. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Family of 8 slain feared release of autopsy details"}

Riley said the number of new tips flowing in has since declined but still numbers more than 200 a day. \n Patty urged the public during a news conference to study two grainy images of a man considered the main suspect in the killings and audio of a male saying \"down the hill.\" \n That evidence came from German's cellphone, and police have hailed her as a hero for recording potentially crucial evidence. \n Police have been tight-lipped about details in the case, and have not disclosed how the girls were killed or whether investigators collected DNA from the crime scene. \n Carroll County Prosecutor Rob Ives said about 70 subpoenas and three search warrants had been issued and served in connection with the case as of today. \n While the month-old investigation has lost some officers to other cases, Riley said more than 40 officers, including FBI agents, are still working the Delphi killings every day. \n Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby said investigators remain confident the murders will eventually be solved, but are still looking for the tip that will break the case. \n \"I'm operating from the standpoint where the next phone tip or email tip is the one we've been searching for.

{"date": "March 14, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump listens during a meeting on healthcare in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Monday. \n NEW YORK >> The release of two pages of President Donald Trump's 2005 tax returns has sparked a legal dispute, with the White House and a major television network squaring off over whether a law was broken. \n The White House said MSNBC's publication of the pages today violated a federal law that prohibits the unauthorized release of tax returns. But the cable network, which revealed the 1040 form on Rachel Maddow's show, claimed First Amendment privilege. \n Trump refused to release his returns during the campaign, breaking a decades-long tradition. \n The document revealed today showed Trump made more than $150 million in income in 2005 and paid $38 million in income taxes that year. \n Here's a look at the law \u2014 and the emerging controversy: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n FEDERAL LAW \n Federal law makes it illegal to publish an unauthorized tax return or \"return information.\" According to federal statute, any violation of the law \"shall be a felony punishable by a fine in any amount not exceeding $5,000, or imprisonment of not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\" \n That term \"return information\" not only applies to the amount of taxes paid, but also the amount of income, payments, receipts, deductions and other financial information that could be found on the forms. \n But legal experts have said the way the returns were obtained matters. \n If a media organization did not conspire to steal the material or get it from the government but simply received it from a private citizen, criminal liability would be less clear. \n Maddow said today that the return was mailed anonymously to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston, who said he received the document unsolicited, in the mail. Johnston then speculated on the show that the documents could have been mailed from Trump, a known leaker of information, or his associates since they appeared to paint the president in a favorable light. \n A stamp reading \"Client Copy\" is visible on one of the two pages sent to Johnston. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE WHITE HOUSE TAKE \n A White House official released a statement in the minutes before Maddow's show aired, declaring \"you know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago.\" \n The statement goes on to declare that the returns were \"illegally published\" and then claims, in a fit of Trumpian hyperbole, that it is \"totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.\" \n Trump, who is famously litigious, threatened lawsuits as recently as last October against women who came forward to accuse him of sexual harassment or misconduct, though he never followed through. It was not immediately clear if he would order a probe into the release of the 2005 returns. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n MSNBC'S DEFENSE \n Maddow, during her broadcast, declared the First Amendment allows journalists to publish tax returns. A similar defense was mounted by The Washington Post amid the 1971 publication of the Pentagon Papers, a classified study of the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War. The Post argued that the publication of the sensitive documents served an important public interest. \n Editors at The New York Times made a nearly identical argument in October when one of their reporters was mailed Trump's 1995 returns. Dean Baquet, the paper's editor, had said he would risk jail to publish the returns. After the publication, the paper printed a statement that read, \"Nothing could be more central to the First Amendment than our right to publish, and the public's right to know, important information about presidential candidates.\" \n Those 1995 returns showed that Trump took a $916 million loss that year \u2014 so big he could have avoided paying federal income tax for years to come. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "The legal dispute over release of Trump's taxes"}

{"date": "March 14, 2017", "text": "THE OCEAN AGENCY/XL CATLIN SEAVIEW SURVEY VIA AP \n In this May 2016 photo released by The Ocean Agency/XL Catlin Seaview Survey, a boat sailed near a coral reef that has been bleached white by heat stress in the Maldives. \n SOUTH ARI ATOLL, Maldives >> There were startling colors here just a year ago, a dazzling array of life beneath the waves. Now this Maldivian reef is dead, killed by the stress of rising ocean temperatures. What's left is a haunting expanse of gray, a scene repeated in reefs across the globe in what has fast become a full-blown ecological catastrophe. \n The world has lost roughly half its coral reefs in the last 30 years. Scientists are now scrambling to ensure that at least a fraction of these unique ecosystems survives beyond the next three decades. The health of the planet depends on it: Coral reefs support a quarter of all marine species, as well as half a billion people around the world. \n \"This isn't something that's going to happen 100 years from now. We're losing them right now,\" said marine biologist Julia Baum of Canada's University of Victoria. \"We're losing them really quickly, much more quickly than I think any of us ever could have imagined.\" \n Even if the world could halt global warming now, scientists still expect that more than 90 percent of corals will die by 2050. Without drastic intervention, we risk losing them all. \n \"To lose coral reefs is to fundamentally undermine the health of a very large proportion of the human race,\" said Ruth Gates, director of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology. \n Coral reefs produce some of the oxygen we breathe. Often described as underwater rainforests, they populate a tiny fraction of the ocean but provide habitats for one in four marine species. Reefs also form crucial barriers that protect coastlines from the full force of storms. \n They provide billions of dollars in revenue from tourism, fishing and other commerce, and are used in medical research for cures to diseases including cancer, arthritis and bacterial or viral infections. \n \"Whether you're living in North America or Europe or Australia, you should be concerned,\" said biologist Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the Global Change Institute at Australia's University of Queensland. \"This is not just some distant dive destination, a holiday destination. This is the fabric of the ecosystem that supports us.\" \n And that fabric is being torn apart. \n \"You couldn't be more dumb \u2026 to erode the very thing that life depends on \u2014 the ecosystem \u2014 and hope that you'll get away with it,\" Hoegh-Guldberg said. \n Corals are invertebrates, living mostly in tropical waters. They secrete calcium carbonate to build protective skeletons that grow and take on impressive colors, thanks to a symbiotic relationship with algae that live in their tissues and provide them with energy. \n But corals are sensitive to temperature fluctuations, and are suffering from rising ocean temperatures and acidification, as well as from overfishing, pollution, coastal development and agricultural runoff. \n A temperature change of just 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) can force coral to expel the algae, leaving their white skeletons visible in a process known as \"bleaching.\" \n Bleached coral can recover if the water cools, but if high temperatures persist for months, the coral will die. Eventually the reef will degrade, leaving fish without habitats and coastlines less protected from storm surges. \n The first global bleaching event occurred in 1998, when 16 percent of corals died. The problem spiraled dramatically in 2015-2016 amid an extended El Nino natural weather phenomenon that warmed Pacific waters near the equator and triggered the most widespread bleaching ever documented. This third global bleaching event, as it is known, continues today even after El Nino ended. \n Headlines have focused on damage to Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef, but other reefs have fared just as badly or worse across the world, from Japan to Hawaii to Florida. \n Around the islands of the Maldives, an idyllic Indian Ocean tourism destination, some 73 percent of surveyed reefs suffered bleaching between March and May 2016, according to the country's Marine Research Center. \n \"This bleaching episode seems to have impacted the entire Maldives, but the severity of bleaching varies\" between reefs, according to local conditions, said Nizam Ibrahim, the center's senior research officer. \n Worst hit have been areas in the central Pacific, where the University of Victoria's Baum has been conducting research on Kiritimati, or Christmas Island, in the Republic of Kiribati. Warmer water temperatures lasted there for 10 months in 2015-2016, killing a staggering 90 percent of the reef. \n Baum had never seen anything like it. \n \"As scientists, we were all on brand new territory,\" Baum said, \"as were the corals in terms of the thermal stress they were subjected to.\" \n To make matters worse, scientists are predicting another wave of elevated ocean temperatures starting next month. \n \"The models indicate that we will see the return of bleaching in the South Pacific soon, along with a possibility of bleaching in both the eastern and western parts of the Indian Ocean,\" said Mark Eakin, coral reef specialist and coordinator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coral Reef Watch, which uses satellites to monitor environmental conditions around reefs. It may not be as bad as last year, but could further stress \"reefs that are still hurting from the last two years.\" \n The speed of the destruction is what alarms scientists and conservationists, as damaged coral might not have time to recover before it is hit again by warmer temperatures. \n But some may have a chance. \n Last month, Hoegh-Guldberg helped launch an initiative called 50 Reefs, aiming to identify those reefs with the best chance of survival in warming oceans and raise public awareness. His project partner is Richard Vevers, who heads the XL Catlin Seaview Survey, which has been documenting coral reefs worldwide. \n \"For the reefs that are least vulnerable to climate change, the key will be to protect them from all the other issues they are facing \u2014 pollution, overfishing, coastal development,\" said Vevers, who founded The Ocean Agency, an Australian organization seeking new technologies to help mitigate some of the ocean's greatest challenges.

{"date": "March 14, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Secretary of State Rex Tillerson smiles during a meeting March 10 with Iraqi Minister of Oil Jabar Ali al-Luaibi at the State Department in Washington. \n TOKYO >> On his first trip to Asia as top U.S. diplomat, Rex Tillerson wants to forge cooperation with Japan, South Korea and China against the nuclear threat from North Korea and demonstrate \"America First\" does not mean a U.S. diplomatic retreat from the volatile region. \n Tillerson will find shared anxiety at the North's saber-rattling but less agreement about how to deal with it, and unresolved questions about how the United States and China, the world's two largest economies, can manage growing differences. \n Japan and South Korea, which host American troops and are already within range of North Korean missiles, support U.S. efforts to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on Pyongyang. The three navies were also conducting drills Wednesday in seas east of the divided Korean Peninsula and north of Japan to promote interoperability, the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet said. \n But China remains conflicted about how to treat its traditional ally for fear of triggering its collapse. \n Adding to the combustible mix of military tension and the region's historic rivalries is another factor \u2014 uncertainty about U.S. foreign policy under the Trump administration. \n Tillerson, who arrives in Tokyo late Wednesday at the start of his four-day, three-nation tour, could provide some reassurance to nervy allies. He will meet Thursday with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida. \n The former Exxon Mobil CEO has adopted a low profile during his six weeks as secretary of state. The State Department Correspondents' Association expressed disappointment Wednesday that Tillerson was traveling to Asia without a full contingent of the diplomatic press corps or even a pool reporter on his plane \u2014 although it is taking a reporter from the conservative-leaning website, the Independent Journal Review. \n President Donald Trump's rise to power has raised anxiety in Asian capitals. During last year's election campaign, Trump asked whether allies like Japan and South Korea contribute enough for their own defense or should get their own nuclear weapons. He also questioned the fundamentals of four decades of U.S. diplomacy with China. \n Trump has allayed some of those concerns since taking office. Trump hosted Abe at his Florida resort last month, and when Tillerson goes to Beijing Saturday, he is expected to arrange a much-anticipated visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to the U.S. \n \"The U.S. allies, Japan and South Korea, want to know that the United States is going to continue to defend them but also is going to show a certain amount of finesse and diplomatic skills in dealing with China and with North Korea,\" said Robert Dujarric, the director of the Institute of Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University's campus in Tokyo. \n North Korea will be a top priority on all Tillerson's stops. The State Department says Tillerson wants to discuss \"fresh\" approaches. Administration officials say all options are on the table, including military ones, but signs are that the U.S. for starters wants to see rigorous implementation of existing sanctions against Pyongyang. \n There appears to be little desire for now to negotiate with North Korea, unless it commits to denuclearization, which it shows no sign of doing. \n The North conducted two nuclear tests and 24 ballistic missile tests last year, deepening concern in Washington that it could soon develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland \u2014 something Trump has vowed won't happen. \n The U.S. is currently involved in annual military drills in South Korea that North Korea regards as rehearsal for invasion. In a show of defiance, the North fired four ballistic missiles into ocean off Japan last week. The next day, the U.S. began bringing in equipment for the long-planned deployment in South Korea of a missile defense system, known by its acronym, THAAD. \n That has raised tensions with China, which says the THAAD's radar could peer into Chinese territory, weakening its own nuclear deterrent. The U.S. says the system is intended to be used only against North Korea. \n After Tokyo, Tillerson visits South Korea, caught up in political upheaval after last week's ouster of its president, Park Geun-hye, over a corruption scandal. Park had been in lockstep with Washington's efforts to isolate Pyongyang. The favorite to succeed her is Moon Jae-in, a moderate who wants to engage North Korea's government. \n Tillerson's final leg involves meetings with several senior Chinese officials in Beijing. China recently announced it was suspending for the rest of the year coal imports that are an important source of revenue for North Korea. That is to comply with U.N. sanctions aimed at restricting the North's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. \n Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday called for all parties to return to talks. Aid-for-disarmament negotiations have been stalled for years. Last week China's foreign minister warned the U.S., South Korea and North Korea could be heading for conflict. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "North Korea threat looms over U.S. envoy Tillerson's Asia trip"}

{"date": "March 14, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Followers of Christ Church is shown in Oregon City, Ore. in 2011. Gennifer Mitchell, a girl born to members of the church that practices faith healing, died from complications of prematurity, a medical examiner has ruled. \n PORTLAND, Ore. >> Oregon's chief medical examiner said today that an infant born to members of a church that practices faith healing died from complications of prematurity as authorities conducted a criminal investigation into the child's death. \n The baby, Gennifer, was probably \"a couple of months\" premature and her lungs were too underdeveloped to allow her to breath unassisted for long, Dr. Karen Gunson, the chief medical examiner, said in a phone interview. \n Clackamas County sheriff's investigators will present the case to prosecutors but have not finished interviewing witnesses, Sgt. Brian Jensen told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \n She died a few hours after her birth at her grandparents' home on March 5 in Oregon City, where the Followers of Christ Church is based. Her birth was attended by three traditional midwives, family members and other church members, authorities have said. \n No one called 911 when the baby began to have trouble breathing, Jensen said. \n A deputy medical examiner responding to a call about Gennifer's death noticed the surviving twin, Evelyn, was also struggling and called law enforcement, who persuaded the parents to get her medical treatment. \n That baby girl is doing well in the neonatal intensive care unit at Oregon Health & Science University, Gunson said. \n \"Given the fact that her sister is doing pretty well, I suspect she probably would have done pretty well too,\" she said. \"I can't tell you for sure whether she would have survived, but the fact is, there's a twin that is doing well.\" \n Gennifer and Evelyn's parents, 24-year-old Sarah Mitchell and 21-year-old Travis Mitchell, did not return a telephone message seeking comment. Gunson said Sarah Mitchell did not know how far along the pregnancy was because the mother received no prenatal care. \n The church, which operates in Oregon and Idaho, has about 1,000 members and is rooted in Pentecostalism, although it is not affiliated with any denomination. \n Members believe in a literal translation of the Scripture, which states that faith will heal all and if someone dies, it is God's will. The congregation shuns traditional medicine in favor of prayer, the laying on of hands and anointing the sick with oils. \n Several members of the church have been convicted of crimes for failing to seek medical care for their children, including Sarah Mitchell's sister and brother-in-law. Children born to church members have also died in Idaho. \n In 2011, a judge sentenced Sarah Mitchell's sister and brother-in-law to more than six years in prison after a manslaughter conviction in the death of their son, David. The boy was born prematurely and weighed less than 4 pounds. \n An autopsy determined he died of staph pneumonia and complications from a premature birth, including underdeveloped lungs. \n Another couple was convicted that same year of first-degree criminal mistreatment and sentenced to 90 days in jail for not getting medical treatment for their infant daughter, who developed an abnormal mass of blood vessels across her face and left eye. \n A third couple was convicted of criminally negligent homicide and sentenced to 16 months in prison after their 15-year-old son died of a urinary tract blockage. \n Of 78 children buried in the church's cemetery from 1955 to 1998, at least 21 could have been saved by medical intervention, according to a 1998 analysis by The Oregonian. \n In 1999, state lawmakers passed a law that eliminated religious protections in cases of second-degree manslaughter and first- and second-degree criminal mistreatment. \n The law left religious immunity in place for some other crimes but gave prosecutors more options for charging parents in such cases. \n Repeated attempts to pass bills in Idaho to loosen religious exemptions in such cases have failed. \n A vigil for the dead children of the church's members is planned by former church member Linda Martin at the Idaho statehouse on March 21. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Autopsy: Infant born to faith healer died from prematurity"}

Boston ended up with 6.6 inches of snow, less than the predictions of up to a foot. \n It was easily the biggest storm in a merciful winter that had mostly spared the Northeast, and many weren't happy about it. \n \"It's horrible,\" said retired gumball-machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. \"I thought winter was out of here. \u2026 It's a real kick in the rear.\" \n While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. \n In East Hartford, Connecticut an elderly man died after being struck by a snow plow truck. \n The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. \n Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before the storm switched over mostly to sleet; forecasters had predicted a foot or more. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow in many areas, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an \"underperformer.\" But officials warned of dangerous ice. \n Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area got over 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches. \n The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. February, too, was remarkably warm. \n \"The winters seem to be upside down now. January and February are nice and then March and April seem to be more wintry than they were in the past,\" said Bob Clifford, who ventured out on an early morning grocery run for his family in Altamont, near Albany, New York. \n His advice: \"Just hide inside. Hibernate.\" \n In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. \n A few days ago, workers on Washington's National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. \n \"Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared,\" said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \"The cherry blossoms, they're right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen.\" \n Kelly Erskine, a 28-year-old coffee shop manager from Whitman, Massachusetts, about 25 miles south of Boston, made it almost all the way through the winter without a shovel. She went to Walmart on this morning to get one. \n \"I live in an apartment complex and they usually take care of the shoveling, but they sent a letter to us and said, 'Expect a lot of snow.' I knew from the letter that I'd have to go out and buy a shovel,\" she said. \n As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like \"life-threatening\" and urged people to \"shelter in place,\" language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. \n Government meteorologists realized by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm wasn't going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they didn't change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Center. \n In Pennsylvania, snowplows and state troopers escorted a 23-month-old child in need of a heart transplant 80 miles between hospitals. Gov. Tom Wolf said the youngster made the trip safely. \n In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. \n And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. \n \"We want to thank our cowboy officer,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said. \n The storm coincided with New Hampshire's Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. \n Some towns postponed because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions to make it to the polls. \n \"You know, they're hardy New Englanders, and they're coming to vote,\" said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. \n The flight cancellations included nearly 3,300 in the New York City area alone. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at airports. \n Laura and Matthew Balderstone of West Yorkshire, England, intended to spend their honeymoon in Florida but found themselves stuck at the Newark, New Jersey, airport and couldn't find a hotel room. \n \"It's better safe than sorry, especially flying.

Bruce Loveless. \n SAN DIEGO >> A retired Navy admiral and eight other current and former military officers were bribed with sex, trips and other lavish perks, according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday in a burgeoning scandal involving a Malaysian defense contractor nicknamed \"Fat Leonard.\" \n Retired Adm. Bruce Loveless, 53, and the others were accused of accepting the services of prostitutes and other bribes from Leonard Francis in exchange for classified information that helped his company, Glenn Defense Marine Asia. \n The indictment says Francis once rented the MacArthur Suite at the Manila Hotel, where memorabilia of Gen. Douglas MacArthur was used for sex acts with prostitutes. \n Francis also is accused of paying for meals that cost as much as $12,000 and included foie gras, ox tail soup, expensive wine and cigars worth $2,000 a box. \n Prosecutors say the defendants called themselves the Lion's King Harem, Brotherhood, Wolfpack and other names as they worked to recruit others for the scheme. They were accused of using fake names and foreign email service providers to cover their tracks. \n Prosecutors say Francis, whose nickname comes from his wide girth, bilked the Navy out of nearly $35 million \u2014 largely by overcharging for his company's services supplying Navy ships in the Pacific with food, water, fuel and other necessities. \n Navy officers provided classified information to Francis that helped him beat out the competition and in some instances commanders steered ships to ports in the Pacific where his company could charge fake tariffs and fees, prosecutors said. \n It was the latest indictment in the three-year-old case that has produced charges against more than 20 former or current Navy officials and marks one of the worst Navy corruption scandals in history. Loveless is the second admiral charged in the case. It is extremely rare for an admiral to face criminal proceedings. \n Adm. John Richardson, the Navy's top officer, vowed to repair damage caused by the scandal. \n \"This behavior is inconsistent with our standards and the expectations the nation has for us as military professionals,\" he said. \"It damages the trust that the nation places in us, and is an embarrassment to the Navy.\" \n Loveless made no substantive comments during a brief hearing hours after his arrest at his Coronado home near San Diego. Magistrate Judge Mitchell Dembin entered a not guilty plea on his behalf and ordered him released without bail. He did not yet have an attorney, \n In the military, Loveless was responsible for collecting foreign intelligence for the Navy's Seventh Fleet, Patrick Hovakimian, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the judge. \n \"Far from doing that, over the course of many years, this defendant participated in wild sex parties,\" Hovakimian said. \"He has shown callous disregard for his duties.\" \n The judge also entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Enrico DeGuzman, a former Marine colonel and Honolulu resident, and allowed him to remain free. His attorney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \n Five defendants were arrested Tuesday in Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado and Virginia. None had attorneys listed in court documents. \n \"This is a fleecing and betrayal of the United States Navy in epic proportions, and it was allegedly carried out by the Navy's highest-ranking officers,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Alana W. Robinson. \n She added that \"the alleged conduct amounts to a staggering degree of corruption by the most prominent leaders of the Seventh Fleet \u2014 the largest fleet in the U.S. Navy \u2014 actively worked together as a team to trade secrets for sex, serving the interests of a greedy foreign defense contractor, and not those of their own country.\" \n Francis has pleaded guilty to fraud and is awaiting sentencing. \n Twenty of the defendants are current or former U.S. Navy officials and five are executives of the Singapore-based company of Francis. \n To date, 13 have pleaded guilty, including another admiral who was sentenced in June and is believed to be the first active-duty Naval flag officer charged in federal court.

Confrontations between moose and Alaska residents are leading wildlife officials to warn people to give the animals some distance. \n ANCHORAGE, Alaska >> Alaska wildlife officials warned people today to keep their distance from grumpy moose after two close calls this past weekend. \n One of the animals walked up behind a woman tending chickens in the city of Homer on Sunday and started eating chicken food from a bucket she carried. When she turned, the startled moose kicked her. \n \"It pulled its nose out of the bucket, looked at her, reared back and kicked her right in the noggin',\" said Jason Herreman, assistant area biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. \n Another agitated moose twice charged skiers in a lift line Saturday at Alyeska Resort, a downhill ski venue in the resort town of Girdwood, said Ken Marsh, spokesman for Fish and Game. No one was hurt, but authorities advised resort officials to shoot and kill the animal Sunday to remove the threat to skiers. \n \"Not all moose are looking for a fight right now, but they do tend to get a little cranky this time of year,\" Marsh said. \n In summer, moose eat lush leaves but turn to twigs and other woody material in winter, which are not as nutritious, biologists said. The animals are tired and ready for spring, Marsh said. \n Most Alaska residents know better than to get near a moose in mating season or between a moose mother and a new calf, but they generally regard the animals as docile. Moose are a common sight along roads and even streets of Anchorage, the state's largest city. \n At the ski resort, the moose was positioned at a blind corner. Skiers had to pass the animal to get to the lift line. As more skiers appeared, the moose became increasingly agitated and charged people twice. \n \"It sort of ended up resembling the running of the bulls in Pamplona,\" Marsh said. \n Feeding moose can trigger attacks, and the woman who was kicked in the head unintentionally was doing just that, Herreman said. \n She had been allowing her chickens to roam and would periodically throw them feed, not knowing that a moose born last year had been chasing the chickens off to eat the feed, he said. \n The young moose defended itself as it would against a wolf: \"They rear up on their back legs a little bit and then kick out with their front ones,\" Herreman said. \n The woman had a welt on her head afterward. A blow to the head from a large cow could have been fatal, he said. Adult moose range from 800-pound small cows to 1,600-pound large adult bulls. \n \"Now she's keeping her chickens in the coop and feeding them in the coop,\" Herreman said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Alaska residents warned to give grumpy moose their space"}

The city's internal disciplinary charges accused Hollinger of failing to tell the dispatcher who sent the officers to the rec center that the man who called 911 about \"a guy\" pointing a gun at people also said it could be a juvenile and the gun might be a \"fake.\" \n That omission was cited by former Cuyahoga County prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty as a crucial mistake that impacted how officers Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback responded. Loehmann shot and killed Tamir less than two seconds after they arrived. \n McGinty said the shooting might have been avoided if the information from the 911 caller had been properly relayed to the officers. \n Cleveland safety director Michael McGrath handed down a two-day suspension for police officer William Cunningham, who was working off duty without permission at the rec center, in a disciplinary letter dated March 10. \n A message seeking comment on behalf of Hollinger and Cunningham was left for the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association. \n Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, said in a statement issued Tuesday by her attorney that Hollinger's eight-day suspension was \"unacceptable.\" \n \"Eight days for gross negligence resulting in the death of a 12-year-old boy,\" Rice's attorney, Subodh Chandra, said in the statement. \"How pathetic is that?\" \n Chandra said that if that is the best \"that system can offer, then the system is broken.\" \n Loehmann and Garmback, who weren't criminally charged, face possible discipline by McGrath that could result in them being dismissed from the Cleveland police department. \n Loehmann's disciplinary letter cites his failure to disclose in an application that the Independence Police Department, where he worked for six months, had placed a letter in his personnel file saying he had an \"inability to emotionally function.\" Garmback's disciplinary letter accuses him of driving too close to Tamir and failing to report the time of arrival at the recreation center. \n Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association president Steve Loomis has said the officers did nothing wrong the day Tamir was shot.

{"date": "March 14, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, right, and right-wing populist leader Geert Wilders, talk prior to a national televised debate, the first head-to-head meeting of the two political party leaders since the start of the election campaign, at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Netherlands, Monday. \n THE HAGUE, Netherlands >> Amid unprecedented international attention, the Dutch go to the polls Wednesday in a parliamentary election that is seen as a bellwether for the future of populism in a year of crucial votes in Europe. \n With the anti-Islam, far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders running just behind two-term right-wing Prime Minister Mark Rutte in polls, the Dutch vote could give an indication of whether the tide of populism that swept Britain toward the European Union exit door and Donald Trump into the White house has peaked. \n The election in the Netherlands comes ahead of polls in France and Germany over the next half year, when right-wing nationalists will also be key players. \n During a final election debate among leaders from the parties vying for seats and control of the government, Wilders piled on the anti-Islam invective while Rutte sought to underscore his leadership experience. \n None of the party representatives made a critical faux-pas or scored points that should alter campaign dynamics established over months. \n The final days of campaigning have been overshadowed by a diplomatic crisis between the Dutch and Turkish governments over the refusal of the Netherlands to let two Turkish government ministers address rallies about a constitutional reform referendum next month that could give President Recep Tayyip Erdogan more powers. It showed Rutte as refusing to bow to pressure from outside, a stance which has widespread backing in the nation. \n \"It is my task to keep the nation safe and stable and deal with these kind of people,\" said Rutte. \n Rutte has driven through unpopular austerity measures over the last four years, but as the election approaches the Dutch economic recovery has gathered pace and unemployment has fallen fast. So the prime minister is urging voters to stick with him. \n Rutte is casting the election as a two-horse race between his VVD party and the Party for Freedom led by Wilders. The choice, Rutte says, is simple: Chaos or continuity. \n The prime minister says Wilders' one-page manifesto \u2014 which pledges to take the Netherlands out of the European Union, shut its borders to all immigrants from Muslim countries, shutter mosques and ban the Quran \u2014 would lead to chaos. Wilders fired back in a debate Monday that it would allow the Dutch \"to become the boss in our own country again.\" \n \"The Netherlands does not belong to all of us,\" he proclaimed. \n Wilders also is tapping into discontent among voters who say they are not benefiting from economic recovery in this nation of 17 million. \n Ruud van Dongen, a 49-year-old chauffeur, said he would vote for Wilders' PVV as a protest against more flexible contracts that mean fewer people have jobs for life which used to be a staple in Dutch welfare state. \n \"Do you know what's the deal with jobs? They last for two years and then people are on the street,\" he said. \n Even if Wilders wins the popular vote Wednesday, the Dutch system of proportional representation for the 150-seat lower house of Parliament will likely keep him out of government since all mainstream parties, with Rutte leading the way, have rejected working with Wilders in a coalition. \n \"Wilders will play no role in the formation of a government,\" said Amsterdam Free University political analyst Andre Krouwel. \"But Wilders plays a major role in the tone and content of the campaign and Wilders \u2014 even if he doesn't win a single seat \u2014 has already won because the two biggest right-wing parties have taken over his policies.\" \n While Rutte's ruling VVD party holds a narrow lead over Wilders in most polls, other parties are also still in the running and well placed to play a role in forming the next coalition. \n Leader Sybrand Buma has moved the traditionally center-right Christian Democrats to the right to counter Wilders, while the pro-European Union liberal democrats D66 are also on track to win more seats.

He claimed he was under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and said his attorneys had advised against it \u2014 though experts and IRS officials said such audits don't bar taxpayers from releasing their returns. \n The White House pushed back pre-emptively today, saying that publishing those returns would be illegal. \n \"You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago,\" the White House said in a statement. \n The unauthorized release or publishing of federal tax returns is a criminal offense, punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 and up to five years in jail. But Maddow argued that MSNBC was exercising its First Amendment right to publish information in the public interest. \n Based on the documents obtained by Johnston, Trump paid $36.5 million in taxes on $153 million in income, for an effective tax rate of around 24 percent. That percentage is higher than the roughly 10 percent the average American pays each year \u2014 but below the 27.4 percent that taxpayers earning 1 million dollars a year average, according to data from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \n Trump's tax returns spotlight the role of the Alternative Minimum Tax, which was established nearly five decades ago to prevent the wealthy from using deductions and clever accounting to largely avoid paying taxes. \n The AMT is a separate gauge of tax liability that, according to critics, has ensnared more middle-class people than intended, raising what they owe the federal government each year. It requires many taxpayers to calculate their taxes twice \u2014 once under the rules for regular income tax and then again under AMT \u2014 and then pay the higher amount. \n Though opponents of the AMT have focused on the growing number of upper-middle-class earners who pay the tax, Trump's 2005 disclosure shows it prevented him from avoiding most of the taxes he paid in 2005. If not for the AMT, Trump's effective tax rate would have been just 3.5 percent. \n Trump, according to his campaign website, has said he wanted to eliminate the tax, which is expected to bring in more than $350 billion in revenues from 2016 to 2025. \n Trump long insisted the American public wasn't interested in his returns and said little could be learned from them. But Trump's full returns would contain key details about things like his charitable giving, his income sources, the type of deductions he claimed, how much he earned from his assets and what strategies Trump used to reduce his tax bill. \n The issue was a major point of attack from his election rival Hillary Clinton, who suggested Trump had something to hide. \n The White House has not said whether or not the president plans to release his returns while he's in office. More than 1 million people have signed a White House petition urging the president to release them. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "White House says Trump paid $38m in taxes, made $150m in '05"}

{"date": "March 14, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A federal police officer walked in an area known as Colinas de Santa Fe on the outskirts of Veracruz, Mexico, in April 2015. More than 250 skulls were found in early 2017 in what appears to be a drug cartel mass burial ground in this wooded area on the outskirts of the city of Veracruz, prosecutors said today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Special investigators guarded bodies, in April 2015, found in mass graves in a wooded area known as Colinas de Santa Fe on the outskirts of Veracruz, Mexico. \n MEXICO CITY >> More than 250 skulls have been found over the last several months in what appears to be a drug cartel mass burial ground on the outskirts of the city of Veracruz, prosecutors said today. \n Veracruz state's top prosecutor, Jorge Winckler, said the clandestine pits appeared to contain remains of cartel victims killed years ago. \n The news came as no surprise to Lucia Diaz, one of the mothers of people who have disappeared whose group is known as Colectivo Solecito. \n The mothers pushed authorities to investigate the fields where the skulls were found because they suspected more than a year ago that the wooded area known as Colinas de Santa Fe was a secret burial ground. \n In the face of official inaction, the activists themselves went to the fields starting in August 2016, sinking rods into the ground to detect the telltale odor of decomposition, and then digging. \n When they find what they believe are burial pits, they alert authorities, who carry out the final excavations. \n \"We dig holes, but we try not to touch the remains,\" Diaz said, because DNA may be the only hope of identifying the dead and touching the bones might contaminate them. \n So far, Diaz said, searchers have found about 125 pits that contain about 253 bodies. Nobody knows when the burials began, but Diaz said some were quite recent. \n \"Some of the bodies had a lot of connective tissue. You could see an ear, or recognize part of a face,\" she said. \n Winckler, in the first official recognition, seemed to say the burials occurred before the new state administration took office in December. \n \"For many years, the drug cartels disappeared people and the authorities were complacent,\" Winckler said In an interview with the Televisa network, in apparent reference to the administration of fugitive former Gov. Javier Duarte and his predecessors. \n Duarte resigned as governor two months before his term ended last year and disappeared. He faces charges that include money laundering and organized crime and officials have accused him thoroughly looting state coffers. Winckler said that resources needed for DNA tests in criminal investigation had vanished, leaving officials to depend on help from the federal government and groups such as the Red Cross. \n So far only two sets of remains \u2014 a police detective and his assistant \u2014 have been identified, Winckler said. \n The prosecutor said excavations have covered only a third of the lot where the skulls were found, and more people may be buried there. \n \"I cannot imagine how many more people are illegally buried there,\" Winckler said, noting the state has reports of about 2,400 people who are still missing. \n \"Veracruz is an enormous mass grave,\" he said. \n Diaz also said \"it is impossible to say\" how many people are buried, and isn't sure the burial ground wasn't used recently. \"We don't know when it stopped, or if it stopped.\" She said searchers found eight bodies just 10 days ago. \n Her group has criticized state authorities both past and present for doing little to try to find or identify the state's missing people, many of whom were kidnapped and never heard from again. \n The state had long been dominated by the ferocious Zetas cartel. But the Jalisco New Generation cartel began moving in around 2011, sparking bloody turf battles. \n Drug cartels in other parts of Mexico have deposited victims' bodies in mass graves before. In the northern state of Durango, authorities found more than 300 bodies in a clandestine mass grave in the state capital in excavations starting in April 2011. Those burial pits were excavated in part with the use of backhoes. \n More than 250 bodies were discovered in April 2011 in burial pits in the town of San Fernando, in Tamaulipas state, close to the U.S. border. \n Drug gangs in some places in Mexico have taken to burning or dissolving their victims' bodies in corrosive substances in order to avoid discovery. \n Diaz joined the effort after her own son, Guillermo Lagunes Diaz, was kidnapped from his home in 2013. No trace of him was ever found. \"He was kidnapped. Beyond that I know nothing,\" Diaz said. Despite pleading with state officials, they were slow to investigate the case and didn't bother even to track his phone, which might have helped locate him. \n But she and other mothers and volunteers in Colectivo Solecito have never flagged in the search, at least for the bodies of their loved ones. \n \"We mothers say they are still alive, until we find out otherwise,\" Diaz said. But she suspects that corrupt police may have been involved in the disappearances; several groups of police in the state have been arrested for kidnapping people and turning them over to the drug gangs. \n \"It is either the criminals, or police, or both\" that dumped the bodies in Colinas de Santa Fe, she said. \"In Veracruz, it's kind of hard to tell the difference.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mexican official: 250 skulls found in clandestine graves"}

The White House and its allies have stepped up attacks on a foe typically associated with fragile democracies, military coups and spy thrillers. \n NEW YORK >> The White House and its allies are stepping up their attacks on a foe typically associated with fragile democracies, military coups and spy thrillers. \n The \"deep state,\" an alleged shadowy network of powerful entrenched federal and military interests, has increasingly become the focus of Republicans who accuse such forces of trying to undermine the new president. \n Though senior White House staff members don't use the exact label, the notion behind it has taken hold. President Donald Trump claims his predecessor tapped his phone and America's intelligence agencies have conspired to leak harmful information to embarrass him. His chief strategist has vowed to dismantle the permanent Washington \"administrative state.\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer says \"people that burrowed into government\" are trying to sabotage the president. \n To Trump's critics, these assertions come off as paranoid fear of a non-existent shadow government and an effort to create a scapegoat for the White House's struggles. But to Trump's supporters, this represents an overdue challenge to an elite ruling class concerned only with maintaining its own grasp on power. \n \"Of course, the deep state exists. There's a permanent state of massive bureaucracies that do whatever they want and set up deliberate leaks to attack the president,\" said Newt Gingrich, a Trump confidant. \"This is what the deep state does: They create a lie, spread a lie, fail to check the lie and then deny that they were behind the lie.\" \n Historians believe the concept of the \"deep state\" comes from Turkey, where the term \"derin devlet\" meant a clandestine network, including intelligence and military officers, which protected the ruling class in the 1920s. Similar ideas have taken hold in Egypt, where the military has allied itself with powerful business interests, and Pakistan, with its robust intelligence service. \n In its current use, the concept has been twisted and broadened, encompassing a resistant bureaucracy and a regulatory regime rather than foreshadowing some sort of military intervention. Chief Trump strategist Steve Bannon has offered the loudest warnings about the opposition the president is facing from the deep state. \n In his only public speech since the election, Bannon told a conservative group that the White House's goal was the \"deconstruction of the administrative state,\" a reflection of his belief that the massive federal government, with its burdensome regulations, does more to hinder than uplift citizens. It also echoes Bannon's oft-stated worldview, frequently on display at his former news site Breitbart, that a global power structure \u2014 including government institutions \u2014 has rigged the economy. \n Gingrich, who says he has discussed the deep state with Bannon, likens its dangers to the plotline of the new season of \"Homeland,\" in which a conspiracy that includes career intelligence officers tries to subvert a president-elect. \n \"They are fighting to keep hold of their power,\" said the former House speaker, who asked a reporter not to spoil the two Homeland episodes of the season he has yet to see. \n The sprawling federal government, including its intelligence agencies, has thousands of employees who predate Trump, a mix of career staffers and those appointed by President Barack Obama whose replacements have yet to be named. Some have offered leaks, including sensitive documents, to reporters that provide a critical take on the president. \n Trump has insinuated that those holdovers are working against him \u2014 even suggesting that leaks from intelligences agencies were reminiscent of smear tactics utilized by Nazi Germany. \n Asked if the White House believes there is \"a deep state that's actively working to undermine the president,\" Spicer said recently, \"I don't think it should come as any surprise that there are people that burrowed into government during eight years of the last administration and, you know, may have believed in that agenda and want to continue to seek it.\" \n Sean Hannity, a Fox News host who has close to ties to Trump, opened a show last week by claiming there are \"deep state Obama holdover government bureaucrats who are hell-bent on destroying this president.\" \n \"It's time for the Trump administration to begin to purge these saboteurs before it's too late,\" Hannity said. \n Trump allies note that is customary for presidents to install loyalists and point to Abraham Lincoln's move to push out Southerners from the federal bureaucracy on the eve of the Civil War. The government has also gone through previous spasms of internal suspicion, most notably in the 1950s when Sen. Joseph McCarthy led a witch hunt to root out what he claimed were communist sympathizers supposedly trying to undermine Washington from within. \n Experts warn that Trump's attacks could lead to faster erosion of faith in government institutions. \n \"The more he talks about a deep state cabal against him, the less trust people will have in government,\" said Matthew Hale, a political science professor at Seton Hall University. \"It's deleterious to democracy.\" \n Some of Trump's allies have, without evidence, seized upon Obama's decision to remain in Washington after leaving office as evidence that he is leading the resistance. The former president has said he is staying in the nation's capital until his youngest daughter finishes school. \n \"He's only there for one purpose and one purpose only and that is to run a shadow government that is totally going to upset the new agenda,\" said Rep. Mark Kelly, a Pennsylvania Republican, at an event in his home district last week. His office later walked back the remarks. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump White House sees 'deep state' behind leaks, opposition"}

Germany's justice minister proposed fines of up to $53 million for social networking sites that fail to swiftly remove illegal content, such as hate speech or defamatory \"fake news.\" \n BERLIN >> Germany's justice minister is proposing fines of up to $53 million for social networking sites that fail to swiftly remove illegal content, such as hate speech or defamatory \"fake news.\" \n The plan announced today marks a further step in Germany's attempt to impose its strict domestic laws against incitement on the free-wheeling world of online chatter. \n Justice Minister Heiko Maas, a member of the center-left Social Democratic Party, said social media companies had already taken voluntary steps to crack down on hate crimes that have resulted in improvements. \n \"This isn't sufficient yet,\" Maas said, citing research that he said showed Twitter deletes just 1 percent of illegal content flagged by users, while Facebook deletes 39 percent. \n The proposal would require companies to provide a round-the-clock service for users to flag illegal content, which would have to be removed by the site within seven days. All copies of the content would also have to be deleted and social media companies would need to publish a quarterly report detailing how they have dealt with such material. \n Sites would also have to nominate a person responsible for handling complaints, who could face fines of up to 5 million euros personally if the company fails to abide by mandatory standards. \n Maas said the measures, which will become part of a bill to be put before Parliament, wouldn't restrict freedom of speech that already exists in Germany and there were no plans to create a \"truth commission\" against so-called fake news. \n But he noted that fake news could constitute illegal content \"if it constitutes slander, defamation or libel.\" \n Facebook said it would examine the proposal. \"We have clear rules against hate speech and are working hard to remove such content from our platform,\" the company said in a statement, adding it was working with the government to tackle the issue. \n However, Facebook said tests it commissioned showed higher rates of removal than those cited by Maas. Facebook also said it had taken measures to train staff in how to deal with the legal situation in Germany and expects to have 700 people in Berlin examining flagged content by the end of the year. \n Twitter declined to comment directly on the proposal, but noted that it had taken a number of measures in recent months designed to prevent abuse and allow users to filter unwanted content. \n Germany poses a particular problem for U.S.-owned social networking sites accustomed to American standards of free speech. Due to its Nazi past, Germany bans public Holocaust denial and any overt promotion of racism. The issue has come to the fore amid the recent influx of migrants to Germany, which has sparked a backlash among some Germans including a rise in online vitriol. \n Robert Singer, the chief executive of the World Jewish Congress, praised the Maas proposal. \n \"The internet is awash with hateful content, a lot of which is incitement to hatred and violence. Currently, it often takes providers far too long to remove or block such content,\" he said. \"It's important that the internet companies and politicians take this problem seriously, and we commend Germany for taking the lead on this. \n The proposal won't affect media outlets already covered by other German laws, said Philip Scholz, a Justice Ministry spokesman.

Democrats are assailing Republicans for \"attacking the messenger,\" seeming to forget all the times they assailed the budget office themselves. \n The Congressional Budget Office is respected for nonpartisan rigor in its estimates of the costs and impacts of legislation. But no projection is infallible, particularly when it comes to large, complex programs. For example, the agency in 2010 overstated the number of people expected to buy insurance under President Barack Obama's health care law, misjudging how many would join because of the threat of tax penalties. \n Yet, CBO's neutrality has been valued by both parties \u2014 though not always at the same time. It depends whose ox is being gored. \n A look at statements in the debate and how they compare with the CBO's estimates and the underlying facts: \n In the first year, the biggest reason more people are uninsured would be repeal of penalties Barack Obama's law imposes on those deemed able to afford insurance but who don't buy it. Still others would decide to forgo coverage because of higher premiums or do without Medicaid. \n In following years the main reason for a drop in the number of insured would be that the Republican bill scales back Medicaid for low-income Americans. Altogether, CBO estimates 52 million people would be uninsured by 2026, a vast distance from \"insurance for everybody.\" \n \"The Congressional Budget Office never gives us any credit,\" President Obama said in 2009 when the CBO pointed to the expense of Democratic health overhaul proposals. Complained Pelosi at the time: \"The CBO will always give you the worst-case scenario.\" \n Again in 2014, Pelosi did not consider CBO's numbers \"elegant,\" or correct, when they forecast job losses from a Democratic effort to raise the minimum wage. She accused the CBO of making arguments that \"contradict the consensus among hundreds of America's top economists\" and said it \"ignored new perspectives in the wide array of analysis on the minimum wage.\" \n Other evidence points to tangible benefits from Obama's coverage expansion. For example, government researchers have found fewer Americans struggling to pay medical bills. A 2015 report found that problems with medical bills had declined for the fourth year in a row. Most of the improvement was among low-income people and those with government coverage, and it coincided with the ACA's big coverage expansion. \n Associated Press writers Jim Drinkard and Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.  \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fact check: Both sides loose with facts in health debate"}

Diane Black, R-Tenn., House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Calif., and House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., participated in a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Friday, to discuss progress on the GOP effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as \"Obamacare.\" \n WASHINGTON >> The White House and Republican leaders in Congress scrambled today to shore up support for their health care bill as critics went on the attack over new estimates that 14 million people would lose insurance coverage in the first year alone. \n The findings from the Congressional Budget Office handed fresh ammunition to Democratic opponents of the GOP drive to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama's health care law. The new figures, which estimated that 24 million people would lose insurance over a decade, also appeared to strengthen pockets of conservative resistance to the bill and rattle nerves among rank-and-file Republicans. \n With Washington blanketed in a rare March snow, congressional GOP leaders and top aides to President Donald Trump got to work trying to salvage the legislation, which they hope to push through the House next week and the Senate the week after that. Trump has promised to sign the bill, fulfilling seven years of GOP promises to undo \"Obamacare,\" even though the legislation breaks the president's own past promises to safeguard Medicaid and provide health insurance for all. \n \"We think we've created a system that saves money and allows more people to get affordable health care,\" Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, said this morning on MSNBC. Mulvaney disputed the CBO findings about how many people would lose coverage, while highlighting the agency's conclusions that the GOP bill would reduce the deficit by $337 billion over a decade and lower insurance premiums by around 10 percent starting in 2020. The premiums reduction would come only after they sharply rose in 2018 and 2019. \n The GOP legislation would use tax credits to help consumers buy health coverage, expand health savings accounts, phase out an expansion of Medicaid and cap that program for the future, end some requirements for health plans under Obama's law, and scrap a number of taxes. \n Republicans say they are not trying to achieve the widespread coverage that Democrats aimed for by including penalties in the Affordable Care Act for people who weren't covered. Instead Republicans would eliminate that mandate, and their buzzword is \"access\" to affordable coverage for people who want it. \n \"You sit there and talk about coverage, but coverage is not the end. People don't get better with coverage,\" Mulvaney said. \n Angry Democrats, united against the GOP bill, scoffed at such claims. \n \"Trumpcare would be a nightmare for the American people,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said at a news conference at the Capitol with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. \n Criticism also is coming from conservatives who threaten to foil GOP leaders' plans of swift passage of the legislation before Easter, when Congress is scheduled to go on a two-week recess that could expose lawmakers to town hall fury. \n Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, a member of the Freedom Caucus and one of the most outspoken critics of the bill, reiterated today that he and other conservatives have been working with the White House on changes to the Republican health plan. They have dubbed the bill \"Obamacare Lite,\" saying it doesn't fully repeal the Affordable Care Act and installs a new but similar system of tax credits that they deride as a new entitlement. \n \"This bill doesn't unite Republicans. This bill doesn't bring down the cost of premiums,\" Jordan told Fox News' \"Fox and Friends.\" \"I don't think it's going to accomplish what we told the voters we were going to do.\" \n House Speaker Paul Ryan has confidently predicted the bill will have the support needed to pass on the House floor next week, but Mulvaney seemed to suggest more work is needed to get to the 216 votes that will be required. He said negotiations are still going on as conservative lawmakers push changes to the bill. \n \"I don't think we're in a position to start counting votes until we know what that bill looks like,\" Mulvaney said. \n The CBO is widely respected but doesn't have a perfect track record, including estimating that Obamacare would cover more people than it has. The office's estimates are relied upon by politicians from all sides, though often attacked when unfavorable. \n Senators are just beginning to absorb the CBO findings and were to meet at the Capitol today with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. \n \"It's awful. It has to be a concern,\" Sen.

{"date": "March 14, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert B. Neller, left, and Acting Navy Secretary Sean J. Stackley, waited to testify on Capitol Hill in Washington, today, before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the investigation of nude photographs of female Marines and other women that were shared on the Facebook page \"Marines United.\" \n WASHINGTON >> Declaring \"enough is enough,\" the top U.S. Marine today told senators that he intends to fix the problem that led to current and former Corps members sharing nude photos of female Marines online and making lewd or threatening comments about them. \n But angry and skeptical members of the Senate Armed Services Committee demanded more, saying the military hasn't done enough to combat sexual assault and harassment despite years of complaints and problems. \n Gen. Robert Neller, the Marine Corps commandant, vowed to hold Marines accountable through whatever legal and other means possible. He acknowledged the scandal may hurt female recruiting and that changes have to be made in the Marine Corps culture, where some male Marines don't accept women in the ranks. \n To some senators, his testimony rang hollow. He faced a particularly fierce barrage of questions and criticism from the women members of the panel. \n \"This committee has heard these kinds of statements before,\" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat. \n \"It's hard to believe something is really going to be done,\" she said. \"Why should we believe it's going to be different this time than it has in the past?\" \n Fellow Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said accusations of online exploitation of women by Marines came up in 2013, and victims have come forward. \n \"When you say to us it's got to be different, that rings hollow,\" Gillibrand said. \"If we can't crack Facebook, how are we supposed to be able to confront Russian aggression and cyber-hacking throughout our military? It is a serious problem when we have members of our military denigrating female Marines who will give their life for this country in the way they have with no response from leadership.\" \n Neller and the acting Navy secretary, Sean Stackley, said the Naval Criminal Investigative Service is looking into the matter. While some women victims have come forward, they said they need more to do so. \n Stackley said an NCIS tip line has gotten more than 50 calls, and officials are finding and investigating more similar websites. \n \"This is a bell-ringer,\" said Stackley. \"We're not going to go backwards.\" \n He also noted the legal hurdles that make it more difficult to prosecute some online behavior that may be protected by certain privacy laws or as free speech. Questions remain, he and Neller said, about what can be done if someone voluntarily provides a nude photo or posts one online. \n Lawmakers suggested possibly beefing up laws or regulations to specifically make what is called \"revenge pornography\" illegal under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. \n Neller also said that while regulations can prohibit Marines from visiting certain places \u2014 such as strip clubs or other such locales \u2014 there are no similar restrictions on websites. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Marine leaders vow to combat online nude photo sharing"}

Jessica Farrar, D-Houston, spoke during an April 2009 news conference in Austin, Texas. \n AUSTIN, Texas >> A Texas lawmaker is making a point about legislation that restricts women's access to health care and abortions by proposing to fine men $100 when they masturbate. \n The 11th term Democrat said that her bill mimics how a woman seeking an abortion is forced by Texas law to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound, which \"has nothing to do with her health care.\" \n While the proposal was meant to mock Republicans, she said it also highlights the obstacles women face \"that were placed there by legislatures making it very difficult for them to access health care.\" \n Farrar today said an unrelated bill she is authoring that came up for a floor vote was being targeted by Republicans in retribution for her satirical measure. She said she was warned before debate that a group of about 50 Republican men were \"going to give you a hard time, they're going to ride you.\" She declined to identify who provided the warning. \n The bill narrowly passed on a 75-70 vote, a margin that surprised Farrar who said an identical proposal only garnered seven votes against it in 2015. \n \"This was a retaliatory event,\" she said. \"I will continue to speak out.\" \n Republican Rep. Tan Parker, chairman of the House GOP caucus, said the caucus' policy committee decided Tuesday to take a neutral position on the bill.

{"date": "March 14, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Sept. 24, 2016 file photo, Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi addresses the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters. \n KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia >> Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said Tuesday that the body of Kim Jong Nam, who was killed last month, has been embalmed to better preserve it, and that about 50 North Koreans whose work permits have expired will be deported. \n News of the deportations was a surprise as the countries have barred each other's citizen from leaving amid a diplomatic standoff over Kim's death. \n Malaysian authorities say the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was killed Feb. 13 after two women smeared his face with the banned VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur's airport. North Korea \u2014 widely suspected of being behind the attack \u2014 rejects the findings. \n Zahid said Kim's body was taken out of the hospital morgue at a Kuala Lumpur hospital for the embalmment procedure and has been returned. He declined to say when it was done. \n \"As it is kept in the mortuary, the body might decompose, so we did this to preserve the body,\" he told reporters in Parliament. \n Health officials have said Kim's relatives will be given two to three weeks to claim his body before deciding what to do with it. \n North Korea has demanded the body back and objected when Malaysia conducted an autopsy. Pyongyang also has refused to acknowledge that Kim Jong Nam was the victim and has referred to him as Kim Chol, the name on the passport Kim was carrying when he was attacked in a crowded airport terminal. \n Malaysian police said Friday that Kim Chol and Kim Jong Nam were the same person, but refused to say how they confirmed that. \n Relations between the countries have deteriorated sharply since Kim's death, with each expelling the other's ambassador. Last Tuesday, North Korea blocked all Malaysians from leaving the country until a \"fair settlement\" of the case was reached. Malaysia then barred North Koreans from exiting its soil. \n Zahid, who earlier said negotiations were ongoing, said Tuesday that about 50 North Koreans detained in eastern Sarawak state for overstaying their work permits will be sent back to Pyongyang soon. He didn't give details nor say why they would be deported amid the exit ban. \n There are nine Malaysians in North Korea \u2014 three embassy staff members and their family members. About 315 North Koreans are in Malaysia, according to Malaysian officials. \n Both countries also scrapped visa-free travel for each other's citizens. \n Although Malaysia has never directly accused North Korea of being behind the attack, many speculate that Pyongyang must have orchestrated it. Experts say the VX nerve agent used to kill Kim was almost certainly produced in a sophisticated state weapons laboratory, and North Korea is widely believed to possess large quantities of chemical weapon. \n Four of the seven North Korean suspects being sought by Malaysia are believed to have left the country the day Kim was killed. Police say the other three, including a North Korean diplomat, are believed to be in the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. \n North Korea on Monday sought to shift the blame for Kim's death to the United States and South Korea. \n North Korea's deputy U.N. ambassador, Kim In Ryong, said in New York that \"from A to Z, this case is the product of reckless moves of the United States and South Korean authorities,\" who he said are trying to tarnish the North's image and bringing down its social system. \n The ambassador said the U.S. is one of the few countries that can manufacture VX, and has also stockpiled chemical weapons in South Korea, which could have provided the chemical agent for the attack on Kim Jong Nam. \n The attack was caught on surveillance video that shows two women going up to Kim and apparently smearing something on his face. He was dead within 20 minutes, authorities say. The women \u2014 one Indonesian, one Vietnamese \u2014 have been charged with murder but say they were duped into thinking they were playing a harmless prank. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Malaysia says Kim Jong Nam's body has been embalmed"}

{"date": "March 14, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Tuesday, Feb. 14, 2017, file photo, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, before the Senate Banking Committee. The Fed seems all but sure to raise rates during the week of Monday, March 13, 2017, and to signal that more hikes are likely coming. \n WASHINGTON >> For years after the Great Recession ended, investors fretted \u2014 sometimes panicked \u2014 over the prospect that the Federal Reserve might begin to raise interest rates from record lows. \n Now? The Fed seems all but sure to raise rates Wednesday for the third time in 15 months and to signal more hikes probably coming. And the response from investors has been something akin to a yawn. \n Wall Street appears too busy extending the stock market rally that began with President Donald Trump's election in November, cheered by the prospect of tax cuts, an easing of regulations and higher spending for infrastructure to worry about a rate hike. \n Fed watchers, it seems, are more buoyed by expectations for a vigorous economy than worried about whether slightly higher rates might slow growth. \n When Chair Janet Yellen and several other Fed officials separately suggested earlier this month that the economy was sturdy enough to withstand a modest raising of loan rates, investors quickly raised their estimate of the probability of a rate hike at the Fed's meeting this week from around 20 percent to 80 percent. \n After Friday's robust February jobs report \u2014 235,000 added jobs, solid pay gains and a dip in the unemployment rate to 4.7 percent \u2014 the likelihood has grown to 95 percent, according to the CME Group, which tracks investor expectations of Fed actions. \n Yet no one seems very concerned. \n \"We're just at a different place now than in 2013 when there was a lot of angst and uncertainty about the economy's prospects,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"Now, the fundamentals of the economy are much better. We are close to full employment and investors feel more comfortable about where we are.\" \n In light of Friday's jobs report, optimism about Trump's economic program and other signs that growth may pick up, some economists said they were raising their forecast for the number of rate increases this year from three to perhaps four. \n \"I think a March rate hike is a fait accompli,\" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands, who expects four rate increases in 2017. \"The more important question is: How many more hikes they will give us for the balance of the year?\" \n If the Fed is no longer unsettling investors with the hint of a forthcoming rate increase, it marks quite a change from the anxiety that prevailed after 2008, when the central bank cut its key rate to a record low and kept it there for seven years. During those years, any slight shift in sentiment about when the Fed might begin raising rates \u2014 a step that would lead eventually to higher loan rates for consumers and businesses \u2014 was enough to move global markets. \n In 2013, then-Chairman Ben Bernanke sent markets into a panic merely by mentioning that the Fed was contemplating slowing the pace of its bond purchases, which it was using then to keep long-term borrowing rates low. \n But now, the economy is widely considered sturdy enough to handle modestly higher loan rates. The unemployment rate, at 4.7 percent, is below the 4.8 percent level the Fed has deemed an indication of full employment. And inflation, which had stayed undesirably low for years, is edging near the 2 percent annual rate that the Fed views as optimal. \n And while the broadest gauge of the economy's health \u2014 the gross domestic product \u2014 remains well below levels associated with a healthy economy, many analysts say they're optimistic that Trump's proposed tax cuts, infrastructure spending increases and deregulation may accelerate growth. Those proposals have lifted the confidence of business executives and offset concerns that investors might otherwise have had about the effects of Fed rate increases. \n Yet for the same reason, some caution that if Trump's program fails to survive Congress intact, concerns will arise that the president's plans won't deliver much economic punch. Investors may start to fret about how steadily higher Fed rates will raise the cost of borrowing and slow spending by consumers and businesses. \n The Fed typically raises rates to prevent an economy from overheating and inflation from rising too high. But throughout the Fed's history, its efforts to control inflation have sometimes gone too far \u2014 slowing borrowing and spending so much as to trigger a recession. Already, the current expansion, which officially began in June 2009, is the third-longest in the post-World War II period. \n The Fed's benchmark rate, after modest increases in December 2015 and December 2016, now stands at a range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, still quite low by historical standards. But if the Fed ends up raising rates three or four times this year and follows up with three additional hikes in 2018, its benchmark rate would be left at a level that might start to dampen economic activity. \n \"The Fed is really just normalizing rates now and not tightening credit,\" said David Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors. \"But if the Fed hikes three or four times this year, by next year, the rate increases will start to bite and investors might start to worry about whether the Fed's credit tightening could get in the way of Trump's stimulus program.\" \n ___ \n Animated explainer: \n http://bit.ly/2nlGO0K \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Why so few are worried about likely Fed rate hike this week"}
