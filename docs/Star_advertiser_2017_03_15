Their boots and socks were water-logged and their clothes, hair and ears were caked with mud. \n The soldiers were going through training at the first jungle school the Army has established in decades. The course is part of a program to train soldiers for exercises and potential combat on terrain that looks more like islands and nations in the Pacific than arid Afghanistan and the deserts of the Middle East. \n Brig. Gen. Stephen Michael, deputy commander of the 25th Infantry Division, said the Army set up the school as its footprint was shrinking in Iraq and Afghanistan after more than a decade of war in those countries. \n \"The jungle school gives us that focus, it reinforces that we're in the Pacific,\" Michael said. \"If you're in the 25th, you understand you got to fight in the tough environment of the Pacific.\" \n Ever since the turn of the 20th century, the Army has fought in tropical rainforests. It spent years, for example, battling Filipino insurgents after the 1898 Spanish-American War. The Vietnam War was fought in the jungle. \n The Army gave up its jungle training school in Panama in 1999 when the U.S. returned land there to the Panamanian government. Then jungle training lost priority in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks as the Army focused on preparing soldiers to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq. \n Now, surviving and fighting in tropical rainforests has captured the Army's interest again. In 2013, it set up a jungle school at Schofield Barracks, a sprawling Army post some 30 miles west of the soft sands of Waikiki. Its dense woods have a stream soldiers can practice crossing and cliffs for rappelling. \n First it needed instructors. The Army sent soldiers to military jungle schools in Brazil, Brunei and other tropical spots to reacquire long-lost skills. Instructors-in-training poured over old Army jungle manuals. \n \"We had to relearn everything,\" said Staff Sgt. Ascencion Lopez, who was one of the first instructors at the school, which is part of the 25th Infantry Division's Lightning Academy. \n The soldiers quickly discovered their existing uniforms stood out among the trees and the fabric took too long to dry. The Army is currently developing a new uniform and boots specifically for the jungle. Instructors in Hawaii are testing out some early models. \n The soldiers have also had to adjust how they carry their ammunition, canteens and other gear. In the desert, soldiers frequently strap gear on their chests so it's accessible while riding vehicles. But instructors recommend soldiers carry gear on their sides in the jungle so it won't get caught on roots and vines while they're maneuvering on the forest ground. \n One day recently, Lopez watched soldiers from the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team in Fort Wainwright, Alaska, practice using a rope and pulley to cross a stream. The soldiers were attending the course to get ready for upcoming exercises in Malaysia, Thailand and other countries in the region. \n Lopez tells soldiers to keep a dry change of clothes to wear at night and to pay special attention to drying out their feet. That's because feet won't heal if they're continually wet. A small cut will become infected and the skin will die. \n \"The minute your feet go, you're done. You're not going to be able to function in the jungle,\" Lopez said. \n Soldiers must also develop the mental stamina to persevere in a place where they're constantly wet, thick vegetation can hide the enemy and deadly animals may be lurking. (Though soldiers are spared threatening animals in Hawaii as the state has no snakes and the only native land mammal is a small, rare bat.) \n \"Soldiers that aren't as mentally tough \u2014 they're either going to find their toughness or they won't. But the jungle doesn't care either way,\" said Staff Sgt. Michael Johnson, another instructor. \n The jungle school is an outgrowth of former President Barack Obama's \"pivot\" to Asia and the Pacific. It's still unclear whether President Donald Trump will maintain a similar emphasis on the region. \n Brian Price, a professor in diplomacy and military studies at Hawaii Pacific University, said the Army is training in the jungle so it will be ready before a crisis demands it. \n \"The Army has to train to fight everywhere \u2014 jungles, deserts, mountains and fair climates as well. This is kind of the missing piece of all that,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. soldiers train for jungle warfare at Hawaii rainforest"}

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump's first proposed budget, released by the Office of Management and Budget, is photographed in Washington, today. \n WASHINGTON >> Military spending would get the biggest boost in President Donald Trump's proposed budget. Environmental programs, medical research, Amtrak and an array of international and cultural programs \u2014 from Africa to Appalachia \u2014 would take big hits, among the many parts of the government he'd put on a crash diet. \n The budget proposal out Thursday is a White House wish list; it'll be up to Congress to decide where money goes. If Trump gets his way, there will be more losers than winners among government departments and programs. \n Some programs would tread water: WIC grants \u2014 money to states for health care and nutrition for low-income women, infants and children \u2014 are one example. Monday for states grants for water infrastructure projects would be held level as well. \n Some others would lose everything: Trump proposes to eliminate money for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the national endowments for the arts and the humanities and more than a dozen other independent agencies financed by the government. \n A sampling: \n WINNERS \n \u2014The Pentagon. Trump proposes a 10 percent increase in the massive defense budget, adding $52 billion in military spending in one year top expand personnel, equipment and capability. Another $2 billion would go to nuclear weapons. \n \u2014Veterans Affairs. Up 5.9 percent. That's an additional $4.4 billion, driven by ever-growing health care costs. \n \u2014Homeland Security. Up 6.8 percent. That's $2.8 billion more. Most of the increase, $2.6 billion, would be to help kick-start Trump's promised border wall. The president has repeatedly said Mexico would pay for the wall; Mexican officials are adamant that they won't. Trump also wants an extra $1.5 billion for more immigration jails and deportations, and $314 million to hire 1,500 immigration enforcement and border patrol agents. \n \u2014The National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the maintenance and safety of the nuclear arsenal and its research labs. The agency would grow by 11.3 percent, or $1.4 billion, so that it takes up more than half the Energy Department's budget, which would shrink overall. \n \u2014Opioid prevention and treatment: a proposed $500 million increase in the Health and Human Services Department to counter the epidemic and more money for the Justice Department to combat the problem. \n \u2014School choice: $1.4 billion more to expand school choice programs, bringing spending in that area to $20 billion, even as the Education Department's overall budget would be cut by $9 billion, or 13 percent. \n LOSERS: \n \u2014EPA, facing a 31.4 percent cut, or $2.6 billion. The plan would cut 3,200 jobs at the agency, eliminate a new plan for tighter regulations on power plants, and \"zero out\" programs to clean up the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay. \n \u2014Health and Human Services, facing the largest cut in dollar terms: $12.6 billion, or 16.2 percent. The plan would cut $5.8 billion from the nearly $32 billion National Institutes of Health, the nation's premier medical research agency, bringing its total to $25.9 billion. It's not clear what research on diseases or disorders would lose the most money, although the budget plan specifically calls for elimination of a division that focuses on global health. Already, the NIH's budget hasn't kept pace with inflation over the last decade, making it dramatically harder for scientists around the country to win money for research projects into potential new treatments or better understanding of disease. \n \u2014State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development. Down 28 percent, or $10 billion. Foreign aid would be reduced, as would money to the U.N. and to multilateral development banks including the World Bank. Some foreign military grants would be shifted to loans. \n \u2014Labor Department. A more than 20 percent cut, or $2.5 billion. To be eliminated: a $434 million program that has helped more than 1 million people 55 and older find jobs, according to the department. The blueprint says the Senior Community Service Employment Program is inefficient and unproven. \n \u2014Agriculture Department. A nearly 21 percent cut, or $4.7 billion, achieved in part by cutting land acquisition in the National Forest System, rural water infrastructure and statistical capabilities at the department. Trump also proposes reduced staff in county USDA offices, an idea that fell flat in Congress when President Barack Obama proposed a similar reduction. \n \u2014Transportation Department. Trump proposes a cut of nearly 13 percent, or $2.4 billion. Amtrak, local transit agencies, and rural communities that depend on federal subsidies to obtain scheduled airline service would take the brunt. Trump would eliminate subsidies for Amtrak long-distance train routes, which would most likely mean the end of those routes since they are generally not profitable. Money for the Federal Transit Administration grant program for new light rail and subway construction would be eliminated except for multi-year projects the government has already committed to help fund. \n \u2014Internal Revenue Service: After years of cuts, the IRS budget would be cut again \u2014 by $239 million from this year's spending levels. The IRS budget is down about $1 billion from its height in 2010. Since then, the agency has lost more than 17,000 employees. As a result, the chances of getting audited have rarely been so low. \n \u2014Commerce Department. A 16 percent or $1.5 billion cut. The plan would eliminate more than $250 million in National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration grants, including a program that helps coastal communities adapt to climate change, deal with invasive species and maintain healthy water and fisheries. Also on the chopping block: the Economic Development Administration, which provides federal dollars to foster job creation and attract private investment; and the Minority Business Development Agency, which is dedicated to helping minority-owned business get off the ground and grow. The Trump administration says the two agencies duplicate work done elsewhere. \n \u2014School programs: The plan would eliminate a $1.2 billion initiative that supports before- and after-school programs as well as summer programs. \n \u2014Independent agencies supported by tax dollars. If Trump prevails, a hefty contingent of entities would lose all federal money and be shut. Among them, the public broadcasting corporation, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Chemical Safety Board, the United States Institute of Peace, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for National Community Service and the African Development Foundation. That foundation was established by Congress and provides seed money and other support to enterprises in some 20 countries on that continent. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Winners and losers in Trump's first budget plan"}

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca talks to the media as he leaves federal court in Los Angeles today. Baca was convicted Wednesday of obstructing an FBI corruption investigation of jails he ran and of lying to federal authorities. \n LOS ANGELES >> A federal investigation that targeted violent Los Angeles jail guards took down the longtime former leader of the nation's largest sheriff's department. \n Lee Baca was convicted Wednesday of obstructing an FBI investigation into guards who savagely beat inmates and took bribes to smuggle contraband into the jails he ran. \n The guilty verdicts represented a stunning turnaround for Baca, who less than three months ago walked out of court feeling victorious when his previous trial was declared mistrial. Jurors had been deadlocked 11-1 in favor of his acquittal and it was no certainty the charges against him would even be refiled. \n Instead he became the 21st and final person convicted in the wide-ranging corruption investigation that began with rank-and-file deputies and spread to Baca's inner circle. \n In addition to tarnishing a reputation earned during a 50-year career as a policing innovator and jail reformer, the conviction threatens to put Baca, 74, who is in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, behind bars for up to 20 years. \n Baca remained free ahead of a Monday hearing that is expected to set a sentencing date on convictions of obstruction of justice, conspiring to hinder the probe and lying to investigators. \n Baca had escaped the fate of underlings indicted in the case until a year ago, when he unexpectedly pleaded guilty to a single count of making false statements to federal authorities about what role he played in efforts to thwart the FBI. \n An agreement with prosecutors called for a sentence no greater than six months. But a judge rejected the deal as too lenient. Baca then withdrew his guilty plea, and prosecutors hit him with the additional conspiracy and obstruction charges. \n In the previous trial, prosecutors had decided to seek a separate trial on the lying charge, but pressed all three counts at the second trial, one of several tactical changes that may have made the difference in winning over a new jury. \n Two deputies who pleaded guilty in the conspiracy testified at the second trial, putting their former boss at the head of the scheme that included efforts to intimidate an FBI agent who had launched the investigation into civil rights abuses in the jails. \n The jury foreman told reporters that there were several \"aha\" moments in testimony that helped win over four jurors who initially voted for acquittal. The 51-year-old salesman, who didn't give his name, said the strongest evidence came from those in the department who had done the right thing and stood up to Baca. \n He cited former Assistant Sheriff Cecil Rhambo, who had warned Baca he would break the law if he obstructed the federal investigation. \n \"Lee Baca knew what was right and what was wrong,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Sandra R. Brown said outside court. \"He made a decision. That decision was to commit a crime, and he led others in a conspiracy to obstruct a federal law enforcement investigation into what he described as 'his jails.' \n \"And when the time came, he lied. He lied to cover up his crimes,\" she said. \n Defense attorney Nathan Hochman didn't dispute the efforts to hide the informant and impede the FBI but said prosecutors had presented no evidence Baca gave orders to obstruct the FBI. \n Hochman was frustrated in efforts to present evidence of Baca's diagnosis. \n There was no evidence Baca suffered from Alzheimer's during the scheme in 2011, and Judge Percy Anderson said mention of it could sway jurors to sympathize with Baca. \n Hochman was left to hint at the issue, reminding jurors that Baca was 71 at the time he spoke with prosecutors and wasn't lying but had forgotten details. Baca did not testify. \n The former sheriff showed no emotion in court as the verdicts were read but struck an upbeat tone outside. \n \"My mentality is always optimistic,\" Baca said. \"I look forward to winning on appeal.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "After stellar 50-year career, ex-LA County sheriff convicted"}

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ARC CENTER OF EXCELLENCE VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this October 2016 photo, a scientist measures coral mortality following bleaching on the northern Great Barrier Reef, Austrlia. Reducing pollution and curbing overfishing won't prevent the severe bleaching that is killing coral at catastrophic rates, according to a study of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. In the end, researchers said, the only way to save the world's coral from heat-induced bleaching is with a war on global warming. \n SYDNEY >> Reducing pollution and curbing overfishing won't prevent the severe bleaching that is killing coral at catastrophic rates, according to a study of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. In the end, researchers say, the only way to save the world's coral from heat-induced bleaching is with a war on global warming. \n Scientists are quick to note that local protection of reefs can help damaged coral recover from the stress of rising ocean temperatures. But the new research shows that such efforts are ultimately futile when it comes to stopping bleaching in the first place. \n \"We don't have any tools to climate-proof corals,\" said Terry Hughes, director of the ARC Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Australia and lead author of the study being published on Thursday in the journal Nature. \"That's a bit sobering. We can't stop bleaching locally. We actually have to do something about climate change.\" \n Across the world, scores of brilliantly colored coral reefs once teeming with life have in recent years become desolate, white graveyards. Their deaths due to coral bleaching have grown more frequent as ocean temperatures rise, mainly due to increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The hot water stresses corals, forcing them to expel the colorful algae living inside them, which leaves the corals vulnerable to disease and death. Given enough time, bleached coral can recover if the water cools, but if the temperature stays too high for too long, the coral will die. \n Preserving coral reefs is crucial, given we depend on them for everything from food to medical research to protection from damaging coastal storms. Scientists and policymakers have thus been scrambling to find ways to prevent bleaching. Last year, for example, Hawaiian officials proposed several measures they hoped would fight bleaching on the state's reefs, such as limiting fishing, establishing new marine protected areas and controlling polluted runoff from land. The question was whether such efforts could provide the corals any resistance to bleaching, or just help them recover. \n The researchers conducted aerial and underwater surveys of the Great Barrier Reef, which has experienced three major bleaching events, the worst of which occurred last year. The scientists found that the severity of bleaching was tightly linked to how warm the water was. In the north, which experienced the hottest temperatures, hundreds of individual reefs suffered severe bleaching in 2016, regardless of whether the water quality was good or bad, or whether fishing had been banned. That means even the most pristine parts of the reef are just as prone to heat stress as those that are less protected. \n Prior exposure to bleaching also did not appear to provide any protective benefit to the coral. The scientists found that the reefs that were highly bleached during the first two events, in 1998 and 2002, did not experience less severe bleaching last year. \n Ultimately, the study concluded, saving reefs from the ravages of bleaching requires urgent action to reduce global warming. \n \"I think it's a wake-up call,\" Hughes said. \"We've been hoping that local interventions with water quality and fishing would improve the resistance of the corals to bleaching. We found no evidence that that's actually true, at least during a very severe event.\" \n The study shows that older ways of thinking about reef management, such as reducing river runoff, are now moot points when it comes to preventing bleaching, said Kim Cobb, a climate scientist and coral researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. \n \"It all seems so quaint now, really,\" said Cobb, who wasn't part of the study. \"A future that we thought was decades coming is basically here.\" \n The research also illustrated the gravity of the situation facing the 2,300-kilometer (1,400-mile) Great Barrier Reef. The team found 91 percent of the reef has been bleached at least once during the three bleaching events. Even more alarming, Hughes said, is that a fourth bleaching event is already underway. Corals need years to recover from bleaching, so back-to-back events increase the possibility that the bleached coral will die. \n The study shows that very intense coral bleaching events are no longer isolated and are happening more regularly, said coral reef scientist Julia Baum of Canada's University of Victoria. That assertion has been further bolstered by the Great Barrier Reef's latest bleaching event, which began a few weeks ago and which Baum says has stunned scientists. \n \"None of us were expecting the water to be heating up again right now,\" Baum said. \"I think it's beyond what any of us could have imagined. It's our worst nightmare.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Study: Stopping global warming only way to save coral reefs"}

Easterbrook has also talked about the potential of delivery. \n With its mobile order-and-pay option, McDonald's says customers place an order on its app then go to a restaurant and \"check in\" to select how they want to get their food. That could be at the counter, in the drive-thru, or with curbside delivery, where an employee brings out orders to a designated space. Orders are prepared once customers check in at the restaurant. \n Starbucks has already found success using its mobile app and loyalty program to encourage people to visit more often and spend more when they do. The chain has also said its mobile order-and-pay option was so popular that it caused congestion at pick-up counters last year, leading some customers who walked into stores to leave without buying anything. Starbucks said it is working on fixing those issues. \n It's not clear whether McDonald's will be able to get the same level of usage for its mobile app and order-and-pay option. Since coffee tends to be more of a daily habit, for instance, people may be more willing to download an app for it on their phones. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "McDonald's tests mobile ordering before national rollout"}

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the free-market VVD party smiles after exit poll results of the parliamentary elections were announced in The Hague, Netherlands, today. \n THE HAGUE, Netherlands >> Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte today claimed a dominating parliamentary election victory over anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders, who failed the year's first litmus test for populism in Europe. \n Provisional results with over half the votes counted suggested Rutte's party won 32 seats in the 150-member legislature, 13 more than Wilders' party, which took only third place with 19 seats. The surging CDA Christian Democrats claimed 20. \n Following Britain's vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's election as U.S. president, \"the Netherlands said, 'Whoa!' to the wrong kind of populism,\" said Rutte, who is now poised for a third term as prime minister. \n \"We want to stick to the course we have \u2014 safe and stable and prosperous,\" Rutte added. \n Wilders, who campaigned on radical pledges to close borders to migrants from Muslim nations, close mosques, ban the Quran and take the Netherlands out of the EU, had insisted that whatever the result of the election, the kind of populist politics he and others in Europe represent aren't going away. \n \"Rutte has not seen the back of me,\" Wilders said after the results had sunk in. \n His Party for Freedom clinched 24 seats in 2010 before sinking to 15 in 2012, and today's total left him with about 12 percent of the electorate, far less than populists in Britain and the United States have scored. \n \"Those are not the 30 seats we hoped for,\" Wilders told reporters today, adding that he'd \"rather have been the biggest party.\" \n Both France and Germany have elections this year in which far-right candidates and parties are hoping to make an impact. \n French President Francois Hollande congratulated Rutte on his election success and his \"clear victory against extremism.\" \n In Germany, Socialist leader Martin Schulz tweeted. \"I am relieved, but we need to continue to fight for an open and Free Europe.\" \n Rutte, who for much of the campaign appeared to be racing to keep pace with Wilders, may have profited from the hard line he drew in a diplomatic standoff with Turkey over the past week. \n The fight erupted over the Netherlands' refusal to let two Turkish government ministers address rallies in Rotterdam about a referendum that could give Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan more powers. It gave Rutte an opportunity to show his statesmanship by refusing to bow to foreign pressure, a stance with widespread backing in the nation. \n \"I mean this is your electoral campaign dream, right? You can't script this if it was a movie,\" Amsterdam Free University political scientist Andre Krouwel said. \"It's really helped Mark Rutte to take the lead and a big lead over Geert Wilders.\" \n Under brilliant skies, the Dutch went to vote in huge numbers, with turnout estimated to have reached at 82 percent. \n In a subplot of the elections, the Green Left party registered a historic victory, turning it into the largest party on the left wing of Dutch politics, together with the Socialist Party. \n The provisional results showed the Greens leaping from four seats to 14 in parliament after a strong campaign by charismatic leader Jesse Klaver, who invites comparisons to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \n It remains to be seen if the 30-year-old Klaver will take his party into the next ruling coalition, which looks likely to be dominated by Rutte's VVD and other right-leaning parties. \n The Labor Party of Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem appeared to have been punished by voters in the election, plunging from 38 seats at the last election to just nine, according to the Ipsos exit poll. \n Because of the result, it looked unlikely Dijsselbloem would be able to hang on to his post of leading the 19-nation Eurogroup, which manages the currency of the European Union nations that use the euro. \n Rutte had framed the election as a choice between continuity and chaos, portraying himself as a safe custodian of the nation's economic recovery and casting Wilders as a far-right radical who was unprepared to make tough decisions. \n Although he drove through unpopular austerity measures over the last four years, the Dutch economic recovery has gathered pace and unemployment has fallen fast under the prime minister. \n Wilders, meanwhile, attempted to tap into discontent among voters who said they were not benefiting from the economic recovery. \n Even if his party had placed first in the election, Wilders stood a remote chance of becoming prime minister in the Netherlands, where a proportional representation system all but guarantees coalition governments. \n The main political parties, including Rutte's, had ruled out forming a coalition government with the Party for Freedom. \n The left-leaning Dutch Labor Party appeared to be hammered by its supporters for its role over the last four years in pushing through a tough austerity package as junior member in a two-party Cabinet with Rutte's VVD. \n The coalition Rutte's VVD party had with Labor can no longer be replicated and the prime minister is likely to look to the right for new coalition partners. \n Rutte has been resolute about not wanting to share power with Wilders, so that tightens the market in which he can acquire the necessary 75-seat threshold. \n Weeks, if not months of coalition-building talks may be required before a new government is installed. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Dutch PM Rutte claims win over 'wrong kind of populism'"}

Plus, the Tar Heels are a No. 1 seed again opposite Villanova on the other side of the 68-team field, setting up the chance for a championship game rematch on April 3. \n And so the madness of March revs up all over again \u2014 a tournament loaded with great teams, players and marquee matchups. \n A few things to look for: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n TOP TEAMS \n Villanova. The defending national champions are the top overall seed and on a roll. No need to start anywhere else. \n Kansas. The Jayhawks may have had an early exit in the Big 12 Tournament, but they have one of the most talented rosters anywhere. \n North Carolina. So good, even a loss to rival Duke in the ACC Tournament wasn't enough to knock them down from a No. 1 seed. \n Gonzaga. Call them overrated all you want, these Zags are deep, athletic and probably the best team coach Mark Few has had in the Inland Northwest. \n Arizona. Pac-12 Tournament and co-regular season champions have coach Sean Miller eyeing his first Final Four. \n Duke. Blue Devils had their share of struggles, but appear to be peaking at the right time. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n TOP PLAYERS \n Frank Mason III, Kansas. Leader and go-to player for a program that won its 13th straight Big 12 title. \n Josh Hart, Villanova. Does it all, already has one national title. \n Lonzo Ball, UCLA.

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Feb. 2014, file photo, Meghan Duggan of the United States looks up during the 2014 Winter Olympics women's semifinal ice hockey game. The U.S. women's hockey team is threatening to boycott the world championships because of a wage dispute. The team announced today that they will not participate in the International Ice Hockey Federation tournament that begins March 31 in Plymouth, Michigan. \n Members of the U.S. women's hockey team are willing to give up the chance to defend their world championship gold medal on home ice unless there is significant progress in settling a wage dispute that has dragged on for months. \n Players informed USA Hockey on Wednesday that they will not report to training camp next week or play in the tournament that begins March 31 in Plymouth, Michigan, without clear steps toward what they hope is a four-year contract. \n \"To voluntarily take ourselves out of the running to (repeat) is not easy, but it's what's right and we're asking for what's right and fair,\" forward Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson said by phone. \"I'm proud to do this with my teammates and to stand arm in arm with them and to say enough is enough.\" \n USA Hockey said the organization and the U.S. Olympic Committee provide national team players with financial support, training opportunities, camps and strength and conditioning programs. \n \"We acknowledge the players' concerns and have proactively increased our level of direct support to the Women's National Team as we prepare for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games,\" USA Hockey executive director Dave Ogrean said. \"We have communicated that increased level of support to the players' representatives and look forward to continuing our discussions.\" \n USA Hockey said each player participating in the Olympics in South Korea next February could receive up to $85,000, which also includes medal incentives. \n Team captain Meghan Duggan called the statement \"completely misleading and dishonest,\" and the law firm representing the players said no $85,000 offer was made. \n \"It's an example of them kind of disregarding anything that we're asking and basically disregarding our request to be under contract for a four-year period and any of that,\" Duggan said, adding that players are also asking for insurance and travel expenses they don't feel are provided on an equal level as men's players. \n Neither USA Hockey nor the players would reveal details of the wages in dispute or how the men's team is compensated. The U.S. men's team is comprised of highly paid NHL players, as are most established national teams. \n \"You can't really say, 'Well what do they get?' Because the NHL guys get paid millions of dollars,\" Lamoureux-Davidson said. \"That's why we bring up equitable support. How they get treated when they go to their world championship or their World Cup, it should be equal to that about how we get treated when we go to our world championship.\" \n Players pointed to the $3.5 million USA Hockey spends annually on its National Team Development Program with no comparable setup for women's development and the fact that those men's under-17 and under-18 teams play 60 games a season compared to just nine for the women's national team in a non-Olympic year. \n Canada, the world's other women's hockey powerhouse, puts more money into the sport in part because of government funding. Hockey Canada general manager of women's programs Melody Davidson said development players receive $900 a month and senior-level players $1,500 a month even outside Olympic years and that players are supported full-time for nine months around the Olympics. \n \"We get paid for six months out of a four-year span,\" said Lamoureux-Davidson, who recently received a check for December Series games against Canada. \n USA Hockey said it planned to \"field a competitive team\" for the IIHF tournament. How that team would be put together wasn't immediately clear, but USA Hockey President Jim Smith declared that \"USA Hockey's role is not to employ athletes and we will not do so.\" \n \"Good luck getting a suitable No. 1 competition to represent our country on a world stage,\" forward Hilary Knight said. \"I kind of dare them.\" \n Matt DelDuca, a lawyer with expertise in labor and employment issues said, \"Who's going to win is going to depend on how strong their leverage really is in the eyes of the organization.\" \n USA Hockey said it is committed to growing women's hockey and that more than 73,000 women play hockey in the U.S. now compared with 23,000 in 1998, when the Americans won gold at the first Olympics with a women's tournament. \n But women's players have had contracts only in Olympic years and are seeking a deal that covers them in off years. Several players said USA Hockey has paid players $1,000 a month during their six-month Olympic residency period and nothing the rest of the time. \n \"They're looking for support for every year so that they don't have to have second and third jobs and don't have to have family supporting them,\" said John Langel, an attorney for the players. He characterized the negotiating gap with USA Hockey as a chasm. \n The wage dispute follows one by U.S. women's soccer players, who last March filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that alleged wage discrimination by the U.S. Soccer Federation. \n Lamoureux-Davidson said the hockey players have been in touch with soccer players about their dispute, which is ongoing; Langel represented U.S. women's soccer players from 1998 to 2014. \n Cammi Granato, one of the first women in the Hockey Hall of Fame after being inducted in 2010, dealt with wage disputes during her career and appreciates current players taking such a difficult stand. \n \"It says a lot for what they're fighting for,\" Granato said. \"It says a lot for the fact that there needs to be change. This takes a lot of courage.\" \n Lamoureux-Davidson said players are hopeful that taking a stand will force the issue. \n \"We all want to go play,\" she said. \"But it's been 14 months and we haven't seen progress, so if there's progress within the next week and a half, we'll see.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. women's hockey players threaten boycott over wages"}

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, center, and his wife Sophie Gregoire chat with some of the citizens from Gander, Newfoundland, after the Broadway musical \"Come From Away\" in New York today. \n NEW YORK >> Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \u2014 along with first daughter Ivanka Trump as a guest \u2014 welcomed a new musical that celebrates Canadian compassion and openness to international travelers following the Sept. 11 attacks. \n Trudeau and Trump and some 120 ambassadors from around the world attended the show \"Come From Away\" tonight at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre, in a city where the bulk of the 3,000 people on 9/11 died. \n The musical is set in the small Newfoundland town of Gander, which opened its arms and homes to some 7,000 airline passengers diverted there when the U.S. government shut down its airspace. In a matter of a few hours, the town was overwhelmed by 38 planeloads of travelers from dozens of countries and religions, yet locals went to work in their kitchens and cleaned up spare rooms. \n In remarks before the show, Trudeau got on the stage and said he was pleased that, \"the world gets to see what it is to lean on each other and be there for each other through the darkest times.\" \n The show got a standing ovation, including from Trump, who sat near Trudeau, his wife and U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley. Also in attendance was Jean Chretien, a former Canadian prime minister, and the mayor of Gander. Trump was seen clapping along happily as the band played at the curtain call. \n The actors did not make any changes to the script or acknowledge the special audience, but one afterward was still buzzing. \n \"When do we have the opportunity to share a story about kindness, gratitude and love that takes place in a country that is known for opening their hearts to people,\" said actor Rodney Hicks. \"It just meant the world to all of us.\" \n Trudeau, who champions global free trade and has welcomed 40,000 Syrian refugees, was celebrating the 150th anniversary of Canada's confederation and also hoped to reaffirm the special friendship between Canadians and Americans. \n \"Our friends are there for those tough times, when you lose a parent or a loved one, when you get knocked off your path at a difficult moment in your life. Where you go through difficult times, that's when you turn and you lean on your friends,\" he said. \"That ultimately is what this story is all about \u2014 being there for each other.\" \n In the show, a cast of a dozen play both residents and marooned passengers, telling true stories of generosity, compassion and acceptance, while fear and suspicion reigned in America. The show arrives just as a debate over immigration and open borders has reignited following the Trump administration's push for a ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim nations. \n Canadian husband-and-wife writing team Irene Sankoff and David Hein wrote the book, music and lyrics, and it was directed by Christopher Ashley, the artistic director of the La Jolla Playhouse. The musical veers its focus from weighty matters \u2014 a mother anxious about her missing firefighter son in New York \u2014 to more silly events, like a rowdy evening at a local bar where visitors are urged to kiss a cod. \n Security at the theater was intense and theatergoers had to navigate through frozen snow drifts as well as black SUVs. But Trudeau seemed comfortable on the stage. \n \"I have to sort of personally say, on behalf of all Canadians, thank you for making us so welcome with the snow,\" he said. \"It's a nice touch. You really went out of your way.\" \n Trudeau's warm reception was in contrast to the ones that greeted two other world leaders who recently attended the Broadway smash \"Hamilton\" \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Both received more than a smattering of boos. \n One woman in attendance today was seeing \"Come From Away\" for the 58th time, having followed it as it made its way from California to Seattle to Washington, D.C., then Gander and now Broadway. \n That was Beverley Bass, the first female captain at American Airlines, who was at the helm of Flight 49, going from Paris to Dallas-Fort Worth, when she ended up in Gander on 9/11. She was interviewed by the musical's creators for her story and is portrayed onstage by Jenn Colella. \n After almost 60 performances, might she at some point just step in for Colella one night and play her own life? Bass laughed: \"I can't sing and dance, so her role is safe from me,\" she said. Then she thought for a moment and added: \"I guess she can't fly jets.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Canadian prime minister, Ivanka Trump catch Broadway musical"}

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This image released by NBC shows Rachel Maddow, host of \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" on MSNBC. \n NEW YORK >> Rachel Maddow says that if people felt let down by her story about President Donald Trump's 2005 tax document it's more because of the weight of expectation than anything she did. \n The MSNBC host found herself in the odd position today of defending herself from criticism following one of the biggest-ever scoops for her show. Maddow's show revealed, through reporter David Cay Johnston, two pages of tax return information that showed Trump earned $150 million in 2005 and paid $38 million in income taxes that year. Trump has steadfastly refused to release his tax returns. \n Maddow's tweet less than 90 minutes before her show that \"we've got Trump's tax returns\" set off a social media frenzy. Although a subsequent tweet specified it was only two pages from one year's returns, expectations were sky high. \n Maddow told the AP that she never misrepresented what she had. \n \"Because I have information about the president doesn't mean that it's necessarily a scandal,\" she said. \"It doesn't mean that it's damning information. If other people leapt to that conclusion without me indicating that it was, that hype is external to what we did.\" \n Her story was derided as \"a big nothingburger\" by Fox News Channel's Steve Doocy today. There were unflattering comparisons to Geraldo Rivera's opening of Al Capone's vault, television shorthand for an anticipated event that doesn't meet expectations. The White House's pre-emptive step of issuing a statement with Trump's income and estimated taxes for that year before Maddow's show started also took air out of the story. \n Maddow's nearly 20-minute explanation of why seeing the president's tax returns is important and all of the things they could reveal \u2014 before telling what the 2005 documents actually showed \u2014 may have felt familiar to her regular viewers but a long tease for those enticed by the advanced advertising. \n Tweeted ESPN's Bob Ley during the show: \"If you have news, Rachel, please tell us. Soon. I'm not young.\" \n \"My priority is to get the story right and put it into proper context, and explain the weight of it and why it is important,\" Maddow said. While she didn't reveal the income figures immediately, she did tell viewers at the top of the show the exact documents that were obtained and how they came to light, she said. \n The fact that the material was leaked \u2014 and the Trump administration contended that it was illegal for Maddow to publicize it \u2014 is as important as what it revealed, Maddow said. If it happened once, it's likely to happen again, she said. \n \"This is a super interesting first window into his finances, and the question of his finances is a legitimate scandal,\" she said. \n While Trump called NBC News \"fake news\" in a tweet today, he didn't mention Maddow specifically. His son, Donald Trump Jr., did that in a tweet: \"Thank you Rachel Maddow for proving to your Trump hating followers how successful #realDonaldTrump is and that he paid $40mm in taxes.\" \n White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said today that he'd have to follow up with the president's lawyer when asked if any legal action is being contemplated against NBC. \n He denied that Trump himself was behind the leak to Maddow and said that it was offensive even to be asked the question. Maddow and Johnston speculated on Tuesday's show about whether Trump had something to do with the document turning up in Johnston's mail. \n \"It's despicable and reprehensible and they should be ashamed of themselves as to how they conducted themselves regarding this entire episode,\" Spicer said. \n Johnston noted in a tweet today that the White House had confirmed what Trump had called \"fake news.\" And he said that Trump fans had harassed his wife and one of his children by phone. \"Sad!\" he tweeted. \"Let's have open debate, not threats.\" \n Maddow said she didn't feel that the White House had undercut her story by releasing the tax information early, noting that it was important to get confirmation that the story was right. \n Some Trump supporters found the revelations a positive, given that critics of his failure to release taxes had suggested the president wasn't as rich as he let on, or that he paid little in taxes. Maddow even faced some criticism within the family: a commentary by Jay Yarow on sister station CNBC's web site that was headlined, \"Donald Trump just got a nice victory, thanks, of all people, to Rachel Maddow.\" \n \"I don't really care,\" Maddow said. \"It is funny to me that a president would spend this much energy and political capital to keep secret his finances and his taxes specifically and simultaneously would want to brag about how much money he made. If that's really what he wants the story to be, he can release all of his taxes and we can all glory in his immense wealth.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Maddow: People disappointed by Trump story expected too much"}

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump raises his fist after speaking at the American Center for Mobility today in Ypsilanti Township, Mich. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump's explosive allegation that Barack Obama wiretapped his New York skyscraper during the presidential campaign has left him increasingly isolated, with allies on Capitol Hill and within his own administration offering no evidence to back him up. \n Today, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he had not given Trump any reason to believe he was wiretapped by President Obama. Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House intelligence committee, said he had seen no information to support the claim and then went further. He suggested the U.S. president's assertion, made in a series of March 4 tweets, should not be taken at face value. \n \"Are you going to take the tweets literally?\" Nunes said. \"If so, clearly the president was wrong.\" \n Trump, in an interview today with Fox News, predicted there would be \"some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.\" The president said he'd learned about the alleged wiretapping from news reports referencing intercepted communications, despite the fact that he and his advisers have publicly denounced stories about government agencies reviewing contacts between Trump associates and Russians. \n Trump's allegations have put him in a potentially perilous position as congressional investigations into Russia's involvement in the 2016 election \u2014 and possible Russian contacts with Trump associates \u2014 ramp up. The FBI is also investigating. \n If no evidence of wiretapping at Trump Tower emerges, his credibility would be newly damaged. If there is proof that the Obama administration approved monitoring of Trump or his associates, that would suggest the government had reason to be suspicious of their contacts with Russia and a judge had approved the surveillance. \n The president, who appears to have made his allegation in a burst of anger, has asked lawmakers to investigate the claim. Lawmakers have since turned the question back toward the administration, asking the Justice Department to provide evidence of wiretapping activity. \n The Justice Department missed a Monday deadline for providing the information to the House and was given a one-week extension. \n Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who heads the Judiciary Committee's crime and terrorism subcommittee, said the FBI will provide a classified briefing on the matter \"at some time in the future.\" Graham has previously said he would use subpoena power to get information from the FBI about whether a warrant was issued allowing the Obama administration to tap Trump's phones during the campaign. \n Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone told the Associated Press today that he believes his own online exchanges with a Russian-linked hacker were obtained through a special warrant that allows the government to collect the communications of people suspected of being agents of a foreign nation. Stone communicated through Twitter direct messages with Guccifer 2.0, a hacker who has claimed responsibility for breaching the Democratic National Committee. \n Stone said he was unaware at the time that U.S. officials believed the hacker had ties to Russia. He said he is willing to testify before any congressional committee that holds its hearings \"in public and not behind closed doors.\" \n The House intelligence committee will begin holding public hearings on Monday. Nunes said FBI Director James Comey and Adm. Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, will testify. \n Ahead of the hearing, the committee sent a letter to the FBI, CIA and the National Security Agency requesting details by Friday about Americans who surfaced in intelligence collections last year. \n Identities of Americans who show up in U.S. surveillance against foreign targets are generally concealed, but can be unmasked by intelligence agencies in certain circumstances. Those include situations when the communications contain information that a crime has or is about to be committed, when the Americans' identity is necessary to understand the importance of the foreign intelligence collected or when the communication provides information that an American may be an agent of a foreign power. \n Asked whether Trump's communications may have been swept up in surveillance, Nunes said it was \"very possible.\" \n Sessions, a staunch supporter of Trump during the campaign, recused himself earlier this month from the Russia investigations after it was revealed that he did not disclose his own contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States. Asked today if he had ever briefed Trump on the investigation or given the president any reason to believe he had been wiretapped by the Obama administration, Sessions said, \"The answer is no.\" \n Trump has said little about his allegations against Obama, largely leaving it to White House aides to explain his inflammatory statements. \n The White House appeared to be backing away from Trump's claims on Monday, with spokesman Sean Spicer saying the president was referring to general surveillance that may have been approved by the Obama administration. On Tuesday, Spicer said the president was \"extremely confident\" the Justice Department would provide evidence vindicating him. \n Graham and Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley have both said they will hold up hearings for Rod Rosenstein, Trump's nominee to serve as deputy attorney general, unless they get more information from the FBI. Given Sessions' recusal, Rosenstein would take over responsibility for any probes touching the Trump campaign and Russia's election meddling if he's confirmed. \n \"It's just too bad that we have to go to this length,\" Grassley said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's allies melting away on wiretapping claims"}

Several commenters preceded their remarks by calling the day \"Unconstitutional Wednesday.\" \n \"Locally, we're going to have the war on protesters, backed up now by a City Council ordinance,\" said Charles BridgeCrane Johnson, a local activist. \"Shame on all of you. I know you can see our attempts to communicate with you and you ignore them.\" \n Before the vote, Wheeler said the provision allowing people to be banned from the council chambers won't be used until a federal court rules on its constitutionality. \n \"There is a difference of opinion among informed attorneys as to whether this is constitutional or not. It may not be constitutional,\" Wheeler said, adding that passing it would allow the court evaluation to start. \n A federal judge in 2015 ruled that the city acted unconstitutionally when it threw out a protester and banned him for 60 days. But the judge left open a window for the city to revise its ordinance and bring it back for review, said Michael Cox, a spokesman for the mayor. \n The revised ordinance contains an appeals process and specifies the types of behavior that can get a person banned, he said. \n Weekly or even daily protests are nothing new in Portland, but in recent months even this city has had more than its share \u2014 and Wheeler has seemed more willing than previous mayors to push back. \n That approach, plus a constellation of highly charged events, has created an atmosphere of anger and distrust for some. \n Police shot and killed a 17-year-old black teenager on Feb. 9 and the ALCU and others have strongly criticized police for crowd control tactics during recent anti-Trump protests that included the use of pepper spray and rubber bullets. \n The city has also been panned for its response to its homeless crisis during an especially harsh winter. Four people have died of exposure and a stillborn infant was found with his homeless mother at a street side bus stop earlier this year. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ultra-liberal Portland moves to rein in protests"}

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump spoke at the American Center for Mobility, today, in Ypsilanti Township, Mich. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump has finalized his first budget for the federal government, a blueprint that would make deep cuts in the Environmental Protection Agency and other domestic programs while significantly increasing spending on the military. \n The budget, to be submitted to Congress on Thursday, was widely expected to cause political pain for Republicans and Democrats, who will have the final say on spending in the arduous budget process. \n Trump has promised a spending plan that fulfills his campaign promises to boost national security, from spending more on defense to building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Though he repeatedly promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, U.S. taxpayers will foot the bill. \n Republicans have groused about some of the preliminary plans, including elimination of the $3 billion community development block grant program that's popular among local GOP officials; a 25 percent cut to the EPA and elimination of 3,000 jobs; and the scuttling, essentially, of a $300 million-per-year program to clean up the Great Lakes. \n Trump's plan to eliminate community development block grants was dismissed on Capitol Hill by those who remember how a modest cut to the program sank a spending bill not long ago. \n The United States spends more than half a trillion dollars on defense, more than the next seven countries combined. But Trump has signaled he would make the Pentagon the big winner with a $54 billion boost to defense spending. \n Democrats are unlikely to support the cuts, and Republican defections raise the possibility of a congressional train wreck and a potential government shutdown when the 2018 budget year begins Oct. 1. \n The budget, known as a \"skinny budget,\" was unlikely to have many of the details expected on Capitol Hill. It will be limited to the discretionary, $1 trillion-plus portion of the $4 trillion annual federal budget that pays for Cabinet agencies and departments. \n The remainder of Trump's budget \u2014 proposals on taxes, mandatory spending and deficits and projections on the economy \u2014 won't come out until May. \n Preliminary reports on the budget show some domestic Cabinet agencies, such as the departments of Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, would see increases, including $3 billion for Trump's promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. \n People familiar with the budget who spoke on condition of anonymity in advance of the public release say the White House is seeking a 30 percent cut from an Energy Department office that promotes energy efficiency and renewable energy. The office has funded research on projects such as LED light bulbs, electric trucks, advanced batteries and biofuels. \n The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is targeted for at least $700 million in cuts from its current $2.1 billion budget, said Scott Sklar, chairman of the steering committee of the Sustainable Energy Coalition. \n The Energy Department could see steep cuts for its 17 national laboratories, which conduct cutting-edge research on topics from nuclear power to advanced materials for energy generation, storage and use. \n Trump's preliminary budget, delivered in secret to agencies last month, proposes a 37 percent cut to the State Department and foreign aid budgets. Those cuts and others were subject to revision in the back-and-forth the White House had with agencies leading up to the release this week. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's first budget boosts military, cuts domestic programs"}

The tribes maintain an oil pipeline under the lake they consider sacred violates their religious rights, but Boasberg says the argument was made too late and is of questionable merit. \n The judge also said ETP would be \"substantially harmed\" by a delay, as it prepares to move oil through the pipeline as early as Monday. \n Both ETP and the Army Corps of Engineers had objected to the tribes' latest attempt to halt the project, with Corps attorneys saying in court documents that President Donald Trump \"has expressly determined that the pipeline is 'in the national interest.'\" \n The Corps last month granted ETP permission to lay pipe under the reservoir that it manages for the federal government, after Trump in January urged the project's completion after months of legal delays. \n The court battle isn't over. Aside from the tribes' appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on the religion argument, the tribes in their lawsuit before Boasberg are arguing for more environmental study and for the government to recognize the tribes' treaty rights to clean water. \n The Corps on Tuesday filed its opposition to those requests, saying the agency's permission for the Lake Oahe work \"represents the culmination of over two years of detailed environmental analysis and extensive consultation with (the tribes).\" \n The pipeline saga also has endured for months outside of the courtroom, with about 750 arrests of protesters in southern North Dakota from August through February.

Doug Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem to drop or consider dropping charges against protesters, review police practices and open independent investigations into several specific cases. \n Police have defended their practices, which have included water sprays, tear gas and non-lethal ammunition such as rubber bullets.

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., as seen in May 2007. Reports of sexual assaults increased at two of the three military academies last year and an anonymous survey suggests sexual misconduct rose across the board at the schools, The Associated Press has learned. \n WASHINGTON >> Reports of sexual assaults increased at two of the three military academies last year and an anonymous survey suggests sexual misconduct rose across the board at the schools, The Associated Press has learned. \n The new data underscore the challenge in stemming bad behavior by young people at the military college campuses, despite a slew of programs designed to prevent assaults, help victims and encourage them to come forward. The difficulties in some ways mirror those the larger military is struggling with amid revelations about Marines and other service members sharing nude photos on websites. \n Assault reports rose at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, while dropping at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado. The Air Force decline was sharp, going to 32 last year from 49 in 2015, contributing to an overall decrease in the overall number of reported assaults at the academies. The total reported cases fell to 86 from 91 in 2015, according to details obtained by The Associated Press. \n Pentagon and military officials believe more people are reporting sexual assaults, which they see as a positive trend because it suggests students have more confidence in the system and greater willingness to seek help. \n But the anonymous survey results suggest more assaults and crime occurring. They showed more than 12 percent of women and nearly 2 percent of men saying they experienced unwanted sexual contact. \n In that survey, the largest increases in sexual misconduct were also at the Navy and Army academies. A vast majority of students said they didn't file a report on the assault because they didn't consider it serious enough. Many women said they took steps to avoid the perpetrator, while more than a third of the men said they confronted the person. \n Senior defense officials expressed disappointment. They were particularly concerned that more men and women said they experienced unwanted sexual contact. The rate two years ago was about 8 percent of women and 1 percent of men. \n \"This is almost a new population of folks every four years and that makes it a little bit more difficult for the messages to build up and gather momentum,\" said Nate Galbreath, deputy director of the Pentagon's sexual assault prevention office. \n Officials struggled to identify a reason. They said some blame may fall on student leaders and how much they are willing to emphasize and enforce sexual assault prevention programs among peers. \n \"Unless the students have a bit of accountability on their own, unless they take the charge themselves, (senior) leadership can really only take them so far,\" said Elizabeth Van Winkle, who is currently the assistant defense secretary for readiness. \"If the students aren't taking the charge themselves, you won't make as much headway in this population.\" \n Galbreath said sexual assault prevention instruction may be getting lost amid the many messages about social behavior, including not drinking and driving, or texting and driving. \n The Pentagon, he said, is encouraging the academies to increase the amount of time they spend talking about how future leaders must foster a climate of dignity and respect. He said students should know that enforcing good conduct is something they will need to do as officers when they graduate and lead troops in combat. \n In recent months, military leaders have met to try and find what Galbreath called the \"holy grail of prevention.\" \n One example, he said, would involving taking more to the students about when and how to intervene when they see a bad situation developing. Such scenarios include when they are in a bar drinking or in a workplace in which a boss is the problem. \n \"What we want those folks to do at the academies is to find those things that seem to really be hallmark situations and help people be better scouts and identify those precursors earlier and also give them a wider range of things that they might be able to do to intervene,\" Galbreath said. \n Galbreath and Van Winkle said drinking remains a major concern, factoring in about 60 percent of incidents women cite and nearly half of those men cite. They said the academies have been putting alcohol programs in place, including some that require students to take a class before turning 21. \n Sexual harassment reports filed by students dropped at all three academies. \n The overall total fell to 10 last year from 28 in 2015. The anonymous survey showed roughly half of the women and slightly more than 10 percent of men saying they were sexually harassed, near the same level as the previous survey. The surveys are conducted every two years. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Sex assault reports up at Navy, Army academies"}

The danger is clear. The law is clear. The need for my executive order is clear.\" \n After hearing arguments this morning in a Honolulu federal courtroom, U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson granted the state's motion for a nationwide temporary restraining order on the revised travel ban, saying Trump's order violates the religious establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution. \n \"The illogic of the government's contentions is palpable,\" Watson wrote. \"The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed.\" \n UPDATE: 1:45 p.m. \n A federal court judge in Honolulu today granted Hawaii's request to block President Donald Trump's revised travel ban a day before it was schedule to go into effect. \n In awarding a nationwide temporary restraining order, U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson found that Trump's order violates the religious establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution. \n Watson said that while the new order is more narrowly focused, he can't ignore what Trump said on the campaign trail, including in a March 2016 interview in which he said, \"I think Islam hates us,\" and an October interview in which he said the Muslim ban has morphed into extreme vetting. \n Watson issued his 43-page ruling early this afternoon after hearing arguments from both sides this morning. He said the state \"preliminarily demonstrated\" that its universities will suffer monetary damages and intangible harms and the state's economy is likely to suffer a loss of revenue due to a decline in tourism because of the order. \n Watson, who was appointed to the court by former President Barack Obama, said he intends to set an expedited hearing to determine whether the temporary restraining order should be extended. \n Hawaii was the first state to challenge the president's revised executive order, which replaced the original Jan. 27 edict that barred the residents of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.

Other tweaks were made in an effort to make it pass legal muster, including the removal of language offering preferential status to persecuted religious minorities. \n Attorneys representing the state said the revised order is just as discriminatory against Muslims as the first one and that it still violates both the U.S. constitution and federal laws. \n They said the order will hurt Hawaii's tourism as well as its universities and and businesses that rely on international recruiting of students and employees. Ultimately, they said, it will hurt the state's economy. \n But government attorneys said it is mere speculation the order will hurt the state's tourism industry and universities. \n The order, they said, was modified with a religion-neutral text that does not discriminate and also includes a waiver process to help reduce any undue hardship. \n Government attorneys argued that the president's action is consistent with the executive's constitutional authority over foreign affairs and national security. \n But state attorneys said the order flies in the face of Hawaii's and the nation's values.

That order was blocked by a federal appeals court. \n The new order, issued March 6, prohibits individuals from six countries if they lack valid U.S. visas.

They said an injunction would merely retain the status quo while the court fully considers the issue. \n Hawaii's lawsuit includes a Muslim plaintiff, Ismail Elshikh, the imam of a Honolulu mosque. He says the ban prevents his mother-in-law, who lives in Syria, from visiting family in Hawaii. \n It's not clear when Watson will rule on the state's request for a temporary restraining order. \n Attorneys from the Washington, D.C., law firm Hawaii has hired will participate by phone. Justice Department attorneys are also phoning in for the hearing. \n Fourteen state attorneys general and 58 technology companies have filed amicus briefs supporting Hawaii's challenge. The attorneys general argue that the revised ban retains the unconstitutional components of the original order, including a broad ban on entry by nationals from six predominantly Muslim countries and a suspension of the refugee program. \n Hawaii is one of several states where the travel ban is being challenged before its planned implementation Thursday. \n In Maryland today, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang said he will issue a ruling in another lawsuit challenging the travel ban, but he did not promise that he would rule before the ban takes effect at 12:01 a.m. Thursday. He also said he may issue a narrow ruling that does not address the ban nationwide. \n The lawsuit in Maryland was filed by the ACLU and other groups representing immigrants and refugees, as well as some individual plaintiffs. They argue banning travel from six majority-Muslim countries is unconstitutional discrimination on the basis of religion. They also say it's illegal for Trump to reduce the number of refugees allowed into the United States this year by more than half. \n Government lawyers argued the ban was revised significantly to address legal concerns and no longer singles out Muslims. \n In Seattle, U.S. District Judge James Robart will hear arguments today in the lawsuit brought by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The group says the new version of the travel ban discriminates against Muslims and raises the same legal issues as the original. \n Robart also is overseeing the legal challenge brought by Washington state. He also issued the order halting nationwide implementation of the first ban. Among the plaintiffs in the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project case is a legal permanent resident who has been trying to bring her 16-year-old son from war-torn Syria. \n The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n Back to top \n ", "author": "By Timothy Hurley thurley@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Trump vows to appeal travel ban ruling by federal judge in Hawaii"}

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. spoke during a March 8 news conference at the Republican National Committee Headquarters on Capitol Hill in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> A substantial 12 million people have enrolled for coverage this year under the very health care statute that President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress want to erase, the government said today. \n With a crunch-time House vote on a GOP bill replacing that law planned for next week, Vice President Mike Pence ensured conservative lawmakers that the administration was open to changes. \n Pence's trip to the Capitol, and an evening all-hands meeting of House Republicans to count votes, came as GOP leaders strained to win backing for besieged legislation that's uniformly opposed by Democrats. The bill would strike down much of former President Barack Obama's 2010 overhaul and reduce the federal role, including financing, for the nation's health care consumers. \n \"Where is the sweet spot, that's what we're working on,\" said Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., among the conservatives who met with Pence. He said the vice president's pitch was: \"The process is open, we're still working on it, bring your ideas forward and let's get a bill done.\" \n With opposition from conservative and moderate GOP lawmakers endangering the measure in the House and Senate, President Donald Trump was expected to urge lawmakers to back the bill in remarks in Nashville, Tennessee. Health secretary Tom Price was using phone calls to lobby Republican governors, some of whom \u2014 with home-state GOP members of Congress \u2014 oppose the bill's phaseout of Obama's expansion of Medicaid to 11 million additional lower-income Americans. \n Underscoring GOP leaders' push-and-pull problem, around 60 conservatives who met with Pence proposed revisions in the other direction, including a hastening of the Medicaid expansion phaseout to 2018 instead of the legislation's 2020. \n \"He gave us a lot of hope,\" said Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., leader of the group that met with Pence. \n The White House, GOP leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers were negotiating over modifications that could be made when the bill reaches the House floor. On CNN, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said changes might give states more \"flexibility\" to oversee Medicaid. \n In the Senate, the GOP's 52-48 edge and widespread dissension leaves leaders little leeway. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, expressed worries about higher costs on seniors and predicted the Senate would reject the bill without changes. \n Conservatives want deeper cuts in the overall Medicaid program than the Republican bill plans and a work requirement for able-bodied constituents. They're also seeking less generous tax credits for people's health care costs and elimination of Obama's insurance requirements, including mandatory coverage of specified services like drug counseling. \n Every one of those proposals would endanger support from moderates. \n \"This is going to take a lot of political capital from the president\" and congressional leaders, said Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Fla. \n The bill would enfeeble Obama's individual mandate \u2014 the requirement that Americans buy coverage \u2014 by abolishing the tax fine on violators. It would end subsidies that help low-income people with high insurance premiums the most and replace them with tax credits that are bigger for older people. It would cut Medicaid, repeal the law's tax increases on higher earning Americans and allow 30 percent higher premiums for consumers who let coverage lapse. \n The latest government sign-up numbers missed Obama's target of 13.8 million people for 2017. The figures represent initial enrollment, and there's usually significant attrition over the course of a year. \n Nonetheless, experts said the report undercuts Republican claims that the health law's insurance markets are teetering toward collapse, which they say makes repealing the law crucial. \n \"While there's a big debate in Washington about the future of the Affordable Care Act, the law remains in place for now and is covering millions of people,\" said the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt, using the formal name of Obama's statute. \n The official national figure of 12.2 million excludes 765,000 people signed up under a related Obama-era law used by New York and Minnesota. \n The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the figures a day before the House Budget Committee plans to advance the GOP bill in a potentially tight vote. The committee can't make significant changes, but Republicans were expected to approve non-binding suggestions to nail down votes. \n GOP support became scarcer when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found this week that the legislation would push 24 million Americans off coverage in a decade and shift out-of-pocket costs toward lower income, older people. That's 4 million more than the 20 million who've gained either Medicaid or insurance coverage under Obama's law. \n Hundreds of conservative activists rallied outside the Capitol in sub-freezing weather to call on congressional leaders and Trump to abandon the GOP bill and fully repeal Obama's law. The rally was organized by FreedomWorks, a conservative group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers. \n \"They're telling us that you campaigned for Obamacare light and you want partial repeal!\" said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., among conservative lawmakers who say the House GOP bill is too timid. \n \"No!\" the crowd replied. \n Nevada GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval, who expanded Medicaid coverage to over 300,000 additional people in his state, said in a phone call, Price promised \"flexibility\" in administering the program. \n Associated Press writers Erica Werner in Washington, David Pitt in Des Moines, Iowa and Alison Noon in Carson City, Nevada, contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "12M enroll in health law Trump, GOP are trying to repeal"}

A ground crew removed Esterbrook from the wreckage and began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. \n But Esterbrook was pronounced dead at the scene by the White County Coroner's Office. \n The National Transportation Board and the Federal Aviation Administration have been notified, Riley said. \n Esterbrook's sister-in-law, former Miss Hawaii Luana Alapa, said her cousin lives in Indiana and reported that winds were blowing so hard the day of Esterbrook's crash that cars were getting pushed off of the freeway. \n \"The winds in Indiana that day were unusually high,\" Alapa said. \"You would think he would get shot down in Afghanistan. But, no, it was the wind.\" \n Brad Hayes, executive director of Naval Air Museum Barbers Point, regularly flew with Esterbrook when they worked for Maui-based Pacific Helicopters that operated across the islands. \n Whatever happened to Esterbrook in Indiana must have been unexpected, Hayes said. \n Esterbrook had logged more than 20,000 hours flying helicopters and \"had all the flying survival skills, all the tricks up his sleeve and a thinking man's approach to all these jobs,\" Hayes said. \"Based on this guy's skill level, it was something that wasn't controllable or even foreseeable. It snuck up on him and he didn't even see it. Whatever went wrong, went wrong quick.\" \n Esterbrook had served for 17 years in the Hawaii Army National Guard, left to fly civilian helicopters for utility and environmental jobs, then lost 150 pounds before re-enlisting in the Guard three years ago, his wife said. He was planning to be redeployed to the Middle East later this year, she said. \n Esterbrook is survived by his wife, who runs a company called Ohelo's Mango Chutneys; daughter Taylor Esterbrook of Waianae; and brother Michael Uchida of Kahala. \n Esterbrook had requested that his ashes be scattered in the waters off of Diamond Head, Alapa said. \n Services are pending. \n ", "author": "By Dan Nakaso dnakaso@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Hawaii Guard pilot dies in private copter crash in Indiana"}

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A horse and buggy drove through a winter snow storm, Tuesday, in Gap, Pa. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A gust of wind blew snow back at Roger Lane, a custodian at Yonkers Public School 17, as he cleared a sidewalk in front of the school with a snow blower during a snow storm, Tuesday, in New York. \n NEW YORK >> Plunging temperatures ushered in by the storm that plastered the Northeast turned the snow and sleet into rock-solid ice, leaving roads and sidewalks treacherous today and making shoveling seem like hard labor. \n Tuesday's powerful nor'easter paralyzed much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor, but fell short of the predicted snowfall totals in New York, Boston and Philadelphia. \n The storm, which followed a stretch of unusually mild winter weather, dumped 1 to 2 feet in many places, grounded more than 1,000 flights today after 6,200 flights were canceled a day earlier. It also knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward. \n By the time it reached Massachusetts, it had turned into a blizzard, with near hurricane-force winds gusting to over 70 mph along the coast. Boston ended up with 6.6 inches of snow, far less than what was predicted. \n Boston canceled school for a second day today to allow time for cleanup efforts. Mayor Marty Walsh said he made the call out of \"an abundance of caution.\" \n The storm was easily the biggest in an otherwise merciful winter that had mostly spared the region. Many, like retired gumball machine technician Don Zimmerman, of Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, weren't happy. \n \"It's horrible,\" Zimmerman said, using a snowblower to clear the sidewalk along his block. \"I thought winter was out of here. \u2026 It's a real kick in the rear.\" \n While most people heeded the warnings to stay off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and crashed into a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. \n In East Hartford, Connecticut, an elderly man died after being struck by a snow plow truck. And, in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, a public works employee was killed after the snow plow he was driving was hit by an Amtrak plow train clearing tracks. \n The storm closed schools in cities big and small, Amtrak suspended service and the post office halted mail delivery. The number of flight cancellations reached more than 3,000 in the New York City area alone, stranding hundreds of passengers. \n The storm was on track to be one of the biggest on record for Burlington, Vermont, which got 25.6 inches of snow as of this morning, with another 2 to 5 inches due by the end of the day. About 70 miles to the northeast, Jay led the way with 34 inches. \n Philadelphia and New York City got anywhere from a few inches of snow to around half a foot before it switched over to sleet. Forecasters had predicted a foot or more. In New Jersey, which saw rain or just a little snow, Gov. Chris Christie called the storm an \"underperformer.\" \n Inland areas, meanwhile, got hit hard. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Worcester, Massachusetts, received a foot or more of snow. The Binghamton, New York, area got over 2 feet, while Vernon, New Jersey, had at least 19 inches. \n The storm came just days after the region saw temperatures climb into the 60s, and less than a week before the official start of spring. \n In the nation's capital, non-essential federal employees were given the option of reporting three hours late, taking the day off or working from home. The city got less than 2 inches of snow. \n A few days ago, workers on Washington's National Mall were making plans to turn on the fountains. \n \"Obviously all that has to come to an abrupt stop until we get all the snow cleared,\" said Jeff Gowen, the acting facility manager for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \"The cherry blossoms, they're right on the cusp of going into bloom here. I had a feeling this was going to happen.\" \n As the storm closed in, the National Weather Service used terms like \"life-threatening\" and urged people to \"shelter in place,\" language that has come to be associated with mass shootings. In the end, the line between snow and rain shifted slightly to the west, sparing some of the Northeast's big cities. \n Government meteorologists realized by late Monday afternoon that there was a good chance the storm wasn't going to produce the giant big-city snow totals predicted. But they didn't change their forecast for fear people would mistakenly think the storm was no longer dangerous, said Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the Weather Prediction Center. \n In Narragansett, Rhode Island, high winds buckled a state-owned wind turbine. In New York City, two homes under construction collapsed near the waterfront in Far Rockaway. No injuries were reported. \n And two ponies broke out of their stables and roamed the snowy streets of Staten Island until an off-duty police officer wrangled them with straps normally used to tow cars and tied them to a lamppost. They were taken back to the stables. \n The storm coincided with New Hampshire's Town Meeting Day, a Yankee tradition in which voters in more than 100 communities elect local politicians and set budgets. \n Some towns postponed the meetings because of the snow. But in Hopkinton, a steady stream of voters braved the blustery conditions. \n \"You know, they're hardy New Englanders, and they're coming to vote,\" said Debbie Norris, a candidate for the Hopkinton Budget Committee. \n Associated Press writers Mark Scolforo in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania; Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Michael Hill and John Kekis in Albany, New York; Mark Pratt in Boston; Bruce Shipkowski in Trenton, New Jersey; Michelle R.

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump listened, Monday, during a meeting on health care in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump earned $153 million and paid $36.5 million in income taxes in 2005, paying a roughly 25 percent effective tax rate thanks to a tax he has since sought to eliminate, according to newly disclosed tax documents. \n The pages from Trump's federal tax return show the real estate mogul also reported a business loss of $103 million that year, although the documents don't provide detail. The forms show that Trump paid an effective tax rate of 24.5 percent, a figure well above the roughly 10 percent the average American taxpayer forks over each year, but below the 27.4 percent that taxpayers earning 1 million dollars a year average were paying at the time, according to data from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \n The tax form was obtained by Pulitzer prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston, who runs the website DCReport.org, and reported on MSNBC's \"The Rachel Maddow Show.\" Johnston, who has long reported on tax issues, said he received the documents in the mail, unsolicited. \n Trump took to Twitter early today to cast doubt on Johnston's account. \n \"Does anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, 'went to his mailbox' and found my tax returns? NBCNews FAKE NEWS!\" \n Johnston, speaking to ABC's \"Good Morning America\" today, said it's entirely possible that he received the returns from Trump himself or someone close to him, saying, \"Donald has a long history of leaking things about himself.\" \n He noted that the real question remains the sources of Trump's income, saying Trump doesn't want us to know \"who he's beholden to.\" \n Trump's hefty business loss appears to be a continued benefit from his use of a tax loophole in the 1990s, which allowed him to deduct his creditors' losses on Trump's failing casinos as his own business losses, which Trump then used to offset his personal taxes in future years. In 1995, Trump reported a loss of more than $900 million \u2014 an amount that had dwindled to $103 million by the 2005 filing. \n Tax records obtained by The New York Times last year showed the losses were so large they could have allowed Trump to avoid paying taxes for up to 18 years. But Trump's 2005 filing shows that another tax prevented him from realizing the full benefit of those deductions. \n The bulk of Trump's tax bill that year was due to the Alternative Minimum Tax, a tax aimed at preventing high-income earners from paying minimal taxes. \n The AMT requires many taxpayers to calculate their taxes twice \u2014 once under the rules for regular income tax and then again under AMT \u2014 and then pay the higher amount. Critics say the tax has ensnared more middle-class people than intended, raising what they owe the federal government each year. \n Were it not for the AMT, Trump would have avoided all but a few million dollars of his 2005 tax bill. \n Trump's campaign website called for the end of the AMT, which is expected to bring in more than $350 billion in revenues from 2016 to 2025. \n As a candidate and as president, Trump has refused to release his tax returns, breaking a decades-long tradition. Although he initially promised to do so, he later claimed he was under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and said his attorneys had advised against it \u2014 though experts and IRS officials said such audits don't bar taxpayers from releasing their returns. \n The White House pushed back even before the release of the documents Tuesday night, saying that publishing the information was illegal. \n \"You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago,\" the White House said in a statement issued on condition that it be attributed to an anonymous official, although the president has decried the use of anonymous sources. \n The unauthorized release or publishing of federal tax returns is a criminal offense, punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 and up to five years in jail. But Maddow argued that MSNBC was exercising its First Amendment right to publish information in the public interest. \n Trump long insisted the American public wasn't interested in his returns and said little could be learned from them. But Trump's full returns would contain key details about things like his charitable giving, his income sources, the type of deductions he claimed, how much he earned from his assets and what strategies Trump used to reduce his tax bill. \n The issue was a major point of attack from his election rival Hillary Clinton, who suggested Trump had something to hide. \n The White House has not said whether the president plans to release his returns while he's in office. More than 1 million people have signed a White House petition urging the president to release them. \n Associated Press writer Jonathan Lemire in New York and Vivian Salama in Washington contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump blasts release of 2005 tax form, reporter's account"}

{"date": "March 15, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Yahoo logo outside of the offices in Santa Clara, Calif., as seen in April 2011. A law enforcement official said the Justice Department is preparing to announce charges against four defendants, including two officers of Russian security services, in a mega data breach at Yahoo. \n WASHINGTON >> The United States announced charges Wednesday against two Russian intelligence officers and two hackers, accusing them of a mega data breach at Yahoo that affected at least a half-billion user accounts. \n The hack targeted the email accounts of Russian and U.S. officials, Russian journalists, and employees of financial services and other businesses, officials said. \n \"We will not allow individuals, groups, nation-states or a combination of them to compromise the privacy of our citizens, the economic interests of our companies, or the security of our country,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord. \n One of the defendants has been taken into custody in Canada, and another is on the list of the FBI's most wanted cyber criminals. \n The charges arise from a compromise of Yahoo user accounts that began at least as early as 2014. Though the Justice Department has previously charged Russian hackers with cybercrime \u2014 as well as hackers sponsored by the Chinese and Iranian governments \u2014 this is the first criminal case brought against Russian government officials. \n The announcement comes as federal authorities investigate Russian interference through hacking in the 2016 presidential election. \n Yahoo didn't disclose the 2014 breach until last September when it began notifying at least 500 million users that their email addresses, birth dates, answers to security questions and other personal information may have been stolen. Three months later, Yahoo revealed it had uncovered a separate hack in 2013 affecting about 1 billion accounts, including some that were also hit in 2014. \n In a statement, Chris Madsen, Yahoo's assistant general counsel and head of global security, thanked law enforcement agencies for their work. \n \"We're committed to keeping our users and our platforms secure and will continue to engage with law enforcement to combat cybercrime,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Russian hackers charged in massive Yahoo breach"}
