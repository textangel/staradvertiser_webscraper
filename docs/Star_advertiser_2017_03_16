{"date": "March 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this, the 100th anniversary of Marquette basketball and 40th anniversary of the Al McGuire-coached team winning the national title, current coach Steve Wojciechowski is marking his own important milestone. The Golden Eagles are back in the NCAA tournament after a four-year absence. \n A look at some interesting things in Friday's opening round the NCAA Tournament: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THIRD CHANCE \n Marquette graduate transfer Katin Reinhardt will play with his third school in the NCAA Tournament. \n The 6-foot-6 Reinhardt played with UNLV as a freshman in 2012-13 and after a redshirt transfer season he played for Southern Cal in 2014-15 and 2015-16. This season he's with Marquette, which opens play Friday against South Carolina. His NCAA Tournament record is 1-2. \n \"It's a blessing for me to be part of the three teams that have been in the NCAA Tournament,\" said Reinhardt, who averaged 10.9 points and 2.8 rebounds. \"I've just been fortunate to be on teams that are good enough to make it in March.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE \n The Marquette-South Carolina game matches the top 3-point shooting team in the country against one of the top defensive teams against the 3. \n Marquette leads the nation in 3-point shooting at 43 percent. The Gamecocks are fifth in Division I in guarding the 3, 29.3 percent. \n \"We've seen that they like to pressure the ball, and pressure off the ball as well,\" freshman guard Markus Howard said. \"So just pinpointing that in preparation for us has been a key part of what we've been doing to practice and prepare for South Carolina.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n SHOOTING WOES \n North Carolina's Justin Jackson, the Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year, has been in a bit of a shooting slump. \n \"My confidence isn't gone. I mean, it was four games that I have not shot the ball well. And that's all it is,\" Jackson said. \"And so for me, still going to shoot the ball the same way, still going to be aggressive, still going to do everything I've been doing all year. \n \"It's not like all of a sudden the world is ending. And I got in the gym a bunch after the ACC Tournament. And I've been doing the same exact things I've been doing all year,\" Jackson said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n FIRST No. 1? \n No No. 16 seed has beaten a No. 1 seed since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. No. 1 North Carolina faces No. 16 Texas Southern on Friday. \n \"I'll tell you what,\" Tar Heels coach Roy Williams said. \"Every coach of the No. 1 always worries like the dickens about it the night before. It's something you always think about. \n \"I forget what year it was, but I'm going to guess 2002, when I was at Kansas, we were right there. We were a 1 seed in St. Louis playing against Holy Cross. And Kirk Hinrich got hurt during the course of the game. We were right there starting to make history and the kids made some big plays down the stretch and we ended up winning the game.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n ANOTHER LOOK \n Roy Williams gave the perspective of a No. 1 seed. Time for the other side of the matchup. \n \"We're going to come out and play right there, just anybody else at the park,\" Texas Southern graduate transfer Marvin Jones said. \"I'm not going to go out there, be timid or nervous just because their jersey says North Carolina or just because Roy's over there. \n \"I know how historic this program is. It's a blessing to be able to go up against those guys. But I'm going to go out and compete, like I was going up against Jackson State or anybody in the SWAC. That's not the problem for us because we all play versus high-level talent all our lives.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n FINDING MOTIVATION \n South Carolina hasn't won an NCAA Tournament game in 44 years. That is the same year Mac Credille started working at the school. Four years later, he became equipment manager, a post he has held since. \n \"We had Mac come talk to us,\" Sindarius Thornwell of the Gamecocks said. \"Mac's been around the program longer than anybody than I know. And he came and talked to us and told us how much it means for him for us to just make the tournament and how much it would mean for him to just, for us to win that win first game.\" \n \"We all have a relationship with him and how much he loves and cares for the program and the work he put in goes unnoticed,\" Thornwell said. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n FAMILIAR FOE \n Southern Cal faces SMU in an 11-6 matchup Friday. The two met earlier this season with the Trojans coming away with a 78-73 victory, one of just four losses on the season for the Mustangs, who have won 16 straight and 26 of 27. \n \"A lot of people said so what, you beat SMU? And I was trying to tell people that SMU is going to be one of the best teams we face all year,\" Trojans coach Andy Enfield said. \"Offensively, they can score at every position. And defensively they're extremely solid and they hold teams about 60 points. So I was their biggest fan when we played them in November, and I'm still their biggest fan.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "A look at Friday's opening round of the NCAA Tournament"}

{"date": "March 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, center, visits with U.S. Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, commander of the United Nations Command, Combined Forces Command and United States Forces Korea, right, at the border village of Panmunjom, which has separated the two Koreas since the Korean War. \n CAMP BONIFAS, South Korea >> U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited the world's most heavily armed border, greeting U.S. soldiers on guard near the tense buffer zone between rivals North and South Korea. \n Tillerson touched down by helicopter Friday at Camp Bonifas, a U.S. base about 400 meters (438 yards) from the Demilitarized Zone, a Cold War vestige created after the Korean War ended in 1953. He planned to then move to the truce village of Panmunjom inside the DMZ, a cluster of blue huts where the Korean War armistice was signed. \n Tillerson is the latest in a parade of senior U.S. officials to have their photos taken at the border. But it's the first trip by the new Trump administration's senior diplomat as he makes a tour of Japan, South Korea and China. \n Speaking in Tokyo, Tillerson earlier vowed a tougher strategy to confront North Korea's nuclear threat. But he offered no details about what would comprise the \"different approach\" to North Korea the U.S. will pursue. He pointedly noted that 20 years of \"diplomatic and other efforts\" had failed to dissuade the isolated communist government from developing its nuclear program, which he called an \"ever-escalating threat.\" \n The DMZ, which is both a tourist trap and a potential flashpoint, is guarded on both sides with land mines, razor wire fence, tank traps and hundreds of thousands of combat-ready troops. More than a million mines are believed to be buried inside the DMZ. Land mine explosions in 2015 that Seoul blamed on Pyongyang maimed two South Korean soldiers and led the rivals to threaten each other with attacks. \n Hordes of tourists visit both sides, despite the lingering animosity. The Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, which means the Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war. \n President Donald Trump is seen as seeking to examine all options \u2014 including military ones \u2014 for halting the North's weapons programs before Pyongyang becomes capable of developing a nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the U.S. mainland. \n Central to the U.S. review is China and its role in any bid to persuade Pyongyang to change course. China remains the North's most powerful ally. \n While the U.S. and its allies in Seoul and Tokyo implore Beijing to press its economic leverage over North Korea, the Chinese have emphasized their desire to relaunch diplomatic talks \u2014 a non-starter for the U.S. under current conditions. \n The U.S. and China also disagree over U.S. deployment of a missile defense system to South Korea. The U.S. says it's a system focused on North Korea. China sees it as a threat to its own security. \n State Department officials have described Tillerson's effort this week as a \"listening tour\" as the administration seeks a coherent North Korea policy, well-coordinated with its Asian partners. \n Last week, North Korea launched four missiles into seas off Japan, in an apparent reaction to major annual military drills the U.S. is currently conducting with South Korea. Pyongyang claims the drills are a rehearsal for invasion. \n In Beijing, a North Korean diplomat said Thursday that Pyongyang must act in self-defense against the drills, which he said have brought the region to the brink of nuclear war. He said the drills are aimed at using atomic weapons for a pre-emptive strike against North Korea. Washington says the maneuvers are routine and defensive. \n North Korea has accelerated its weapons development, violating multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions and appearing undeterred by tough international sanctions. The North conducted two nuclear test explosions and 24 ballistic missile tests last year. Experts say it could have a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the U.S. within a few years. \n During last year's election campaign, presidential candidate Donald Trump called into question U.S. security alliances and called for Tokyo and Seoul to contribute more for their defense. Tillerson, however, stressed that cooperation with Japan and South Korea was \"critical.\" \n Japan and South Korea both host tens of thousands of U.S. troops. Washington has been urging its two allies to step up security cooperation despite their historically strained relations. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tillerson gets a look at North Korea at the DMZ"}

The U.S. and its Asia-Pacific allies are rolling out their new stealth fighter jet, a cutting-edge plane that costs about $100 million each. \n The U.S. and its Asia-Pacific allies are rolling out their new stealth fighter jet, a cutting-edge plane that costs about $100 million each. \n The U.S. Air Force this week hosted allies and partners in Hawaii for a symposium on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which can sneak undetected behind enemy radar. \n Brig. Gen. Craig Wills, the strategic plans director at Pacific Air Forces, said the U.S. wanted to share its experiences with the F-35 and F-22, another stealth fighter, with allies and partners so they wouldn't have to learn everything on their own. \n The Air Force will use the F-35 to replace the A-10 and the F-16, and say it represents a \"quantum leap\" in air combat capability over these older planes. \n \"The idea with fifth generation is that we want to be able to operate in areas where others cannot, in places where our fourth generation airplanes can't fly,\" Wills said. \n The U.S. Marine Corps in January deployed 10 of the planes to a base in Japan. The U.S. Air Force plans to station the jet in Alaska within three years. \n Australia and Japan have already taken delivery of some of planes that they are using for pilot training in Arizona. South Korea is scheduled to get the plane next year. \n The F-35 is being built in different configurations for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. The Navy's version is designed to take off and land on an aircraft carrier. \n The F-35 had massive budget overruns early on, but analysts say the cost has stabilized and even dropped a bit after negotiations between the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin. \n Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Virginia-based think tank, said the F-35 can make a \"huge difference \" in places like North Korea, where it could defeat air defenses and take out threats before they could react. \n \"The F-35 could fly all the way from South Korea to the North Korean capital without anyone from North Korea knowing it was on its way,\" he said. \n The Air Force currently has 103 planes in its possession, including one fully operational fighter wing at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. \n Other than Alaska, Wills said the Air Force hasn't decided where in the Pacific it will station additional planes. Alaska's Eielson Air Force Base is expected to get two squadrons. \n The Air Force currently bases F-22 jets in Hawaii and Alaska. Wills said the F-22 was designed to face down other fighter jets in the air, but also have an ability to hit ground targets. The F-35 was designed to strike ground targets and for air-to-air combat. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pacific F-35 Symposium wraps up in Hawaii"}

{"date": "March 16, 2017", "text": "U.S. MARINE CORPS VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This undated image shows a billboard that the Corps will post as part of a new recruitment advertisement campaign, meant to draw millennials by showing Marines as not only strong warriors but good citizens. \n SAN DIEGO >> The Marine Corps is launching a new recruitment ad campaign meant to draw millennials by showing Marines as not only strong warriors but good citizens. \n \"Battles Won\" is the name of the campaign that includes TV ads and online clips of Marines unloading \"Toys for Tots\" boxes and real video of a Marine veteran tackling an armed robber. \n The campaign has been in the works for months, but its release comes as the Marine Corps' image has taken a beating amid an investigation into nude photos of female Marines posted without their consent on a private Facebook page used by Marines. \n The Marine Corp is in the process of trying to boost its numbers and recruit more women, and the new TV ads include clips of women in combat fatigues. But Marine Corps officials said the campaign is not aimed at a particular demographic other than those of recruiting age. \n The Marine Corps shared the campaign with The Associated Press ahead of its official rollout Friday in conjunction with the first weekend of the hugely popular March Madness college basketball games. \n The military's smallest branch is also considering replacing its iconic tagline, \"The Few. The Proud. The Marines\" \u2014 one of the most successful ad campaigns of the 20th century. \n The short, simple phrase highlighted the elite status given to Marine warfighters and drew recruits after the draft in the 1970s. It will continue for now as the Marine Corps' tagline in promotional materials or on the backs of T-shirts. \n Marine Corps officials said the branch needed a recruitment ad campaign that portrayed who Marines are and why the Marine Corps exists. \n \"Battles Won\" is designed to drive home the message that mental, moral and emotional strength are as important as physical toughness. The campaign was created around three concepts, fighting self-doubt, fighting the nation's battles and fighting for what's right, officials said. \n \"It focuses on what we believe is the irreducible essence of a Marine \u2014 which is the fighting spirit,\" said Lt. Col. John Caldwell, assistant chief of staff, marketing and public affairs at the Marine Corps Recruiting Command. \"It's the promise that we make that if there is a fight in which we engage in, we will win. We'll win that battle and also become a responsible member of our community post-service.\" \n The campaign comes as the Marine Corps aims to dramatically increase in size and add more women among its ranks, though Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller acknowledged the nude photo scandal may hurt female recruiting. Neller has said he wants women to make up 10 percent of the force, which currently has the lowest percentage of all the services at about 8 percent. Marine Corps officials also have said the 182,000-strong force should grow to at least 194,000. \n Neller has vowed to hold Marines accountable for the Facebook scandal and acknowledged that changes have to be made in the Marine Corps culture, where some male Marines don't accept women in the ranks. \n A Los Angeles marketing specialist, Isaac Swiderski, said the campaign spots fail to show women in leadership roles, which could have helped attract female recruits. But he noted the community service spots may appeal to millennials. \n A Marine veteran in Los Angeles, Michael Hjelmstad, said the campaign could help balance the public's view of the Marine Corps as it works to restore its image from the Facebook page scandal. \n \"Recent social media stuff has given a black eye to the whole family, and I think that's something the Marine Corps needs to deal with in a way of branding. So I think it's important now that they show what we're all about,\" he said. \"I think this campaign is trying to speak to the breadth of what the Marine Corps really is.\" \n There have been other campaigns like \"If Everybody Could Get In The Marines, It Wouldn't Be The Marines\" and \"We're Looking for a Few Good Men.\" \n But none has stuck like \"The Few. The Proud. The Marines.\" It was launched in 1977, a few years after the draft ended and the U.S. armed forces became an all-volunteer military. It is enshrined on the Advertising Walk of Fame on New York's Madison Avenue and embodied the prestige and feeling of exclusivity of serving in a branch often referred to as a \"brotherhood.\" That stood out among ads for the other branches that highlighted steady employment and job training. \n Despite its success, the Marine Corps is considering the possibility of inventing a new tagline that might resonate with today's generation. \n \"Whether or not a new tagline is introduced is to be determined,\" Caldwell said. He said he did not know when that decision would be made. \n The latest ad campaign was crafted by J. Walter Thompson, the same ad agency that created \"The Few. The Proud.\" \n Retired Marine Gary Solis, a Georgetown University law professor who served 26 years in the Corps, said the \"Battles Won\" message is diluted by trying to show the Marine Corps as a diverse organization that plays a role in everything from providing disaster relief to helping communities to fighting on the battlefield. \n \"What drew me into the Corps when I was 19 years old was that I was joining America's Spartans,\" he said. \"I have nothing against community service or good citizenship, of course, but it seems to me the primary strength of the Marine Corps is its renown as superior warfighters. But I'm not a recruiter's target anymore. Perhaps younger men and women are attracted by something different than I was. But I have my doubts.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New ads show Marines as good citizens, warriors"}

Carey, right, Executive Vice President of T-Mobile, next to City Manager T.C. Broadnax during a press conference about the 911 issue with T-Mobile at Dallas City Hall on Wednesday. \n DALLAS >> Dallas officials are working with T-Mobile engineers to determine what's prompting a flood of ghost calls that's forced hundreds of 911 calls to be placed on hold and may have slowed the emergency response to two people who died. \n Dallas resident David Taffet confronted Mayor Mike Rawlings at a news conference Wednesday to say it took 20 minutes to get through to 911 after his husband stopped breathing last week. At one point, Taffet was disconnected. He was placed on hold when he called back. Paramedics promptly arrived after he finally got through, but his husband later died at a hospital. \n \"I was just doing chest compressions on my husband and the call just dropped. I had to call back,\" said Taffet, who at one point asked of the mayor, \"How many others died?\" \n Rawlings said he apologized to the mother of a 6-month-old child who died during the weekend after falling from a bed. The child's baby sitter tried calling 911 three times but kept being placed on hold. \n Officials say phantom calls are coming into 911 from T-Mobile phones, leading to long wait times and delays in emergency response. \n City Manager T.C. Broadnax said at one point last week the city had 360 calls on hold. The problem began in October and officials thought it had been resolved in January when they no longer saw a spike in the phantom calls, Broadnax said. \n The city this week is increasing staffing levels at its 911 center and authorizing overtime shifts to ensure calls are being answered. \n Rawlings said the problem means the city isn't performing one of its core functions: ensuring people's safety. \n \"As you can well imagine this situation is very frustrating,\" he said, adding, \"This is the No. 1 priority we're facing right now as a city.\" \n Neville Ray, T-Mobile's chief technology officer, said the company, which is based in Bellevue, Washington, hasn't seen a similar problem anywhere else in the country. \n \"Clearly we are seeing a set of circumstances in Dallas which are unique,\" he said. \n Officials say engineers will examine how T-Mobile cellular technology and the city's 911 infrastructure interact with each other. Rawlings said one consideration is that the problem could be on the city 911 system's end. \n T-Mobile says its team will remain in Dallas until the matter is resolved. \n A state report released in 2014 by the Commission on State Emergency Communications notes 911 service will erode as new digital technology is introduced. The report says that's because existing 911 systems in Texas and other states are \"based on wireline technologies established decades ago.\" \n The phantom calls are happening at the same time Dallas-based AT&T experienced its own 911 problems. AT&T cellphone customers in Texas and other states were unable to call 911 for a time on March 8. The company has not explained the cause of the disruption. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Dallas scrambles to fix 911 delays in wake of 2 deaths"}

President Donald Trump wants to eliminate federal support of a program that addresses the Great Lakes' most pressing environmental threats. \n TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. >> It sounds like an idea that would warm a conservative Republican's heart: Kill funding of a regional environmental cleanup that has lasted seven years and cost the federal government more than $2 billion, with no end in sight. If states want to keep the program going, let them pick up the tab. \n That is what President Donald Trump's 2018 budget plan proposes for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, an ambitious push to fix problems that have long bedeviled the world's largest surface freshwater system \u2014 from invasive species to algal blooms and toxic sludge fouling tributary rivers. \n During the Obama administration, the program generally got about $300 million a year. Trump's offer is zero. His spending plan released Thursday says it \"returns the responsibility for funding local environmental efforts and programs to state and local entities, allowing EPA to focus on its highest national priorities.\" \n The response from Republicans in Great Lakes states: No, thanks. \n \"I think it makes sense for us to continue to make prudent investments in protecting and improving the Great Lakes,\" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker told The Associated Press, adding that he would lobby the Trump administration and congressional leaders to put the money back. \n Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan considers Great Lakes funding \"very important to Michiganders, therefore we know there is strong support among Michigan's congressional delegation and we will work with them to preserve the funding,\" spokeswoman Anna Heaton said. \n GOP lawmakers from the region also rushed out statements defending the program. It \"helps protect both our environment and our economy,\" U.S. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio said. \n The reaction illustrates a political fact of life: Whether you consider something in the budget valuable or wasteful can depend a lot on where you're from. \n And it underscores the resistance Trump may encounter to some spending cuts he is proposing for the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Interior and other agencies that draw frequent attacks from congressional Republicans yet fund projects and services with support back home. \n The president's spending blueprint also targets a Chesapeake Bay cleanup begun in 1983 that received $73 million last year, plus other \"geographic programs.\" It doesn't identify them, but a proposal by the Office of Management and Budget this month called for cutting all or most funding for San Francisco Bay, Puget Sound and the Gulf of Mexico. \n Asked for more details, EPA released a statement saying the plan \"reflects the president's priorities\" and that Administrator Scott Pruitt \"is committed to leading the EPA in a more effective, more focused, less costly way as we partner with states to fulfill the agency's core mission.\" \n The Great Lakes region includes swing states crucial to Trump's election \u2014 Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. There's also New York, Minnesota and Illinois. And Indiana, whose former governor, Mike Pence, is now Trump's vice president. \n Coincidentally, the budget plan was released as about 100 Great Lakes advocates paid a yearly visit to Washington, D.C., in support of the restoration initiative. They flocked to the offices of home-state lawmakers, reminding them that Congress voted only last year to extend the program another five years. \n \"We are going to turn once again to our bipartisan congressional champions,\" said Todd Ambs, director of the Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition. \n While Democratic lawmakers excoriated Trump's proposal \u2014 \"incredibly short-sighted and reckless,\" said Rep. Dan Kildee of Michigan \u2014 Republicans noted that former President Barack Obama at times recommended more modest reductions to the initiative, which Congress rejected. \n Some also pointed out that former President George W. Bush signed initial legislation authorizing a wide-ranging Great Lakes cleanup, although he sought little money for it. \n The initiative has funded nearly 3,000 projects across the eight states. Among them: efforts to prevent Asian carp from invading the lakes, prevent nutrient runoff that feeds harmful algal blooms, rebuild wetlands where fish spawn and remove sediments laced with PCBs and other toxins. \n Nearly all the federal grants require cost-share payments from a state, local or tribal agency, or perhaps a nonprofit organization. But Ambs said they can't afford to shoulder the burden alone. \n Without federal support, \"all of this restoration work would come to a halt,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Republicans join Democrats against Trump's Great Lakes cuts"}

If there is no appeal, the Federal Court will hear a class-action suit by detainees who say a blanket ban on phones in all Australian immigration detention centers would be illegal. \n The ban would affect hundreds of detainees on the Australian mainland and on the Australian territory of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. \n The phone ban would not apply to asylum seekers who attempted to reach Australia by boat and have been sent to immigration camps on the Pacific island nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea. \n Most asylum seekers arrive in Australia by plane and are kept in mainland detention centers along with foreign nationals who have breached their visa conditions and criminals who are awaiting deportation after serving prison sentences. \n The Department of Immigration and Border Protection had planned to confiscate all phones last month, but human rights lawyers obtained an injunction allowing inmates to keep in contact with the outside world until the legality of the new policy is decided. \n George Newhouse, a senior lawyer at the National Justice Project that initiated the legal challenge, said that while phones are banned in Australian prisons, asylum seekers should not be treated like criminals. \n \"Seeking asylum does not make you a criminal. Mobile phones provide asylum seekers with vital access to the outside world, to loved ones and to advocates \u2014 their mental health and their families depend on this,\" Newhouse said. \n \"The blanket ban on phones punishes innocent men, women and children and demonstrates the increasing criminalization by this government of asylum seekers who have committed no crime,\" he added. \n Border Force Commissioner Roman Quaedvlieg told a Senate committee last month the ban was needed to prevent plotting of escapes and drug crimes. \n \"I cannot countenance running a custodial setting \u2026 that allows mobile phones to be used as an enabler to crime,\" he said. \n The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the court decision. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Setback for Australia's ban on phones in immigrant detention"}

I didn't do nothing,\" said Jose Gonzalez, 25, who was set to be arraigned in a Bronx courtroom later Friday on charges including murder. \n In a twist, authorities said he lived on the same block as the Fire Department Emergency Medical Services technician he is accused of killing, Yadira Arroyo. \n Police said Gonzalez, who has 31 prior arrests, was high on drugs when he hopped on the back of Arroyo's ambulance as it drove through the Bronx on Thursday evening on its way to a routine medical call. He has a history of violent and erratic behavior with police, they said. \n Mayor Bill de Blasio said Arroyo, who was 44 and had five children, was \"bravely doing her job\" when she and a partner pulled over after being alerted that someone was on the back of the vehicle. \n When they got out to check things out, Gonzalez ran around the ambulance, got in and threw the vehicle in reverse, authorities said.

There was no immediate information on an attorney who could comment on his behalf.

{"date": "March 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A man stood in a poppy flower field that the government sprayed with an herbicide in the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains of Guerrero state, Mexico, on Jan. 27, 2015. \n MEXICO CITY >> A Mexican army general said his forces are increasingly coming under fire from drug traffickers protecting opium poppy plantations in Oaxaca state, where opium growers are moving production to take advantage of mountainous terrain and impoverished villages. \n Gen. Alfonso Duarte Mugica said Wednesday that army patrols were fired at twice this week as they tried to cut down poppy plantations in western Oaxaca. \n On Monday, an army helicopter searching for poppy fields was hit by gunfire from the ground, damaging the fuel tank. The chopper landed safely. \n He said a third army patrol was blocked from reaching about 30 poppy fields they could plainly see in the distance, by a demonstration of Indian residents, mostly women and children. Armed with only sticks and machetes, the Triquis stood in front of soldiers and refused to move. \n Duarte Mugica said the farm communities were being recruited by the cartels and acknowledged the army is walking a thin line in Oaxaca, where Indian communities jealously guard their territories and their rights. \n Any confrontation with Indians would be a public relations disaster. \n \"The presence of the military in this and other areas of the state is because of the important presence of opium poppy and marijuana fields that the drug cartels have been planting in the mountains of Oaxaca,\" Duarte Mugica said. \"I want to repeat that the Defense Department and particularly the soldiers of the 8th Region are respectful and sympathize with the traditions and practices of each of the Indian groups in Oaxaca state.\" \n The shift to Oaxaca has officials worried. The state is better known for its colonial capital and beaches, but its large impoverished Indian population and mountainous terrain could make it ideal for growing opium. \n The Mexican army faces a delicate task in moving into Oaxaca's notoriously conflictive Triqui Indian communities. \n The region has seen three Triqui groups locked in a decades-long armed struggle that has led to dozens of killings. \n One of those groups, known as the Triqui Unification and Struggle Movement, demanded this week that the army be withdrawn completely from the area. \n \"Now we have the Mexican army coming in by land under the pretext of searching for poppy plantations. They staged incursions all last week in our territory, and found only corn fields and more cornfields,\" the movement said in a statement. \"Get the army out of Triqui territory! No to the militarization of our country's indigenous lands!\" \n The idea that authorities are finding only corn fields is questionable; in recent months, unusually large poppy fields have been found in Oaxaca, whereas opium production used to be centered in neighboring Guerrero state. \n Increasing army raids in Guerrero \u2014 and the presence of a large number of violent small drug gangs who fight among themselves for the business of buying opium paste from farmers \u2014 have apparently made Oaxaca more attractive. And Oaxaca Indian groups like the Triquis have a long history of armed resistance. Dozens have been killed in the violence, including a Finnish rights observer. \n One striking aspect is the size of the opium fields the army is finding in Oaxaca. In Guerrero, such plantations rarely measure more than an acre (half hectare). \n But in February, federal police found a pair of poppy fields in other part of Oaxaca that measured almost 37 acres (15 hectares). \n Altogether, in the last year, Duarte Mugica said troops had destroyed a total of 1,747 acres (707 hectares) of poppy and marijuana fields, most of them poppies. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mexican cartels moving drug crops into Oaxaca state"}

{"date": "March 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump spoke at a rally Wednesday in Nashville, Tenn. \n SEATTLE >> Federal law gives the president broad authority over immigration. Jimmy Carter used it to deny some Iranians entry to the U.S. during the hostage crisis, Ronald Reagan to bar Cubans who didn't already have relatives here and President Obama to keep out North Korean officials. \n So why does President Donald Trump keep running into legal trouble with his efforts to freeze immigration by refugees and citizens of some predominantly Muslim nations? \n When federal courts in Hawaii and Maryland blocked Trump's revised travel ban from taking effect, the judges spelled out their major concern: the unusual record of statements by the president and his advisers suggesting the executive order's real purpose was to discriminate against Muslims, in violation of the Constitution's ban on officially favoring or disfavoring any religion. \n As the legal fight moves into the appeals courts, two key issues will be the extent of the president's broad immigration powers \u2014 and whether Trump's own record stymies his plans. \n THE RULINGS \n Neither U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang in Maryland nor Judge Derrick Watson bought the administration's reasoning that the travel ban is about national security. \n \"The history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the second executive order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban,\" Chuang wrote. \n Watson criticized what he called the \"illogic\" of the government's arguments and cited \"significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus\" behind the travel ban. He also noted that while courts should not examine the \"veiled psyche\" and \"secret motives\" of government decision-makers, \"the remarkable facts at issue here require no such impermissible inquiry.\" \n \"For instance, there is nothing 'veiled' about this press release: 'Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,'\" he wrote, referring to a statement Trump issued as a candidate. \n But the scope of the rulings differed. In a challenge brought by Hawaii, Watson blocked the federal government from enforcing its ban on travel from six mostly Muslim countries and its suspension of the nation's refugee program. Chuang only blocked the six-nation travel ban, saying it wasn't clear that the suspension of the refugee program was similarly motivated by religious bias. \n A federal judge in Seattle on Thursday ruled that his order blocking Trump's original travel ban does not apply to the revised executive order because there are enough differences between the two. \n Judge James Robart noted that Washington and several other states have also asked him to block the revised ban. He said he would rule on that request at a later date. \n APPEALS COMING \n Speaking Wednesday evening at a rally in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump called the ruling in Hawaii an example of \"unprecedented judicial overreach\" and said his administration would appeal it to the U.S. Supreme Court. He also called his new travel ban a watered-down version of the first one, which he said he wished he could implement. \n \"We're going to win. We're going to keep our citizens safe,\" the president said. \"The danger is clear. The law is clear. The need for my executive order is clear.\" \n White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday that the Justice Department was exploring its options, but that it expected to file an appeal of the Maryland ruling with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and to seek clarification of the Hawaii order before appealing to the 9th Circuit. That circuit is where a three-judge panel unanimously declined to reinstate Trump's original travel ban when it was put on hold by a Seattle Judge last month. \n Despite the legal victories for critics of the ban, it's far from clear that they will continue to win. A different panel of judges in the 9th Circuit will probably hear the appeal of Hawaii's case. And on Wednesday, five judges signed a dissent criticizing the court's decision not to reconsider and throw out the panel's ruling on the original travel ban. \n \"Whatever we, as individuals, may feel about the president or the executive order, the president's decision was well within the powers of the presidency,\" Judge Jay Bybee wrote for the five. \n THE PRESIDENT'S AUTHORITY \n In 1952, with the nation fearful of communist infiltration, Congress gave the president the authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act to take action: \n \"Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may \u2026 suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,\" the law says. \n That power has been invoked dozens of times. But legal experts say those examples were more limited than what Trump has sought. \n Citing a report that reviewed White House administrations going back to Reagan, Chuang noted in his ruling that no president has issued a ban on the entry \"of all citizens from more than one country at the same time, much less six nations all at once.\" \n Chuang found that the travel ban likely violated another aspect of federal immigration law, barring discrimination on the basis of nationality in the issuance of immigrant visas. That law was passed in 1965 as part of an effort to end longstanding immigration quotas that had been criticized as racist. \n Ultimately, the cases will come down to the ways in which that law and the Constitution constrain the president's authority. \n \"That's the tug of war that is going to play out and, I suspect, go before the Supreme Court,\" said Ted Ruthizer, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \"I think it will be a very seminal decision as to what are the limitations on the executive's powers.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Travel ban rulings highlight trouble posed by Trump record"}

Matthew Muller, a disbarred Harvard University-trained attorney, faces decades in prison when he is sentenced Thursday, March 16, 2017, for kidnapping Huskins in a scheme so elaborate and bizarre that police in California initially dismissed it as a hoax. \n SACRAMENTO, Calif. >> A California woman who was drugged along with her boyfriend and then dragged from their home described the \"hell that we have survived\" in emotional testimony Thursday before her abductor was sentenced to 40 years in prison in a crime so elaborate and bizarre that police initially dismissed it as a hoax. \n \"You treated me like an object, a toy, an animal,\" Denise Huskins told her kidnapper, Matthew Muller, a disbarred Harvard University-trained attorney who pleaded guilty in September. \n Huskins described the two days of physical and psychological torture she endured after Muller snatched her from her and her boyfriend's San Francisco Bay Area home two years ago. \n \"I still have nightmares every night,\" she said, fighting back tears. \"Sleep is not rest for me. It is a trigger.\" \n Her boyfriend, Aaron Quinn, who was bound and drugged during the kidnapping, said he \"cannot and will not ever be the same.\" \n U.S. District Judge Troy Nunley called the abduction a \"heinous, atrocious, horrible crime\" as he sentenced Muller, 39. He had faced up to life in prison, but prosecutors agreed to recommend 40 years in exchange for his guilty plea. \n In court, Muller said he was \"sick with shame\" for the \"pain and horror\" he caused. Shackled and wearing an orange jail jumpsuit, he looked straight ahead and showed no emotion as he was sentenced. \n \"He doesn't have empathy. I don't think he's capable of it,\" Quinn's mother, Marianne Quinn, said after the sentencing. \n She said a life sentence would have been better \"because they never would have to worry about him ever again, but again, he's going to be in jail for a long, long, long time.\" \n Defense attorney Thomas Johnson argued for a 30-year sentence, saying his client has been diagnosed as manic and depressive and can be rehabilitated with proper treatment. \n \"They want him to be a monster to get to 40 years. Fine. Marginalize mental illness,\" Johnson told the judge rhetorically. \n He declined comment after the hearing. \n Muller used a remote-controlled drone to spy on Huskins and Quinn before he broke into their Vallejo home, tied up the couple and made them drink a sleep-inducing liquid, prosecutors said. They were blindfolded while Muller played a pre-recorded message that made it seem as if there was more than one kidnapper. \n He put Huskins in the trunk of his car, drove her to his home in South Lake Tahoe and held her there for two days before eventually releasing her in her hometown of Huntington Beach. \n He claimed in emails to a San Francisco reporter that Huskins was abducted by a team of elite criminals who were practicing their kidnapping tactics. \n After her release, Vallejo police called the kidnapping a hoax and erroneously likened it to the book and movie \"Gone Girl,\" in which a woman goes missing and then lies about being kidnapped when she reappears. \n Investigators dropped that theory after Muller was arrested in an attempted robbery at another Bay Area home. Authorities said they found a cellphone that they traced to Muller and a subsequent search of a car and home turned up evidence, including a computer Muller stole from Quinn, linking the disbarred attorney to the abduction. \n Vallejo police have since apologized. Huskins is suing the city and two police officers, accusing them of defamation and inflicting emotional distress. \n Quinn described Thursday how the home he once loved \"turned into a prison\" and how his young nieces still check under their beds each night. \n \"They're not checking for a bogeyman,\" he told Muller directly. \"They're checking for you.\" \n Muller, a former Marine, was admitted to practice law in California in 2011, and his state bar profile says he attended Harvard Law School. He lost his law license in 2015 in an unrelated incident. \n \"Muller had advantages in life that most people only dream of,\" U.S. Attorney Phillip Talbert said in a statement, \"yet he used his considerable intelligence to plan and execute the physical assault and psychological torture of two innocent strangers.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "At sentencing, woman says kidnap once called hoax was 'hell'"}

{"date": "March 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A body is recovered near Silver Lake in Highland, Ill. after a car with an infant was pulled from the lake earlier in the morning. \n ST. LOUIS >> A fast-acting paramedic dove into the frigid water of an Illinois lake where a SUV was submerged on Thursday and found an infant floating inside, then administered CPR on the hood and swam the child to shore, authorities said. The baby is expected to make a full recovery. \n The infant was one of seven siblings who survived a tragic chain of events that left one person dead in a house fire and second body recovered from the lake where the baby was found. \n It all began at 5:15 a.m. in Glen Carbon, Illinois, when fire broke out at a home owned by Cristy Lynn Campbell. An adult died in the fire but six children, siblings ranging up to age 14, escaped. Glen Carbon is about 30 miles east of St. Louis. \n Sheriff John Lakin said the person killed has not been identified, but Campbell's estranged husband and the father of the children, Justin Campbell, has not been accounted for. \n Some of the children ran to a nearby Wal-Mart, others to a home in the neighborhood. The kids at the Wal-Mart asked an arriving worker to call 911, Lakin said. \n Cristy Campbell was not in the home when firefighters arrived nor was the couple's seventh child, a 3-month-old boy. \n At 5:31 a.m., a motorist passing near Silver Lake in Highland, Illinois, about 16 miles from the home, saw a car heading down a hill toward the water and called 911, Lakin said. \n Highland paramedic Todd Zobrist arrived quickly, jumped into the 46-degree water and swam 50 to 75 feet to the SUV, where he found a baby floating inside the car. He pulled the baby by the arm to the hood of the SUV, where he began CPR, then swam with the child to shore. \n The child, initially unresponsive, is expected to recover and could be released Friday from a hospital in St. Charles, Missouri, Lakin said. \n \"Today was a tragic day all the way around because of both scenes,\" Lakin said. \"Fortunately, there is something good that can come of this.\" \n Highland Emergency Medical Services chief Brian Wilson said Zobrist's actions were heroic. \n \"He definitely saved the child's life,\" Wilson said. \n After finding the baby, authorities began searching the water. A body was pulled from the lake around 11:15 a.m. While the body has not been identified, Lakin said police are no longer searching for Cristy Campbell. \n Court records showed that Cristy Campbell and Justin Campbell, 37, had a volatile relationship. \n In 2005, before they were married, Justin Campbell was charged with domestic abuse for allegedly attacking Cristy Campbell, then known as Cristy Brueggemann, by slapping her in the head when she was pregnant. He was sentenced in March 2006 to probation and fined $500. \n Despite the violence they wed on Nov. 3, 2006. She filed for legal separation in September 2010, but the matter was dismissed two months later. \n In April 2012, Cristy Campbell obtained an emergency protection order against her husband and filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that he \"abuses me on a weekly basis,\" including punching and choking her. \n \"He has told me that I'm a no good wife,\" Campbell wrote in her application for the protection order. \n The divorce was granted in February 2013. \n Lakin said Glen Carbon police have answered several calls to Campbell's home, including some \"domestic-related situations,\" but he declined to elaborate. \n \"The Glen Carbon Police Department was aware of that house,\" Lakin said. \n Authorities said the children are with Illinois authorities and will be placed with relatives. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fast-acting paramedic rescues baby from submerged SUV"}

{"date": "March 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn sits in the East Room of the White House in Washington. Documents released in a congressional inquiry show Flynn was paid more than $33,750 by RT, Russia's government-run television system, for appearing at a Moscow event in December 2015. Flynn had retired months earlier as head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency. \n WASHINGTON >> Documenting more than $67,000 in fees and expenses paid before the presidential election to former national security adviser Michael Flynn by Russian companies, a Democratic congressman Thursday asked the Trump administration to provide a comprehensive record of Flynn's contacts with foreign governments and interests. \n Flynn accepted $33,750 from Russia's government-run television system for appearing at a Moscow event in December 2015 \u2014 a few months before Flynn began formally advising President Donald Trump's campaign \u2014 and thousands more in expenses covered by the network and in speech fees from other Russian firms, according to the newly released documents. \n Flynn's financial relationship with the RT network may violate a constitutional provision against gifts from foreign governments, said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who released documents obtained during the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform's inquiry into Flynn's activities before Trump appointed him to become national security adviser. \n In addition to the record of Flynn's foreign contacts, Cummings, the senior Democrat on the committee, also asked the Defense Department to compel Flynn to pay the money he received to the U.S. government. \n \"I am writing to request information about whether Gen. Flynn fully disclosed\u2014 as part of the security clearance and vetting process for his return to government\u2014 his communications with Russian agents, Turkish agents and other foreign agents, as well as his payments from foreign sources,\" Cummings wrote. Last week, Flynn registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent whose lobbying work may have benefited the Turkish government. The lobbying occurred before Election Day from August to November, during the period when Flynn was Trump's campaign adviser. \n Trump fired Flynn as national security adviser last month, saying the former U.S. Army lieutenant general misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are part of House and Senate committee investigations into contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians. \n The newly-released files show that RT \u2014 designated by the U.S. intelligence community as a propaganda arm for Russia's government \u2014 also paid for luxury hotel stays and other expenses incurred by Flynn and his adult son, Michael Flynn Jr., during the Moscow trip. \n Flynn, who was fired in August 2014 as chief of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during the climax of the televised RT gala. \n Cummings said Flynn's acceptance of payments from RT violated the emoluments provision of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits retired military officers from accepting gifts from foreign powers. RT identifies itself as an independent news network, but a report by U.S. intelligence agencies made public in January said RT has long been considered by the U.S. government a Russian propaganda arm. \n In letters sent to Trump, Defense Secretary James Mattis and FBI Director James Comey, Cummings said Flynn \"violated the Constitution by accepting tens of thousands of dollars from an agent of a global adversary that attacked our democracy.\" Cummings was referring to the intelligence agencies' conclusion that Russia instigated cyber-hacking of Democratic party officials and organizations in the months before the presidential election. \n The Defense Department has said retired military officers are covered by the emoluments clause because they could be recalled to military service. The department has also noted that the prohibition on accepting foreign gifts includes commercial groups controlled by foreign governments or others \"considered instruments of the foreign government.\" \n A Flynn spokesman said Flynn informed the DIA before he went to Moscow and after his return. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, said that \"as many former government officials and general officers have done, Gen. Flynn signed with a speakers' bureau and these are examples of that work.\" \n DIA spokesman Jim Kudla said Thursday that Flynn did report to the agency in advance that he was traveling to Moscow \"in accordance with standard security clearance procedures.\" \n Separately, the Army is looking into the matter of Flynn's reporting and compensation, but has found no answers yet, according to spokesman Col. Pat Seiber. \n Emails indicate Flynn initially asked for a higher fee than the $45,000 paid to his speakers' group, Leading Authorities Inc., but was asked to reduce his price. Flynn's take from RT was ultimately $33,750 after Leading Authorities received its commission. \n \"If Gen. Flynn is coming, we would like him to be front and central at the Moscow conference,\" an RT official told Flynn's representatives in a November 2015 email. During his Moscow stay, Flynn was interviewed by an RT personality on national security affairs before attending the lavish RT gala with Putin. \n In an addition to the RT payments, Flynn was also paid $11,250 for two speeches in Washington \u2014 one in August for Volga-Dnepr Airlines, a Russian charter cargo airline, and a second, in September, for Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity firm. \n Flynn and his son also received an unspecified amount in expenses paid by RT for business-class flights to and from Moscow and for their three-day stay at the Hotel Metropol. RT representatives said the stay offered tours of the Kremlin, RT headquarters, the Bolshoi Theater and art museums. Another attendee who took part in some of the tours told The Associated Press they did not see Flynn at those events. \n Cummings said he has given the Trump administration, the FBI and the Defense Department until April 7 to produce documents related to Flynn's contacts with foreign nationals and any documentation of funds he received from foreign sources. \n Cummings also asked for documents about Flynn's security clearance over the past 10 years. They include how Flynn answered questions about his contact with foreign nationals, his work for foreign governments and businesses, and any international real estate holdings. \n The release of the documents comes one week after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group, registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents whose lobbying work may have benefited the government of Turkey. \n The registration involved $530,000 worth of lobbying that Flynn's firm performed for a company owned by a Turkish businessman. In that filing, Flynn acknowledged the lobbying on behalf of the company, Inovo BV, \"could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.\" \n The AP reported last week that while Flynn was under consideration for the top national security post, his attorneys informed the presidential transition team that it was likely he would have to register as a foreign agent. After Flynn was appointed, his attorneys then notified the White House counsel's office that a filing was imminent. \n The White House initially said it had no recollection of the second discussion but later acknowledged such a contact had occurred. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Documents detail Flynn payments from Russian interests"}

Common Cause, a nonpartisan group that promotes government accountability, says accepting money from a private-sector business in an industry it regulates would present the state with an ethical dilemma. \n Pipeline opponents have long accused the state of being too cozy with ETP, and if the state takes the company's money \"it certainly would lend credence to those arguments,\" said Joye Braun, a protest leader. \n \"For Energy Transfer to offer a donation, basically that's paying off the state for using state resources as personal security,\" she said. \n Gawrylow said ETP's offer, while it would help the state, might be more marketing than generosity. \n \"They're not spending it out of the goodness of their heart. They're spending it to build goodwill in North Dakota\" after months of upheaval, he said. \n Work is wrapping up on the $3.8 billion pipeline to move North Dakota oil 1,200 miles to a shipping point in Illinois, and oil could be flowing as early as Monday despite an ongoing legal challenge by Sioux tribes who fear the project could affect their water supply \u2014 a claim ETP rejects. \n The saga has endured for months, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of pipeline opponents camping on federal land near the drill site and often clashing with police. About 750 arrests were made between early August and late February, when camps on property managed by the Corps were shut down in advance of spring flooding season. \n State officials haven't been clear on why they haven't accepted ETP's offer, first made in the fall. \n \"The governor hasn't said whether the state will or won't seek reimbursement from ETP, only that all options are on the table,\" Mike Nowatzki, spokesman for Republican Gov. Doug Burgum, said. \n State Budget Director Pam Sharp told The Associated Press that nothing in state law would prevent North Dakota from accepting such a donation, and that it's happened before, though not in such a sizable amount. For example, smaller private donations have been made to the state-operated North Dakota Veterans Home, she said. \n Both Nowatzki and ETP spokeswoman Vicki Granado said they weren't aware of any discussions between state officials and ETP. But, Nowatzki said, \"the governor's office has been in discussions with both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and White House officials to emphasize the state's position that federal reimbursement is warranted.\" \n U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, a Republican from North Dakota, said his office also is working to get the Corps to reimburse protest-related state costs. \n State Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem has publicly broached the idea of suing the federal government. He didn't respond to requests for comment. \n The state Emergency Commission late last year approved borrowing $17 million to cover the costs, and the first bill Burgum signed as governor after taking office in January authorized an additional $8 million. But the cost has surpassed the approved total by $13 million, and officials plan to ask the Legislature for more money, state Emergency Services spokeswoman Cecily Fong said. \n \"I would be very surprised if the Legislature does not cover the full cost,\" said Republican state Rep. Jeff Delzer, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \n Nowatzki said Burgum's chief concern \"is ensuring that North Dakota taxpayers alone don't foot the bill.\" \n Accepting money from ETP would be a risky way of doing that, according to Paul S. Ryan, vice president of litigation and public policy for Common Cause. \n \"One would reasonably question whether the state could in an unbiased way regulate ETP if it is receiving tens of millions of dollars in cold hard cash from ETP,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. taxpayers might be on the hook for Dakota pipeline protest costs"}

President Donald Trump's proposed budget would eliminate a program providing subsidized airline service to small towns and cities, the very communities that overwhelmingly backed him. Local officials see the program as a lifeline crucial to their efforts to attract jobs. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump called Thursday for eliminating subsidized air service to rural communities, many of which supported his election last year after he promised to create jobs. \n Trump's proposal, part of his budget plan, would sever an economic lifeline that enables rural communities to attract and keep businesses and jobs, officials in those communities said. \n The program has long been a target of conservatives who say the subsidies are too expensive for the relatively small number of passengers served. Elimination of the program would save about $175 million a year, according to the Trump administration. \n \"We do appreciate running government as efficiently as possible, those are our values \u2026 (but) I would argue that this program is vital for rural America,\" said Laurie Gill, the Republican mayor of Pierre, South Dakota. \n Trump's budget proposal cuts many domestic programs as the administration looks for money to increase the military, border control and veterans services while not expanding the deficit. The proposal is an early step in a lengthy budget process and it's not clear to what degree Congress will back his priorities. \n The Essential Air Service program subsidizes airline flights to 111 communities in the 48 contiguous states that would otherwise have no scheduled service and which are at least 210 miles from the nearest hub airport, according to the Transportation Department. Trump got more than 50 percent of the vote in 86 of those communities, according to an Associated Press analysis of voting data. \n About 60 communities in the deep-red state of Alaska also receive subsidized service. \n Without the subsidies, airlines would no longer service their communities, local officials said. In Pierre, that means people who live in the state capital would have to drive more than three hours to reach the nearest airport with scheduled flights, Gill said. \n Hunting, one of the underpinnings of the local economy, might also suffer, she said. Hunters across the country are drawn to the state during pheasant season. \n The program was created nearly 40 years ago to ensure air service to rural communities after the airlines were de-regulated and cut back less profitable routes. \n Not all flights are full, the cost per passenger is high and some of the communities aren't that far from another airport with scheduled service, according to the administration. The Transportation Department has also made exceptions for some communities that are less than the required 210-mile distance. \n That's not the case in Show Low in eastern Arizona near the White Mountains, said Glen Boyd, manager of the regional airport there. The program subsidizes flights to Phoenix, which is more than three hours away by car over roads that are often treacherous and snow-covered in the winter, he said. \n The region is economically depressed, he said. A paper mill that was a large employer closed about two years ago. Another major employer, some coal-fired power plants, are in trouble and may close, he said. \n One bright spot is tourism, especially skiing, fishing and hunting, but airline flights to bring those tourists to the region are critical, Boyd said. Without the subsidies, he said, the airport might be forced to close. \n Elimination of the program is likely to run into opposition in the Senate, where lawmakers from rural states have helped keep it alive despite several previous attempts by budget-cutters to kill it. \n Among other transportation programs serving rural communities targeted for elimination in Trump's proposal is Amtrak's long-distance trail service. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump would end subsidies for rural airline service"}

Only Republican Rep. Mark Amodei did not issue an immediate comment. He has said he is open to completing Yucca Mountain's licensing process. \n Masto joined Heller in a statement that said Nuclear Regulatory Commission hearings alone could cost more than $1.6 billion dollars, which she said would be \"a colossal waste of taxpayer money.\" \n Nevada is gearing up to add dozens more reasons to a list of 218 already accepted by the NRC about why transporting, storing and monitoring the most radioactive material in the U.S. cannot be done safely at Yucca Mountain. \n Democratic Reps. Dina Titus, Ruben Kihuen, and Jacky Rosen restated their opposition to accepting and entombing more than 77,000 tons of spent nuclear reactor fuel from more than 100 power plants and research facilities around the country. \n Kihuen noted the Nevada delegation is sponsoring a bill, the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act, to prohibit the federal government from putting a repository in a state that doesn't want it. \n Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval promised \"relentless opposition and maximum resources\" to block a project that GOP Attorney General Adam Laxalt derided as \"the poster child for federal overreach.\" \n State lawmakers were asked this week to commit $3.6 million a year for the next two years to continue the legal and administrative fight. \n One of Sandoval's predecessors, the late Republican Kenny Guinn, found in 2002 that the state could not veto congressional approval for the Yucca Mountain site, an arid former volcanic ridge first identified as a possible nuclear dump in 1982. \n Former Nevada Sen. Harry Reid in 2007 convinced Congress to cut off federal funding for Yucca Mountain. He declared the proposal dead, and the Energy Department under President Barack Obama shuttered the project in 2010. \n A federal court in 2013 revived the proposal when it ordered the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to resume the Yucca Mountain licensing process.

{"date": "March 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer talks to the media during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington, Thursday, March 16, 2017. Spicer discussed President Donald Trump's assertion that former President Barack Obama wire tapped him, the Trump Administration's proposed budget, and other topics. \n WASHINGTON >> The White House today stood by President Donald Trump's unproven accusations that his predecessor wiretapped his New York skyscraper, despite growing bipartisan agreement that there's no evidence to back up the claim and mounting pressure to retract the statement. \n Angrily defending the president's statement, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Trump \"stands by\" the four tweets that sparked a firestorm that has threatened Trump's credibility with lawmakers. Spicer denounced reporters for taking the president's words too literally and suggested lawmakers were basing their assessments on incomplete information. \n Spicer's comments were a rebuttal to the top two members of the Senate intelligence committee, who released a statement earlier Thursday declaring there is no indication that Trump Tower was \"the subject of surveillance\" by the U.S. government before or after the 2016 election. Spicer suggested the statement from Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Mark Warner, D-Va., was made without a full review of the evidence or, incorrectly, a briefing from the Justice Department. \n \"They are not findings,\" he said. \n The standoff between the White House and lawmakers came four days before FBI Director James Comey is slated to testify before Congress, when he will inevitably be asked whether the president's accusations are accurate. The White House's refusal to back down raised the stakes for Comey's appearance before the intelligence committee on Monday. \n Trump tweeted earlier this month that President Barack Obama \"was tapping my phones in October\" and compared the incident to \"Nixon/Watergate\" and \"McCarthyism.\" \n Trump, in an interview Wednesday with Fox News, said he'd learned about the alleged wiretapping from news reports referencing intercepted communications, despite the fact that he and his advisers have publicly denounced stories about government agencies reviewing contacts between Trump associates and Russians. \n Trump said there would be \"some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.\" \n In the two weeks since the tweets, the White House has tried to soften the statement, but not disavowed it. \n Spicer on Thursday asserted that Trump meant to broadly refer to \"surveillance,\" rather than a phone wiretap. \n \"The president's already been very clear that he didn't mean specifically wiretapping,\" he said. \n In an attempt to bolster his case, the spokesman spent nearly 10 minutes angrily reading from news reports which he said pointed to possible evidence of surveillance. The list included a report from The New York Times, which Trump has dubbed \"fake news,\" as well as conservative commentary, a little-known blog and several reports based on anonymous sources, which Trump has said cannot be believed. \n It was not immediately clear what prompted the senators' statements Thursday. \n Burr and Warner were among eight senior congressional leaders briefed by Comey on March 10. A Senate aide, who requested anonymity to discuss the senators' private briefings, said Spicer was incorrect in claiming Burr and Warner had not been briefed on the matter. \n \"Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,\" Burr and Warner said in a one-sentence joint statement Thursday afternoon. \n The phrasing of the statement left open the possibility that tenants or employees working in the tower may have been monitored. In response to Trump's claims and a request from the House intelligence committee, the Justice Department is doing its own review of whether Trump or any of his associates were the subject of surveillance. The department is slated to provide a response to the committee by Monday. \n Burr and Warner are leading one of three congressional investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, including whether Trump associates were in contact with the Kremlin. \n The senators joined a growing, bipartisan group of lawmakers who have publicly disputed Trump's accusation in the lead up to Comey's testimony. \n Earlier Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin pushed back on the accusations as well. \n \"We've cleared that up,\" Ryan said, adding that he'd received a briefing and seen no evidence of Trump's wiretap claims. \n But the issue is unlikely to pass as quickly as some Republicans hope. \n Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Thursday that he still believes the FBI or Justice Department should comment publicly in \"a simple statement that goes to the heart of the matter \u2014 without jeopardizing classified information.\" \n \"I believe such a statement would serve the public well, and I fear that without an official answer this issue will continue to linger,\" Graham said in a statement. \n On Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he had not given Trump any reason to believe he was wiretapped by Obama. Republican Rep. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House intelligence committee, said he had seen no information to support the claim and then went further. He suggested the U.S. president's assertion should not be taken at face value. \n \"Are you going to take the tweets literally?\" Nunes said. \"If so, clearly the president was wrong.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "White House resists GOP pressure, stands by wiretap claim"}

But these are going to be negotiated. \u2026 We will take care of our people or I'm not signing it, OK, just so you understand.\" \n The House Budget Committee narrowly voted Thursday to advance the troubled Republican health bill, with defections by three GOP conservatives underscoring the obstacles party leaders face in maneuvering to avoid a stinging setback to their showpiece legislation after seven years of promises to repeal and replace \"Obamacare.\" \n In another warning signal, four GOP governors wrote congressional leaders saying the beleaguered bill would not work for their states. \n Govs. John Kasich of Ohio, Rick Snyder of Michigan, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas said the legislation \"provides almost no new flexibility for states,\" fails to ensure enough resources to protect vulnerable residents and shifts significant new costs to states. \n A copy of the letter was provided to The Associated Press. \n The House GOP bill repeals elements of the Obama law, including the \"individual mandate\" that penalizes people who don't have insurance. It sets up a new system of tax credits that is less generous, particularly to older Americans. It eliminates some of Obamacare's requirements for services health plans need to cover, and it sunsets an expansion of Medicaid over several years, an element causing great consternation with moderate-leaning Republicans but one that conservatives want to move up faster. \n The bill also cuts a slew of taxes, mostly to the benefit of the rich. Conservatives say it doesn't go far enough in repealing the Obama-era law in full, and an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found 24 million people would lose their health insurance over a decade though the bill would also reduce the deficit. \n Republicans in the Budget Committee pushed nonbinding proposals to phase out the Medicaid expansion more rapidly, help low-income people more with tax credits and require able-bodied Medicaid recipients to meet work requirements. The provisions seemed a window into votes that leaders think may be needed to win support from conservatives. \n \"Anyone not willing to work, let him not eat,\" asserted Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, in support of the Medicaid work requirement, saying he was citing scripture. \n House conservatives say they are negotiating some changes directly with the White House, cutting out House GOP leaders, while rebellious GOP senators were stoking the opposition. \n Nevertheless, House Speaker Paul Ryan tried to strike an optimistic tone as he addressed reporters Thursday for his weekly press briefing. \n \"We feel like we're making great strides and great progress on getting a bill that can pass,\" Ryan said. \n But Ryan did not commit to a timetable for passage, and his acknowledgment that the bill needs changes to pass was itself a change. Last week, Ryan was pledging action next week by the House Rules Committee \u2014 the precursor to a floor vote \u2014 and confidently predicting the bill would have the votes to pass. \n Instead, Ryan spent part of his news conference disputing suggestions that he and Trump are at odds over the health bill, rumblings that originate with Ryan's very reluctant support for Trump during the presidential campaign. \n \"There is no intrigue, palace intrigue, divisions between the principals \u2026 there really is no schism whatsoever,\" Ryan insisted. \"I'm excited at the fact that we have a president who likes closing deals.\" \n But some conservatives, having ousted the last House speaker, were beginning to grumble openly about Ryan's leadership. \"Maybe Paul Ryan needs to take a couple of lessons from Nancy Pelosi and learn what it means to have a majority. Having a majority does not mean playing defense,\" said Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, referring to the House Democratic leader who was speaker when Obamacare passed. \n By many accounts Trump has been closely involved in negotiations on the health bill, including calling Budget Committee members ahead of Thursday's vote, but he is seen as focused on delivering his \"repeal and replace\" promise and flexible on the fine print. \n Failing to pass a bill while his party controls both the House and Senate would be a devastating blow to his party and the premise of his presidency \u2014 that he was a dealmaker the country needed. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Health bill short of votes, GOP leaders look to Trump"}

The Oklahoma Senate has voted to punish Shortey, who police say was found with a teenage boy in a motel room. \n OKLAHOMA CITY >> Oklahoma prosecutors today filed child prostitution charges against a Republican state senator after police found him in a hotel room a 17-year-old boy. \n Ralph Shortey, 35, is charged in Cleveland County with engaging in child prostitution, transporting a minor for prostitution and engaging in prostitution within 1,000 feet of a church. An arrest warrant was issued for him. \n Shortey, a conservative Republican from south Oklahoma City, hasn't replied to several phone messages seeking comment, and court records don't show if he has retained an attorney yet. \n Moore police said that acting on a tip from the teen's father, officers went to the Super 8 Hotel last week and smelled marijuana coming from a room. They found Shortey and the teen alone inside. \n A search of the teen's tablet uncovered a series of sexually explicit exchanges in which Shortey offered the teen cash in exchange for \"sexual stuff,\" according to a police report. Police also found lotion and a box of condoms inside a backpack in the room. \n The age of consent in Oklahoma is 16, but Oklahoma's prostitution statute applies to any person under 18 years old. \n The Oklahoma Senate imposed sanctions Wednesday on Shortey, voting 43-0 for a resolution that accuses him of \"disorderly behavior.\" Among other things, it removes Shortey from membership and leadership of various Senate committees, bars him from occupying his office and reserved parking spot at the Capitol, blocks his expense allowances and authorship of bills, and revokes his right to have an executive assistant. \n Shortey, who was a county coordinator and early supporter of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, wasn't present when the resolution was adopted and didn't show up to his Capitol office on Wednesday. \n In a statement following its passage, Senate President Pro Tem Mike Schulz said it was not intended to be \"a presumption of guilt or innocence.\" \n \"The Oklahoma Senate has full faith that the judicial system will play out appropriately and bring this matter to a lawful conclusion,\" Schulz said. \"This resolution reserves the right of the Oklahoma Senate to pursue further action if more facts come to light.\" \n Associated Press writers Sean Murphy and Ken Miller in Oklahoma City contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Child prostitution charges brought against Oklahoma lawmaker"}

{"date": "March 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump spoke at a rally, Wednesday, in Nashville, Tenn. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Attorney General Bob Ferguson, center, stood with Solicitor General Noah Purcell, left, and Civil Rights Unit Chief Colleen Melody as he spoke with media members on the steps of the federal courthouse after an immigration hearing there Wednesday, in Seattle. \n GREENBELT, Md. >> Rejecting arguments from the government that President Donald Trump's revised travel ban was substantially different from the first one, judges in Hawaii and Maryland blocked the executive order from taking effect as scheduled today, using the president's own words as evidence that the order discriminates against Muslims. \n The rulings in Hawaii late Wednesday and in Maryland early today were victories for civil liberties groups and advocates for immigrants and refugees, who argued that a temporary ban on travel from six predominantly Muslim countries violated the First Amendment. The Trump administration argued that the ban was intended to protect the United States from terrorism. \n In Greenbelt, Maryland, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang \u2014 who was appointed by then-president Barack Obama \u2014 called Trump's own statements about barring Muslims from entering the United States \"highly relevant.\" The second executive order removed a preference for religious minorities from the affected countries, among other changes that the Justice Department argued would address the legal concerns surrounding the first ban, which was also blocked in court. \n \"Despite these changes, the history of public statements continues to provide a convincing case that the purpose of the Second Executive Order remains the realization of the long-envisioned Muslim ban,\" Chuang said. \n The initial ban sparked chaos at U.S. airports and widespread criticism around the world when it was signed in January. It was later blocked by a judge in Washington state, a ruling that was upheld by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. \n In Honolulu, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson criticized what he called the \"illogic\" of the government's arguments and cited \"significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus\" behind the travel ban. He also noted that while courts should not examine the \"veiled psyche\" and \"secret motives\" of government decision-makers, \"the remarkable facts at issue here require no such impermissible inquiry.\" \n Watson also wrote, referring to a statement Trump issued as a candidate, \"For instance, there is nothing 'veiled' about this press release: 'Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.'\" \n The White House had no immediate comment today. The Justice Department said it would continue to defend the ban. \n \"The president's executive order falls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our nation's security,\" Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement. \n The case was argued in court by acting U.S. Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, who said the ban \"doesn't say anything about religion. It doesn't draw any religious distinctions.\" \n Speaking Wednesday evening at a rally in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump called the ruling in Hawaii an example of \"unprecedented judicial overreach\" and said his administration would appeal it to the U.S. Supreme Court. He also called his new travel ban a watered-down version of the first one, which he said he wished he could implement. \n \"We're going to win. We're going to keep our citizens safe,\" the president said. \"The danger is clear. The law is clear. The need for my executive order is clear.\" \n While the Hawaii ruling temporarily blocks the travel ban, a temporary ban on refugees and a cap on the number of refugees who can enter the country, Chuang's ruling in Maryland applies only to the travel ban. The Maryland ruling took the form of a preliminary injunction, which will remain in effect indefinitely as the case is litigated. Chuang was also the first judge to stop the ban outside the 9th Circuit, which has a liberal reputation. \n \"Unless and until the president realizes that this is a battle in which he's going to keep losing and decides to do the right thing and abandon this course, for as long as he's on it we'll keep litigating it and I think we're going to keep winning,\" said Omar Jadwat, who argued the case for the American Civil Liberties Union in Maryland. \n Chuang wrote that the plaintiffs didn't sufficiently develop their argument that a temporary ban on refugees discriminates on the basis of religion. Plaintiffs in the Maryland case also had sought to stop a portion of the order that would reduce the number of refugees allowed to enter the country this fiscal year from 110,000 to 50,000. \n Still, the judge's order is hugely meaningful for many plaintiffs, including a man in Texas whose same-sex fianc\u00e9 is seeking a visa to enter the United States from Iran, said Justin Cox, an attorney with the National Immigration Law Center who also argued the Maryland case. \n \"This Muslim ban was threatening to either separate or continue to separate families who've already been separated for months and years,\" Cox said. \"It has real-world consequences and we were obviously very glad to see that Judge Chuang recognized those and rejected the government's frankly callous argument that our clients have already been waiting and another few months couldn't possibly be irreparable.\" \n If the administration appeals Watson's decision at the 9th Circuit level, the matter would likely be heard by different judges from the three who ruled on the case last month. The panel of judges assigned to such cases rotates every month, said court spokesman David Madden. \n The 9th Circuit on Wednesday declined to reconsider the 3-0 decision not to reinstate the original ban. In a dissent, five judges said they considered that decision incorrect and wanted it vacated. \n An appeal to the 4th Circuit in Richmond, Virginia, would not necessarily be easier for the Trump administration, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who is following the cases. The 4th Circuit has a conservative reputation but has become more moderate in recent years, he said. \n The hearings in Maryland and Hawaii were two of three held Wednesday in federal courts around the country. U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle, who blocked the initial travel ban last month, did not immediately rule on a request from an immigrant-rights group to block the revised version. \n In all, more than half a dozen states are trying to stop the ban. \n Associated Press writers Sarah Brumfield in Washington, D.C., Jennifer Sinco Kelleher in Honolulu, Gene Johnson in Seattle and Sudhin Thanawala in San Francisco contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "2 federal judges find new Trump travel ban discriminatory"}

{"date": "March 16, 2017", "text": "INTERPOL VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This screen grab from the Interpol wanted persons web page shows the red notice list of suspects including North Koreans, top center and right, and bottom left and center. \n KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia >> Malaysian officials said Thursday that the family of Kim Jong Nam, who was killed last month, has given its consent to Malaysia to decide what to do with his body. \n Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said police confirmed Kim's identity using DNA from his son which was obtained overseas and brought to Malaysia, local media reported. Kim was holding a diplomatic passport bearing the name Kim Chol when he was attacked Feb. 13 at Kuala Lumpur's airport by two women who smeared the banned VX nerve agent on his face, officials say. He died within 20 minutes. \n Deputy national police Chief Noor Rashid Ibrahim said Kim's family will let the government decide what to do with his body. \n \"I was made to understand that they are leaving it to our government to deal with it (body) \u2026 yes, they have given their consent,\" Noor Rashid said. \n He said any decision will be subject to negotiations between the two countries amid a diplomatic standoff over the killing. Kim was the estranged half brother of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, and relations between Malaysia and North Korea have deteriorated sharply since Kim's death, with each expelling the other's ambassador. \n North Korea blocked Malaysians from leaving the country until a \"fair settlement\" of the case is reached. Malaysia then barred North Koreans from exiting its soil. The two countries have also scrapped visa-free travel for each other's citizens. \n Noor Rashid declined to comment on whether the two women had been given different components that would form a binary version of VX, but described it as a \"professional job.\" \n National police chief Khalid Abu Bakar separately told reporters that four North Korean suspects who left Malaysia on the same day as the killing have been put on Interpol's red notice list, which is a request to locate and hold a person pending extradition. \n Police say three other North Korean suspects, including a North Korean diplomat and an employee of Air Koryo, North Korea's state airline, are believed to be in the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. \n There are currently nine Malaysians in North Korea \u2014 three embassy staff members and their family members. About 315 North Koreans are in Malaysia. \n Although Malaysia has never directly accused North Korea of being behind the attack, many speculate that it must have orchestrated it. \n Experts say the VX nerve agent used to kill Kim was almost certainly produced in a sophisticated state weapons laboratory, and North Korea is widely believed to possess large quantities of chemical weapons. \n In Beijing, a North Korean diplomat said Thursday that the killing was a political conspiracy engineered by Washington and Seoul. \n Pak Myong Ho, a minister at the North Korean Embassy in Beijing, said the death was a \"despicable and extremely dangerous\" plot by the U.S. and South Korea aimed at smearing North Korea's image and subverting its regime. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Malaysia says it has family consent to decide on Kim's body"}
