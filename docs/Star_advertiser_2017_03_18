{"date": "March 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Dora-Olivia Vicol from Romania shows her U.K. Residence Documentation during and interview with the Associated Press in London. The Oxford University PhD student said she spent weeks trying to get a document from Romania to prove she had health coverage. \n LONDON >> Sam Schwarzkopf, a German neuroscientist at University College London, was startled to receive a letter from the British government telling him that his application for permanent residence had been rejected and he should prepare to leave the U.K. \n As a European Union citizen, he is legally entitled to live in Britain, and last year's decision by U.K. voters to leave the 28-nation bloc hasn't changed that. But he is one of hundreds of thousands of Europeans battling British bureaucracy to confirm their legal status \u2014 and sometimes discovering that the process only increases their uncertainty. \n Schwarzkopf, who has lived in the U.K. since 2009 and is married to a Briton, thought his application for a permanent resident card \"would be a formality.\" \n When he got the rejection saying he should prepare to leave, he was at first surprised, then angry. \n \"It's outrageous that they use statements like that, especially at a time like this,\" he said. \n Schwarzkopf was trying to obtain a small blue card emblazoned with the logo of Britain's Home Office and the words \"U.K. residence documentation.\" \n Before last year's EU membership referendum, most people didn't even know the cards existed. Residents of EU nations can live and work across the bloc \u2014 no special visas or paperwork are needed for Europeans living in Britain. \n That will change once Britain leaves the EU, after a two-year divorce process due to begin by March 31. But no one is sure exactly how. \n Britain says it will end free movement and impose controls on EU immigration, but has given no details. Officials in both the U.K. and the EU say the 3 million EU citizens living in Britain \u2014 and the 1 million Britons who reside elsewhere in the bloc \u2014 should be allowed to stay. But there has not been a formal guarantee, or a decision on when the cutoff date for legal residence could be. \n That leaves Europeans in Britain anxious, and gives the previously obscure residence cards new value as proof of immigrants' legal status. \n The number of residence cards issued by the British government shot up sevenfold between the final quarter of 2015 and the same period in 2016. There were 240,000 applications in all of 2016 \u2014 a number that has overwhelmed the civil service, which is sitting on a backlog of 90,000 applications. \n Applicants have to fill out an 85-page form and supply reams of supporting documents including pay slips, bank statements and proofs of address. \n Chris Jordan from Brighton in southern England weighed the material submitted by his German wife: It came to 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds). \n More than a quarter of applicants are rejected, sometimes because of simple mistakes in filling out the form. Schwarzkopf was turned down because he had sent a copy of his German passport rather than the original. \n Like him, other rejected applicants have been sent government letters telling them to prepare to leave the country they call home. \n Schwarzkopf said the \"threatening\" wording of the letters \"is just really irresponsible.\" \n Following complaints from Schwarzkopf and others, the Home Office says it has changed the wording of its refusal letters \"to make clear that nobody who has the legal right to remain in the country has to leave the country.\" It also says it has simplified the application process. \n It says \"there is no requirement to register for documentation certifying permanent residence\" to confirm EU nationals' status \u2014 but that hasn't slowed the tide of applications. \n Critics accuse the British government of acting with insensitivity \u2014 or even hostility \u2014 to long-time residents. \n \"The goalposts have been moved retrospectively,\" Liberal Democrat politician Sarah Ludford said in the House of Lords earlier this month. \"People are being asked to document every movement in their lives.\" \n Some applicants have fallen foul of a requirement that people who are not employed or looking for work, such as students and full-time parents, must prove that that they had \"comprehensive sickness insurance\" while living in Britain. \n This has come as a shock to many, since Britain's National Health Service provides free care to all residents, paid for from taxation. EU countries also have agreements that guarantee citizens can get medical treatment in other member states. \n Oxford University PhD student Dora-Olivia Vicol said she spent weeks trying to get a document from her homeland, Romania, to prove she had health coverage. \n \"I felt like I was going to fall through the cracks,\" she said. \n \"I had to scramble for papers and trace back my steps and try to find my paper trail,\" said Vicol, an anthropologist whose area of study is, ironically, migration. \"(It was) like I had to authenticate myself and claim this right to be here.\" \n Vicol's application was successful. She knows people who have failed and are trying again with the help of immigration lawyers. But it's a lengthy and expensive process. Vicol says well-educated young professionals like her and her friends may have the resources, but many others will not. \n Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics and public policy at Kings College London, said the system is \"a complete mess.\" \n \"We've got a process \u2014 the permanent residence process \u2014 which clearly isn't capable of dealing with more than a few thousand people, let alone 3 million,\" he said. \n \"So that process will have to be replaced, it will have to be streamlined. Everybody in government knows it \u2014 but we're still letting people apply for this, and then rejecting a third of them for stupid bureaucratic reasons. And of course the result has been \u2026 that we're spreading uncertainty and confusion.\" \n In the meantime, some successful applicants are reconsidering whether they want to stay in Britain. \n Schwarzkopf reapplied and was approved. But he has already started looking for academic posts abroad. \n \"These last few months have confirmed to me that I will be leaving,\" he said. \"I don't know when, but I know it will be fairly soon.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Europeans in U.K. anxiously seek security before Brexit"}

Authorities say around 30,000 of the city's 42,000 people have been vaccinated in recent days. \n \"I'm really scared,\" said Tais da Silva Almeida, a mother of two who arrived Friday to get vaccinated. \"If adults can't deal with the illness, imagine the children.\" \n Yellow fever is transmitted by mosquito and causes fever, body aches, vomiting and sometimes jaundice. Rio de Janeiro's state Health Department has announced plans to vaccinate its entire population as a preventative measure. It says it will need 12 million doses to reach a 90 percent vaccination rate by year's end. \n The vaccinations come as cases continue to be confirmed in several areas nationwide. Brazil's Health Ministry says that at least 424 people have been infected with yellow fever in the largest outbreak the country has seen in years. \n Of those, 137 have died, and more than 900 other cases are under investigation. The vast majority of confirmed cases and deaths have been in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais, which borders the state of Rio de Janeiro. \n In Casimiro de Abreu, health workers visited houses in rural areas and inspected stagnant water, where mosquitoes lay eggs. The state also sent experts to nearby parks and reserves with monkey populations to monitor the situation with the primates, which are a primary reservoir of yellow fever. \n Meanwhile, in a group of houses near a lush jungle area a few miles (5 kilometers) from downtown, relatives of Santos wait for news about the four members of the family who may be infected. \n Walace Santos, the younger brother of the man who died, said he took solace in knowing that the death raised alarm bells that could save others. \n \"Wherever he is now, he knows that because he died a lot of lives were saved,\" said Santos. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Small Brazil city on edge after man dies from yellow fever"}

{"date": "March 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Employees waited for customers at Lotte Duty Free in Jeju Island, South Korea. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> The once-cordial ties between South Korea and its biggest trading partner have soured due to the perception that China has targeted businesses, sports teams and culture to protest deployment of an advanced U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea. \n A South Korean candy maker, a chocolate factory, video games and a soccer team have suffered from actions many in South Korea view as retribution and Chinese have vandalized some South Korean-run stores. \n Beijing is incensed over the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system. The U.S. and South Korea say it's needed as a defense against a belligerent North Korea but China believes the system could be used against its own missiles as well. \n China denies any direct link between its ire over the U.S. missile system and recent troubles for South Korean businesses. Some recent developments viewed as retaliation: \n Bittersweet: Lotte's lament \n Chewing-gum maker and retail giant Lotte Group, South Korea's No. 5 business group, took the brunt of the backlash after agreeing to let one of its golf courses in southeastern South Korea be a site for deploying THAAD. Lotte Duty Free said its shopping websites were knocked offline for more than six hours a few days after the agreement was signed, in what it believes were cyberattacks by Chinese, based on an analysis of IP addresses. \n At least 55 of 99 Lotte Mart discount stores in China were shut in early March for a month each after surprise inspections found violations of fire safety standards. Five Lotte department stores and 13 smaller supermarkets remain open, the company said Friday. \n A Hershey chocolate factory in Shanghai jointly operated with Lotte suspended production earlier this month for what Hershey said was maintenance for a routine inspection but South Koreans linked it to the spat. \n K-pop, K-drama \n Since last year, some K-pop and K-drama stars have cancelled visits to China due to visa delays. South Korean actor Ha Jung Woo could not get a visa needed for a movie project with China called \"The Mask,\" starring Chinese star Zhang Ziyi, his agency confirmed on Wednesday. The representative for Ha, who was not authorized to talk about the matter and thus asked not to be identified, would not say if the project fell through because of the THAAD problem. \n Regional satellite broadcasters have reportedly been ordered to suspend broadcasts of South Korean television dramas. Online distributors such as Youku, a homegrown YouTube clone, have apparently also stopped buying broadcast rights to South Korean shows. On Youku, \"Guardian: The Lonely and Great God,\" a series featuring South Korean actor Gong Yoo, was no longer on the platform as of Friday. The fantasy-romance drama, which aired its final episode in January, had been available on Youku but reports emerged in February they were removed. Other shows haven't made new episodes available, though past episodes can be seen. \n In January, South Korean soprano Jo Sumi said her concert in China was canceled, possibly due to the diplomatic spat. \n \"I had been preparing for since I got the invitation two years ago, but there was no word on why it was cancelled,\" Jo, a Grammy Award-winning soprano, said on Twitter. \"It's very sad that conflicts between countries are getting in the way of culture and the arts.\" \n Football \n China and South Korea play each other in the central Chinese city of Changsha on March 23. China reportedly refused to let the team take a chartered flight. That could leave them at a disadvantage, and also limit the number of supporters they can bring. China trails in its group, and a loss to South Korea could anger local fans, adding to tensions. \n Cosmetics \n Some South Koreans believe China's recent rejection of some South Korean cosmetic products also was fallout from the THAAD issue. Beauty companies whose products are popular in China, like Amorepacific and LG, have downplayed suggestions that such actions were linked to politics, saying they have not noticed any meaningful decline in sales to Chinese. \n Tough on tourism \n Effective March 15, China told South Korean travel agencies not to sell group tour packages to South Korea. Instead, Chinese must seek visas individually. Both Italy's Costa and Royal Caribbean Cruises have cancelled port calls in South Korea by their cruises originating in China. One place likely to be hit hardest is the southern resort island of Jeju, where mom-and-pop shops and travel agencies rely on Chinese tourists. An official with Jeju's immigration office, who declined to be named, said that as of Thursday no cruises from China were calling at the semi-tropical island. \n South Korean airliners are cutting flights to and from China as reservations drop. \n Anti-Korean sentiment in China \n South Koreans have been shaken by reports of anti-Korean sentiment among Chinese. \n One South Korean exchange student at a university in Beijing said a Korean restaurant in the Chinese capital turned him away. \"Maybe I didn't look Chinese. I don't know how they found out but they told me to get out, saying they don't sell meals to Koreans,\" Ji Wonik said via a mobile messenger app. \"I was angry but I just felt bad so I left the restaurant.\" \n With quiet government urging, some schools have canceled trips to China as a precaution. \n \"Anti-Korean sentiment is running high in China due to the THAAD issue. Given the local political and economic situation, we asked schools to visit domestic destinations instead of going overseas,\" said Ahn Hee-won, an education supervisor in Daegu. \n A video uploaded to YouTube on Monday showed what it said was a Chinese nightclub playing an anti-Korean video loop on four video monitors as people sat drinking. It flashed the red \"no\" symbol of a circle with a diagonal line over a South Korean national flag and in ensuing frames, the word \"KOREA\" is followed by scenes showing two hands with their middle fingers raised and an epithet beginning with \"F\" in capital letters. \n Ji, the Korean student in Beijing, says when he sees such signs of anti-Korean sentiment, he regrets going to China. \n \"But I didn't tell my parents because they might feel terrible, too,\" he said. \"I hope the government could quickly come up with diplomatic measures.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Candy, makeup, K-pop get doused amid China's ire over THAAD"}

{"date": "March 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A South Korean man in Seoul watched a TV news program showing an image, published in North Korea's Rodong Sinmun newspaper, of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the country's Sohae launch site. The letters read \"new type engine.\" \n TOKYO >> North Korea has conducted a ground test of a new type of high-thrust rocket engine that leader Kim Jong Un is calling a revolutionary breakthrough for the country's space program. \n Kim attended the test at the Sohae launch site, according to a report Sunday by the Korean Central News Agency, which said the test was intended to confirm the \"new type\" engine's thrust power and gauge the reliability of its control system and structural safety. \n The KCNA report said Kim called the test \"a great event of historic significance\" for the country's indigenous rocket industry. \n He also said the \"whole world will soon witness what eventful significance the great victory won today carries\" and claimed the test marks what will be known as the \"March 18 revolution\" in the development of the country's rocket industry. \n The report indicated the engine is to be used for North Korea's space and satellite-launching program. \n North Korea is banned by the United Nations from conducting long-range missile tests, but it claims its satellite program is for peaceful use, a claim many in the U.S. and elsewhere believe is questionable. \n North Korean officials have said that under a five-year plan they intend to launch more Earth observation satellites and what would be the country's first geostationary communications satellite \u2014 which would be a major technological advance. \n Getting that kind of satellite into place would likely require a more powerful engine than its previous ones. The North also claims it is trying to build a viable space program that would include a moon launch within the next 10 years. \n The test was conducted as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is in China on a swing through Asia that has been closely focused on concerns over how to deal with Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. \n It's hard to know whether this test was deliberately timed to coincide with Tillerson's visit, but Pyongyang has been highly critical of ongoing U.S.-South Korea wargames just south of the Demilitarized Zone and often conducts some sort of high-profile operation of its own in protest. \n Earlier this month, it fired off four ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan, reportedly reaching within 200 kilometers (120 miles) of Japan's shoreline. \n Japan, which was Tillerson's first stop before traveling to South Korea and China, hosts tens of thousands of U.S. troops. \n While building ever better long-range missiles and smaller nuclear warheads to pair with them, North Korea has marked a number of successes in its space program. \n It launched its latest satellite \u2014 the Kwangmyongsong 4, or Brilliant Star 4 \u2014 into orbit on Feb. 7 last year, just one month after conducting what it claims was its first hydrogen-bomb test. \n It put its first satellite in orbit in 2012, a feat few other countries have achieved.

{"date": "March 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Proposals for the Homeland Security Department in President Donald Trump's first budget were displayed at the Government Printing Office in Washington on Thursday. \n WASHINGTON >> The Trump administration wants to build a 30-foot-high border wall that looks good from the north side and is difficult to climb or cut through, according to a pair of contract notices posted to a government website further detailing President Donald Trump's promise to build a \"big, beautiful wall\" at the Mexican border. \n The notices were made public late Friday by Customs and Border Protection, the Homeland Security Department agency that will oversee the project and eventually patrol and maintain the wall. The proposals are due to the government by March 29. \n One of the CBP contract requests calls for a solid concrete wall, while the other asks for proposals for a see-through structure. Both require the wall to sunk at least six feet into the ground and include 25- and 50-foot automated gates for pedestrians and vehicles. The proposed wall must also be built in a such a way that it would take at least an hour to cut through it with a \"sledgehammer, car jack, pick axe, chisel, battery operated impact tools, battery operated cutting tools, Oxy/acetylene torch or other similar hand-held tools.\" \n The government will award a contract based on 30-foot-wide sample walls that are to be built in San Diego. \n This is the latest step in the Trump administration plan to build a border wall. Last month CBP put out a call for \"concept papers\" to design and build prototypes by March 10. \n Trump has bragged in recent days that the wall is ahead of schedule, though it's unclear from the latest contract notices if any firms have submitted wall proposals or if any such submissions have been rejected. \n The government has not said where the wall will be built, though the contract notices suggest some pieces of a new wall could replace existing fencing that stretches over about 700 miles of the roughly 2,000-mile border. The current fencing of mixed construction, including 15-foot steel posts set inches apart that are designed to keep people from crossing and shorter posts that are intended to block cars. Border Patrol agents are constantly repairing holes in the structure. \n Trump has long promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, which he has said is necessary to stop the flow of immigrants crossing the border illegally and drug smugglers. \n This week the president sent a budget proposal to Congress that included a $2.6 billion down payment for the wall. The total cost for the project is unclear, but the Government Accountability Office estimates it would cost about $6.5 million a mile for fence to keep pedestrians from crossing the border and about $1.8 million a mile for a vehicle barrier. \n Congressional Republicans have said Trump's wall would cost between $12 billion and $15 billion and Trump has suggested $12 billion. \n An internal report prepared for Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly estimated the cost of building a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border at about $21 billion, according to a U.S. government official who is involved in border issues. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the report has not been made public. \n That report proposed an initial phase that would extend fences 26 miles and a second wave that would add 151 miles, plus 272 \"replacement\" miles where fences are already installed, according to the official. Those two phases would cost $5 billion. \n It is unclear how soon Congress might act on that request or how much money lawmakers will ultimately approve for the wall. Democrats and some Republicans have said a border-long wall is unnecessary. \n The Department of Homeland Security reported earlier this month that the number of border arrests dropped about 44 percent from January to February, the lowest monthly tallies since at the least the start of the 2012 budget year. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump wants to build 30-foot-high wall at Mexican border"}

{"date": "March 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Legendary musician Chuck Berry has died in St. Charles County, Missouri, west of St. Louis. He was 90. \n NEW YORK >> Chuck Berry, rock 'n' roll's founding guitar hero and storyteller who defined the music's joy and rebellion in such classics as \"Johnny B. Goode,\" \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" and \"Roll Over Beethoven,\" died today at his home in an unincorporated area west of St. Louis. He was 90. \n Emergency responders summoned to Berry's residence by his caretaker about 12:40 p.m. found him unresponsive, police in Missouri's St. Charles County said in a statement. Attempts to revive Berry failed, and he was pronounced shortly before 1:30 p.m., police said. \n A police spokeswoman, Val Joyner, told The Associated Press she had no additional details about the death of Berry, calling him \"really a legend.\" \n Berry's core repertoire was some three dozen songs, his influence incalculable, from the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to virtually any group from garage band to arena act that called itself rock 'n roll. While Elvis Presley gave rock its libidinous, hip-shaking image, Berry was the auteur, setting the template for a new sound and way of life. Well before the rise of Bob Dylan, Berry wedded social commentary to the beat and rush of popular music. \n \"He was singing good lyrics, and intelligent lyrics, in the '50s when people were singing, \"Oh, baby, I love you so,'\" John Lennon once observed. \n Berry, in his late 20s before his first major hit, crafted lyrics that spoke to the teenagers of the day and remained fresh decades later. \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" captured rock 'n' roll fandom, an early and innocent ode to the young girls later known as \"groupies.\" \"School Day\" told of the sing-song trials of the classroom (\"American history and practical math; you're studying hard, hoping to pass\u2026\") and the liberation of rock 'n' roll once the day's final bell rang. \n \"Roll Over Beethoven\" was an anthem to rock's history-making power, while \"Rock and Roll Music\" was a guidebook for all bands that followed (\"It's got a back beat, you can't lose it\"). \"Back in the U.S.A.\" was a black man's straight-faced tribute to his country at a time there was no guarantee Berry would be served at the drive-ins and corner cafes he was celebrating. \n \"Everything I wrote about wasn't about me, but about the people listening,\" he once said. \n \"Johnny B. Goode,\" the tale of a guitar-playing country boy whose mother tells him he'll be a star, was Berry's signature song, the archetypal narrative for would-be rockers and among the most ecstatic recordings in the music's history. Berry can hardly contain himself as the words hurry out (\"Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans/Way back up in the woods among the evergreens\") and the downpour of guitar, drums and keyboards amplifies every call of \"Go, Johnny Go!\" \n The song was inspired in part by Johnnie Johnson, the boogie-woogie piano master who collaborated on many Berry hits, but the story could have easily been Berry's, Presley's or countless others'. Commercial calculation made the song universal: Berry had meant to call Johnny a \"colored boy,\" but changed \"colored\" to \"country,\" enabling not only radio play, but musicians of any color to imagine themselves as stars. \n \"Chances are you have talent,\" Berry later wrote of the song. \"But will the name and the light come to you? No! You have to go!\" \n Johnny B. Goode could have only been a guitarist. The guitar was rock 'n' roll's signature instrument and Berry's clarion sound, a melting pot of country flash and rhythm 'n blues drive, turned on at least a generation of musicians, among them the Rolling Stones' Keith Richards, who once acknowledged he had \"lifted every lick\" from his hero; the Beatles' George Harrison; Bruce Springsteen; and the Who's Pete Townshend. \n When NASA launched the unmanned Voyager I in 1977, an album was stored on the craft that would explain music on Earth to extraterrestrials. The one rock song included was \"Johnny B. Goode.\" \n Charles Edward Anderson Berry was born in St. Louis on Oct. 18, 1926. As a child he practiced a bent-leg stride that enabled him to slip under tables, a prelude to the duck walk of his adult years. His mother, like Johnny B. Goode's, told him he would make it, and make it big. \n A fan of blues, swing and boogie woogie, Berry studied the very mechanics of music and how it was transmitted. As a teenager, he loved to take radios apart and put them back together. Using a Nick Manoloff guitar chord book, he learned how to play the hits of the time. He was fascinated by chord progressions and rhythms, discovering that many songs borrowed heavily from the Gershwins' \"I Got Rhythm.\" \n He began his musical career at age 15 when he went on stage at a high school review to do his own version of Jay McShann's \"Confessin' the Blues.\" Berry would never forget the ovation he received. \n \"Long did the encouragement of that performance assist me in programming my songs and even their delivery while performing,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"I added and deleted according to the audiences' response to different gestures, and chose songs to build an act that would constantly stimulate my audience.\" \n Meanwhile, his troubles with the law began, in 1944, when a joy riding trip to Kansas City turned into a crime spree involving armed robberies and car theft. Berry served three years of a 10-year sentence at a reformatory. \n A year after his October 1947 release, Berry met and married Themetta Suggs, who stayed by his side despite some of his well-publicized indiscretions. Berry then started sitting in with local bands. By 1950, he had graduated to a six-string electric guitar and was making his own crude recordings on a reel to reel machine. \n On New Year's Eve 1952 at The Cosmopolitan club in East St. Louis, Illinois, Johnson called Berry to fill in for an ailing saxophonist in his Sir John Trio. \n \"He gave me a break\" and his first commercial gig, for $4, Berry later recalled. \"I was excited. My best turned into a mess. I stole the group from Johnnie.\" \n Influenced by bandleader Louis Jourdan, blues guitarist T-Bone Walker and jazz man Charlie Christian, but also hip to country music, novelty songs and the emerging teen audiences of the post-World War II era, Berry signed with Chicago's Chess Records in 1955. \"Maybellene\" reworked the country song \"Ida Red\" and rose into the top 10 of the national pop charts, a rare achievement for a black artist at that time. According to Berry, label owner Leonard Chess was taken by the novelty of a \"hillbilly song sung by a black man,\" an inversion of Presley's covers of blues songs. \n Several hits followed, including \"Roll Over Beethoven,\" \"School Day\" and \"Sweet Little Sixteen.\" Among his other songs: \"Too Much Monkey Business,\" \"Nadine,\" \"No Particular Place To Go,\" \"Almost Grown\" and the racy novelty number \"My Ding-A-Ling,\" which topped the charts in 1972. \n Berry also appeared in a dozen movies, doing his distinctive bent-legged \"duck-walk\" in several teen exploitation flicks of the '50s. Richards organized the well-received 1987 documentary \"Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll,\" a concert at St. Louis' Fox Theatre to celebrate Berry's 60th birthday. It featured Eric Clapton, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis, who recalled being told by his own mother that Berry, not he, was the true king of rock 'n' roll. \n Country, pop and rock artists have recorded Berry songs, including the Beatles (\"Roll Over Beethoven\"), Emmylou Harris (\"You Never Can Tell\"), Buck Owens (\"Johnny B. Goode\") and AC/DC (\"School Days\"). The Rolling Stones' first single was a cover of Berry's \"Come On\" and they went on to perform and record \"Around and Around,\" \"Let it Rock\" and others. Berry riffs pop up in countless songs, from the Stones' ravenous \"Brown Sugar\" to the Eagles' mellow country-rock ballad \"Peaceful Easy Feeling.\" \n Some stars covered him too well. The Beach Boys borrowed the melody of \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" for their surf anthem \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" without initially crediting Berry. The Beatles' \"Come Together,\" written by John Lennon, was close enough to Berry's \"You Can't Catch Me\" to inspire a lawsuit by music publisher Morris Levy. In an out of court settlement, Lennon agreed to record \"You Can't Catch Me\" for his 1975 \"Rock n' Roll\" album. \n Berry himself was accused of theft. In 2000, Johnson sued Berry over royalties and credit he believed he was due for the songs they composed together over more than 20 years of collaboration. The lawsuit was dismissed two years later, but Richards was among those who believed Johnson had been cheated, writing in his memoir \"Life\" that Johnson set up the arrangements for Berry and was so essential to the music that many of Berry's songs were recorded in keys more suited for the piano. \n Openly money-minded, Berry was an entrepreneur with a St. Louis nightclub and, in a small town west of there, property he dubbed Berry Park, which included a home, guitar-shaped swimming pool, restaurant, cottages and concert venue. He declined to have a regular band and instead used local musicians, willing to work cheap. Springsteen was among those who had an early gig backing Berry. \n Burned by an industry that demanded a share of his songwriting credits, Berry was deeply suspicious of even his admirers, as anybody could tell from watching him give Richards the business in \"Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll.\" For the movie's concerts, he confounded Richards by playing songs in different keys and tempos than they had been in rehearsal. Richards would recall turning to his fellow musicians and shrugging, \"Wing it, boys.\" \n Berry's career nearly ended decades earlier, when he was indicted for violating the Mann Act, which barred transportation of a minor across state lines for \"immoral purposes.\" An all-white jury found him guilty in 1960, but the charges were vacated after the judge made racist comments. A trial in 1961 led to his serving 1 1/2 years of a three-year term. Berry continued to record after getting out, and his legacy was duly honored by the Beatles and the Stones, but his hit-making days were essentially over. \n \"Down from stardom/then I fell/to this lowly prison cell,\" Berry wrote as his jail time began. \n Tax charges came in 1979, and another three-year prison sentence, all but 120 days of which was suspended. Some former female employees later sued him for allegedly videotaping them in the bathroom of his restaurant. The cases were settled in 1994, after Berry paid $1.3 million. \n \"Every 15 years, in fact, it seems I make a big mistake,\" Berry acknowledged in his memoir. \n Still, echoing the lyrics of \"Back in the U.S.A.,\" he said: \"There's no other place I would rather live, including Africa, than America. I believe in the system.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry dies at 90"}

{"date": "March 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Flower Scallia works in the shop at Buddy's Shoe Repair Shop in Hixson, Tenn., on March 10, 2017. Scallia, has survived a recent bout with colon cancer. \n CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. >> Even though she's now cancer-free, the anger shows when Flower Scalia, 35, remembers being diagnosed. \n Raised in California, she had been living in Chattanooga for almost 20 years, working as a dental assistant and helping her husband at the shoe repair shop his family has operated since 1906. She knew she was sick \u2014 she was nauseous and losing weight \u2014 but her doctor couldn't figure out what was wrong with her. \n \"He blew me off for nine months,\" Scalia said in a recent interview. It wasn't until July 2012 she learned she had colon cancer. \n The next year was difficult. \n First, she had chemotherapy and radiation to shrink the cancer, but the treatments made her sick. \n \"My husband would take me to radiation, then he would go to work,\" Scalia said. \"I lived on the couch.\" \n Her small dog, Oscar, lay on her stomach for much of every day, she said. \n \"He got me through some really dark places, alone with my chemo pump, (being sick) and all of that. My biggest fear was that my girls would get off the (school) bus and find me dead on the couch.\" \n Surgery removed the tumor, but the follow-up chemo treatments were too much for Scalia. Again nauseous and miserable, she talked to her doctor and quit after only two treatments. \n Now, almost five years after she was diagnosed, Scalia is cancer-free. She plans to take balloons and cake to her doctor July 20, the anniversary of the day she was diagnosed. \n But there may be a reason why Scalia's first doctor didn't quickly recognize her colon cancer. Colon cancer is normally only seen in people aged 60 or older. In fact, the American Cancer Society recommends people get their first screening for the disease when they are 50. \n \"It is still thought of as a disease of age 60 and later,\" said Kim Shank, a colorectal nurse navigator at CHI Memorial's Rees Skillern Cancer Institute, who worked with Scalia. \n But a recent study by the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute showed that while the chances of someone young getting colon cancer are still slight, they have increased significantly in the last 40 years, and doctors are not certain why. The study examined more than 490,000 people age 20 or older who developed colon or rectal cancer between 1974 and 2013. People 50 years old and older showed a decline, which researchers believe is linked to increased screening. \n But compared to a baby boomer born around 1950, those born around 1990, often referred to as millennials, have double the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer. The risk is still slight \u2014 you're 20 times more likely right now to get colon or rectal cancer if you are a baby boomer than a millennial \u2014 but what is troubling to doctors is the trend. \n In their study, the cancer researchers said the recommended age for screening might need to be lowered. Already, African-Americans, who seem to be more vulnerable to colon cancer, are told to begin screenings at age 45. \n But too many people who are experiencing the possible symptoms of colon cancer, including rectal bleeding or abdominal pain, are reluctant to see their doctors. \n \"Not many people want to see their doctor about anal or rectal problems,\" said Dr. Eric Nelson, a colorectal surgeon with University Surgical Associates in Chattanooga. \"They sometimes think it is embarrassing, and that prevents patients from getting checked. But it is very important that people try to put that aside and realize it is a common medical problem, and many people have it, so go and see a doctor.\" \n Most of the time, the cause will not be colon cancer, Nelson said. \n \"All of these things are not normal, but most of the time it is not cancer. But it is important to find out the cause.\" \n Often a screening will discover a growth, or polyp, in the colon that may later become cancerous. But it is easily removed if discovered earlier. \n As with many other cancers, if people delay in getting diagnosed, their treatment may be much more difficult, or even impossible. Colon and rectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society, and the second leading cause in men, resulting in an estimated 50,000 deaths during 2017. \n While researchers do not know for certain why the rate of colon and rectal cancer is increasing in younger people, they suspect both genetics and diet. \n \"The phrase we use is 'genetics loads the gun but lifestyle pulls the trigger,'\" Nelson said. \n If several family members have developed colon cancer at an early age that would be a clear warning sign, Shank said. \n \"People that have a strong family history with multiple family members who have colon cancer are at increased risk. But they are also at higher risk in people who are obese and who have a high-fat, low-fiber diet. And there is an increased risk for people who have things such as an inflammatory bowel condition, Crohn's disease, or colitis.\" \n Researchers are suspicious, she said, that \"there's going to be proven a strong link to the diet that millennials and Gen Xers have been on \u2014 processed food, convenience food, less fresh fruits and fresh vegetables.\" \n That does not necessarily mean they are overweight. \n \"At a young age, you don't have to be obese to have a poor diet,\" Shank said. \"You can look like you have a healthy weight, but your diet is processed food.\" \n That makes sense for Scalia. At Shank's urging, she has joined an exercise program at the YMCA and she now pays attention to \"all that crap you put in your mouth.\" \n \"I do have a pizza here and there, but I try to buy everything organic,\" she said. \"I like smoothies from Whole Foods.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Colon cancer is now showing up in younger people"}

{"date": "March 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Audience members show their disapproval during a town hall event hosted by Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Perry at a Junior High School in Red Lion, Pa. \n RED LION, Pa. >> Republican U.S. Rep. Scott Perry's town hall Saturday turned contentious in his conservative south-central Pennsylvania district over questions about his support undoing President Barack Obama's signature health care law and President Donald Trump's budget proposal and immigration plans. \n Perry, a third-term member of the Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative House Republicans, gamely took dozens of questions, often answering through heckling and shouts in the high school cafeteria-auditorium. \n At one point, he stopped to say, \"If you let me answer the question, I will answer the question.\" The 90-minute town hall at no point was interrupted, but Perry from time to time was shouted at or briefly drowned out by the attendees, all of whom had to show ID proving they lived in the congressional district. \n Many of the questions submitted by attendees \u2014 they were picked and read by the Red Lion school district's superintendent \u2014 took on core Republican or Trump agenda items. Some sought an answer on his support for domestic or diplomatic spending cuts proposed by Trump and elements of the House GOP bill to scrap Obama's health care law. \n Perry was also asked about his support for investigating links between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin and forcing Trump to disclose his tax returns. \n Saturday's town hall makes Perry the first Pennsylvania Republican member of Congress to hold a live town hall since Trump took office in January. The approximately 400-seat event was nearly full and submitted questions perhaps reflected the coordination of liberal groups to get their members there. \n His answers often lacked the directness many in the audience sought, such as one on whether he would support a Trump budget proposal to reduce or eliminate subsidies for public broadcasting, libraries, environmental protection, job retraining and Meals on Wheels. \n \"I like you have concerns about the budget and I know that many of you are concerned and some of you are scared about the budget,\" Perry started, and as he began to explain that changes to Trump's proposal were guaranteed, a chorus of shouts picked up. \n Perry persisted, and finished, saying: \"There will probably be things in the president's budget as he proposed it that I will agree with and there will be things in the president's budget that I don't agree with.\" \n That brought a rain of boos, and shouts of \"answer the question!\" and \"are you going to vote for it!\" \n Asked how he can support billions for a border wall with Mexico when one in five children live in poverty in the United States, Perry said borders must be enforced, and suggested there are limits to the nation's compassion and resources. He then turned to the national debt, a point he often repeated when the subject of budget cuts arose. \n \"Every single one of us has to make choices, including your federal government,\" Perry said. \n That set off chants of \"no wall.\" \n On questions about health care legislation, Perry often answered without giving his position, but drew cheers, from across the partisan divide, when he said he opposed the House GOP health care bill. \n \"I'm not happy with this bill,\" Perry said. \"I've already expressed to my leadership that I'm a 'no' on it because, in my opinion, the issue really at hand for access to care \u2026 is the cost of health care. It is unaffordable for almost all of us and the bill that I see does not drive the cost of health care down.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Perry town hall contentious over health care, immigration"}

{"date": "March 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President and CEO Paula Kerger speaks at the PBS's Executive Session at the 2017 Television Critics Association press tour in Pasadena, Calif. \n LOS ANGELES >> The federal act that created public broadcasting is marking its 50th year, but if President Donald Trump has his way it will be its last with government funding. \n Trump's 2018 budget proposal makes him the second president to try to kill funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and the first to target the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities as well. \n The White House plan released Thursday, which emphasizes military and other security-related spending and slashes many domestic programs, is the first step in a lengthy budget process that ultimately requires Congressional approval. \n The three agencies combined receive about $740 million annually in tax dollars. It's a sliver of the current $4 trillion federal budget but carries outsized importance in political symbolism and, both supporters and detractors say, economic impact. \n Reaction was swift from the agencies and the art and entertainment world. Alarm was the common thread. \n \"We're celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Public Broadcasting Act, what I think has been the most successful public-private partnership \u2014 how ironic it would be if we were defunded this year,\" said Paula Kerger, chief executive for PBS. The nonprofit group's yearly CPB grant pays for programs that are distributed to member stations. \n The proposal is \"counter to the message that American art can reflect society, it can advance society, it can inspire society,\" said Gina Prince-Bythewood, director of movies including \"Beyond the Lights\" and co-creator of Fox TV's new drama, \"Shots Fired.\" \n \"It's horrifying to think that can go away, and I have to stay optimistic and believe that (the cuts) won't go through,\" she said. \n Kate Shindle, president of the 51,000-strong Actors' Equity Association that represents stage actors and stage managers, said the NEA's $148 million reaps a \"return on investment\" for both the culture and the economy. \n \"The arts are not a frill, a luxury, or some kind of extended vanity project,\" she said. \"The arts are a part of who we are as a nation, and the arts put our nation to work. Millions of people have jobs based on spinoff effects in hotels, restaurants, retail stores, and other business that benefit from spending on the arts.\" \n William D. Adams, chairman of the NEH, said the agency was \"saddened\" by Trump's move and noted the agency's five-decade funding of books, film, museum exhibits and other projects that have \"inspired and supported what is best for America.\" \n Trump's budget plan makes no specific argument for eliminating the agencies, although the proposal follows a paragraph describing the intent to \"redefine the proper role\" of the federal government. \n But the conservative Heritage Foundation has been a vocal advocate of such cuts for decades and is again in its \"A Blueprint for Balance: A Federal Budget for 2017.\" Paul Winfree, who was lead editor on the document, has since joined the White House as director of budget policy. \n \"We fundamentally believe the arts are able to flourish independently of the federal government,\" said Romina Boccia, the foundation's deputy director. \n Among the problems she says federal funding can create: A distortion of the art market as private funding migrates to projects seen as having the \"federal stamp of approval,\" and \"cultural cronyism.\" \n Such cronyism, she alleges, can be seen in the NEA's distribution of grants to regional arts projects in every state. \n \"Not necessarily because it creates the best art but because they (the NEA) are trying to secure political support so they can continue to exist,\" Boccia said. \n But it's public broadcasting that's been the recurring target for conservative lawmakers. \n Many Republicans vowed to eliminate its subsidies in 1995, but the effort fizzled. In 2005, Republicans controlling the House tried to cut subsidies for PBS, National Public Radio and hundreds of public radio and TV stations by $100 million, igniting an outcry from fans of \"Sesame Street\" and other defenders of public broadcasting. \n That bid failed. So did President George W. Bush's repeated tries to eliminate CPB funding altogether \u2014 but not for the NEA or NEH \u2014 despite a GOP-controlled Congress in some years of his White House tenure. \n The federal subsidy of $445 million to CPB represents, on average, 15 percent of public TV and stations' funding overall, at a cost of $1.35 per person yearly, PBS said. The rest comes from private and corporate donors. \n But some stations rely more heavily on public dollars, with a number of those located in areas that voted for Trump. \n Among them are KTOO TV and its sister public radio stations in Juneau, Alaska. Federal dollars make up $1.3 million of its $3.2 million budget, spent on programming including Alaska-wide broadcasts of the state legislature sessions held in the hard-to-reach capital city. \n Trump's proposal \"would be absolutely devastating for my station and for all of the stations in Alaska,\" said Bill Legere, KTOO general manager. \n As in the past, Kerger said, informing legislators about what PBS does and mustering citizen support for public broadcasting is key. One new step this year: PBS commissioned an independent poll to measure that backing and circulated the results widely, including among lawmakers and online. \n \"It found what we've always said: We have very strong support from Democrats, Republicans and independents across the country,\" Kerger said. \n PBS, an independent organization, and its member stations are free to lobby lawmakers. The NEA and NEH face restrictions as federal agencies and have to rely on the kindness of strangers to defend them. \n While the NEA can't engage in advocacy \"we will, however, continue our practice of educating about the NEA's vital role in serving our nation's communities,\" Jane Chu, the agency's chairman, said in a statement. \n Whether the GOP's hold on both the White House and Congress makes Trump's proposed cuts a reality is something that neither observers nor stakeholders are able to say. \n \"In a Reagan or Bush era, it would have been almost impossible for Republicans to do this, because their donors wouldn't have allowed it,\" said Dan Schnur, who teaches political communications at the Annenberg School for Communications at the University of Southern California. \n But times may have changed. \n \"It is a different Republican party in 2017 and that makes an approach that used to be impossible not just fairly improbable,\" Schnur said. \n PBS' Kerger said that she takes \"nothing for granted.\" \n \"It's very important if people care about issues that they weigh in,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "As PBS celebrates 50th, Trump budget could mark doom"}

By comparison, last year's meeting called on them to resist \"all forms\" of protectionism. \n The statement, while nonbinding, is important as it helps set the tone for global economic and financial policy. Protectionism can include border tariffs and rules that favor a country's businesses over those in another economy. \n Wolfgang Schaeuble, the finance minister of host country Germany, sought to play down any disagreements. He told reporters after the two-day meeting that the issue was more wording than substance. \n \"It's not true we are not agreed. It's completely clear we are not for protectionism. But it wasn't clear what one or another meant by that.\" \n Trump, who campaigned on an \"America First\" platform, has already pulled the U.S. out of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement with Japan and other Pacific Rim countries. He also has started the process to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. \n During the meeting, European countries and China were said to be pushing for a stronger stance in favor of free trade and cooperative, multi-country frameworks for trade such as the World Trade Organization. \n Chinese Finance Minister Xiao Jie said his country would \"unswervingly oppose trade protectionism.\" Canada, like China a major trade partner of the U.S., took a nuanced approach, with Finance Minister Bill Morneau said to support a general statement on the importance of trade for growth \u2014 while not insisting on particular language. \n The G-20 is an informal forum on economic cooperation made up of 19 countries plus the European Union.

The DeKalb County Board of Registration and Elections ruled that Hector could run because the city's charter doesn't specifically mention an age restriction. \n Hector said her age shouldn't be an issue. \n \"Just because I'm young doesn't mean I lack experience,\" she said. \n Hector is not a stranger to politics or community organizing. At 15, she founded the nonprofit Youth in Action USA, which works to mobilize young people to solve problems in their communities. She's also served as national youth director for Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network, as a youth leader for Hillary for America's Millennial Victory Council, advocated for criminal justice reform with the Obama Administration and worked with Cities United on safety issues in minority communities. \n \"The biggest thing is just getting people to see more than just the age, and more about the vision,\" Hector said. \"And the fact that young people can govern.\" \n Hector, who is studying political science and comparative women's studies, said she's happy her candidacy has sparked debate. \n \"It's time for young people to step up to the plate and do something to fix the problems they see in their communities,\" she said. \"Instead of waiting for someone to save us, to save our community, why can't we address our own issues and run for the same offices that older people seek.\" \n The other candidates in the council race are former Atlanta police investigator Geraldine Champion; former DeKalb County School Board member Jesse \"Jay\" Cunningham; Jonathan \"JP\" Phillips, a homeowners' association chief; and George Turner Jr., president of the county's District 5 Community Council, who challenged Hector's candidacy. \n Cunningham, 58, applauds Hector's initiative, but notes enthusiasm alone is not enough. He said he wants to make sure Stonecrest works with the county and state to enhance the city's footprint. \n \"I'm glad to see that we have someone, who at an early age is taking the lead to get involved in governing,\" he said. \"But at the same time, sometimes you need to sit and learn and build a foundation and work your way up from there.\" \n Champion, at 76, said she believes Hector is \"a smart young lady\" but not quite ready to take on such a leadership role. \"Maybe in the next four to five years, she will be right for politics,\" she said. \"Right now, politics are so dirty it will just chew her up and spit her out. She needs to live awhile longer and get that under her belt.\" \n Neither Phillips nor Turner responded to email requests for an interview. \n Hector said several people have told her she \"should wait my turn\" but she doesn't embrace that philosophy. \n Hector said Stonecrest was formed to create economic development. \"But a city that centers on economic development won't happen if we don't educate our kids or curb violence. The vision I have for the city is much bigger than just sitting back and waiting my turn. Things need to happen now.\" \n Stonecrest, a city of about 50,000 residents, covers most of southeast DeKalb County, including areas near Lithonia and Stonecrest Mall. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Young candidate seeks seat on newly formed Georgia city's council"}

{"date": "March 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel participate in a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, Friday, March 17, 2017. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump said Saturday that Germany owes \"vast sums of money\" to NATO and the U.S. \"must be paid more\" for providing defense, reiterating his stance that European allies need to meet their end of the bargain if they are to continue benefiting from the military alliance. \n Trump's tweet from his Florida resort, where he is spending the weekend, came the day after his first meeting with Germany's leader. \n \"Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel,\" the president wrote. \"Nevertheless, Germany owes \u2026 vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!\" \n Trump and Merkel tried to sidestep their differences in their meeting at the White House on Friday, but it was punctuated by some awkward moments. \n During a photo op in the Oval Office, the two did not shake hands before reporters. Later, during a joint news conference, Trump pushed back against the notion in Europe that his \"America First\" agenda means he's an isolationist, calling such a suggestion \"another example of, as you say, fake news.\" And he referred to the United States as \"a very powerful company,\" before quickly correcting that to \"country.\" \n When a German reporter asked Trump if he regrets any of his commentary on Twitter, Trump said, \"Very seldom.\" \n The new president reaffirmed the United States' \"strong support\" for NATO, but reiterated his stance that NATO allies need to \"pay their fair share\" for the cost of defense. Trump said at the press conference that many countries owe \"vast sums of money\" \u2014 but he declined to identify Germany, at the time, as one of those nations. \n Prior to his inauguration, Trump declared NATO \"obsolete\" but has since modified his stance, telling European leaders the alliance remains of strategic importance. Only the U.S. and four other members currently reach the benchmark of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. Germany currently spends 1.23 percent of its GDP on defense, but it is being increased. \n When the topic moved to trade, Trump said the U.S. would do \"fantastically well\" in its trade relations with Germany. The president has been deeply critical of foreign trade and national security agreements but suggested he was only trying to revise trade deals to better serve U.S. interests, rather than pull back from the world entirely. \n Trump said trade agreements have led to greater trade deficits. The U.S. trade deficit with Germany was $64.9 billion last year, the lowest since 2009, according to the Commerce Department. \n Merkel maintained her composure when Trump repeated his contention that former President Barack Obama may have tapped his phones in Trump Tower. He sought to turn the explosive charge into a light joke when asked about concerns raised by the British government that the White House is now citing a debunked claim that U.K. spies snooped on Trump. \n \"At least we have something in common, perhaps,\" Trump said casually, referring to 2013 reports that the U.S. was monitoring Merkel's cellphone conversations. As for the most recent report, Trump said he shouldn't be blamed for quoting a Fox News analyst who had accused British intelligence of helping Obama spy on him. \n On economic issues, Merkel attempted to project a conciliatory approach. She said the \"success of Germans has always been one where the German success is one side of the coin and the other side of the coin has been European unity and European integration. That's something of which I'm deeply convinced.\" \n Those comments appeared aimed at making a case to Trump on the benefits of the European Union. Trump backed Britain's departure from the EU and has expressed skepticism of multilateral trade agreements. \n The two leaders tried to express their common bonds but showed minimal rapport in their first encounter, a departure from Merkel's warm relations with Obama during his eight years as president. At the start of the news conference, Merkel sought to break the ice, saying that it was \"much better to talk to one another than about one another.\" \n Merkel said delicately that while she represents German interests, Trump \"stands up for, as is right, American interests. That is our task respectively.\" She said they were \"trying to address also those areas where we disagree but tried to bring people together.\" \n \"We need to be fair with each other,\" Merkel said, saying both countries were expecting \"that something good comes out of it for their own people.\" \n The meetings at the White House included discussions on fighting the Islamic State group, the conflict in Afghanistan and resolving Ukraine's conflict, all matters that require close cooperation between the U.S. and Germany. \n The talks aimed to represent a restart of a relationship complicated by Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail. As a candidate, Trump frequently accused the chancellor of \"ruining\" Germany for allowing an influx of refugees and other migrants from Syria and accused his campaign rival, Hillary Clinton, of wanting to be \"America's Angela Merkel.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump says U.S. 'must be paid more' to defend Germany"}

{"date": "March 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Seton Hall head coach Kevin Willard directs his team against Arkansas during the first half in a first-round game of the NCAA men's college basketball tournament in Greenville, S.C., on Friday. \n Coaches across the country can use the first two days of the NCAA Tournament as examples when they're teaching the importance of knowing when and how to foul in late-game situations. \n One day after Northwestern sank the winning free throws in a 68-66 victory over Vanderbilt after an ill-timed foul, Arkansas clinched its 77-71 triumph over Seton Hall after the Pirates got called for a flagrant foul in the final minute. \n Arkansas was clinging to a 72-71 lead over Seton Hall with 18.3 seconds remaining Friday when Seton Hall's Desi Rodriguez fouled Arkansas' Jaylen Barford in an attempt to stop the clock and get the Razorbacks to the foul line. \n But instead of merely calling a common foul on the play, officials determined Rodriguez had committed a flagrant foul after they looked at replays showing the Seton Hall player putting his hands on Barford's back and left shoulder. \n That enabled Arkansas to maintain possession after making two free throws. By the time Seton Hall got the ball back, it trailed by four points with less than 10 seconds remaining. \n \"I think I made a basketball play,\" Rodriguez said. \"I didn't foul intentionally to hurt anyone. The officials called it another way, and that's that.\" \n J.D. Collins, the NCAA national coordinator of men's basketball officiating, said the right call was made because Rodriguez simply put his hands on Barford without ever making an attempt at the ball. \n \"If he makes a legitimate attempt to play the ball and the referees see that, they're likely going to say, 'Hey, he was playing the ball, it's OK,'\" Collins said. \n Arkansas coach Mike Anderson agreed. \n \"I thought (there) was no play on the ball,\" Anderson said. \"That's as simple as that.\" \n But Seton Hall coach Kevin Willard said the context of the situation should be taken into account. After all, it wasn't any mystery that Seton Hall was going to be trying to foul in an attempt to stop the clock. \n \"If you've been around the game long enough, you've got to know time, score, you've got to know what's going on,\" Willard said. \"It's an NCAA Tournament game. I think you've really got to understand what's going on. But they (officiated) a good game all night. So I can't really complain about whether I agree or not. I'm always going to disagree with it. That's what coaches do.\" \n In the Northwestern game, the problem wasn't with how Matthew Fisher-Davis fouled Bryant McIntosh. It's the fact that Fisher-Davis fouled him at all. \n Northwestern had the ball and was trailing 66-65 with less than 15 seconds left when Fisher-Davis fouled McIntosh, who made two free throws to put the Wildcats ahead for good. After Vanderbilt's Riley LaChance missed a 3-pointer and Northwestern made one more free throw, the Wildcats had a 68-66 victory. \n Fisher-Davis said afterward he saw Vanderbilt coach Bryce Drew pointing toward McIntosh and forgot that the Commodores had just pulled ahead. \n \"I actually thought we were down one (point),\" Fisher-Davis said. \"Coach \u2026 pointed at him, but he was just telling me that was my matchup. I took it as (I should) foul.\" \n Fisher-Davis' situation underscores the costs of making a mistake in these types of circumstances. Fisher-Davis scored 22 points Thursday and played the biggest role in rallying Vanderbilt from a 15-point deficit, but much of that was forgotten once his foul enabled Northwestern to regain the lead. \n \"It could have been a miscommunication,\" Drew said \"He looked over at me before. But one play doesn't lose the game for you. And I'm proud of the guys fighting back and being in that situation. Without him, we're not even close to being in that situation at the end.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fouling flubs mark first 2 days of NCAA Tournament"}

{"date": "March 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Republicans intent on scrapping Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act have a budget problem. As it turns out, repealing and replacing the law they hate so much won't save nearly as much money as getting rid of it entirely, the goal they've been campaigning on for seven years. That means trouble for the federal deficit and for Congress' fiscal conservatives who repeatedly warn about leaving their children and grandchildren worse off financially. \n WASHINGTON >> Republicans intent on scrapping Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act have a budget problem. \n As it turns out, repealing and replacing the law they hate so much won't save nearly as much money as getting rid of it entirely, the goal they've been campaigning on for seven years. That means trouble for the federal deficit and for Congress' fiscal conservatives who repeatedly warn about leaving their children and grandchildren worse off financially. \n President Donald Trump and other GOP leaders know they can't just get rid of the law; that was just an applause line for campaign rallies. So they've come up with a bill that would fix Obama's \"disaster\" and insist it would give Americans more choices on health coverage. \n But it only reduces the deficit by $337 billion over a decade and doesn't move the federal budget much closer to being balanced, if at all. That's one big reason many budget-conscious Republicans have joined Democrats in opposing the repeal-and-replace version pushed by the White House and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \n In proposing his 2018 budget on Thursday, Trump called for spending billions more on defense while slashing domestic programs. He vowed during the campaign to leave the costly mandatory programs such as Medicare and Social Security untouched, and he won't raise taxes. That budget plan guarantees large deficits. \n \"Our military is more important to me than a balanced budget,\" Trump said in a Fox News interview in January. \n The initial Republican plan to completely scuttle the 2010 health care law promised a cut of more than $2 trillion from the deficit over 10 years. \n The GOP health care bill cuts the deficit by much less. \n \"Now that (health care repeal) is actually going to happen, they've changed their priorities greatly so that they're not actually trying to generate any significant savings,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington-based advocacy group for budget discipline. \"And there's no sign what they can fill it in with.\" \n A senior member of the House Budget Committee, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., says: \"Oh yeah, there's no question. It's much tougher, much tougher\" to balance the budget after repealing and replacing the health care law. \n What would be left behind, according to the Congressional Budget Office, is $9 trillion in projected deficits over the coming decade and fewer ways for Trump and Republicans controlling Congress to cut. \n The worsening deficit creates a huge problem for other critical pieces of Trump's agenda, including tax reform, a big infusion of infrastructure spending or helping people with the costs of child care. \n First, swelling deficits mean less money for such legislation. \n The deepening debt hole also means problems when Republicans try to pass a budget outline this spring, since some tea party Republicans and deficit hard-liners will insist on promising to balance the budget even though the math no longer works. More realistic lawmakers will resist that. \n Under the arcane congressional budget process, the yearly budget blueprint doesn't by itself make any changes to government programs, but it makes it easier to enact follow-up legislation like tax reform, which is the top GOP priority after dealing with health care. \n But if they can't pass a budget, Republicans can't pass tax reform \u2014 at least without help from Senate Democrats \u2014 because of Senate rules. \n The fiscal picture, meanwhile, has another complication. If Republicans can successfully pass their health care repeal and replacement they will have used up their opportunity to cut Medicaid to generate savings toward a balanced budget. The health measure promises an enormous $880 billion cut from Medicaid over 10 years and it's not credible to say Republicans could claim more in subsequent legislation. \n \"They've taken (Medicaid) off the table,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist and former Congressional Budget Office director. \n \"The math doesn't work,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. \"Just nothing that they're doing adds up right now.\" \n How big is the problem? According to calculations by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, if House Republicans were to simply plug their health repeal and replace bill into last year's budget resolution, they would fall $350 billion short of balance by the end of their 10-year goal. And if further Medicaid savings are taken off the table, the gap is more like $500 billion. \n \"It's going to be extremely difficult,\" admitted budget panel member Cole. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Republican health care plan creates budget problems for GOP"}

{"date": "March 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Clean air advocates cheer as Mary Anne Hitt, director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign, speaks at a rally outside an Environmental Protection Agency hearing in Atlanta. \n RENO, Nev. >> Sierra Club lawyers who've preached against the environmental evils of coal-burning power plants for decades are trying to force the closure of the last significant one in renewable energy-rich Nevada with arguments based on a different sort of green: money. \n \"It used to be that we had to come in and say closing these plants might cost us a bit more, but it's the right thing to do because of the social and environmental impacts \u2014 kids with asthma, dirty air and dirty water,\" said Travis Ritchie, a lawyer for the club's environmental law program in Oakland, California. \n \"And those things are all still true, but we don't have to say that anymore,\" he said. \"We can say, 'You will lose money if you keep using these coal plants.'\" \n Critics of the Valmy coal plant scored a key victory last month when state regulators formally ordered Nevada's largest utility to reassess its economic efficiency after experts projected it will cost ratepayers $30 million or more under current plans to keep it open until 2025. \n This past week, the power plant 250 miles east of Reno became the last utility-owned one still burning coal in Nevada when the Reid-Gardner Generating Station northeast of Las Vegas ended 50 years of operation. \n The Public Utilities Commission said in a December directive it was surprised NV Energy had done only a \"cursory review\" of the need to re-examine Valmy's costs under new plans to keep it idle all but a handful of days a year. \n NV Energy maintains it needs Valmy to meet reliability concerns during peak demand, but intends to comply with the order to produce a new \"lifespan analysis plan\" for Valmy's two coal-fired units by February 2018. \n Leaders of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign say it means the utility will have to address arguments they've been making for years \u2014 that the plant burning the black stuff is increasingly putting NV Energy ratepayers in the red. \n \"NV Energy has been squandering customers' money on an outdated power source at a time when Nevada is equipped to become a leader in the new clean energy economy,\" said Sierra Club lawyer Gloria Smith, adding that today's alternative sources \u2014 including natural gas \u2014 are much cheaper than coal. \n In some ways, the Valmy plant east of Battle Mountain sits at a crossroads of the transition from fossil fuels to renewables \u2014 about a mile from the Southern Pacific railroad tracks where coal-powered locomotives first steamed across Nevada in the late 19th century. \n Gov. Brian Sandoval boasted of Nevada's No. 8 ranking nationally in renewable energy production during his state-of-the-state address in January, highlighting hundreds of millions of dollars in recent investments in solar and geothermal energy. \n NV Energy didn't publicize plans to operate Valmy only during peak demand until a Sierra Club consultant reviewed the utility's resource plan filed last summer and the group successfully intervened in the case. \n Specific costs are confidential. But computer models used in state filings show losses accelerating with the shift from a \"baseload\" plant to a \"peaker\" plant, said Jeremey Fisher of Synapse Energy Economics Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \n The results \"would alarm any resource planner, as it is tremendously difficult to justify maintaining a coal-fired power plant that only operates at peak times,\" said Fisher, who has reviewed about 200 electric energy systems in the past decade. He predicts the plant's two units will operate at 5 percent of capacity or less the rest of its life. \n \"In some years, one or both of the units do not operate at all,\" Fisher said. \n NV Energy hasn't responded to the Sierra Club's claims about the growing costs. But spokeswoman Jennifer Schuricht said in an email to The Associated Press on Thursday the pending reassessment will provided a detailed analysis of the company's concerns about the reliability of power grid supplies if Valmy closes early, as well as proposals for \"generation, operational and transmission alternatives\" that might address those concerns. \n Ritchie insists future efficiency will plummet because operating the plant only a half-dozen days a year still requires year-round maintenance. Plus, it takes two or three days to start it up and the same to shut it down. \n \"The argument for coal has always been that, yeah, it's slow and lumbering and it's dirty, but once you turn it on, it's super cheap because you just leave it on and keep throwing coal in the boiler,\" Ritchie said. \n \"Now, other than the super-hot days when everyone in the entire West is running their air conditioners at the same time, it is more expensive than any other energy.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Push to close last Nevada coal plant centers on money"}
