LEE. / 2015 \n Leslie Kobayashi, U.S. District Judge. \n PAGO PAGO, American Samoa >> A federal judge in Honolulu has ruled that the decision to reduce the area off-limits to large vessels along the coast of American Samoa \"is invalid,\" clearing the way for exclusive access by local fishermen and small boats. \n U.S. District Court Judge Leslie E. Kobayashi also ruled that National Marine Fishery Service's change of the rule \"was arbitrary and capricious.\" \n Fishing waters had been preserved for the local \"alia\" \u2014 or small boat \u2014 fishing fleet from the shoreline out to 50 miles since 2002. Last year, the National Marine Fishery Service reduced the large-vessel-protected area, or LVPA, to 12 miles from the shoreline, allowing vessels 50 feet and longer to net hauls once reserved for local fishermen. \n The plaintiffs, through the American Samoa government, filed the lawsuit in March 2016 arguing that American Samoa's cultural fishing rights are found in the two Deeds of Cession \u2014 the 1900 Deed of Cession for Tutuila and Aunu'u islands and the 1904 Deeds of Cession for Manu'a islands \u2014 with the U.S. \n The defendants, who include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, countered in court documents that deeds say nothing, about fishing or marine resources and \"that silence should not be read to establish rights.\" \n In a 42-page ruling issued Monday, Kobayashi says the Deeds of Cession require the United States to respect the American Samoans' customary practices \u2014 such as fishing \u2014 even though the deeds do not specifically identify the practices. \n American Samoa Gov. Lolo Matalasi Moliga said he hopes the case serves as a reminder to the federal government that \"we have rights and they should not be easily dismissed.\" \n American Samoa Attorney General Talauega Eleasalo Ale, who appeared for the territorial government at federal court during oral arguments last month, describes the ruling as \"thorough and well-reasoned.\" \n \"This decision is the first federal case law to articulate the meaning of the deeds as it relates to our direct dealings with the federal government,\" Ale said. \"It establishes a critical pathway towards clarifying our relationship with the federal government, as well as our status as a people and culture within the American family.\" \n Federal defendants in the lawsuit include NMFS, the Secretary of Commerce, Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council executive director Kitty Simons and the Fisheries Service's Pacific Islands Regional Office administrator Michael Tosatto. \n Tosatto said late Tuesday afternoon from Honolulu that NOAA Fisheries is reviewing the court's decision and evaluating its next steps. \n Council spokeswoman Sylvia Spalding said that the council may discuss the ruling as it meets in Honolulu this week. \n Legal counsel Frederick Tucker with the NOAA Office of General Counsel-Pacific Islands Section said NOAA hasn't had an opportunity to discuss the ruling extensively with other federal parties including the US Justice Department, which represented defendants in the lawsuit. \n \"Currently, we're in the evaluation state,\" Tucker said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Honolulu judge sides with American Samoa fishermen over feds"}

Patients who took Xadago also had better control of movement compared to groups that got levodopa and dummy pills. \n Roughly 1 million Americans and up to 10 million people worldwide have Parkinson's. It generally strikes the elderly, affecting 1 percent to 2 percent of those over age 65. \n Parkinson's is a progressive disease with symptoms worsening over time.

So additional medicines are then needed. \n Milan, Italy-based Newron Pharmaceuticals, which has a U.S. subsidiary in Morristown, New Jersey, developed Xadago, known chemically as safinamide. It was approved in the European Union in 2015. \n Newron's partner, US Worldwide Meds LLC of Louisville, Kentucky, will market Xadago in the U.S. That company said the drug's list price without insurance will be $670 for a 30-day supply of either the 50- or 100-milligram dose. \n Possible side effects can include involuntary movement, nausea and insomnia.

Director Premysl Rabas said Tuesday that it was a tough decision to saw off the horns. \n \"However, the risk that the rhinos currently face not only in the wild but even in zoos is too high. The safety of the animals is our first concern,\" he said. \"A dehorned rhino is definitely a better option than a dead rhino.\" \n The zoo said the procedure is painless for the animals and has been used before for safety reasons, especially when the rhinos are moved to other places. \n \"There is no live tissue (in the horn),\" said Jan Stejskal, director of communications and international projects at Dvur Kralove. \"It's just compact matter, similar to nails or to hair. If you cut it, it's like cutting your hair or your nails. So it has no impact on the life of the animal.\" \n Palmir, a 10-year-old male rhino, was the first to have his horn cut off on Monday. It will grow back again. \n \"Pamir was anaesthetized. The intervention took less than one hour and it was performed without any complications,\" said Jiri Hruby, a rhino curator. \n The horns will be initially stored in a \"safe place\" outside the park. \n The Czech zoo is not the only one to take such measures.

Similar decreases weren't seen in other ethnic groups, he said. \n \"Imagine your sister, your mother, not reporting a sexual assault for fear that their family will be torn apart,\" Beck said Tuesday. \n Around the nation, President Donald Trump's efforts to crack down on the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the U.S. have sparked fear and anxiety, leading many people to try to avoid any contact with law enforcement. \n Beck said there was a \"strong correlation\" between the timing of the decreased reporting and fears of accelerated efforts to round up and deport immigrants. \n Josh Rubenstein, a Los Angeles police spokesman, said the numbers were \"concerning\" and that the department is continuing to look at \"every element contributing to the drop in reporting.\" \n Advocates say the unease among immigrants is forcing the victims of violent crimes to stay silent. \n \"We are seeing immigrant families potentially being so afraid of the ultimate punishment, which deportation represents, that they may forego their chances of justice,\" said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, of the immigrant advocacy group CHIRLA. \"We do not want to be in a situation where victims of crimes remain silent because they fear deportation. That's just horrible and unthinkable.\" \n In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month, Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell said gang members have also been preying on undocumented immigrants and telling them they would be deported if they report crimes to the police. \n \"Certainly the felons in our community are using that as a weapon against the hard working people, letting them believe that if you come forward as a witness or a victim to the police that you open yourself up to deportation,\" McDonnell said. \"That is certainly not the case.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "LAPD: Latinos report fewer sex crimes amid immigration fears"}

{"date": "March 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The NHL's divisional playoff format is drawing criticism because two of the top three teams in the league could meet in the first round. The Metropolitan Division's Capitals, Penguins, Blue Jackets and Rangers all have more points than any team in the Atlantic, yet one of them is guaranteed to be eliminated early. \n In a cruel twist of the NHL's divisional playoff format, say goodbye to one of the three best teams in the league in the first round. \n \"I don't think it was designed for this,\" Columbus Blue Jackets general manager Jarmo Kekalainen said. \"I don't think it was intended for this to happen.\" \n The Blue Jackets, Washington Capitals and Pittsburgh Penguins could finish 1-2-3 in points, but because they all play in the Metropolitan Division, the second- and third-place teams will face off in the first round. It's not the first time a loaded division has caused consternation about this playoff format \u2014 ask teams in the Central Division \u2014 but the groans are getting louder now with no end in sight. \n \"It's stupid. It's the stupidest thing ever,\" Capitals forward Daniel Winnik said. \"It doesn't work. It doesn't make sense.\" \n The NHL adopted this format four years ago where the top three teams make it in each division and two wild cards from each conference, a throwback to 1981-82 to 1992-93 when the playoffs included four teams from each division needing to go through each other to advance. From 1993-94 through 2013, the Eastern and Western Conferences teams were ranked 1-8 and re-seeded each round to reward regular-season success. \n The purpose of the change was to put more emphasis on intradivision rivalries, and it has \u2014 like the Capitals and Penguins meeting in the second round last spring. But that series and others also generate criticism and questions, including: Why should the Presidents' Trophy winners face the team with the second-most points in the East before the conference final? \n \"It's something that's so weird now with the playoff format, where you've got to play one of the best teams in the league in the first round,\" Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury said. \"But if you're going to win in the end, you still need to play the best teams whether you face them in the first round or the third or fourth round. You've still got to beat them. There's no easy way to win the Cup.\" \n Capitals winger T.J. Oshie feels the same way, but actually some paths to the Cup are easier than others. Consider that the Metropolitan fourth-place New York Rangers will likely have more points than every team in the Atlantic Division and have an easier road to the East final because they would avoid the Capitals, Penguins and Blue Jackets. \n \"It's not a good system when your one wild-card team can cross over and they have kind of, if they perform, a clear path to get to the final,\" Washington GM Brian MacLellan said. \"I think the incentive should be the higher team gets the easier path.\" \n While the Rangers could end up facing Atlantic Division foes with fewer points, the Capitals, Penguins and Blue Jackets will beat each other up on the other side of the bracket. Capitals coach Barry Trotz believes \"that 2 (versus) 3 matchup could take a pretty big piece out of a team.\" \n The Penguins took that path last year as the second seed in the Metropolitan and won the Stanley Cup. So Pittsburgh GM Jim Rutherford is fine with the format and isn't even worried about his team winning the division to evade a brutal first-round matchup. \n \"I don't think it's critical,\" Rutherford said. \"Because you could end up playing another team that you don't match up as well against or you could play another team that's healthy and the team you avoided isn't healthy.\" \n Because of so much power at the top of the Metropolitan, Sidney Crosby said \"You just expect everybody to win,\" adding that it has helped push the Penguins to keep their game up down the stretch. \n That should help the Capitals, too, after they were able to cruise a year ago and didn't have momentum in the playoffs. Newcomer Kevin Shattenkirk learned from his years in St. Louis how important momentum is \u2014 far more important than winning in the regular season. \n \"It's tough because if you have had the best season of any team in the regular season, you feel like you should get some sort of relief going into the playoffs,\" said Shattenkirk, whose Blues finished first or second five times and never reached the Cup Final. \n Capitals veteran defenseman Brooks Orpik sees no use complaining because this is the format at least through 2018-19. Detroit Red Wings GM Ken Holland said there hasn't been talk of altering the format and said, \"You can't constantly change the system based on the balance of power at any given time.\" \n Columbus, in the playoffs for just the third time in franchise history, will take it no matter the format. \n \"I don't think we are in a position to start picking and choosing right now,\" Kekalainen said. \"We're making the playoffs this year and we're happy for that opportunity. But we'll let the teams that have been making it 10 years in a row complain about it.\" \n RED-HOT ELLIOTT \n Flames goaltender Brian Elliott won 11 games in a row going into their game Tuesday in Washington with a 1.70 goals-against average and .940 save percentage in that span. He's a big reason Calgary will be back in the playoffs. \n \"He's just real dialed in,\" first-year coach Glen Gulutzan said. \"He's real confident. It's the time of year, I think, a competitive guy enjoys the most, this last little stretch and into the playoffs. So I think it's the time of year where he feels real dialed in with his game.\" \n GAME OF THE WEEK \n Norris Trophy front-runner Brent Burns and the San Jose Sharks visit 2013 Norris winner P.K.

Could sending Congress into space be next? \n Flanked at an Oval Office bill-signing ceremony by astronauts and lawmakers, Trump observed that being an astronaut is a \"pretty tough job.\" He said he wasn't sure he'd want it and, among lawmakers he put the question to, Sen. Ted Cruz said he wouldn't want to be a space traveler, either. \n But Cruz, R-Texas, offered up a tantalizing suggestion. \"You could send Congress to space,\" he said to laughter, including from the president. \n Trump, who faces a crucial House vote later this week on legislation long promised by Republicans to overhaul the Obama-era Affordable Care Act health law, readily agreed. The health care bill is facing resistance from some conservative members of the party. \n \"What a great idea that could be,\" Trump said, before turning back to the space exploration measure sponsored by Cruz and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla. \n The new law authorizes $19.5 billion in spending for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for the budget year that began Oct. 1. Cruz said the authorization bill is the first for the space agency in seven years, and he called it a \"terrific\" achievement. \n Trump last week sent Congress a budget proposal that seeks $19.1 billion in spending authorization for the agency next year. \n \"For almost six decades, NASA's work has inspired millions and millions of Americans to imagine distant worlds and a better future right here on earth,\" Trump said. \"I'm delighted to sign this bill. It's been a long time since a bill like this has been signed, reaffirming our commitment to the core mission of NASA: human space exploration, space science and technology.\" \n The measure amends current law to add human exploration of the red planet as a goal for the agency. It supports use of the International Space Station through at least 2024, along with private sector companies partnering with NASA to deliver cargo and experiments, among other steps. \n After signing the bill, Trump invited several lawmakers to comment, starting with Cruz. When Trump invited Vice President Mike Pence to speak, he suggested that Nelson be allowed to say a few words. Nelson traveled into space when he was in the House. \n \"He's a Democrat. I wasn't going to let him speak,\" Trump quipped, to laughter. Nelson ultimately got a chance to briefly praise his bill. \n Pence also announced that Trump plans to re-launch the National Space Council, with Pence as chairman, to coordinate U.S. space policy. The council was authorized by law in 1988, near the end of the Reagan administration, but ceased to operate soon after Bill Clinton took office in January 1993. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump adds new mission for NASA: human exploration of Mars"}

{"date": "March 21, 2017", "text": "COURTESY APPLE \n Apple is releasing a red edition of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus; for each phone sold, Apple is donating an unspecified amount to HIV and AIDS programs. \n NEW YORK >> Apple is cutting prices on two iPad models and introducing red iPhones, but the company held back on updating its higher-end iPad Pro tablets. \n A much-speculated 10.5-inch iPad Pro didn't materialize, nor did new versions of existing sizes in the Pro lineup, which is aimed at businesses and creative professionals. The new devices are mostly refreshes of existing models. Apple unveiled them through press releases Tuesday rather than a staged event, as it typically does for bigger product releases. \n The iPad updates come as the tablet market continues to decline, after a few years of rapid growth. According to IDC, tablet shipments fell 20 percent to 53 million worldwide in the final three months of 2016, compared with the same period in 2015. \n THE NEW LINEUP  \n The iPad Air 2 is replaced by a new model simply called the iPad. It retains a 9.7-inch screen, but gains a little weight and thickness. The display is brighter and the processor faster. Its price starts at $329 for 32 gigabytes of storage, down from $399. The standard-size iPad is now cheaper than the smaller Mini model. \n The 7.9-inch iPad Mini 4 now comes with 128 gigabytes of storage starting at $399, rather than $499 before. Apple is eliminating the 32-gigabyte model, which used to sell for $399. Nothing else is changing. \n Apple is also releasing a red edition of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus; for each phone sold, Apple is donating an unspecified amount to HIV and AIDS programs. And Apple is doubling the storage on the smaller iPhone SE while keeping the $399 starting price. \n The new iPad Mini 4 is available right away, while the standard-size iPad comes out next week, with orders to begin Friday. The new iPhone SE comes out Friday, while the red iPhones are expected by the end of the month, with advance orders beginning Friday. \n THE MISSING DEVICE  \n IDC analyst Jorge Vela had high hopes for a 10.5-inch iPad. He said such a size might have offered room for a better keyboard, compared with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, and it wouldn't have been as bulky as the 12.9-inch version. \n And Apple typically sparks consumer interest when it has new sizes and designs, Vela said, as seen by a jump in sales following the introduction of larger iPhones in 2014 (iPhone sales have since dropped.) Vela said a 10.5-inch version might have been enough for existing iPad owners to upgrade. \n A 10.5-inch version may still come this year, closer to the holiday shopping season, along with updates to existing Pro sizes. \n Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson said Tuesday's announcement makes it \"even clearer that there are two very distinct iPad tiers now \u2014 the iPad Pro and the basic iPads. The iPad Pros will likely continue to get all the best new features, while the basic iPad will get occasional updates and new features a little later than the Pros, lagging a generation or two behind.\" \n The processor in the new standard-size iPad, for instance, is akin to what's in the iPhone 6S from 2015. The Mini's processor is even older. \n DOWN BUT NOT OUT  \n In the last three months of 2016, iPhones generated 10 times the revenue as iPads. Unit sales of iPads fell 19 percent from the previous year. Yet Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed optimism because many people were buying iPads for the first time, indicating that the market had yet to reach saturation, the point at which everyone who wants a particular product already has one. \n Dawson agrees that the number of tablet owners is still growing, even if overall sales are declining because people aren't upgrading often. He said the new $329 price for the 9.7-inch iPad should help spur sales. New 9.7-inch models have previously cost at least $499. \n Far from holding a clearance sale, Vela said Apple is merely taking advantage of lower prices for older components. And Apple might be able to preserve higher profit margins by pushing people into a model with four times the storage, or 128 gigabytes; the extra storage costs Apple far less than the extra $100 that model sells for, Vela said. \n CHALLENGERS  \n Apple remains the market leader, accounting for about a quarter of all tablets shipped in the fourth quarter, according to IDC. \n Samsung beat Apple to a tablet announcement by nearly a month, though Samsung's Android-based Galaxy Tab S3 doesn't actually start selling until this Friday, for $600. \n Vela doesn't consider it a serious threat to Apple. Even though the Tab S3 is more in line with iPad Pros in quality, Vela said people tend to buy Samsung tablets as media-consumption devices, something they can do with the cheaper iPads. \n Samsung also has two Windows 10 tablets coming. Called the Galaxy Book, the Windows devices are more likely to challenge Microsoft's Surface than iPads. Microsoft is due for a refresh of its Surface Pro tablet, last updated in October 2015. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Apple cuts prices on lower-end iPads, releases red iPhones"}

{"date": "March 21, 2017", "text": "THE BISMARCK TRIBUNE VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Dakota Access developer Energy Transfer Partners said in court documents on Monday that there have been \"coordinated physical attacks\" along the $3.8 billion pipeline that will carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. \n BISMARCK, N.D. >> The developer of the Dakota Access pipeline has reported \"recent coordinated physical attacks\" on the much-protested line, just as it's almost ready to carry oil. \n Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners didn't give details, but experts say Dakota Access and the rest of the nearly 3 million miles of pipeline that deliver natural gas and petroleum in the U.S. are vulnerable to acts of sabotage. \n It's a threat that ETP takes seriously enough that it has asked a court to shield details such as spill response plans and features of the four-state pipeline that the company fears could be used against it by activists or terrorists. \n Here is a look at some pipeline security issues: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n RECENT ATTACKS \n Authorities in South Dakota and Iowa confirmed Tuesday that someone apparently used a torch to burn a hole through empty sections of the pipeline at aboveground shut-off valve sites. \n Mahaska County Sheriff Russell Van Renterghem said the culprit in Iowa appeared to have gotten under a fence around the facility, but Lincoln County Sheriff's Deputy Chad Brown said the site in South Dakota wasn't fenced. \n The Iowa incident was discovered March 13 and the South Dakota incident Friday. \n Pipeline operators are asked to report security breaches to the National Response Center. Data on the center's website show no reports from ETP this month. \n The $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline runs 1,200 miles through the Dakotas, Iowa and Illinois. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n HOW DO YOU ATTACK A PIPELINE? \n Because pipelines mainly run underground, aboveground shut-off valves are natural targets, according to Jay O'Hara, a spokesman for the environmental group Climate Direct Action. That group targeted valves on pipelines in October in North Dakota, Minnesota, Montana and Washington state, though the pipeline companies said activists didn't succeed because none of the sites were operating when the attacks happened. \n Explosives, firearms and heavy machinery also have been used to try to sabotage pipelines. \n Securing pipelines is difficult because they often travel long distances through remote and even uninhabited territory, said Kerry Sundberg, a professor at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta, who studies energy infrastructure security and environmental crime. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE DANGER \n Sundberg said \"it's stupid and dangerous\" to tamper with pipeline shut-off valves. \n Modern oil pipelines are \"incredibly sophisticated\" systems that move huge volumes of petrochemicals at high pressures, he said. Simply closing a valve can cause the pressure upstream to increase quickly, creating a significant risk of a spill that endangers the environment and anyone in the area where the pipe suddenly bursts, he said. \n In response to the October incidents, federal regulators issued a bulletin warning that tampering with pipeline valves \"can have significant consequences such as death, injury, and economic and environmental harm.\" \n Sundberg also said that it's ironic for people who say they're concerned about the environment to take an action that could cause an environmental disaster. \n But O'Hara said: \"The hypocrisy really lies in the pipeline corporations who say their pipelines are safe, say leaks don't happen. They blame activists who are trying to stop global cataclysm by taking action to point out what they do every day, which is leak and spill.\" \n Someone who targets a pipeline facility in the U.S. could face up to 20 years in prison. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RECENT ATTACKS? \n No suspects have been identified in either state and no group has claimed responsibility \n O'Hara told The Associated Press that Climate Direct Action wasn't involved in any actions against the Dakota Access pipeline. \n Attorneys for the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, which are leading the legal battle against the pipeline, said the tribes don't condone acts of violence against pipeline property. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n HOW FREQUENTLY DOES PIPELINE SABOTAGE OCCUR? \n Not very often, Sundberg said. It happens more frequently in Canada than the U.S. It's generally committed by people trying to make an environmental point. It would be \"very scary\" if terrorist groups tried it in North America, he said. \n Some of the worst incidents in the U.S. were on the Trans Alaska Pipeline. Vandals blew up a section in 1978, spilling about 16,000 barrels of oil near Fairbanks. In 2001, a drunken man fired a hunting rifle into the pipeline near Livengood, causing more than 6,000 barrels to spray out. \n Some of the most notable incidents in Canada happened in the 1990s and 2000s in Alberta and British Columbia. A series of bombings in 2008-09 targeted pipelines in British Columbia. Weibo Ludwig, an Alberta man who crusaded against the extraction of \"sour gas\" containing high amounts of hydrogen sulfide, was convicted in several of the 1990s acts of vandalism. He was arrested but never charged in the later attacks. \n Pipeline sabotage happens with some regularity in war zones. Iraqi insurgents, Colombian rebels and Mexican guerrillas all have claimed responsibility for pipeline attacks in recent decades. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Dakota Access pipeline vandalism highlights sabotage risks"}

Several justices seemed sympathetic to Microsoft's argument that the Xbox 360 owners shouldn't be permitted to use a procedural maneuver to force an appeals court to weigh in after the appeals court declined to do so. \n Microsoft has sold millions of Xbox 360 consoles since they were introduced in 2005. It says only 0.4 percent of owners report disk scratching and that in many cases damage is the result of consumer misuse. The company says consumers were warned both in the instruction manual and on a sticker affixed to the console not to move it while a disc was inside. \n When a handful of Xbox 360 owners sued, a federal judge initially said the lawsuit couldn't proceed as a class action, and an appeals court declined to consider an appeal of that decision. The Xbox 360 owners then asked the judge to dismiss their case, a procedural move designed to get the appeals court to weigh in, which it did. Microsoft says that shouldn't be allowed to happen. \n Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the attorney for the Xbox 360 owners, Peter Stris, that \"rule makers went through a lot of work\" to come up with the rule governing appeals in class action cases and suggested he was making an end run around it. And Justice Stephen Breyer suggested the \"simplicity\" of ruling for Microsoft seemed preferable, asking Stris if there was \"anything terrible that would happen\" if the justices ruled against his clients. \n Arguing for Microsoft, lawyer Jeffrey Fisher told the court that ruling for the Xbox 360 owners would \"upend\" the \"carefully considered\" rule governing an appeal of a class action determination. \n Business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have urged the court to side with Microsoft. In briefs to the court they say a ruling for the Xbox 360 owners gives those who file questionable class action lawsuits another chance to pursue class action status if they fail to get it at an early stage of the litigation. Businesses say that would make defending against class action lawsuits more expensive and push businesses to settle claims. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Supreme Court sympathetic to Microsoft in Xbox owners' suit"}

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson) \n LOS ANGELES >> Brandon Crawford scored the tiebreaking run when Nobuhiro Matsuda bobbled Adam Jones' grounder to third in the eighth inning, and the United States reached the championship game of the World Baseball Classic for the first time by beating Japan 2-1 on Tuesday night at rainy Dodger Stadium. \n Andrew McCutchen drove in an early run for the U.S., which will play Puerto Rico for the title Wednesday night. Puerto Rico beat the Netherlands 4-3 in 11 innings Monday. \n The World Baseball Classic final has been played in the United States in each of its four editions, but the home team had never made it. \n The Americans only reached the semifinals once before, in 2009. But this All-Star-laden roster has won two straight elimination games to earn the chance for its first crown. \n Ryosuke Kikuchi hit a tying homer off reliever Nate Jones in the sixth inning for Japan, but the two-time WBC champions were twice let down by their normally sturdy defense on a rain-soaked night at Chavez Ravine, where an intermittent downpour kept fans in ponchos. \n McCutchen opened the scoring with an RBI single in the fourth inning moments after Kikuchi's two-base error at second. In the eighth, Crawford likely would have been out at the plate on Jones' innocent grounder, but Matsuda didn't field it cleanly and had to throw to first. \n Japan, unbeaten coming into the game, won the first two WBC tournaments before losing in the semifinals in 2013. \n Tanner Roark pitched four scoreless innings of two-hit ball before U.S. manager Jim Leyland went to his bullpen early and liberally. His sixth reliever, Luke Gregerson, pitched a perfect ninth inning after Pat Neshek escaped a two-on jam in the eighth. \n Team USA's pitching has come up big all tournament long. \n Although the crowd of 33,462 strongly favored the team with five California natives in the starting lineup, thousands of Japanese fans showed up early and chanted throughout the game, accompanied by the brass band in the left-field bleachers. \n A light, misting rain started falling several hours before game time, forcing the teams to take batting practice indoors while a tarp covered the infield. The wet weather, unusual for Los Angeles, eventually soaked the playing field and forced grounds crews to tend to the infield dirt between innings. \n But the WBC couldn't really afford a rainout day, given its tight schedule in the final weeks of big league spring training. \n Leyland kept a lineup with eight All-Stars, making only one change from the team that beat the Dominican Republic on Saturday to avoid elimination. Buster Posey was behind the plate, continuing his alternation with Jonathan Lucroy, apparently in accordance with their major league teams' wishes. \n Tomoyuki Sugano, the Yomiuri Giants ace with a seven-pitch repertoire, tossed six innings of three-hit ball for Japan, striking out six and yielding only one unearned run. \n \"He's a big league pitcher,\" Leyland said before the game. \n But Sugano was matched by Roark, who had given up three runs over 1 1/3 innings in his only previous WBC appearance. The Washington Nationals right-hander was largely outstanding against Japan, giving up just two singles and a walk and hitting a batter with a pitch. After Christian Yelich reached second in the fourth inning when his hard-hit grounder was mishandled by Kikuchi, the standout defensive second baseman, Eric Hosmer worked out of an 0-2 count to draw a two-out walk. \n McCutchen had just two hits in his first 14 at-bats in the WBC, but he drove in Yelich with a sharp single to left. \n Kikuchi atoned for his mistake in the sixth, driving Jones' fastball barely over the reach of McCutchen in right field for his first homer of the tournament. \n Japan reliever Kodai Senga struck out the first four batters he faced with a 96 mph fastball and exceptional off-speed stuff, but Crawford then delivered a sharp single before Ian Kinsler doubled to deep left-center. \n Neshek got cleanup hitter Yoshimoto Tsutsugoh on a fly to right to end the eighth. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. edges Japan 2-1, advances to WBC final for the first time"}

{"date": "March 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Brooklyn Bridge, in this photo taken in June, spans the East River from Brooklyn into Manhattan, as seen from Brooklyn Bridge Park, in New York. The Department of Justice has taken the rare step of seeking to strip a convicted terrorist, Iyman Faris, 47, of his U.S. citizenship as he serves the last several years of a 20-year prison sentence for plotting to destroy New York's Brooklyn Bridge. \n CHICAGO >> The Department of Justice has taken the rare step of seeking to strip a convicted terrorist of his U.S. citizenship as he serves the last several years of a 20-year prison sentence for plotting to destroy New York's Brooklyn Bridge. \n Some national security experts suggested today the move might signal a new, tougher line under President Donald Trump. \n The case involves Iyman Faris, 47 and born in Pakistan, who was sentenced in 2003 for aiding and abetting the al-Qaida terrorist group with his plan to cut through cables that support the iconic bridge. At the time, it was among the highest profile terrorism cases in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. \n A 17-page filing Monday in U.S. District Court in southern Illinois where Faris is imprisoned launched a revocation process that is likely to take years. The court filing argues that Faris lied on immigration papers before becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1999 and that his terrorist affiliations demonstrated a lack of commitment to the U.S. Constitution. \n The acting assistant attorney of the Justice Department's civil division, Chad Readler, vowed in a statement about the filing to \"continue to pursue denaturalization proceedings against known or suspected terrorists who procured their citizenship by fraud.\" He added: \"The U.S. government is dedicated to \u2026 preventing the exploitation of our nation's immigration system by those who would do harm to our country.\" \n Faris, known as Mohammad Rauf before becoming a U.S. citizen and who once worked as a truck driver in Ohio, is scheduled for release from the U.S. Penitentiary at Marion, Illinois, on Dec. 23, 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. \n Karen Greenberg, director of the Fordham Law School's Center on National Security in New York, said the federal government has been aggressive in previous decades about revoking the citizenship of accused Nazis living in the United States. But she says it's largely unheard of for revocation proceedings to be launched against naturalized U.S. citizens imprisoned for terrorism. \n Most Americans would almost certainly back steps to strip citizenship from someone like Faris. Prosecutors have also accused him of meeting with Osama bin Laden in 2000 and alleged that the planned attack on the bridge could have been designed to be part of a second wave of attacks to follow those on 9/11. \n But Greenberg said making the revocation of a terrorist's U.S. citizenship established policy would only add to a trend since 9/11 of treating accused terrorists differently than other suspects. Stripping someone's citizenship, she said, also appeared to be a way of adding on extra punishment not in the criminal statute itself. \n \"Why isn't it enough that we put him in prison and give him the sentence he was given?\" she said. She added that the effort against Faris could be seen as another example of how the Trump administration \"tinkers with the established way we do things.\" \n The government can't strip U.S.-born citizens of their citizenship, so can't use the revocation of citizenship as a tool to punish attackers born and raised in the United States. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Bid to strip terrorist's citizenship may mark new Trump way"}

{"date": "March 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Trump Hotels CEO Eric Danziger poses for a portrait in his office last month at Trump Tower in New York. \n NEW YORK >> You might have expected the Trump Organization to tap the brakes on expansion plans given all the criticism over potential conflicts of interest while its owner sits in the Oval Office. \n It's hitting the accelerator instead. \n The company owned by President Donald Trump is launching a chain of new hotels with plans to open in cities large and small across the country. Called Scion, they will be the first Trump-run hotels not to bear the family's gilded name. The hotels will feature modern, sleek interiors and communal areas, and offer rooms at $200 to $300 a night, about half what it costs at some hotels in Trump's luxury chain. \n The company has signed letters of intent with more than 20 developers to build the hotels, said Trump Hotels CEO Eric Danziger. The last three were signed in just one week earlier this month. \n \"It's full steam ahead. It's in our DNA. It's in the Trump boys' DNA,\" said Danziger. The \"boys\" are Eric and Donald Jr., who are running their father's company while he is president. \n The bold expansion plan raises some thorny ethical questions. \n The Trump family won't be putting up any money to build the hotels. Instead, it plans to get local real estate developers and their investors to foot the bill, as do most major hotel chains. \n One of the first going up could be in Dallas. A development company there originally planned to raise money from unnamed investors in Kazakhstan, Turkey and Qatar, but recently told the Dallas Morning News that it now will tap only the company's U.S. partners. \n ETHICS CONCERNS \n Government ethics experts say turning to outside money, whether foreign or American, raises the specter of people trying to use their investment to gain favor with the new administration \u2014 like contributing to a political campaign, but with no dollar limits or public disclosure. \n \"This is the new version of pay-to-play, 'Get in there and do business with the Trump Organization,'\" said Richard Painter, who was the chief White House ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush. \n The Trump family will have to overcome some political obstacles, too. Already, politicians in a few cities mentioned as possible sites have vowed to fight the first family, raising the prospect of a struggle to get zoning and other permits to start building. \n The son of German and Polish refugees from World War II, CEO Danziger is no stranger to long odds. He never went to college, instead taking a job as a bellman at a San Francisco hotel at 17. He worked himself up over the decades to CEO spots at several major hospitality companies. \n When Danziger led Starwood Hotels and Resorts in the 1990s, he expanded the number of hotels from 20 to nearly 600. \n The 62-year-old executive has similar ambitions for the Trump family. He said he hopes to open 50 to 100 Scions in three years, and is planning to add to Trump's existing line of luxury hotels. \n Danziger took over Trump's hotel business in August 2015 with hopes of adding to the company's string of properties abroad. A review of trademark databases by The Associated Press shows the Trump family has applied for rights to use the Scion name in several countries, including China, Indonesia, Canada and 28 nations in Europe. An application for trademark rights in the Dominican Republic was approved as late as December. \n Then President Trump held a news conference the next month and basically killed the international plans. A week before he took office, he pledged that his company would strike \"no new foreign deals\" while he was president to allay concerns that foreigners might try to influence U.S. policy by helping his business abroad. \n PROJECTS GET NEW LIFE \n Critics note that hasn't stopped his company from expanding one of its Scottish resorts, pursuing two Indonesian projects that are largely unbuilt and looking to revive an old deal for a beachfront Dominican Republic resort that appeared dead years ago. The company has said these were already in the works, so they don't fall under the president's pledge. \n At a panel discussion at a recent hotel industry conference, Danziger said the U.S. offers plenty of opportunity for expansion. As possible cities for new hotels, he mentioned Seattle, San Francisco, Denver and Dallas. \n That didn't go down well with some local power brokers. \n Mark Farrell, a San Francisco supervisor who heads the land use committee, scoffed at the idea of a Trump hotel getting permission to build in his city, telling a CBS affiliate \"Good luck with that.\" \n In Seattle, councilmember Rob Johnson told the AP he'd be \"shocked\" if any Trump hotels got built, calling his city \"ground zero\" for Trump resisters. In January, thousands took to the streets there to protest the president's first attempt at a travel ban and the city council passed a unanimous resolution denouncing it. \n St. Louis, another possible Scion target, may prove a tough sell, too. A few days after the presidential election, protesters marched in front of a building that had been rumored as the site of a new Trump hotel as they chanted \"No to Trump Tower.\" \n The developer of the St. Louis project, Alterra Worldwide, is also the company behind the possible Scion hotel in Dallas. It announced soon after the St. Louis protest that it would use the building there to open a hotel under the Marriott name. \n Despite the St. Louis trouble, Alterra President Mukemmel \"Mike\" Sarimsakci said, he expects no trouble with his Dallas project. \n For starters, he appears to have much of the local approval needed to move forward. Both Sarimsakci and a Dallas city hall spokeswoman said Alterra is not seeking rezoning or tax incentives, which will avoid any need for a vote of the city council to approve the hotel. \n Sarimsakci doesn't think anti-Trump sentiment will hurt the Scion chain. \n \"I think it's passed. I think people had really strong feelings prior to the election,\" he said. \"I don't see that as being an issue moving forward.\" \n Sarimsakci spoke to the AP last month. He did not respond to requests to confirm that he no longer plans to use foreign investors. \n THE LURE OF TAX REVENUE, JOBS \n Danziger also shrugs off the danger from anti-Trump folks. Stopping a Scion from opening would hurt a city, he said, just as surely as it would hurt the Trumps. \n \"Why would a city because of political views, a city councilman's views, prohibit tax revenue from coming to the city and employment to the people?\" Danziger said. \"It doesn't make sense.\" \n He also expressed confidence Scion will avoid ethical trouble. He said any new investors in Scion go through an \"exhaustive, thorough\" review to make sure, for instance, they're not offering sweetheart deals to the Trump family to curry favor with the president. \n Before Trump took office, he hired an outside lawyer to vet his deals for conflicts. Critics say his company shouldn't be striking any new deals at all and that he should follow the precedent of modern presidents by selling his interest in the company. He has refused to do so. \n Politics aside, Trump's new chain faces stiff business challenges. \n The U.S. president is a tiny hotel operator, with just 14 properties that he either owns or licenses his name to or manages for others, according to his company's website. This puts it at a disadvantage compared with, say, Marriott International, which has more than 6,000 hotels and can get deeper discounts when purchasing insurance and food and linens. The bigger companies have powerful loyalty programs to lure travelers, too. \n \"Why do people stay at Marriotts all the time?\" said Bjorn Hanson, professor of hospitality and tourism management at New York University. \"They're earning points.\" \n Trump's Scion chain also faces a fight for customers against an array of new chic \"lifestyle\" chains from Marriott, Hilton and other rivals. Furniture retailers West Elm and Restoration Hardware are opening hotels to appeal to young travelers. Even the gym chain Equinox recently announced plans to enter the crowded field. \n Danziger said he's not worried. \"Every industry on the planet is crowded.\" \n He won't name the developers with whom he has letters of intent, or where they hope to build, noting that they're tentative deals that could easily fall though. Pressed, though, he rattled off a long series of cities seemingly at random, including Cincinnati, Milwaukee and Louisville, Kentucky. \n \"The list of places Scion can go,\" he said, \"is virtually limitless.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New Trump hotels face political fights, ethics questions"}

The Pearl Harbor-based Los Angeles-class nuclear fast attack submarine USS Columbus was participating in the drills, U.S. Naval Forces Korea said. \n Earlier this month, North Korea fired four ballistic missiles that landed in waters off Japan, triggering strong protests from Seoul and Tokyo. \n Today, the North fired a missile from the eastern coastal town of Wonsan but the launch was believed to have ended in a failure, Seoul's Defense Ministry said in a statement. \n The ministry said it was analyzing what type of missile was launched but gave no further details. Yonhap news agency reported the missile was believed to have exploded in mid-air. \n The failure might mean that the missile is a newly developed one the North has not deployed, according to South Korean media. Last year, the country suffered a series of embarrassing failed launches of its new medium-range Musudan missile before it successfully test-fired one. \n American officials said earlier this week that the U.S. military expected another North Korean missile launch in the next several days. The officials said the U.S. had increased its surveillance over the North and had detected a North Korean missile launcher being moved, as well as the construction of VIP seating in Wonsan. \n The North's state media said Sunday that it had conducted a ground test of a new type of high-thrust rocket engine, which it hailed as a breakthrough for the country's space program. Washington, Seoul and others view the North's space program as a cover for its banned long-range missile development program. \n North Korea is pushing hard to upgrade its weapons systems to cope with it calls U.S. hostility.

Ralph Shortey, who was elected to represent part of the Oklahoma City area, planned to resign Wednesday after being accused of soliciting sex from a 17-year-old boy, according to his attorney. \n Joe Dorman, a former Democratic state representative who was active in the same youth program, said the 35-year-old lawmaker was \"peculiar\" and \"a little quirky.\" \n \"But in politics, you see all kinds of personalities,\" Dorman said. \"But I would have never expected this.\" \n Police in suburban Moore arrested Shortey last week after finding him with the boy in a hotel room off the interstate. The FBI and Secret Service said they have joined the investigation. \n Attorney Ed Blau declined to comment today on the allegations. Shortey has not responded to phone and text messages from The Associated Press. \n Shortey was an early supporter and volunteer last year for Donald Trump's campaign in Oklahoma, but Blau said he did not believe the FBI or Secret Service's involvement has anything to do with his client's political work. \n The FBI conducted a search of Shortey's home, and the Secret Service often lends its expertise in computer and cellphone forensics to local law enforcement agencies. \n A physically imposing man standing 6-foot-5 and weighing 315 pounds, Shortey frequently wore a fedora or straw hat that made him appear even taller. \n Aside from his legislative work, he was known for his long-running involvement in a YMCA's youth government program. \n Shortey became active in the program in high school and later served as a chaperone on several out-of-state trips. YMCA spokeswoman Brenda Bennett said she did not know of any allegations of wrongdoing involving his work. \n He also volunteered as a bus driver for children who attended Oklahoma City's Southwest Baptist Church, where he attended services since his own childhood. \n \"He was very outgoing, never met a stranger,\" assistant pastor Ted Inman said. \"We're all flabbergasted.\" \n Shortey was a staunch conservative in the GOP-dominated Legislature, but also a bit of an outsider in the Senate fraternity, according to many of those who served with him. \n \"I was unaware of him having any close friendships here in the Senate,\" said Republican Sen. David Holt, who was first elected to the Senate in 2010, the same year as Shortey. \"He was here so seldom that it made it hard to get to know him.\" \n Shortey's voting record shows that despite living in the state's capital city, he missed nearly half of the votes before most of his Senate privileges were suspended last week, according to eCapitol, an online bill tracking service. \n He also frustrated the occasional security guard posted at the state Capitol entrance by breezing through the metal detector and setting off the alarms but refusing to stop and be screened like all other visitors. \n \"If a legislator wants to carry a firearm in the Capitol, I think they have a constitutional protection to do that,\" Shortey told the AP last year, despite a Department of Public Safety prohibition on anyone bringing a gun into the Capitol building except for licensed law enforcement officers. \n Court records show Shortey had some past financial difficulties dating back to before his time in the Senate, including an eviction, debt-related lawsuits and foreclosure proceedings. \n He launched a political consulting firm, Precision Strategy Group, in 2014 that assisted numerous Republican candidates. \n Campaign finance reports show his company has received more than $300,000 in payments from various campaigns for consulting, direct mail and polling services. \n Shortey also worked earlier this year as a consultant for former state Rep. Dan Kirby, a Republican from Tulsa who resigned after being accused of sexually harassing two former legislative assistants. \n When it came to legislation, Shortey developed a reputation early in his career for his harsh stance on illegal immigration, an unusual juxtaposition since he represents a heavily Hispanic district on the south side of Oklahoma City. \n Among the early bills he wrote was one to deny Oklahoma citizenship to babies born to parents in the country illegally and another that would allow police not only to question people about their immigration status, but also to confiscate property \u2014 including homes and vehicles \u2014 belonging to those in the country illegally. \n He later developed a niche for legislation targeting the bail bond industry, including one eventually signed by the governor to regulate bail enforcers that earned Shortey a visit from noted bounty hunter Duane \"Dog\" Chapman and his wife, Beth, stars of the reality television show \"Dog the Bounty Hunter.\" \n But Shortey was best-known for more eccentric bills, including one that would allow property owners to shoot down drones and the fetus bill, which drew national ridicule in 2012. \n At the time, Shortey cited his own internet research that, he said, uncovered suggestions that some companies use embryonic stem cells to develop artificial flavors. \n \"He was always coming up with off-the-wall stuff,\" Holt said, citing Shortey's worries about drones and electromagnetic pulse attacks. \n \"I always wished that kind of creativity could have been channeled into legislation that was more relevant in the daily lives of Oklahomans.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lawmaker charged with child prostitution filed odd bills"}

The charge carries a hate-crime enhancement. \n Rivello, a resident of Salisbury, Md., was booked into the Dallas County Jail on Monday night and released around 2 a.m. Tuesday after posting bond. \n Last week, Rivello was arrested at his Maryland home on a federal cyberstalking charge in connection with the case. \n Eichenwald, a senior writer at Newsweek and a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, said in December that someone had tweeted a flashing animated image at him that had induced an epileptic seizure. The image included the message \"You deserve a seizure for your post.\" \n The tweet came not long after Eichenwald had argued with Tucker Carlson on Carlson's Fox News show about each other's political biases and journalistic wrongdoings. \n According to the federal criminal complaint, Eichenwald's seizure on Dec. 15 lasted for eight minutes. \n His wife walked into the room and placed Eichenwald safely on the floor and called 911. She also took a picture of the tweet and responded to it, saying that she had reported the incident to police. \n Dallas police served Twitter with a search warrant for the user's account, jew \u2014 goldstein, and recovered a number of direct messages that referred to Eichenwald. \n \"I know he has epilepsy,\" \"I hope this sends him into a seizure,\" \"let's see if he dies,\" they read. Another said that Eichenwald \"deserves to have his liver pecked out by a pack of emus.\" \n According to the criminal complaint, police were able to link a phone number associated with the Twitter account to an Apple iCloud storage account belonging to Rivello. One of the files on the account was a selfie of Rivello holding his Maryland driver's license. \n In charging Rivello with cyberstalking, the FBI concluded that the tweet was sent \"with the intent to kill, injure, harass, and intimidate.\" \n A Dallas County grand jury indicted Rivello on Monday morning, saying that he knew Eichenwald was susceptible to epileptic seizures and used a deadly weapon \u2014 the animated image in the tweet \u2014 to assault him. \n A hate-crime enhancement was added to the charge because of Rivello's \"bias or prejudice against a group identified by race, ancestry, or religion, namely: persons of Jewish faith or descent,\" the indictment says. \n Rivello's laywers released a statement Tuesday saying that their client, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, immediately apologized for the incident. \n \"He is seeking help from the VA,\" the statement says. \"And we are proud to defend this young man who gave so much defending his country.\" \n Eichenwald said last week on Twitter that dozens of people have sent flashing images at him in the months since jew \u2014 goldstein's offending tweet.

{"date": "March 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A Facebook employee walks past a sign at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. \n RICHMOND, Va. >> An altered Facebook headline on a newspaper story involving a statue of Robert E. Lee has blown up into a major sore point in the Virginia GOP primary for governor \u2014 another instance of politicians or their allies changing headlines to suit their own purposes on that platform. \n Virginia's governor's race is being watched nationally as a possible early referendum on President Donald Trump. A group aligned with gubernatorial hopeful Corey Stewart, a firebrand conservative Trump backer, has weaponized a fake headline to attack rival Ed Gillespie, the GOP establishment's pick for governor. At issue: Gillespie's level of support for Virginia's Confederate monuments. \n Stewart pledged no Confederate monuments would be removed if elected, staunchly supportive of Southern history. After Stewart protested before Charlottesville's Lee statue in February, the Washington Post wrote a story called \"Protesters mob provocative Va. governor candidate as he defends Confederate statue.\" \n A conservative nonprofit with ties to Stewart campaign aides \u2014 the Conservative Response Team \u2014 subsequently posted and promoted a Facebook post linking to the article but with a fake headline: \"Gillespie: I'm OK with Charlottesville Taking Down the General Lee Monument.\" The post makes it look as if that were the Washington Post's headline. \n In fact, Gillespie has said he doesn't support moving the statue and thinks local officials who approved moving it should be voted out of office. Gillespie also said it's an issue to be handled locally. \n Rick Shaftan is a Republican operative who runs the Conservative Response Team's Facebook page and altered the headline. He said Gillespie's trying to have it both ways and the changed headline reflects that. \n \"It's all true, it's exactly what Ed thinks,\" Shaftan said. \n Other flaps over altered headlines have erupted in at least two other states recently involving politicians or political groups close to them. The social media site has special tools available to page administrators allowing them to change headlines in ways that make it look like they were written by legitimate news organizations. \n Critics complain altered headlines are a new kind of \"fake news\" to fool casual readers. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan was recently called out for a staff-altered newspaper headline including the words \"road kill\" about legislation he criticized. In North Carolina, a GOP state senator drew fire for an altered headline stating Democratic Gov. Roy \"Cooper flip flops on refugees.\" \n During the presidential race, Facebook was criticized for not doing enough to stop patently fake news stories on its platform. Recently it announced a slew of new countermeasures. \n The instances highlight Facebook's increasingly important presence in political campaigns, thanks to its vast reach and ability to target specific subgroups of voters. \n The altered headline rankled Gillespie, whose own Facebook page is frequently visited by users chiding him for not supporting Confederate monuments. \n The post was widely shared, and Shaftan said it was viewed more than 400,000 times. Shaftan said his group, which doesn't have to reveal its donors, paid a small amount to Facebook to promote the post. He said the issue resonates with a large group of voters opposed to an \"elitist mindset\" that dismisses the importance of preserving Southern statues. He said the rebellion echoes what happened last year. \n \"This is kind of why Trump won,\" Shaftan said. \n Gillespie's campaign complained to Facebook in mid-February that the altered headline misrepresented his position. Facebook didn't remove the post then. It suggested, among other things, that Gillespie's campaign create a new page focused on debunking false stories. \n But when asked about the post Friday by an Associated Press reporter, Facebook removed it that day. Spokesman Andy Stone said it violated Facebook's terms of not doing \"anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.\" \n Gillespie spokesman Matthew Moran said the campaign's disappointed with Facebook. \n \"We hope Facebook will work harder to stop (Stewart) and his allies from using its platform to deceive voters,\" Moran said via email. \n Shaftan said he found out Friday the post was removed. He reposted the story with the same altered headline hours later and paid to promote the new posting. It was still online Monday morning before Facebook removed it. \n And after this story was first published, Shaftan posted it to the Conservative Response Team's Facebook page but with what he said was a \"slightly more accurate headline.\" It reads: \"Gillespie Flips Out Over True Altered Headline Over Lee Statue Removal.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Altered Facebook news headline jolts Virginia governor race"}

And he gave versions of that same response numerous times to other senators. \n As a long day of questioning wore on, senators and Gorsuch engaged in a routine well-established in recent confirmation hearings, as the nominee resists all requests to say how he feels about Supreme Court decisions, even as he is asked about them again and again. \n Questioned by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California about the Supreme Court's 2008 ruling affirming the right of people to keep guns in their homes for self-defense \u2014 District of Columbia v. Heller \u2014 Gorsuch said, \"Whatever is in Heller is the law and I follow the law. \u2026 It's not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing.\" \n Gorsuch said he has not been asked since his nomination to make promises about future rulings. \n \"I don't believe in litmus tests for judges,\" he said. \"No one in that process asked me for any commitments.\" \n Republicans are unanimously supporting Gorsuch, and they asked supportive questions as he appeared for a second day before the committee. But Democrats made clear on the first day that they were in no mood to \"rubber stamp a nominee selected by extreme interest groups and nominated by a president who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes,\" as Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont put it. \n Democrats remain incensed over how Republicans treated former President Barack Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, who was denied even a hearing last year after Antonin Scalia's death created an opening on the high court. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insisted that since a presidential campaign was underway it was the right of the next president to fill the opening, and his gamble paid off when Trump won the election and nominated Gorsuch, a 49-year-old judge on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. \n There are now just eight justices on the nine-member high court. \n Gorsuch was on a list of potential Trump picks vetted by the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation, and is strongly supported by Senate Republicans, many of whom believe his selection is the best move so far of Trump's presidency and goes far to compensate for the president's erratic behavior on other fronts. \n For their part, Democrats are divided on what to do about Gorsuch and how hard to fight his confirmation, given their frustration over Garland's treatment and the fury of liberal base voters over Trump. Few dispute, though, that Garland is highly qualified and credentialed, and by most accounts a gentle and amiable person. \n In an interview with Associated Press reporters and editors today, McConnell dismissed \"whining\" and \"crocodile tears\" by Democrats over Garland, insisting they would have done the same in his position. With a Senate narrowly divided 52-48 between Republicans and Democrats, McConnell would need eight Democrats to get Gorsuch over procedural hurdles to a final confirmation vote. \n He said today he remains hopeful of getting Democratic votes, but if they aren't forthcoming he sounded prepared to move unilaterally to change Senate rules and confirm Gorsuch with a simple majority. \n \"If there aren't 60 votes for a nominee like Neil Gorsuch it's appropriate to ask the question is there any nominee any Republican president could make that Democrats would approve,\" McConnell said. \"Gorsuch will be confirmed I just can't tell you exactly how that will happen yet.\" \n Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'No man is above the law' Supreme Court pick says on Trump"}

{"date": "March 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n South Korea's ousted leader Park Geun-hye arrived at the prosecutor's office in Seoul today. Park said she was \"sorry\" to the people as she arrived today at a prosecutors' office for questioning over a corruption scandal that led to her removal from office. \n SEOUL >> South Korean prosecutors grilled the country's just-ousted president today in a long-awaited investigation of corruption allegations that ended her rule and now threaten to put her in jail. \n The questioning of Park Geun-hye came 11 days after the Constitutional Court unanimously ruled to dismiss her over suspicions she colluded with a confidante to extort money from businesses and committed other wrongdoings. Her powers had been suspended since she was impeached by parliament in December. \n \"I am sorry to the people. I will sincerely undergo an investigation,\" Park told reporters, without elaborating, when she arrived at the prosecutors' office. \n It was not clear if Park's brief statement meant she acknowledged the corruption allegations, since she has repeatedly denied any legal wrongdoing. South Korean politicians embroiled in scandals often offer public apologies for causing trouble though they deny any involvement. \n Park's questioning lasted 14 hours and ended just before midnight. She was to leave the prosecutors' office after reviewing their report to check whether they accurately described her testimony, according to Park's lawyer. \n In Park's questioning, prosecutors tried to determine whether to seek an arrest warrant, according to South Korean media. Many other suspects implicated in the scandal have already been arrested, including Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, some top government officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong. \n Prosecutors have previously accused Park of extortion, bribery and abuse of power, which could theoretically carry penalties of up to life imprisonment. But arresting Park would be a delicate matter because it might aggravate a national divide and create a strong conservative backlash ahead of an election in May to choose her successor, some political experts said. \n Park's scandal has roiled South Korea for months, with those opposing and supporting her rule staging massive rallies. After the March 10 Constitutional Court ruling, Park supporters clashed with police, leaving three dead. Hundreds of Park's supporters today waited for hours outside the prosecutors' office, holding anti-impeachment signs and the national flag, which has become a symbol of their protest. \n Park had immunity while in office and had refused to meet with prosecutors or allow officials to search her presidential compound. After leaving office, she has continued to reject the allegations, saying \"I believe the truth will certainly come out.\" \n Park is the first democratically elected leader to be forced out of office in South Korea since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s. \n It was a dramatic fall for Park, the daughter of slain dictator Park Chung-hee who became the country's first female president in early 2013 with the backing of conservatives who remembered her father as a hero who pulled the country up from poverty despite his suppression of civil rights. \n Moon Jae-in, a liberal who lost the 2012 presidential election to Park, currently has a commanding lead in opinion surveys for next leader. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "S.

{"date": "March 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The female green sea turtle nicknamed \"Bank\" swam in a pool at Sea Turtle Conservation Center, March 3, in Chonburi Province, Thailand. The 25-year-old sea turtle in Thailand who swallowed nearly a thousand coins tossed by tourists seeking good luck died today, two weeks after having surgery to remove the coins from its stomach. \n BANGKOK >> Tourists used to toss coins at a green sea turtle that lived in a pond in eastern Thailand, wishing for luck and longevity. But swallowing the shiny tidbits turned out to be a death sentence for the reptile. \n After having nearly a thousand coins removed from its stomach in a four-hour operation two weeks ago, the turtle \u2014 nicknamed \"Omsin,\" or \"Piggy Bank,\" \u2014 died today. \n Omsin, estimated to be 25 years old, had been rescued by Thai navy personnel who saw her visibly ailing in the seaside town of Sattahip. She was then examined by a veterinarian, who found the coins inside her stomach. \n The story attracted international media attention, and a public clamor to ease Omsin's plight ensued. The weight of the money inside her had cracked her underside shell and threatened a fatal infection. \n The cause of death was intestinal obstruction that blocked Omsin's protein intake, while nickel toxicity from the coins damaged her immune system, said Dr. Roongroje Thanawongnuwech, dean of the veterinary school at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University. \n The turtle had appeared to be doing well after the operation, but a checkup Saturday revealed problems with her intestines. Doctors performed a second, 2 1/2 hour-operation, but Omsin never woke up and died this morning. \n \"She at least had the chance to swim freely and eat happily before she passed,\" said Dr. Nantarika Chansue, who led the team that removed 915 coins weighing 5 kilograms (11 pounds) from her stomach on March 6. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Thailand's coin-eating green sea turtle dies of intestinal blockage"}

{"date": "March 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price arrived on Capitol Hill in Washington, today, to rally support for the Republican health care overhaul by taking his case directly to GOP lawmakers. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump today warned House Republicans they could lose their seats in next year's midterm elections if they failed to back the GOP health care overhaul and fulfill a long-promised goal to undo Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.  \n In a rare trip to the Capitol, the president met behind closed doors with rank-and-file Republicans, some wavering on the legislation two days before a climactic vote. Top House Republicans unveiled revisions to their bill Monday night in hopes of nailing down support. \n Trump's message to Republicans: \"If you don't pass the bill there could be political costs,\" said Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C. \n The lawmaker said Trump said House GOP seats could be at risk if the bill fails and \"the danger of your not voting for the bill is people could lose their seats.\" \n The GOP bill would dismantle Obama's requirements that most people buy policies and that larger companies cover workers. Federal subsidies based largely on peoples' incomes and insurance premiums would end, and a Medicaid expansion to 11 million more low-income people would disappear. \n The Republican legislation would provide tax credits to help people pay medical bills based chiefly on age, and open-ended federal payments to help states cover Medicaid costs would be cut. Insurers could charge older consumers five times the premiums they charge younger people instead of Obama's 3-1 limit, and would boost premiums 30 percent for those who let coverage lapse. \n Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., said Trump told Republicans he would campaign for them if they backed the bill. Trump didn't indicate what he would do to those who vote against the bill, but during the caucus, he singled out Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., one of the outspoken critics of the bill. \n Collins said Trump asked Meadows to stand up, called him a great guy and said he is counting on Meadows to get this over the line. \n \"The president is very adroit at putting somebody on the spot and he did that today with Mark Meadows,\" Collins said. Asked if there was a threat to Meadows in that, Collins responded: \"There was no threat whatsoever.\" \n Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters Trump attended the meeting \"to do what he does best: to close the deal.\" \n Trump's closed-door meeting with House Republicans was coming as party leaders released 43 pages worth of changes to a bill whose prospects remain dicey. Their proposals were largely aimed at addressing dissent that their measure would leave many older people with higher costs. \n Included was an unusual approach: language paving the way for the Senate, if it chooses, to make the bill's tax credit more generous for people age 50-64. Details in the documents released were initially unclear, but one GOP lawmaker and an aide said the plan sets aside $85 billion over 10 years for that purpose. \n The leaders' proposals would accelerate the repeal of tax increases Obama imposed on higher earners, the medical industry and others to this year instead of 2018. It would be easier for some people to deduct medical expenses from their taxes. \n Older and disabled Medicaid beneficiaries would get larger benefits. But it would also curb future growth of the overall Medicaid program, which helps low earners afford medical coverage, and let states impose work requirements on some recipients. Additional states could not join the 31 that opted to expand Medicaid to more beneficiaries under Obama's law, the Affordable Care Act. \n In a bid to cement support from upstate New Yorkers, the revisions would also stop that state from passing on over $2 billion a year in Medicaid costs to counties. The change was pushed by Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., one of Trump's first congressional supporters. Local officials have complained the practice overburdens their budgets. \n Republican support teetered last week when a nonpartisan congressional analysis projected the measure would strip 24 million people of coverage in a decade. The Congressional Budget Office also said the bill would cause huge out-of-pocket increases for many lower earners and people aged 50 to 64. \n Democrats have opposed the GOP repeal effort. They tout Obama's expansion of coverage to 20 million additional people and consumer-friendly coverage requirements it imposed on insurers, including abolishing annual and lifetime coverage limits and forcing them to insure seriously ill people. \n House approval would give the legislation much-needed momentum as it moves to the Senate, which Republicans control 52-48 but where five Republicans have expressed opposition. Trump used Monday's trip to single out perhaps the measure's most vociferous foe \u2014 Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul. \n \"He's a good guy,\" Trump said of one 2016 rival for the GOP presidential nomination. \"And I look forward to working with him so we can get this bill passed, in some form, so that we can pass massive tax reform, which we can't do till this happens.\" \n Enactment of the health care bill would clear the way for Congress to move to revamping the tax code and other GOP priorities. Defeat would wound Trump two months into his administration and raise questions about his ability to win support from his own party moving forward. \n Among the disgruntled were GOP lawmakers in the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, though the strength of their opposition was unclear. \n Associated Press reporters Matthew Daly and Julie Bykowicz contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump warns GOP of political costs of rejecting health bill"}

{"date": "March 21, 2017", "text": "CHICAGO >> A 15-year-old Chicago girl was apparently sexually assaulted by five or six men or boys on Facebook Live, and none of the roughly 40 people who watched the live video reported the attack to police, authorities said today. \n The video marks the second time in recent months that the Chicago Police Department has investigated an apparent attack that was streamed live on Facebook. In January, four people were arrested after a cellphone footage showed them allegedly taunting and beating a mentally disabled man. \n Police only learned of the latest alleged attack when the girl's mother approached the head of the police department, Superintendent Eddie Johnson, late Monday afternoon as he was leaving a department station in the Lawndale neighborhood on the city's West Side, department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. She told him her daughter had been missing since Sunday and showed him screen grab photos of the alleged assault. \n He said Johnson immediately ordered detectives to investigate and the department asked Facebook to take down the video, which it did. \n Guglielmi said today that detectives found the girl and reunited her with her family. He said she told detectives that she knows at least one of her alleged attackers, but it remained unclear how well they knew each other. He said investigators are questioning several people, but no one is considered a suspect yet and no arrests have been made. \n He said Johnson was \"visibly upset\" after he watched the video, both by its content and the fact that there were \"40 or so live viewers and no one thought to call authorities.\" \n Investigators know the number of viewers because the count was posted with the video. To find out who they were, though, investigators would have to subpoena Facebook and would need to \"prove a nexus to criminal activity\" to obtain such a subpoena, Guglielmi said by email. \n A spokeswoman for Facebook, Andrea Saul, said she had no specific comment on the Chicago incident but that the company takes its \"responsibility to keep people safe on Facebook very seriously.\" \n \"Crimes like this are hideous and we do not allow that kind of content on Facebook,\" she said. \n Jeffrey Urdangen, a professor at Northwestern University's law school and the director of the school's Center for Criminal Defense, said it isn't illegal to watch such a video or to not report it to the police. He also said child pornography charges wouldn't apply unless viewers were downloading the video. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police: Chicago teen apparently gang-raped on Facebook Live"}
