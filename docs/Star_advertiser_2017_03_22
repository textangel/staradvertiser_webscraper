{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Chief Justice John Roberts speaks in Lexington, Ky. in February. A unanimous Supreme Court today bolstered the rights of learning-disabled students in a ruling that requires public schools to offer special education programs that meet higher standards. \n Parents of learning disabled students say a unanimous Supreme Court ruling will make it easier for them to insist on appropriate services for their children, and harder for the schools to say no. \n The court today said that it is not enough for school districts to get by with minimal instruction for special needs children. They must design programs to let students make progress in light of their disabilities, and be prepared to explain their decisions when challenged. \n \"It is a massive victory for children with disabilities across this country who will really hold the cards when their parents go into the school system and say now it's time to act for my child to have an equal opportunity to achieve the American dream,\" said Maryland parent Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi, president of the nonprofit RespectAbility. \n The court struck down a lower standard endorsed by President Donald Trump's nominee to the high court, Neil Gorsuch, who quickly faced tough questions at his confirmation hearing. \n Chief Justice John Roberts sided with parents of an autistic teen in Colorado who said their public school did not do enough to help their son make progress. They sought reimbursement for the cost of sending him to private school. \n The case helps clarify the scope of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a federal law that requires a \"free and appropriate public education\" for disabled students. Lower courts said even programs with minimal benefits can satisfy the law. \n \"It's a validation to be able to say if the data is not showing that my child is making progress, we need to be looking at what other programs or what other services to put in place,\" said Amanda Morin, of Portland, Maine, who has two children with learning and attention issues. \n Roberts said the law requires an educational program \"reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child's circumstances.\" He did not elaborate on what that progress should look like, saying it depends on the \"unique circumstances\" of each child. \n School officials had warned of a possible surge in costly litigation should the court drastically raise the standard, and lead parents to make unrealistic demands. \n National School Boards Association General Counsel Francisco Negron said the court instead issued a \"measured\" decision. He said it would lead to schools more carefully tracking the progress of special needs students. But he praised the court for saying it would defer to the judgment of educational officials. \n At the Gorsuch hearing, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, of Illinois, said the high court had just tossed out a standard that Gorsuch himself had used in a similar case that lowered the bar for educational achievement. Durbin said the nominee had gone beyond the standards of his own appeals court by adding the word \"merely\" in his 2008 opinion approving the \"de minimis\" \u2014 or minimum \u2014 standard for special needs education. Durbin suggested that Gorsuch had lowered the bar even more. \n Gorsuch, handed a copy of the ruling during a break on the third day of his hearings, noted that his panel reached its decision unanimously based on a 10-year-old precedent. \n Durbin also said Gorsuch had ruled against disabled students in eight out of 10 cases dealing with the IDEA. \n \"To suggest I have some animus against children, senator, would be a mistake,\" Gorsuch said. \n The ruling does not go as far as the Colorado parents wanted. They had argued that educational programs for disabled students should meet goals \"substantially equal\" to those for children without disabilities. Roberts rejected that standard, saying it was \"entirely unworkable.\" \n The court's decision to require a more demanding test for progress has major implications for about 6.4 million disabled students who want to advance in school and rely on special programs to make that happen. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Parents empowered by Supreme Court ruling in special ed case"}

{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "COURTESY PIXABAY \n Few if any states have amended their laws to incorporate the phenomena of witnessing crimes online, explained Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA who has studied the issue. In theory, he says, laws that apply to in-person witnesses could be applied to social media witnesses. \n CHICAGO >> The case of a 15-year-old Chicago girl who authorities say was raped while around 40 people watched on Facebook raises questions that have come up before in other attacks: What's the obligation of bystanders who see a crime unfolding? And why do they not intervene? \n None of those who watched the sexual assault involving five or six men or boys called police. The girl knows at least one of her attackers, and investigators reported making good progress toward identifying the others. A closer look at what laws in the United States say about people who witness crimes: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE LAW IN GENERAL \n There is no all-encompassing legal obligation in the United States that a bystander who sees an act of violence must intervene or call police. But there are exceptions to that idea, dubbed the no-duty rule. Many states have laws requiring intervention when the victim of an ongoing attack is a child. The relationship of the witness to the victim is also a factor in assessing criminal or civil liability: Bosses may have a duty to intervene on behalf of employees, teachers for students and spouses for spouses. \n Other countries enshrine the principle that you must intervene into writing. The charter of human rights and freedoms in the Canadian province of Quebec says \"every person must come to the aid of anyone whose life is in peril, either personally or calling for aid, by giving him the necessary and immediate physical assistance, unless it involves danger to himself or a third person, or he has another valid reason.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n A LONG HISTORY \n The legal and ethical questions surrounding when and under what circumstances someone must help date back to ancient times. \n The biblical parable of the good Samaritan tells of a man who is beaten and robbed, then left wounded by the roadside. A Levite and a priest walk by, offering no assistance. A Samaritan eventually stops to care for the man. Some state laws that spell out witness obligations and liabilities are called good Samaritan laws. They are also sometimes referred as duty-to-rescue laws and duty-to-report laws. \n Among the best known recent instances of witness inaction happened in 1964, when Kitty Genovese was fatally stabbed outside her New York City apartment. Reports at the time alleged that dozens of witnesses saw the attack or heard the young woman scream but did nothing. While many researchers later concluded those accounts were exaggerated and even incorrect on key details, the slaying did focus a national spotlight on the obligations of witnesses to a crime. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n STATES WITH LAWS \n Some states require some level of intervention, even if only a 911 call, including California and Wisconsin. In Texas, it is a Class A misdemeanor not to immediately report an offense in which someone could be seriously hurt or killed. Massachusetts law requires, among other things, that people who witness a crime have full knowledge that what they are seeing is a crime. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE INTERNET \n Few if any states have amended their laws to incorporate the phenomena of witnessing crimes online, explained Eugene Volokh, a law professor at UCLA who has studied the issue. In theory, he says, laws that apply to in-person witnesses could be applied to social media witnesses. \n But a major complicating factor is whether internet witnesses can accurately assess what they see on their screens. \n \"It's even harder to determine if a crime is real or not,\" he said. Most internet users are used to seeing odd or surreal depictions and manipulated videos. \n Some state laws that make witnesses liable require that they were actually at the scene of the crime. That could not apply to someone watching from miles away. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE CHICAGO CASE \n Investigators in the Chicago sex assault know the number of Facebook viewers because the count was posted with the video. To find out who they were, though, investigators would have to subpoena Facebook and show proof of a direct link to the crime, police said. Jeffrey Urdangen, a professor at Northwestern University's law school, said it is not illegal to watch such a video or to fail to report it to police. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n THE 'GENOVESE SYNDROME' \n Genovese's death gave rise to the \"Genovese syndrome,\" which is now more widely known as \"bystanders' effect.\" It's the phenomenon described by psychologists that the more people who are watching an attack or some perilous situation befall a victim, the less likely any one of them will intervene. \n Multiple studies in the 1960s and since then made other observations, including that bystanders were even less likely to intervene if they were strangers than if they were friends. Some studies suggested crowds were less likely to act because each individual rationalizes that someone else in the crowd would act or already had. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Facebook rape stirs questions about witnessing crimes online"}

He traveled to New York on March 17 and had been staying in a Manhattan hotel. \n \"The reason he picked New York is because it's the media capital of the world and he wanted to make a statement,\" Aubrey said. \n Jackson was wandering the streets in a long overcoat concealing a 26-inch sword when he encountered Caughman, who was collecting bottles from trash cans, police said. Jackson stabbed him repeatedly in his chest and back, they said. \n Caughman, who was 66 years old and lived nearby in a transitional house, was taken to a hospital by police shortly after he arrived to the station house. He died at the hospital. According to his Twitter page, he was an autograph collector and a music and movie lover who tweeted about John Lennon, Chuck Berry and the best St. Patrick's Day writing. He said he'd like to visit California someday. \n After the attack, Jackson, who's 28, went to the bathroom of a nearby restaurant and washed off the blood from the killing, authorities said. \n Investigators said they believed Jackson was considering other attacks but surrendered after noticing his photo in media reports. He had two knives and told investigators where they could find the sword, police said. The sword was retrieved from a trash can not far from the scene. \n Video surveillance captured Jackson in the days leading up to the attack, and investigators said he had walked purposefully toward a black man but didn't attack him. \n Jackson was expected to appear in court later today. It was unclear when he might get a lawyer who could comment on his case. He said nothing to reporters as he was led from a police station. A call to his family's home phone rang unanswered. \n A former neighbor who tangled with Jackson over an apartment in Baltimore recalled him as \"a piece of work\" who fell months behind on rent. \n \"He's just one of those people that you wish you never met,\" said Marcus Dagan, who had been informally managing the building on behalf of its then-owner and took Jackson to court over the rent. \n Dagan said Jackson moved out in 2015 without paying. \n When Jackson moved in in 2014, he indicated he was a military veteran and was in college, studying toward becoming a lawyer, Dagan said. Jackson left behind a collection of war movies in the apartment, the former neighbor said. \n Jackson was in the Army from March 2009 to August 2012 and worked as a military intelligence analyst, the Army said. Deployed in Afghanistan from December 2010 to November 2011, he earned several medals and attained the rank of specialist. \n The circumstances of his discharge are unclear; the Army cites privacy laws that prevent releasing such details. \n Bias attacks have more than doubled this year in New York, and there have been nine bias crimes against black people reported, up from five in the same time period last year. \n Mayor Bill de Blasio said the sword killing was \"an assault\" on the city's inclusiveness and diversity.

But that diverse selection periodically allows ads to appear next to videos that marketers find distasteful, despite Google's efforts to prevent it from happening. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> AT&T, Verizon and several other major advertisers are suspending their marketing campaigns on Google's YouTube site after discovering their brands have been appearing alongside videos promoting terrorism and other unsavory subjects. \n The spreading boycott confronts Google with a challenge that threatens to cost it hundreds of millions of dollars. \n YouTube's popularity stems from its massive and eclectic library of video, spanning everything from polished TV clips to raw diatribes posted by people bashing homosexuals. \n But that diverse selection periodically allows ads to appear next to videos that marketers find distasteful, despite Google's efforts to prevent it from happening. \n Google depends largely on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. \n Earlier this week, Google vowed to step up its efforts to block ads on \"hateful, offensive and derogatory\" videos. \n \"We know that this is unacceptable to the advertisers and agencies who put their trust in us,\" Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, wrote in a Tuesday blog post. \n As part of Google's solution to the problem, Schindler promised to hire \"significant numbers\" of employees to review YouTube videos and flag them as inappropriate for ads. He also predicted YouTube would be able to address advertisers' concerns through Google's recent advancements in artificial intelligence \u2014 technology parlance for computers that learn to think like humans. \n But that promise so far hasn't appeased AT&T, Verizon Communications and an expanding global list of advertisers that includes Volkswagen, Audi, HSBC Holdings, the Royal Bank of Scotland and L'Oreal. \n \"We are deeply concerned that our ads may have appeared alongside YouTube content promoting terrorism and hate,\" AT&T said in a statement. \"Until Google can ensure this won't happen again, we are removing our ads from Google's non-search platforms.\" \n By extending its ban to everything beyond Google's search results, AT&T is also effectively pulling its ads from more than two million other websites that depend on Google to deliver ads to their pages. \n In its statement, Verizon said it decided to pull ads from YouTube to protect its website while it investigates the \"weak links\" among its digital advertising partners. \n Both AT&T and Verizon may have an ulterior motive to make YouTube look like an untrustworthy spot for marketers because both companies are trying to sell more digital ads in their own networks. \n YouTube has become one of the fastest growing parts of Google's ad system, which generated $79 billion in revenue last year. Google doesn't disclose how much of that came from YouTube ads, but the research firm eMarketer estimated that the video site accounted for $5.6 billion that amount. EMarketer projected YouTube's advertising will rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, but that prediction came before marketers began to suspend their spending. \n The YouTube boycott began late last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in videos delving into contentious themes. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "YouTube losing major advertisers upset with videos"}

{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This photo shows an employment application form on a table at a job fair in Hudson, N.Y. Middle-age white Americans with limited education are increasingly dying younger, on average, than other middle-age U.S. adults, a trend driven by their dwindling economic opportunities, two Princeton University economists have found. \n WASHINGTON >> Middle-age white Americans with limited education are increasingly dying younger, on average, than other middle-age U.S. adults, a trend driven by their dwindling economic opportunities, research by two Princeton University economists has found. \n The economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, argue in a paper released Thursday that the loss of steady middle-income jobs for those with high school degrees or less has triggered broad problems for this group. They are more likely than their college-educated counterparts, for example, to be unemployed, unmarried or afflicted with poor health. \n \"This is a story of the collapse of the white working class,\" Deaton said in an interview. \"The labor market has very much turned against them.\" \n Those dynamics helped fuel the rise of President Donald Trump, who won widespread support among whites with only a high school degree. Yet Deaton said his policies are unlikely to reverse these trends, particularly the health care legislation now before the House that Trump is championing. That bill would lead to higher premiums for older Americans, the Congressional Budget Office has found. \n \"The policies that you see, seem almost perfectly designed to hurt the very people who voted for him,\" Deaton said. \n Case and Deaton's paper, issued by the Brookings Institution, follows up on research they released in 2015 that first documented a sharp increase in mortality among middle-aged whites. \n Since 1999, white men and women ages 45 through 54 have endured a sharp increase in \"deaths of despair,\" Case and Deaton found in their earlier work. These include suicides, drug overdoses, and alcohol-related deaths such as liver failure. \n In the paper released Thursday, Case and Deaton draw a clearer relationship between rising death rates and changes in the job market since the 1970s. They find that men without college degrees are less likely to receive rising incomes over time, a trend \"consistent with men moving to lower and lower skilled jobs.\" \n Other research has found that Americans with only high school degrees are less likely to get married or purchase a home and more likely to get divorced if they do marry. \n \"It's not just their careers that have gone down the tubes, but their marriage prospects, their ability to raise children,\" said Deaton, who won the Nobel prize in economics in 2015 for his long-standing work on solutions to poverty. \"That's the kind of thing that can lead people to despair.\" \n It's not entirely clear why these trends have affected whites much more than they have African-Americans or Hispanics, whose death rates are improving. \n Case and Deaton note that many Hispanics are \"markedly better off\" than parents or grandparents who were born abroad, enabling a greater sense of optimism. African-Americans, they add, may have become more resilient to economic challenges given their long-standing disadvantages in the job market. \n The data is clear, though: In 1999, the death rate for high school-educated whites ages 50 through 54 was 30 percent lower than the death rate for all African-Americans in that age group. By 2015, it was 30 percent higher. \n The educational split is also growing. Even while the death rate for whites without a college degree is rising, the rate for whites who are college graduates is falling, Case and Deaton found. \n Americans with less education are also faring much worse when compared with adults in other countries, Case and Deaton concluded. Death rates in Europe for people with limited education are falling \u2014 and in most countries, they're falling faster than death rates for those with more education. \n For those reasons, Case and Deaton discount the notion that government disability benefit programs are responsible for some of these problems by enabling more Americans to stop working. Social welfare programs in Europe are typically more generous yet haven't caused a rise in death rates. \n Given the long-running nature of these trends, many of which stem from the 1970s, reversing them could take years, Case and Deaton write. But there are immediate steps that could be taken, Deaton said in the interview. Routine prescriptions for opioids should be cut back. \n And, \"Europe has a much better safety net than we do, and they're not seeing the same sort of problems as we are,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Less-educated middle-age U.S. whites dying younger than others"}

She survived, but her family says she has been battling for her life. \n She was found Feb. 17 in a dry canal in the small town of Smithfield, a suburb around Logan. \n The Associated Press is not naming the boys because they are juveniles. Prosecutors said they will seek to have them charged as adults. Another hearing is set for May 8 to determine if the boy accused of pulling the trigger will be tried as an adult. \n The AP is part of a media coalition that persuaded a judge to keep the proceedings open to the public. \n In court Tuesday, authorities showed a March 10 video of Deserae in a hospital bed, surrounded by tubes and blankets. Her long curly hair was cut off and her voice could barely be heard. She asked, \"Who did it and why?\" Smithfield police Detective Brandon Muir testified. \n Her father told her the boys were suspects, leading Deserae to flash a look of shock. Her eyes suggested she was trying to sort out what happened, Muir said. \n He added that a bullet remains pressed up to the front of Deserae's skull. \n Jill Parker, a spokeswoman for the girl's family, provided a family statement with an update on Deserae's condition today. \n Deserae had a successful surgery and has been admitted to inpatient rehab to undergo intensive therapies, the statement said. \n Investigators said they identified the teens after learning of text messages Deserae sent to a friend saying, \"I'm getting picked on.\" \n Groves, the sheriff's deputy, said the teen who fired the shot told him that without his friend there, he would not have had the courage to shoot Deserae. \n The boys then broke her cellphone and iPod and took $55 they found in her backpack, police said. \n Groves said that when he asked the boy why they took the money, the teen said, \"greed.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Boy told police plot to shoot girl started as 'crude joke'"}

{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump arrives to speak at the National Republican Congressional Committee March Dinner at the National Building Museum, Tuesday. \n NEW YORK >> Hard-line House Republicans considering voting against the House GOP health bill are bracing for payback from a president who claims his favorite biblical passage is \"an eye for an eye.\" Many appear ready to risk it. \n The scheduled roll call vote for the bill backed by President Donald Trump is a crucial first test of whether Republicans are willing to defy the White House and face the wrath of a president who has bragged about never forgetting a slight. Trump has shown he's willing to use his megaphone and practiced counter-punch against his allies. But the vote comes as Trump's poll numbers have slouched and his White House is consumed with damaging distractions. \n A group of breakaway Republicans, including several members of the deeply conservative House Freedom Caucus, today remain unbowed, taking comfort in the political safety they feel in their home districts. \n Members are well aware they face possible primary threats if they vote against the bill the White House has cast as the only chance to make good on a GOP promise to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's health care law. \n White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told holdout lawmakers today: \"You all have to vote for this. We've got to do this. I know you don't like it, but you have to vote for this,\" according to several representatives present. The comment came after Trump told a group Tuesday that \"many of you will lose your seats in 2018\" if Republicans don't pass a health care bill. \n \"They know,\" said Rep. Steve Stivers, of Ohio, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, of the looming primary threats. Stivers said he's heard Trump \"say things privately\" about retaliating against those who oppose the measure. \"Every member has their own calculations they have to look at,\" he said. \n More than two dozen members of the House Freedom Caucus oppose the plan because they say it doesn't go far enough to undo Obamacare. Some moderate GOP members, meanwhile, were turned off a recent Congressional Budget Office analysis predicting 24 million people would lose coverage in a decade. \n Most of the GOP no-voters represent safely Republican seats \u2014 some drawn to ensure they stay that way \u2014 and whose grip on power would only be threatened by a primary challenger. Among them is Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who was re-elected in November with 71 percent of the vote, making a stand against Trump a relatively safe bet. \n \"He has categorized himself as a staunch ideological conservative and can tell voters he was standing up for what he believed in,\" said Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky. \"(The White House) could send a bunch of money to go after him but there's no reason to think the Republican voters would buy into a fight on this.\" \n Massie tweeted today that he'd switched his vote from \"no\" to \"hell no.\" \n Many in the Freedom Caucus also have taken a stand knowing that while Trump is popular in their districts, they are equally so. Rep. Mark Meadows, chair of the caucus, did not face a primary challenger and was re-elected to his seat last year with more than 64 percent of the vote, slightly higher than Trump's total in his western North Carolina district. \n White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer has said the White House has not considered a course of action if the lawmakers defeat the bill, insisting today that Trump is \"not there to threaten them, he's there to explain the political landscape to them.\" \n But the White House has previewed what could be part of its strategy to seek retribution against those who defy the president: Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have each held rallies this month in deep red Kentucky. The president just raised more than $30 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee and could threaten members' money. And while Trump's overall numbers have slipped, he remains popular among Republicans and could hold campaign rallies in the districts of representatives who defied hm. \n The political stakes for Trump could not be much higher. \n Failure to pass the bill would be a dramatic setback for Republicans core campaign promise. Rebellion among House Republicans also would undercut Trump's self-promotion as a dealmaker and winner. The defeat would come just days after the FBI investigation confirmed it's investigating his campaign's contacts with Russian officials, would further damage a president with an approval rating hovering below 40 percent and weaken his ability to tackle the rest of his agenda. \n Trump has long touted his ability at dishing out payback. Whether with his Twitter account or onstage at a rally, Trump lets few slights \u2014 real or imagined \u2014 go unpunished. \n After Sen. Ted Cruz refused to endorse Trump at the Republican National Convention, the newly minted Republican nominee used the morning after his acceptance speech to tear into his former rival. Trump read out Sen. Lindsey Graham's personal cell phone to get back at him. He tore into a Gold Star family after the parents of a slain solider denounced him from the stage at the Democratic National Convention. And he went after a former beauty queen \u2014 even falsely claiming she had a sex tape \u2014 after she appeared in an ad for Hillary Clinton. \n Even after getting elected, Trump has showed little inclination to let bygones be bygones. \n He's warned that he would fund a Super PAC solely dedicated to defeat Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who never endorsed the president, if Kasich ever challenged him \u2014 an extraordinary threat from a sitting president. He also interjected himself into a state-level race to oust Kasich's hand-picked Ohio state party chair. \n And last week in Michigan, he turned to Republican Gov. Rick Snyder during a feel-good photo op to note that Snyder never endorsed him. \n \"I never forget,\" Trump said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Republicans rebelling against health care risk Trump's wrath"}

{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Shinjiro Shishido, director of \"Inochinodenwa\", non-profit telephone hotline for people seek help, speaks during an interview, in Tokyo this month. Fewer Japanese are taking their own lives, a glimmer of hope in a country with one of the world's highest suicide rates. \n TOKYO >> Fewer Japanese are taking their own lives, a positive sign in a country with one of the world's highest suicide rates. \n The Health Ministry said today that 21,897 people committed suicide in 2016, down from more than 30,000 in 2011 and the lowest number since 1994. Of those, 15,121 were male and 6,776 were female. It was the seventh straight year that the number of suicides had declined. \n Experts say it's difficult to pinpoint a reason for the decline, attributing it to a combination of factors. The government has made a determined effort to tackle the issue, starting with national legislation in 2006. Consumer loan laws have been revised to try to keep people from taking on too much debt, while awareness campaigns have helped bring the issue into the public eye. \n \"Now we can talk about suicides,\" said Yasuyuki Shimuzu, founder of Lifelink, a nonprofit that lobbies for suicide-prevention measures. \"I believe the change in environment has made it easier for the needy to seek help.\" \n Before the good news, however, came bad news. \n The number of suicides in Japan jumped sharply in 1998 to more than 30,000 and remained at that very elevated level for more than a decade. It was a year when Japan's economy fell into recession, and bankruptcies and unemployment soared. The suicide rate rose to about 26 per 100,000 people. \n The only silver lining was that suicides didn't jump again after a deep recession in 2008-09. Then in 2010, the decline started and has been steady since then, bringing the number back to pre-1998 levels. \n A closer look at the data shows that the main factors driving both the rise to more than 30,000 and the drop back to close to 20,000 were health issues and financial problems. The decline has been sharpest for people aged 50-59. \n Experts say the steps taken since 2006 have been effective in addressing the socio-economic problems common among middle-aged men. Prevention efforts are shifting their focus to the elderly and young, whose suicide rates have not come down as much. \n Even with the decline, Japan's suicide rate of 17.3 per 100,000 people in 2016 remains high compared to most other countries. The U.S. suicide rate is around 13 per 100,000, and the United Kingdom is under 10. \n Shimizu said Japan should aim to get the number of suicides down to 14,000-15,000 per year. \n The still-high suicide rate means Japan is a difficult place to live, a society that is not kind to troubled people, said Dr. Yutaka Motohashi, head of the government-funded Japan Support Center for Suicide Countermeasures. \n \"Suicide prevention is not a job for experts and special people supporting the cause, but it's for everyone,\" he said. \"We can be a little kinder and try to reach out to others.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Steady fall in suicides offers glimmer of hope in Japan"}

{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n After eight hours of debate, House Rules Committee Chairman Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, left, and Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., the vice-chair, listen to arguments today from committee chairs as the panel meets to shape the final version of the Republican health care bill before it goes to the floor for debate and a vote. \n WASHINGTON >> The top Republican legislative priority in peril, President Donald Trump dangled possible changes to the health care bill today aimed at placating conservatives threatening to torpedo the legislation. The White House seemed to make progress after GOP opposition had snowballed a day before a showdown House vote. \n Trump huddled at the White House with 18 lawmakers, a mix of supporters and opponents, Vice President Mike Pence saw around two dozen and House GOP leaders held countless talks with lawmakers at the Capitol. The sessions came as leaders rummaged for votes on a roll call they can ill-afford to lose without diminishing their clout for the rest of the GOP agenda. \n Most GOP opponents were conservatives asserting that the legislation demolishing former President Barack Obama's health care law did not go far enough. They were demanding repeal of the law's requirements that insurers pay for specified services like maternity care, prescription drugs and substances abuse treatment. \n Late today, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., met with moderate Republicans from Pennsylvania, Illinois, Maine and New York as well as members of leadership. Any changes on essential health benefits would likely trigger an immediate backlash from patient advocacy groups and doctors. \n In early meetings with Trump and Pence and later discussions with the White House, talks focused on language addressing conservatives' concerns that those coverage requirements drive up premiums. Details were unclear, but members of the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-line group spearheading the opposition, were expected at the White House early Thursday. \n \"Tonight is an encouraging night,\" said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., leader of the caucus, who for days has said he has the votes to kill the measure. \"But I don't want to be so optimistic as to say the deal is done.\" \n It was initially uncertain if the provision could survive in the Senate or how moderate Republicans would react. Democrats said the language would die in the Senate because that chamber's rules don't allow provisions not directly related to the federal budget. \n The Republican legislation would halt Obama's tax penalties against people who don't buy coverage and cut the federal-state Medicaid program for low earners, which the statute expanded. It would provide tax credits to help people pay medical bills, though generally skimpier than the aid Obama's statute provides. It also would allow insurers to charge older Americans more and repeal tax boosts the law imposed on high-income people and health industry companies. \n In a count by The Associated Press, at least 25 Republicans said they opposed the bill and others were leaning that way, enough to narrowly defeat the measure. The number was in constant flux amid eleventh-hour lobbying by the White House and GOP leaders. \n Including vacancies and expected absentees, the bill would be defeated if 23 Republicans join all Democrats in voting \"no.\" \n In a show of support for the opponents, the conservative Koch network promised today to spend millions of dollars to defeat the health care overhaul, the influential network's most aggressive move against the bill. \n Moderates were daunted by projections of 24 million Americans losing coverage in a decade and higher out-of-pocket costs for many low-income and older people, as predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. \n For now, leaders showed no sign of delaying a House vote, their initial attempt to deliver on a pledge to erase Obama's law they've repeated since its 2010 enactment. \n Underscoring the delicate pathway to victory, participants in the Pence meeting said there were no visible signs of weakened opposition and described one tense moment. Rep. Randy Weber, R-Texas, said White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told them: \"We've got to do this. I know you don't like it, but you have to vote for this.\" \n Weber said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, bristled. \n \"When somebody tells me I have to do something, odds are really good that I will do exactly the opposite,\" Barton said, according to Weber. \n Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said that talk of deleting the insurance coverage requirements had converted him into a supporter. But before the late talks, others were skeptical. \n \"We're being asked to sign a blank check,\" said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., who's been an opponent. \"In the past, that hasn't worked out so well.\" \n Some Republicans were showing irritation at their party's holdouts, all but accusing them of damaging the GOP. \n \"At some point we have to cowboy up and prove we can govern,\" said Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. \"Otherwise we're just going to be the 'no' party and some people are OK with that, it appears.\" \n The Rules Committee, usually tightly controlled by GOP leadership, was expected to let the chamber vote on revisions that top Republicans concocted to win votes. These include adding federal aid for older people and protecting upstate New York counties \u2014 but not Democratic-run New York City \u2014 from repaying the state billions of dollars for Medicaid costs. \n There were other glimmers of hope for GOP leaders. \n Rep. Lou Barletta, R-Pa., said he had switched from \"no\" to \"yes\" after Trump endorsed his bill to use Social Security numbers to hinder people from fraudulently collecting tax credits. Barletta, an outspoken foe of illegal immigration, said he had been promised a vote next month on the measure by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Leaders need votes for health bill on eve of House showdown"}

{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Supreme Court Justice nominee Neil Gorsuch, right, stands up during a break in his testimony on Capitol Hill in today. Gorsuch's wife Marie Louise Gorsuch, second from right, joins him. \n WASHINGTON >> Assured of support from majority Republicans, Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch wrapped up two days of Senate questioning today to glowing GOP reviews but complaints from frustrated Democrats that he concealed his views from the American public. \n Gorsuch, a federal appeals court judge in Denver, refused repeated attempts to get him to talk about key legal and political issues of the day. But he did tell Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who worried that Gorsuch would vote to restrict abortion, that \"no one is looking to return us to horse and buggy days.\" \n The Supreme Court itself threw one surprise Gorsuch's way when it ruled unanimously today in a case involving learning-disabled students, overturning a standard for special education that Gorsuch had endorsed in an earlier case on the same topic. \n The decision prompted sharp questioning from committee Democrats in the second of two days of testimony that spanned 20 hours. \n \"Why in your early decision did you want to lower the bar so low?\" Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois asked. \n Gorsuch said he was bound by an even earlier decision on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and said that any implication that he was against autistic children was \"heartbreaking.\" \n \"I was wrong senator, I was wrong because I was bound by circuit court precedent,\" Gorsuch said. \"And I'm sorry.\" \n Later today, Durbin elicited another apology from Gorsuch. The senator asked about an email Gorsuch sent while working at the Justice Department in which he criticized lawyers at big firms who were representing Guantanamo detainees. The email, Gorsuch said, \"was not my finest hour.\" \n Aside from a few uncomfortable moments, Gorsuch generally maintained the mix of earnest talk about respect for prior court decisions, a pledge for absolute independence \u2014 \"when you put on the robe, you open your mind\" \u2014 and folksy humor that led to lighthearted exchanges with Republicans about his passion for fly fishing. \n \"What's the largest trout you ever caught?\" Sen. Jeff Flake asked late in Tuesday's session. \"Oh, now we're talking,\" Gorsuch shot back. \n But every time Democrats tried to draw him out on a range of serious issues, including abortion and gay rights, Gorsuch answered in the same way: \"I have declined to offer any promises, hints or previews of how I'd resolve any case.\" Gorsuch similarly wouldn't commit to a view on cameras in the Supreme Court, despite widespread support from senators on the Judiciary Committee. \n He was sticking to the common practice of high court nominees to resist all requests to say how they feel about Supreme Court decisions. \n Feinstein, the committee's senior Democrat, summed up her colleagues' frustration. \"What worries me is you have been very much able to avoid any specificity like no one I have ever seen before,\" Feinstein told Gorsuch. \"And maybe that's a virtue, I don't know. But for us on this side, knowing where you stand on major questions of the day is really important to a vote 'aye,' and so that's why we pressed and pressed.\" \n Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Gorsuch's refusal to explicitly endorse key Supreme Court privacy rulings \"leaves doubt in the minds of millions of Americans.\" \n Republicans, on the other hand, couldn't get enough of the Colorado native. Sen. Orrin Hatch said he hadn't seen a better nominee in 40 years in the Senate. \n Lindsey Graham of South Carolina lamented what he called the deterioration of the Senate confirmation process since Antonin Scalia, whose seat Gorsuch would fill, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were confirmed with more than 90 votes each. \n \"What's happened? Did the Constitution change? I don't think so, I think politics has changed. I think it's changed in a fashion that we should all be ashamed of as senators, and I think we're doing great damage to the judiciary by politicizing every judicial nomination,\" Graham said. \n His statement about the process left out Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's nominee for the seat that opened up when Scalia died more than 13 months ago. Senate Republicans blocked any action on Garland's nomination all year, and the episode has left Democrats enraged. \n Following Graham, Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont said the treatment of Garland was unprecedented. \"For the first time in the history of the United States, the Senate refused to hold a hearing, refused to have a vote,\" he said. \n The hearing is taking place against the backdrop of turmoil in Trump's young presidency. Democrats including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are demanding a pause in Gorsuch's confirmation process pending the FBI investigation of alleged ties between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. Republicans have dismissed those demands. \n \"I think President Trump, with all of his problems and all of his mistakes, chose wisely when it came to this man,\" Graham said. \n Under questioning from Graham, Gorsuch repeated statements he'd made publicly for the first time Tuesday, that he was \"disheartened\" and \"demoralized\" by Trump's attacks on the judiciary, including federal judges who blocked the president's refugee travel ban. \n When Leahy pressed him on whether the president could ignore a court order, Gorsuch replied: \"You better believe I expect judicial decrees to be obeyed.\" \n The confirmation hearing will wrap up with a panel of outside witnesses talking about Gorsuch, before a committee vote expected April 3 and a Senate floor vote later that same week. Republicans control the Senate 52-48, so it would require eight Democrats to move Gorsuch past procedural hurdles that require 60 votes. \n No Democrat has yet pledged to support the judge, but Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said today he is open to voting for him. McConnell could also change Senate rules to confirm Gorsuch with a simple majority, and appears prepared to take that step. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pressed on abortion, Gorsuch says no return to 'horse and buggy' era"}

{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Wendy Lavarnia and Kansas Lavarnia \n PHOENIX >> The parents of a 9-year-old boy who was shot in the head in their Phoenix home put off calling 911 as they cleaned up evidence in multiple rooms of the house, police said today in calling it a case that \"shocks your conscience.\" \n Wendy Lavarnia told police that her 2-year-old son found a gun left on a bed and accidentally shot his older brother Monday. Police cast doubt on her story as they launched a murder investigation against the 28-year-old woman and her ex-convict husband, Kansas Lavarnia. \n Police began to become suspicious of the mother's story when they found inconsistencies in her account and when the boy's father showed up at the home with a crudely bandaged gunshot wound on his upper arm. The wound looked to have been punctured multiple times, possibly with a screwdriver, to camouflage the injury. \n Police declined to specify the mother's inconsistencies or say who they think shot the boy and his father. It's unclear whether the couple is now represented by lawyers who can speak on their behalf. \n Authorities said the parents delayed medical care for their son to clean up evidence in the house. Police declined to say whether they believe the boy would be alive had authorities been alerted sooner. \n But a probable-cause statement filed by police says the lack of visible blood and the extent of blood residue implied that a significant amount of time passed before authorities were called. \n \"We have a 9-year-old critically wounded, shot in the head, in dire need of lifesaving efforts and care, which was delayed and not provided to this young man,\" police Sgt. Vince Lewis said. \"It definitely shocks your conscience.\" \n Lewis declined to specify the efforts taken to clean up evidence in several rooms at the house. \n The father's appearance at the home three hours after officers started investigating was suspicious because he was injured, Lewis said. Police say they found evidence of blood in the trunk of the vehicle that Kansas Lavarnia drove to the house. \n He is accused of first-degree murder, child abuse and hindering prosecution, while Wendy Lavarnia is accused of first-degree murder, court documents said. Prosecutors have not yet charged them. \n In a court appearance before her son died, the mother asked a judge whether she could go to the hospital to see the boy, but the judge said she could not leave jail without posting bond. Kansas Lavarnia's only statements in court were responses to questions about his name and date of birth. \n They are now being held in lieu of $1 million bond each. \n Kansas Lavarnia had originally been booked on weapons misconduct. He was barred from having a gun in the home because of three 2009 convictions for theft and possession of burglary tools. He completed a three-year prison sentence in 2012. \n He blamed his convictions on a longstanding addiction to pain medications, saying he started taking the drugs after he broke his back in an ATV accident when he was 15, according to court records. \n He said he was sober from 18 to 21 but later resumed using pain medications. Once such drugs got too expensive, he turned to cheaper illegal drugs, using cocaine and heroin for a few years, records say. \n Neighbors of the couple said the children could sometimes be seen outside wearing only a diaper. \n \"Their kids were always running in the front with their diapers on,\" said Marie Mosley, who lives next door. \"They always yelled and cussed at them, which I didn't think was right, to cuss at little babies like that.\" \n Mosley also was surprised when she saw the mother emerge from the house showing little emotion, considering her child had just been shot in the head and taken away by paramedics barely alive. \n The couple's three surviving children are in the care of the state's child-welfare agency. \n Lavarnia's first conviction stemmed from a January 2009 arrest when he was seen crouched down in a car outside a home where $480 in property had been stolen.

{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks during a press conference at Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing Saturday. \n TOKYO >> North Korea has a criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump he probably wasn't expecting: He's too much like Barack Obama. \n North Korea's state media, which regularly vilified Obama in the strongest terms, had been slow to do the same with the Trump administration, possibly so that officials in Pyongyang could figure out what direction Trump will likely take and what new policies he may pursue. \n But his top diplomat's recent trip to Asia, which featured some pretty tough talk, appears to have loosened their lips. \n In North Korea's first official comments since new Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's swing through the region, a Foreign Ministry spokesman seized on the former oil executive's blunt assessment that Obama's strategy needs to be replaced and U.S. efforts to get North Korea to denuclearize over the past 20 years have been a failure. \n The spokesman then slammed Trump for adopting the same policies, particularly regarding tougher economic sanctions, nevertheless. \n \"Tillerson admitted the failure of the U.S. efforts to denuclearize the DPRK for 20 years and end of Obama's policy of 'strategic patience' during his recent tour,\" the North's official Korean Central News Agency said in the dispatch that ran late Monday, quoting the unnamed Foreign Ministry official. \"Now Tillerson is repeating what Obama touted \u2026 until he left the White House.\" \n North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or DPRK, hasn't exactly been sitting quietly by as Trump gets settled in. \n Just before Tillerson arrived in Tokyo, the North launched several ballistic missiles into the Sea of Japan. While he was still in China, it conducted a test of what it called a \"revolutionary\" new type of engine for its rockets. On Tuesday, it appears to have conducted more missile tests from the eastern port city of Wonsan, though they reportedly failed. \n To be fair, Trump doesn't really have a North Korea policy yet. \n Tillerson stressed repeatedly that a comprehensive policy review is underway and that the purpose of his trip to Asia was to hear out the North's neighbors. How much he was able to do that is questionable. South Korea has only an interim government these days, since its president was just forced out of office because of a scandal. China, North Korea's economic lifeline, has a longstanding dialogue-based agenda that Washington is already familiar with but has never shown much interest in. \n On the other hand, Tillerson did raise some eyebrows with a few tough-sounding warnings. \n While in Seoul, he said \"everything was on the table,\" including military intervention or even a pre-emptive strike if tougher sanctions or other diplomatic measures fail to achieve Washington's goals. \n Some policy experts in the U.S. say that is really more smoke than fire. \n \"If you look at Tillerson's full statements, they were much more of a continuation of current policy than has been portrayed in the press, with an emphasis on expanding sanctions,\" said David Wright, co-director and senior scientist of the Global Security Program for the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"You can try to squeeze North Korea with more sanctions and maybe slow its program, but it's hard to see how to stop it from moving ahead without diplomacy.\" \n Tillerson's remarks are completely in line with longstanding U.S. policy, including Obama's, but just stated more threateningly. President Bill Clinton, for example, is known to have seriously considered a pre-emptive strike over the nuclear issue in 1994. \n Even so, tone is important in diplomacy and Tillerson does seem to have reassured some in Seoul and Tokyo that the United States hasn't forgotten them. \n Pyongyang, however, seems to have hit the familiar bravado button. \n \"The nuclear force of the DPRK is the treasured sword of justice and the most reliable war deterrence to defend the socialist motherland and the life of its people,\" the official reportedly said. \"If the businessmen-turned-U.S. authorities thought that they would frighten the DPRK, they would soon know that their method would not work.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Take that!

{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. spoke with reporters outside the White House in Washington today following a meeting with President Donald Trump. \n WASHINGTON >> Private communications of Donald Trump and his presidential transition team may have been scooped up by American intelligence officials monitoring other targets and improperly distributed throughout spy agencies, the chairman of the House intelligence committee said today \u2014 an extraordinary public airing of often-secret information that brought swift protests from Democrats. \n Republican Rep. Devin Nunes' comments led the committee's ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff, to renew his party's calls for an independent probe of Trump campaign links to Russia in addition to the GOP-led panel's investigation. \n In back-to-back news conferences at the Capitol and then the White House \u2014 where he had privately briefed the president \u2014 Nunes said he was concerned by officials' handling of the communications in the waning days of the Obama administration. \n He said the surveillance was conducted legally and did not appear to be related to the current FBI investigation into Trump associates' contacts with Russia or with any criminal warrants. And the revelations, he said, did nothing to change his assessment that Trump's explosive allegations about wiretaps at Trump Tower were false. \n Still, the White House immediately seized on his statements in what appeared to be a coordinated public display. \n Moments after Nunes spoke on Capitol Hill, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer read his statements from the White House briefing room podium. The California congressman quickly headed up Pennsylvania Avenue to personally brief the president and to address reporters outside the West Wing. Nunes' decision to brief the president was particularly unusual, given Trump almost certainly has access to the information from his intelligence agencies. \n Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., said Nunes' disclosure could be a \"weapon of mass distraction\" in light of allegations of coordination between Russians and the Trump campaign during the 2016 campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton. \n \"This could be a lot of theatrics,\" said Speier, also a member of the House intelligence committee. \n Outside the White House, Nunes said, \"What I've read bothers me, and I think it should bother the president himself and his team.\" \n Trump said he felt \"somewhat\" vindicated by the Republican's revelations. \"I very much appreciated the fact that they found what they found,\" he said. \n The disclosure came two days after FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed the bureau's own investigation into the Trump campaign's connections with Russia and rejected Trump's explosive claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped his New York skyscraper during the election. Comey's comments came during the intelligence committee's first public hearing on Russia's election interference, an investigation being overseen by Nunes. \n Nunes briefed reporters on the new information without consulting with Schiff, and that did not sit well with the top Democrat on the committee. \n Schiff declared he now has \"profound doubt\" about the integrity and independence of the committee's probe. He said that \"a credible investigation cannot be conducted this way.\" \n Nunes said he believed the Trump team's communications were caught \"incidentally.\" But he suggested the contents may have been inappropriately disseminated in intelligence reports. He left open the possibility the communications were spread for political reasons. Nunes would not disclose how he received the new information. \n It was unclear whether Trump's own communications were monitored. Nunes initially said \"yes\" when asked if Trump was among those swept up in the intelligence monitoring, but then said it was only \"possible.\" \n It's common for Americans to get caught up in U.S. surveillance of foreigners, such as foreign diplomats in the U.S. talking to an American. Typically, the American's name would not be revealed in a report about the intercepted communications. However, if there is a foreign intelligence value to revealing the American's name, it is \"unmasked\" and shared with other intelligence analysts who are working on related foreign intelligence surveillance. \n Schiff disputed Nunes suggestions that there was improper \"unmasking.\" He said that after speaking with Nunes, it appeared that the names of Americans were still guarded in the intercepts though their identities could be gleaned from the materials. \n Obama administration officials disputed the suggestion that the outgoing administration was improperly monitoring its successors. Ned Price, who served as spokesman for Obama's National Security Council, said Nunes' assertions \"were nothing more than an attempt to offer a lifeline to a White House caught in its own netting following President Trump's baseless tweets.\" \n Matthew Waxman, a national security law professor at Columbia University, said Nunes' actions \"in this case are contributing to, rather than alleviating concerns, about politicization of intelligence.\" \n Nunes said the information on the Trump team was collected in November, December and January, the period after the election when Trump was holding calls with foreign leaders, interviewing potential Cabinet secretaries and beginning to sketch out administration policy. He said the monitored material was \"widely disseminated\" in intelligence reports. \n Asked whether he believed the transition team had been spied on, Nunes said: \"It all depends on one's definition of spying.\" \n Nunes did not identify any of the Trump associates he said were \"unmasked,\" but they are believed to include Michael Flynn, who was fired as White House national security adviser after misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials about his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n AP writers Eileen Sullivan and Eric Tucker contributed to this report. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Deb Riechmann at http://twitter.com/debriechmann \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Spying claim by Intel chair renews fight over Russia probe"}

She will seek membership in the Democratic Party. \n Her departure further depletes the Hawaii Republican Party, which is now reduced to just five elected officials, all of whom serve in the state House of Representatives. \n \"When I joined the Republican Party eight years ago, I did so with a group of people my age who were full of hope, ideas and energy,\" Fukumoto said in a news release. \"We saw an opportunity to take a political party that was broken, in a political system that seemed rigged, and even the playing field.

Cadden was acquitted today of murder allegations but convicted of racketeering and other crimes in a meningitis outbreak that was traced to fungus-contaminated drugs and killed 64 people across the country. \n BOSTON >> The former head of a Massachusetts pharmacy was acquitted today of murder allegations but convicted of racketeering and other crimes in a meningitis outbreak that was traced to fungus-contaminated drugs and killed 64 people across the country. \n Prosecutors said Barry Cadden, 50, ran the business in an \"extraordinarily dangerous\" way by disregarding regulations on cleanliness to boost production and make more money. \n Cadden, president and co-founder of the now-closed New England Compounding Center, was charged with 25 counts of second-degree murder, conspiracy and other offenses under federal racketeering law. \n After five days of deliberations, the jury refused to hold Cadden responsible for the deaths and cleared him on the murder counts. He was found guilty of racketeering, conspiracy and fraud and could get a long prison term at sentencing June 21. \n The 2012 outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections in 20 states was traced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to contaminated injections of medical steroids, given mostly to people with back pain. In addition to those who died, 700 people fell ill. Indiana, Michigan and Tennessee were hit hardest. \n Joan Peay, 76, of Nashville, Tennessee, suffered two bouts of meningitis after receiving a shot for back pain. She wept upon learning the verdict. \n \"He killed people and he's getting away with murder. I am furious,\" she said. She said that she got so sick from meningitis \"I didn't care if I died,\" and that she still suffers from hearing loss, memory problems, a stiff neck and low energy. \n Alfred Rye, 77, of Maybee, Michigan, said: \"I wish I could give him the same shot he gave me. I think they should pay for their crime.\" \n Rye fell ill after getting an injection in his lower back 4\u00bd years ago. He said he continues to suffer from a loss of balance and other ill effects. \n \"Life has been totally hell,\" he said. \n The racketeering charge and the 52 counts of fraud carry up to 20 years in prison each, but federal sentencing guidelines typically call for far less than the maximum. \n The scandal threw a spotlight on compounding pharmacies, which differ from ordinary drugstores in that they custom-mix medications and supply them directly to hospitals and doctors. In 2013, in reaction to the outbreak, Congress increased federal oversight of such pharmacies. \n Federal prosecutor Amanda Strachan told the jury during the two-month trial that the deaths and illnesses happened because Cadden \"decided to put profits before patients.\" \n NECC used expired ingredients and falsified logs to make it look as if the so-called clean rooms had been disinfected, prosecutors said. After the outbreak, regulators found multiple potential sources of contamination, including standing water and mold and bacteria in the air and on workers' gloved fingertips. \n Cadden's lawyer, Bruce Singal, told the jury Cadden was not responsible for the deaths and pointed the finger at Glenn Chin, a supervisory pharmacist who ran the clean rooms where drugs were made. Chin has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. \n After the verdict, Singal said it was a \"disgrace\" that prosecutors brought murder allegations against Cadden. \n \"We're very pleased that the jury acquitted Barry on all 25 of the murder charges and that he can now go home and tell his children that he's not a murderer,\" Singal said. \"At the same time, it is Barry's fervent wish \u2026 that people still remember the victims of this terrible public health outbreak.\" \n NECC filed for bankruptcy after getting hit with hundreds of lawsuits. NECC and several related companies reached a $200 million settlement with victims and their families. \n Tom Carroll, a lawyer for the family of Kentucky Judge Eddie C. Lovelace, who died after receiving injections to treat neck and back pain, said the family was disappointed by the outcome of the trial. \n \"They very strongly felt that a murder conviction was in order,\" Carroll said. \"The family thinks he should get the maximum penalty.\" \n Associated Press writers Chris Ehrmann in Lansing, Michigan, Sheila Burke in Nashville, Tennessee, and Bruce Schreiner in Frankfort, Kentucky, contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ex-pharmacy exec convicted in deadly meningitis outbreak"}

He died, as did three pedestrians on the bridge, and the police officer. \n A doctor who treated the wounded from the bridge said some had \"catastrophic\" injuries. Three police officers, several French teenagers on a school trip, two Romanian tourists and five South Korean visitors were among the injured. \n Police said they were treating the attack as terrorism. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. \n Metropolitan Police counterterrorism chief Mark Rowley said police believed there was only one attacker, \"but it would be foolish to be overconfident early on.\" He said an unarmed policeman, three civilians and the attacker died. Forty others, including three police officers, were injured. \n Islamic extremism was suspected in the attack, Rowley said, adding that authorities believe they know the assailant's identity but would not reveal it while the investigation was ongoing. \n The threat level for international terrorism in the U.K. was already listed at severe, meaning an attack was \"highly likely.\" \n Speaking outside 10 Downing St. after chairing a meeting of government's emergency committee, COBRA, May said that level would not change.

About 10 yards away lay the assailant. \n \"I tried to stem the flow of blood and give mouth to mouth while waiting for the medics to arrive but I think he had lost too much blood,\" Ellwood said. \"He had multiple wounds, under the arm and in the back.\" \n The attack began in the early afternoon London time as a driver in a gray SUV slammed into pedestrians on the bridge linking Parliament to the south bank of the River Thames. \n Former Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski was in a car crossing the bridge when he heard \"something like a car hitting metal sheet\" and then saw people lying on the pavement. \n \"I saw one person who gave no signs of life. One man was bleeding from his head. I saw five people who were at least seriously injured,\" Sikorski told Poland's TVN24. \n Ambulances arrived within minutes to treat people who lay scattered along the length of the bridge. One bloodied woman lay surrounded by a scattering of postcards. \n Police said one injured woman was pulled from the river. \n The car crashed into railings on the north side of the bridge, less than 200 yards (meters) from the entrance to Parliament. As people scattered in panic, witnesses saw a man holding a knife run toward the building. \n \"The whole crowd just surged around the corner by the gates just opposite Big Ben,\" said witness Rick Longley. \"A guy came past my right shoulder with a big knife and just started plunging it into the policeman. I have never seen anything like that. I just can't believe what I just saw.\" \n The attacker managed to get past a gate into Parliament's fenced-in New Palace Yard, a cobbled courtyard in the shadow of the Big Ben clock tower. \n Daily Mail journalist Quentin Letts said a man in black attacked the police officer before being shot two or three times as he tried to storm into the building. \n \"As this attacker was running towards the entrance two plain-clothed guys with guns shouted at him what sounded like a warning, he ignored it and they shot two or three times and he fell,\" Letts told the BBC. \n The attacker fell to the cobbles just yards from the entrance to 1,000-year-old Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the parliamentary complex, busy with visitors and school groups. Beyond that, a corridor leads to the building's Central Lobby, flanked by House of Commons and House of Lords chambers. \n The prime minister was among lawmakers near the Commons at the time of the attack, and was quickly ushered away by security officers and driven back to Downing Street. \n To get that far, the attacker would have had to evade the armed officers who patrol the Parliament complex in pairs, as well as Parliament's own security staff, who don't carry guns. \n The attack unfolded near some of the city's most famous tourist sites, including the London Eye, a large Ferris wheel with pods that overlook the capital. It was halted after the attack, stranding visitors in the pods, with an aerial view of the attack scene. \n London Ambulance Service said medics treated 12 people for serious injuries and eight who were less seriously hurt. \n Dr. Colleen Anderson of St. Thomas' Hospital said some of the wounded had \"catastrophic\" injuries. \n The French Foreign Ministry said that three students on a school trip from Saint-Joseph in the Brittany town of Concarneau were among the injured. Two Romanians were also among the injured, the country's Foreign Ministry said. \n U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with May by telephone and applauded \"the quick response of British police and first responders,\" spokesman Sean Spicer said. \n London has often been the target of terrorist attacks, from IRA campaigns in the 1970s and 80s to more recent Islamist plots. \n On July 7, 2005, four al-Qaida-inspired British bombers blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus in London, killing 52 people. \n British security forces say they have thwarted some 13 terror plots over the past four years, but in recent years the U.K. has largely been spared major international terror attacks such as the ones seen in Belgium and France. \n Last year, a far-right supporter shot and killed British lawmaker Jo Cox, who had campaigned for the U.K. to remain in the European Union. Prior to that, an attacker claiming to be motivated by Syria stabbed three people at a London subway station. \n The most gruesome recent attack occurred in 2013 when two Muslim converts of Nigerian descent attacked Lee Rigby, a British soldier who was walking down the street. The men ran Rigby down with their vehicle and then used a cleaver to hack him to death as bystanders watched in horror. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "5 dead in vehicle, knife attack at British Parliament"}

Germany's Cabinet approved a bill that will annul the convictions of thousands of gay men under a law criminalizing homosexuality that was applied zealously in post-World War II West Germany. \n BERLIN >> Germany's Cabinet on Wednesday approved a bill that would annul the convictions of thousands of gay men under a law criminalizing homosexuality that was applied zealously in post-World War II West Germany. \n The decision clears the way for compensation for those still alive who were among the 50,000 men convicted between 1949 and 1969 under the so-called Paragraph 175 outlawing sexual relations between men. The legislation was introduced in the 19th century, toughened under Nazi rule and retained in that form by West Germany. \n Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1969 but the legislation wasn't taken off the books entirely until 1994. \n The bill approved Wednesday by Chancellor Angela Merkel's Cabinet of conservatives and center-left Social Democrats still requires parliamentary approval. It foresees compensation of 3,000 euros ($3,230) for each conviction, plus 1,500 euros for every year of jail time that convicted men started. \n \"The rehabilitation of men who ended up in court purely because of their homosexuality is long overdue,\" Justice Minister Heiko Maas said. \"They were persecuted, punished and ostracized by the German state just because of their love for men, because of their sexual identity.\" \n \"The strength of a state of law is reflected in having the strength to correct its own mistakes,\" he said. \"We have not just the right but the obligation to act.\" \n In 2000, Germany's parliament approved a resolution regretting the fact that Paragraph 175 was retained after the war. Two years later, it annulled the convictions of gay men under Nazi rule, but not post-war convictions. \n The Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany \"welcomes the fact that, after long decades of ignorance, legal consequences are being drawn from the serious mass human rights violations that were committed against homosexual people by the democratic state,\" spokesman Helmut Metzner said. \n The planned legal rehabilitation will exclude men who were convicted for homosexual activities with children or for acts that involved violence or threats. \n In addition to individual compensation, the government plans to give an annual 500,000 euros in funding to the Magnus Hirschfeld Foundation, named after a pioneering German sex researcher and gay-rights activist of the post-World War I period. \n The foundation is working on documenting the stories of men convicted under Paragraph 175. \n In October, the British government announced that thousands of men convicted under now-abolished laws outlawing homosexuality would receive posthumous pardons, while those still alive will be eligible to have their criminal records wiped clean. \n A few other countries, including Canada and New Zealand, are considering pardons for people convicted under now-repealed laws against gay sex. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Germany OKs plan to annul homosexuality convictions"}

{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, shook hands with Russian metals magnate Oleg Deripaska, in Sept. 2014, while visiting the RusVinyl plant in Kstovo, in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod region. President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, secretly worked for Deripaska, a Russian billionaire, to advance the interests of Putin a decade ago and proposed an ambitious political strategy to undermine anti-Russian opposition across former Soviet republics. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Then-Trump Campaign manager Paul Manafort stood between the then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump, on July 21, during a walk-through at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Associated Press has learned that Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign manager, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago and proposed an ambitious political strategy to undermine anti-Russian opposition across former Soviet republics, The Associated Press has learned. The White House today acknowledged the AP's revelations had \"started to catch a lot of buzz\" but brushed them aside, though some members of Congress expressed alarm. \n Manafort proposed in a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005 that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and the former Soviet republics to benefit the Putin government, even as U.S.-Russia relations under Republican President George W. Bush grew worse. \n Manafort pitched the plans to Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work. \n \"We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success,\" Manafort wrote in the 2005 memo to Deripaska. The effort, Manafort wrote, \"will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government.\" \n White House spokesman Sean Spicer indicated today that President Trump had not been aware of Manafort's work on behalf of Deripaska. \n \"To suggest that the president knew who his clients were from 10 years ago is a bit insane,\" Spicer said. He noted the AP's reporting \"has started to catch a lot of buzz\" but said Manafort's work occurred long before he became Trump's campaign chairman. \"I don't know what he got paid to do,\" Spicer said, adding, \"There's no suggestion he did anything improper.\" \n Manafort's plans were laid out in detailed documents obtained by the AP that included strategy memoranda and records showing international wire transfers for millions of dollars. How much work Manafort performed under the contract was unclear. The work appears to contradict assertions by the Trump administration and Manafort himself that he never worked for Russian interests. \n Manafort confirmed again today in a statement that he had worked for Deripaska but denied his work had been pro-Russian in nature. He added, \"I look forward to meeting with those conducting serious investigations of these issues.\" \n An official representative of Deripaska said simply in a statement today: \"There was an agreement between Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Manafort to provide investment consulting services related to business interests of Mr Deripaska which now is a subject to legal claims.\" \n The disclosures come as Trump campaign advisers are the subject of an FBI probe and two congressional investigations, and they appear to guarantee that Manafort will be sought as a key witness in upcoming hearings. Investigators are reviewing whether the Trump campaign and its associates coordinated with Moscow to meddle in the 2016 campaign. Manafort has dismissed the investigations as politically motivated and misguided. The documents obtained by AP show Manafort's ties to Russia were closer than previously revealed. \n Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the disclosures \"serious stuff\" and more evidence that an independent congressional committee should investigate the Trump administration. \"Other shoes will drop,\" he said. \n Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic, said of Manafort: \"Clearly, if he's getting millions of dollars from a billionaire close to Putin, to basically undermine democratic movements, that's something I'd want to know about. I doubt if Trump knew about it.\" \n Democrats on the House intelligence committee said the new revelations will feature in their investigations. \n The disclosure \"undermines the groundless assertions that the administration has been making that there are no ties between President Trump and Russia. This is not a drip, drip, drip,\" said Rep. Jackie Speier of California. \"This is now dam-breaking with water flushing out with all kinds of entanglements.\" \n Deripaska became one of Russia's wealthiest men under Putin, buying assets abroad in ways widely perceived to benefit the Kremlin's interests. U.S. diplomatic cables from 2006 described him as \"among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis\" and \"a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin's trips abroad.\" In response to questions about Manafort's consulting firm, a spokesman for Deripaska in 2008 \u2014 at least three years after they began working together \u2014 said Deripaska had never hired the firm. Another Deripaska spokesman in Moscow last week declined to answer AP's questions. \n Manafort worked as Trump's unpaid campaign chairman last year from March until August, a period that included the Republican National Convention that nominated Trump in July. Trump asked Manafort to resign after AP revealed that he had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation until 2014 on behalf of Ukraine's ruling pro-Russian political party. \n The newly obtained business records link Manafort more directly to Putin's interests in the region. According to those records and people with direct knowledge of Manafort's work for Deripaska, Manafort made plans to open an office in Moscow, and at least some of his work in Ukraine was directed by Deripaska, not local political interests there. The Moscow office never opened. \n Manafort has been a leading focus of the U.S. intelligence investigation of Trump's associates and Russia, according to a U.S. official. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the investigation are confidential. Meanwhile, federal criminal prosecutors became interested in Manafort's activities years ago as part of a broad investigation to recover stolen Ukraine assets after the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych there in early 2014. No U.S. criminal charges have ever been filed in the case. \n FBI Director James Comey, in confirming to Congress the federal intelligence investigation this week, declined to say whether Manafort was a target. Manafort's name was mentioned 28 times during the hearing of the House intelligence committee, mostly about his work in Ukraine. No one mentioned Deripaska. \n On Monday, Spicer had said Manafort \"played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time\" in the presidential campaign, even though he was Trump's campaign chairman. Spicer today said further that Manafort was hired to oversee the campaign's delegate operation. \"To be clear, he got the job done on the delegates,\" Spicer said. \n Manafort and his associates remain in Trump's orbit. Manafort told a colleague this year that he continues to speak with Trump by telephone. Manafort's former business partner in eastern Europe, Rick Gates, has been seen inside the White House on a number of occasions, helped plan Trump's inauguration and now runs a nonprofit organization, America First Policies, to back the White House agenda. \n Gates, whose name does not appear in the documents, told the AP that he joined Manafort's firm in 2006 and was aware Manafort had a relationship with Deripaska but was not aware of the work described in the memos. Gates said his work was focused on domestic U.S. lobbying and political consulting in Ukraine at the time. He said he stopped working for Manafort's firm in March 2016 when he joined Trump's presidential campaign. \n Manafort told Deripaska in 2005 that he was pushing policies as part of his work in Ukraine \"at the highest levels of the U.S. government \u2014 the White House, Capitol Hill and the State Department,\" according to the documents. He also said he had hired a \"leading international law firm with close ties to President Bush to support our client's interests,\" but he did not identify the firm. Manafort also said he was employing unidentified legal experts for the effort at leading universities and think tanks, including Duke University, New York University and the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \n Manafort did not disclose details about the lobbying work to the Justice Department during the period the contract was in place. \n Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, people who lobby in the U.S. on behalf of foreign political leaders or political parties must provide detailed reports about their actions to the department. Willfully failing to register is a felony and can result in up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, though the government rarely files criminal charges. \"I don't know if he violated the Foreign Agent Registration Act,\" Sen. Graham said, \"but it's something I think we all need to know more about.\" \n Deripaska owns Basic Element Co., which employs 200,000 people worldwide in the agriculture, aviation, construction, energy, financial services, insurance and manufacturing industries, and he runs one of the world's largest aluminum companies. Forbes estimated his net worth at $5.2 billion. How much Deripaska paid Manafort in total is not clear, but people familiar with the relationship said money transfers to Manafort amounted to tens of millions of dollars and continued through at least 2009. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the secret payments publicly. \n In strategy memos, Manafort proposed that Deripaska and Putin would benefit from lobbying Western governments, especially the U.S., to allow oligarchs to keep possession of formerly state-owned assets in Ukraine. He proposed building \"long term relationships\" with Western journalists and a variety of measures to improve recruitment, communications and financial planning by pro-Russian parties in the region. \n Manafort proposed extending his existing work in eastern Europe to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Georgia, where he pledged to bolster the legitimacy of governments friendly to Putin and undercut anti-Russian figures through political campaigns, nonprofit front groups and media operations. \n For the $10 million annual contract, Manafort did not use his public-facing consulting firm, Davis Manafort. Instead, he used a company, LOAV Ltd., that he had registered in Delaware in 1992. He listed LOAV as having the same address as his lobbying and consulting firms in Alexandria, Virginia. In other records, LOAV's address was listed as Manafort's home, also in Alexandria. Manafort sold the home in July 2015 for $1.4 million. He now owns an apartment in Trump Tower in New York, as well as other properties in Florida and New York. \n One strategy memo to Deripaska was written by Manafort and Rick Davis, his business partner at the time. In written responses to the AP, Davis said he did not know that his firm had proposed a plan to covertly promote the interests of the Russian government. \n Davis said he believes Manafort used his name without his permission on the strategy memo. \"My name was on every piece of stationery used by the company and in every memo prior to 2006. It does not mean I had anything to do with the memo described,\" Davis said. He took a leave of absence from the firm in late 2006 to work on Sen. McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. \n Manafort's work with Deripaska continued for years, though they had a falling out laid bare in 2014 in a Cayman Islands bankruptcy court. The billionaire gave Manafort nearly $19 million to invest in a Ukrainian TV company called Black Sea Cable, according to legal filings by Deripaska's representatives. It said that after taking the money, Manafort and his associates stopped responding to Deripaska's queries about how the funds had been used. \n Early in the 2016 presidential campaign, Deripaska's representatives openly accused Manafort of fraud and pledged to recover the money from him. After Trump earned the nomination, Deripaska's representatives said they would no longer discuss the case. \n Associated Press writers Jack Gillum, Eric Tucker, Julie Pace, Ted Bridis, Stephen Braun, Julie Bykowicz and Monika Mathur contributed to this report in Washington; Nataliya Vasilyeva contributed from Moscow and Kiev, Ukraine; and Jake Pearson contributed from New York. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump campaign chief linked to Putin interests"}

{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Supreme Court Justice nominee Neil Gorsuch gestures as he testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n WASHINGTON >> Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch enters the third day of his nomination hearings largely unscathed by Democratic attacks, as Republicans confidently predict he will win confirmation despite liberal opposition. \n A growing number of Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, are calling for Gorsuch's confirmation to be delayed because of the FBI investigation of ties between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia. But Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa dismissed that demand as \"ridiculous,\" and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told The Associated Press: \"Gorsuch will be confirmed. I just can't tell you exactly how that will happen yet.\" \n Even with Democrats divided over how hard to fight Gorsuch's nomination, the political intensity accompanying his confirmation process seemed at times palpable during the second day of hearings Tuesday, as the questioning stretched beyond 11 hours. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut announced he would be asking Gorsuch about the \"elephant in the room\" \u2014 Trump \u2014 and tried to draw him out over Trump's attacks on judges, including those who halted his immigration travel ban. \n \"When anyone criticizes the honesty and integrity or the motives of a federal judge, I find that disheartening, I find that demoralizing,\" Gorsuch said. \n \"Including the president?\" Blumenthal said. \n \"Anyone is anyone,\" Gorsuch replied. \n It was the first time Gorsuch had said publicly what he had told senators, including Blumenthal, in private meetings in recent weeks. \n Gorsuch's exchange with Blumenthal also yielded the surprising revelation that Trump had used a private interview with Gorsuch, prior to nominating him in January, to muse about having lost Colorado in the presidential election and argue that he would have won the state if given more time. Gorsuch serves on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, and would fill the 13-month vacancy on the high court created by the death of Antonin Scalia last year. \n Gorsuch, who will face additional questioning from senators Wednesday, made two other notable statements in response to questions from members of the Judiciary Committee, and both also related to Trump, who nominated him. \n Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina asked Gorsuch whether Trump had asked him to overturn Roe v. Wade, the case establishing a right to abortion, and what he would have done had Trump asked him to do so. \n \"Senator, I would have walked out the door,\" Gorsuch replied. \"That's not what judges do.\" \n And when Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy asked Gorsuch if a president is free to ignore laws on national security grounds, Gorsuch replied that \"nobody is above the law in this country, and that includes the president of the United States.\" \n Still the day was mostly devoid of drama as Gorsuch swatted away Democrats' efforts to get him to reveal his views on abortion, guns and other controversial issues, insisting he keeps \"an open mind for the entire process\" when he makes rulings. \n There are now just eight justices on the nine-member high court. There have been a number of 4-4 ties and Gorsuch, a highly credentialed conservative who is ideologically akin to Scalia, would be expected to join the bloc of largely conservative justices. \n The confirmation hearing will wrap up with a panel of outside witnesses talking about Gorsuch, before a committee vote expected April 3 and a Senate floor vote later that same week. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Gorsuch unscathed facing last day of hearings"}

{"date": "March 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday to rally support for the Republican health care overhaul by taking his case directly to GOP lawmakers. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump and House leaders are revving up pressure on balky conservatives and other Republican lawmakers as crunch time approaches on the party's health care overhaul bill, a drive GOP leaders concede they can't afford to lose. \n A day before the House planned votes on the measure, Trump was expected to continue hunting support for what would be a significant achievement for his young presidency. But underscoring the bill's uncertain fate, a senior administration official said that 20 to 25 House Republicans remained opposed or undecided. That's a grave figure since united Democratic opposition means the measure crashes if 22 GOP lawmakers vote \"no.\" \n \"If we keep our promise, people will reward us,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters Tuesday of GOP vows to demolish former President Barack Obama's health care law that the GOP has assailed since its enactment in 2010. \"If we don't keep our promise, it will be very hard to manage this,\" the speaker said. \n \"Honestly, a loss is not acceptable, folks,\" Trump told lawmakers at a closed-door Capitol meeting with House Republicans. He warned they'd face widespread defeats in next year's elections and possible loss of control of the chamber if the measure failed. \n Trump's remarks and the White House nose count of votes were each described by Republicans who provided inside information on condition of anonymity. \n Emerging from the meeting at the Capitol, Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., said Trump told Republicans he would campaign for them if they backed the bill. Trump didn't indicate what he would do to those who vote against the bill, but during that meeting, he singled out Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., an outspoken critic of the bill. \n Collins said Trump asked Meadows to stand up, called him a great guy and said he is counting on Meadows to get this over the line. \n Another person at the event said Trump told Meadows, \"I'm gonna come after you so hard.\" Trump delivered that line with a smile, but it was also lined with a touch of seriousness, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private meeting. \n The Republican legislation would halt Obama's tax penalties against people who don't buy coverage and shrink the federal-state Medicaid program for low earners, which the statute has expanded. It would provide tax credits for medical bills, though generally skimpier than the aid Obama's statute provides. It also would allow insurers to charge older Americans more and repeal tax boosts the law imposes on high-income people and health industry companies. \n The House Rules committee, usually tightly controlled by GOP leadership, was meeting Wednesday to set the terms of debate. \n The panel was expected to let the chamber vote on revisions that top Republicans concocted to win votes. These include adding federal aid for older people and protecting upstate New York counties \u2014 but not Democratic-run New York City \u2014 from repaying the state billions of dollars for Medicaid costs. \n Eager to showcase their support for Obama's law, House Democrats invited former Vice President Joe Biden to speak Wednesday on the Capitol's steps. Democrats champion the statute for its expansion of health care coverage to 20 million more people and requiring insurers to cover the very ill, families' grown children to age 26 and specified services like mental health care. \n While victory remained uncertain in the House, both sides were looking ahead to what could be an even tougher Senate fight. \n Republicans control that chamber 52-48 and six GOP senators have already said they oppose the legislation, enough to sink it without changes. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in an interview with The Associated Press Tuesday he will \"have the president weigh in\" with senators. \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and other Democrats will try removing provisions from the GOP bill cherished by conservatives: letting states require some Medicaid recipients to work and barring federal health subsidies from use for abortions. The tactic was described by a Democrat speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss strategy, and it could weaken conservative support for the measure if successful. \n The Senate will debate the bill under rules barring provisions not directly related to the federal budget. The Senate parliamentarian makes that call and it would take 60 votes to overrule that decision \u2014 a threshold Republicans would be unlikely to reach. \n At least a dozen of the House's most conservative lawmakers and a smattering of GOP moderates have said they oppose the Republican bill. \n Many conservatives are demanding that the bill void Obama's restrictions on insurers, which they say drive up premiums. Moderates' concerns include a worry that the measure would snatch insurance from many voters \u2014 a week after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the measure would toss 24 million off coverage in a decade. \n \"We're repealing Democrats' over-regulation of one-sixth of our economy with Republican over-regulation, just not quite as much,\" said Rep. Rod Blum, R-Iowa, among the opponents. \n House GOP leaders' amendments to round up votes will literally be costly. \n The budget office had projected the original bill would cut federal deficits by $337 billion over a decade. But those savings are plummeting as top Republicans dole out provisions to nail down backing. Language helping older and disabled people includes $85 billion set aside for the Senate to beef up tax credits for people aged 50 to 64, who budget analysts said would see big cost increases from the GOP bill. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "GOP leaders boost pressure as health bill crunch time nears"}

Presidents of historically black colleges and universities were mocked by some for posing for a photo with Trump in the White House, and then saw no increase in money for their schools in Trump's budget. The administration has proposed cuts in financial assistance that students depend on. \n In fact, Richmond said he's been urged by his constituents, black voters and even caucus members to cancel the meeting and instead focus only on resisting the president's agenda and reducing the chances for his re-election, similar to what he said tea party Republicans did to former President Barack Obama. \n He said \"if our only action is to resist,\" African-Americans around the country are going to suffer disproportionately. \n \"We have a responsibility as African-American leaders to always put them first,\" Richmond said. \n Trump is willing to work with the black caucus, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Monday. \n \"Maybe they won't agree on 100 percent or 60 percent, but maybe there's 15, 20 or 30 percent of the issues, maybe there's one bill in particular that they can work on,\" Spicer said. \"But there's a willingness to sit down and talk and I think that's the first step in the process of any of these.\" \n The Congressional Black Caucus is made up of 49 black members of Congress, mostly Democrats, but Republican Rep.

And while the top PGA Tour players are in Austin, the rest are at the Puerto Rico Open. \n Also back in action this week is the Web.com Tour in Louisiana. \n Two tournaments will be without defending champions. Tony Finau won in Puerto Rico last year, but he's the first alternate in Match Play and is taking his chances by waiting around in Texas. Wesley Bryan won in Louisiana last year, and now he's in Puerto Rico trying to win to get into the top 50 and receive a Masters invitation. \n INTERNATIAON FEDERATION OF PGA TOURS \n The early days of the Match Play brought out the unpredictable nature of the format, especially when it was single elimination. The seeds of the first four champions were No. 24 (Jeff Maggert), No. 19 (Darren Clarke), No. 55 (Steve Stricker) and No. 62 (Kevin Sutherland). \n Since then, only one player beyond the No. 21 seed has won. That was Geoff Ogilvy (No. 52) at La Costa in 2006. Ogilvy went on to win the U.S. Open that summer. \n Tiger Woods won three times, but he hasn't been eligible the last three years and last played in 2013 when he lost to Charles Howell III in the opening round. Day will try to join Woods as a three-time winner. Along with winning a year ago, he outlasted the French magician , Victor Dubuisson, in a most wild affair in the Arizona desert even as Dubuisson was getting up-and-down from the cactus. \n The No. 1 seed is Dustin Johnson, who won in Mexico three weeks ago and will try to become the first player to sweep all four World Golf Championships. \n Television: Wednesday-Friday, 2-8 p.m. (Golf Channel); Saturday, 10 a.m.-2 p.m. (Golf Channel), 2-6 p.m. (NBC). Sunday, 10 a.m.-2 p.m. (Golf Channel), 3-7 p.m. (NBC). \n LPGA TOUR \n It was only three years ago that Stacy Lewis swept all the LPGA Tour awards, starting with player of the year. \n Now she can't seem to win. \n Lewis was runner-up last week for the 12th time since her last victory in Arkansas in June 2014. She's back to try again this week at the Kia Classic, which boasts another strong field with the first major of the year the following week. \n Lydia Ko won the first of her four LPGA titles last year at Aviara Golf Club north of San Diego. No one has won the tournament more than once since it began in 2010. \n Television: Thursday-Friday, 8:30-10:30 p.m. (Golf Channel); Saturday, 5:30-9 p.m. (Golf Channel); Sunday, 6-9 p.m. (Golf Channel). \n PGA TOUR \n Wesley Bryan's latest trick might be his most difficult \u2014 getting into the Masters. \n The South Carolina native famous for his trick-shot videos that made him a YouTube sensation will have to win the Puerto Rico to have any chance to get into the top 50 in the world. That's critical because this is the last week to get into the top 50 and earn a spot in the Masters. \n Bryan now lives in Augusta, Georgia, so the motivation is plenty strong. \n Puerto Rico has produced first-time PGA Tour winners each of the last five years. The last two were in playoffs won by Finau and Alex Cejka. \n Television: Thursday-Friday, 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. (Golf Channel); Saturday, 2-5:30 p.m. (Golf Channel); Sunday, 2:30-6 p.m. (Golf Channel). \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Match Play in Texas, and the LPGA gears up for a major"}
