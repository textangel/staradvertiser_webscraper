{"date": "March 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney, right, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, depart after a Republican caucus meeting on Capitol Hill on in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> In a gamble with monumental political stakes, Republicans set course for a climactic House vote on their health care overhaul after President Donald Trump claimed he was finished negotiating with GOP holdouts and determined to pursue the rest of his agenda, win or lose. \n House Speaker Paul Ryan set the showdown for Friday, following a nighttime Capitol meeting at which top White House officials told GOP lawmakers that Trump had decided the time for talk was over. \n \"We have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it's collapsing and it's failing families. And tomorrow we're proceeding,\" Ryan tersely told reporters after scheduling what loomed as the most momentous vote to date for Trump and for the Wisconsin Republican's own speakership. \n In an embarrassing and stinging setback hours earlier, leaders abruptly postponed the vote because a rebellion by conservatives and moderates would have doomed the measure. They'd hoped for a roll call Thursday, which marked the seventh anniversary of President Barack Obama's enactment of his landmark health care statute that Republicans have vowed ever since to annul. \n There was no evidence that leaders had nailed down sufficient support to prevail, nor that their decision to charge ahead was a feint and that they'd delay again if necessary. But they seemed to be calculating that at crunch time, enough dissidents would decide against sabotaging the bill, Trump's young presidency and the House GOP leadership's ability to set the agenda, with a single, crushing defeat. \n \"The president has said he wants the vote tomorrow,\" White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney told the lawmakers, according to Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., a Trump ally. \"If for any reason it goes down, we're just going to move forward with additional parts of his agenda. This is our moment in time.\" \n Even if they prevail, Republicans face an uphill climb in the Senate, where conservatives and moderates are also threatening to sink it. \n The GOP bill eliminates the Obama statute's unpopular fines on those who do not obtain coverage and the often generous subsidies for those who purchase insurance. \n Instead, consumers would face a 30 percent premium penalty if they let coverage lapse. Republican tax credits would be based on age, not income. The bill would also end Obama's Medicaid expansion and trim future federal financing for the federal-state program and let states impose work requirements on some of its 70 million beneficiaries. \n In a bid to coax support from conservatives, House leaders proposed a fresh amendment \u2014 to be voted on Friday \u2014 repealing Obama's requirement that insurers cover 10 specified services like maternity and mental health care. Conservatives have demanded the removal of those and other conditions the law imposes on insurers, arguing they drive premiums skyward. \n Many moderates are opposed because they say the GOP bill would leave many voters uninsured. Medical associations, consumer groups and hospitals are opposed or voicing misgivings, and some Republican governors say the bill cuts Medicaid too deeply and would leave many low-income people uncovered. \n Republicans can lose only 22 votes in the face of united Democratic opposition. A tally by The Associated Press found at least 32 \"no\" votes, but the figure was subject to fluctuation amid frantic GOP lobbying. \n Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., head of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, said he remained a \"no\" but didn't answer when asked whether the group still had enough votes to kill the legislation. He'd long said caucus opposition alone would defeat it without changes. \n One member of that group, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., responded indirectly when asked if his opposition had changed. \n \"Everybody asked us to take a moment and reflect. Well, we'll reflect,\" he said. \n Other foes said they'd not flipped. These included moderate Reps. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, Dan Donovan of New York and Leonard Lance of New Jersey, plus conservative Walter Jones of North Carolina, who had his own words of warning. \n \"He's there for three-and-a-half more years,\" Jones said of Trump. \"He better be careful. He's got a lot of issues coming.\" \n The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said changes Republican leaders had proposed before Thursday to win votes had cut the legislation's deficit reduction by more than half, to $150 billion over the next decade. But it would still result in 24 million more uninsured people in a decade. \n Obama's law increased coverage through subsidized private insurance for people who don't have access to workplace plans, and a state option to expand Medicaid for low-income residents. More than 20 million people gained coverage since the law was passed in 2010. \n Many who purchase individual health insurance and make too much to qualify for the law's tax credits have seen their premiums jump and their choices diminished. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "House sets risky health care vote after Trump demands it"}

Terry says he has determined that the president's business is in \"full compliance\" because profits from the hotel won't go directly to Trump while he's president. \n The 2013 lease for the Trump International Hotel expressly forbids any federal official from participating or benefiting from the project, a $200 million renovation of historic Old Post Office building a few blocks from the White House. \n Numerous ethics experts have questioned whether Trump violated the terms of his lease the moment he took the oath of office. \n Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University, called Thursday's ruling unpersuasive and damaging to the credibility of the GSA. \n \"It has never been easier for a foreign government, lobbyist or special-interest group to funnel money directly to the president of the United States and his family,\" said Schooner, who served in the Clinton administration and contributed to President Barack Obama's presidential campaign and other Democrats. \n Trump announced in January he was transferring control of his business empire to his adult sons, but he still maintained a direct tie to the company through a trust. Trump is the sole beneficiary of the trust and can revoke it at any time. \n Richard W. Painter, who was the lead White House ethics attorney for President George W. Bush, is among a group that days after Trump was inaugurated filed a lawsuit alleging he was violating the Constitution by allowing his businesses to accept payments from foreign governments. \n The lawsuit claims the \"emoluments clause\" prohibits Trump from receiving money from diplomats for stays at his hotels or foreign governments for leases of office space in his buildings. The lawsuit is pending in the Southern District of New York. \n \"The economic benefit from this lease goes to him whether or not the hotel LLC holds onto it and no matter how many trusts they form to hold the hotel or to hold the money,\" Painter said Thursday. \"The focus should be on the economic reality of the transaction and it is very clear what that is. He gets the profits from this lease.\" \n According to the GSA's letter, Trump restructured the governance of numerous corporate entities involved with the Washington hotel to remove himself as an officer. In a series of meetings, officials with the Trump Organization told the government that while Trump is president, no proceeds from the hotel business will be paid out to the holding company, DJT Holdings LLC. That company is owned by a trust benefiting Trump. \n The profits from the hotel will accrue in an account under the corporate entity that holds the lease, Trump Old Post Office LLC. More than three-quarters of that company is owned by DJT Holdings. The money could then be used to make capital improvements to the hotel. \n The letter does not address what might happen to any remaining profits from the hotel after Trump leaves office, or whether they could be transferred to Trump at that time. \n The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press about what happens after Trump is no longer president. \n Democrats quickly criticized the GSA's ruling, saying the agency had completely changed the position it held before Trump took office. \n \"This new interpretation renders this lease provision completely meaningless \u2014 any elected official can now defy the restriction by following this blueprint,\" said a joint statement issued by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Rep. Peter DeFazio, the ranking member on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. \n \"This decision allows profits to be reinvested back into the hotel so Donald Trump can reap the financial benefits when he leaves the White House,\" the Democrats said. \"This is exactly what the lease provision was supposed to prevent.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Feds: Trump D.C. hotel not in violation of government lease"}

But today is a Xavier day.\" \n Xavier (30-13) fought through a string of injuries and a late losing streak to reach the NCAA Tournament, then opened with a pair of upsets. The Musketeers passed their biggest test to date with confident performance against one of college basketball's storied programs. \n Bluiett scored 18 of his 25 points in the first half to help Xavier keep up with the athletic Wildcats. The Musketeers tracked Arizona after it tried to pull away in the second half, getting a late basket inside by Sean O'Mara while shutting down one of the nation's best offensive teams down the stretch. \n Next up is their first Elite Eight since 2008 and third overall, a showdown with No. 1 seed Gonzaga on Saturday. \n \"We're all tough guys. We stuck together,\" said Xavier's J.P Macura, who had 14 points. \"We're not really backing down from anyone.\" \n Arizona (32-5) appeared to be in control after Allonzo Trier scored 15 straight points to push the Wildcats' lead to six. Arizona stalled out on offense, though, failing to score over the final 2:52 as Xavier closed with a 9-0 run. \n Trier had a final shot, but missed a 3-pointer with 8 seconds left and the Wildcats were unable to track down Malcolm Bernard as he dribbled out the clock . \n Trier scored 15 of his 19 points in the second half and Dusan Ristic had 17 for Arizona. \n \"We weren't able to get good looks down the stretch and that's on me,\" Miller said. \n Xavier made an improbable run to its fourth Sweet 16 in eight years under Mack, overcoming a late six-game losing streak and the loss of point guard Edmond Sumner to a torn left ACL. \n The Musketeers were the lone double-digit seed left in the bracket after knocking off Maryland and Florida State in the first two rounds, setting up their second Sweet 16 game against Arizona in three years. \n Arizona won the previous meeting to reach the Elite Eight, putting Miller one up on Mack. \n Arizona led 37-35 at halftime of the rematch despite Bluiett's hot start, after turning 11 offensive rebounds into 13 second-chance points. \n Xavier made 6 of its 8 first shots to take the second-half lead and Arizona answered with a run of its own, building a 67-61 lead behind Trier's outburst. \n With super fan Bill Murray cheering them on \u2014 his son is an assistant coach \u2014 the Musketeers battled their way back with a 7-0 run, tying the game at 71-all with just under 2 minutes left, setting up the tense finish that left Arizona short. \n \"We didn't do a good enough job of defending them for the last four minutes of the game,\" Trier said. \"Tough way to go out, especially knowing we had a lot of momentum. Just not an easy end to swallow. \n BIG PICTURE \n Xavier was one of the hottest teams in the country despite its injuries and has a chance to reach the Final Four for the first time. \n Arizona struggled down the stretch in a close game, leaving Miller short in his latest bid to reach the Final Four. \n OFF THE MARKKANEN \n Lauri Markkanen was Arizona's leading scorer through the first two games of the tournament, but did not have much of an impact against Xavier. He finished with 9 points on 3-of-9 shooting, including 1 for 6 from 3-point range. He did grab eight rebounds, including five on the offensive glass. \n The Finnish forward is expected to leave for the NBA, but said after the game that he has yet to make a decision. \n MURRAY IN THE HOUSE \n Murray's son, Luke, is an assistant coach under Mack and has become a huge Xavier fan, attending games whenever he gets the chance. Sitting across from Xavier's bench, he was a vocal supporter for the Musketeers and was a big part of the celebration after Xavier clinched it. \n UP NEXT \n Xavier will face No. 1 seed Gonzaga Saturday in the Elite Eight. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Xavier knocks off Arizona 73-71 in West Region"}

On Wednesday a knife-wielding man went on a deadly rampage, first driving a car into pedestrians then stabbing a police officer to death before being fatally shot by police within Parliament's grounds in London. \n LONDON >> The four victims killed and at least 30 wounded in the attack in Westminster were a cosmopolitan snapshot of one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities. \n The dead included a British policeman stabbed to death, an American tourist celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary and a British school administrator adored in the Spanish town where she spent summer vacations with her family. A 75-year-old man also died Thursday of his wounds, London police said. \n The injured came from 12 countries. In addition to Britons, they included schoolchildren from France, a Romanian couple, a Portuguese man who had just finished his shift at a food store, and others who had traveled from as far away as China to explore London. \n Here's what's known about the victims: \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Police Officer Keith Palmer, 48, had been a member of Britain's parliamentary and diplomatic protection forces for 15 years and a soldier in the Royal Artillery before that. \n He was on duty protecting Parliament when he was stabbed to death on Wednesday. \n Honoring Palmer, Prime Minister Theresa May said he was \"a husband, a father \u2026 he was every inch a hero. \n \"His actions will never be forgotten.\" \n Conservative lawmaker James Cleverly tweeted that he was \"heartbroken,\" having known Palmer for 25 years. He said they served in the military together. \n \"A lovely man, a friend,\" Cleverly wrote. \n The Charlton Athletic Football Club said Palmer was a long-time fan and \"a familiar face\" at its London stadium, The Valley. As a tribute, the club placed one of its red-and-white scarves on his seat in the East Stand where he sat \"for many years.\" It said the scarf will stay there until the team's next game on April 4. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n Aysha Frade, a British citizen whose mother is Spanish, was one of two people killed on the bridge. \n In the northwestern Spanish town of Betanzos, where her mother was born and her two sisters run an English-language school, the mayor said: \"The whole town is shocked.\" \n Although Frade, 43, was born and lived in London, she spent weeks every summer in Betanzos visiting relatives, said Ramon Garcia Vazquez, mayor of the town of 13,000 in Spain's Galicia region. \n He told The Associated Press that her family \"was very well known in the village and loved by everybody here.\" \n He said her two elder sisters, Silvia and Michelle, flew to London early Thursday. The Betanzos town hall held a minute of silence for the family at noon Thursday and the mayor announced three days of mourning. \n Frade worked as an administrator at the DLD College \u2014 a school in Westminster a stone's throw from Parliament. \n \"She was highly regarded and loved by our students and by her colleagues.

She suffered a broken leg, a broken rib and cuts and bruises, said friend Mike Murphy. \n They were visiting her parents, who are serving as Mormon missionaries in the British capital, a church spokesman said. \n The couple ran a recording studio in the basement of their home just outside Salt Lake City. \n Murphy, owner of Murphy's Guitars, said Kurt Cochran regularly came to his shop to buy recording equipment for the studio where he tried to help young bands get started by charging them very little. \n \"He loved music,\" Murphy said. \"He was always around when there were music things going on.\" \n Pictures on Kurt Cochran's Facebook page show the couple enjoying their trip through Europe prior to the attack. In one post, he was smiling and holding a German beer under the caption, \"After a long day of sightseeing.\" \n In a tweet, U.S. President Donald Trump called Cochran \"a great American\" and said: \"My prayers and condolences are with his family and friends.\" \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n A fourth victim of Wednesday's attack on Westminster Bridge died Thursday, London police said, without releasing his name or nationality.

Director of Education John Malloy said students should not be placed into situations of potentially being turned away at the border. He said the board remains committed to fairness, equity, and inclusion. \n \"We just can't have trips going across the border and a student for no legitimate reason being denied entry to the U.S. We're obviously not going to leave that student and continue on,\" said Ryan Bird, a spokesman for the board. \n The board is among the largest in North America with over 246,000 students and 584 schools. It books dozens of trips to the U.S. every year. Toronto is one of the most multicultural cities in the world. \n Other Canadian school boards have canceled or are considering canceling trips to the U.S. The Girl Guides of Canada have canceled all U.S. travel. \n The Toronto District School board said that for now, it will move forward with the 25 U.S. trips involving about 900 students that have already been approved, but said the entire group will turn back if any students with appropriate documentation are turned away. \n Malloy said if Trump's executive order is fully implemented and students are prevented from crossing all trips will be canceled.

The lights are part of an artificial sun that will be used for research purposes. \n BERLIN >> Scientists in Germany flipped the switch Thursday on what's being described as \"the world's largest artificial sun,\" a device they hope will help shed light on new ways of making climate-friendly fuels. \n The giant honeycomb-like setup of 149 spotlights \u2014 officially known as \"Synlight\" \u2014 in Juelich, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) west of Cologne, uses xenon short-arc lamps normally found in cinemas to simulate natural sunlight that's often in short supply in Germany at this time of year. \n By focusing the entire array on a single 20-by-20 centimeter (8\u00d78 inch) spot, scientists from the German Aerospace Center, or DLR , will be able to produce the equivalent of 10,000 times the amount of solar radiation that would normally shine on the same surface. \n Creating such furnace-like conditions \u2014 with temperatures of up to 3,000 degrees Celsius (5,432 Fahrenheit) \u2014 is key to testing novel ways of making hydrogen, according to Bernhard Hoffschmidt, the director of DLR's Institute for Solar Research. \n Many consider hydrogen to be the fuel of the future because it produces no carbon emissions when burned, meaning it doesn't add to global warming. But while hydrogen is the most common element in the universe it is rare on Earth. One way to manufacture it is to split water into its two components \u2014 the other being oxygen \u2014 using electricity in a process called electrolysis. \n Researchers hope to bypass the electricity stage by tapping into the enormous amount of energy that reaches Earth in the form of light from the sun. \n Hoffschmidt said the dazzling display is designed to take experiments done in smaller labs to the next level, adding that once researchers have mastered hydrogen-making techniques with Synlight's 350-kilowatt array, the process could be scaled up ten-fold on the way to reaching a level fit for industry. Experts say this could take about a decade, if there is sufficient industry support. \n The goal is to eventually use actual sunlight rather than the artificial light produced at the Juelich experiment, which cost 3.5 million euros ($3.8 million) to build and requires as much electricity in four hours as a four-person household would use in a year. \n Hoffschmidt conceded that hydrogen isn't without its problems \u2014 for one thing it's incredibly volatile \u2014 but by combining it with carbon monoxide produced from renewable sources, scientists would, for example, be able to make eco-friendly kerosene for the aviation industry. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Let there be light: German scientists test 'artificial sun'"}

Last month, authorities ordered the evacuation of 188,000 people downstream after surging releases of water tore away big chunks of the main spillway and then the dam's second, emergency spillway. \n At the time, officials feared rapid deterioration of the emergency spillway could send large, uncontrolled torrents of water from the lake behind the dam through surrounding towns. \n The spillway is used to release water when the reservoir is nearing full capacity. \n During the releases, water was even seeping from seemingly undamaged stretches of the main spillway, the five-member team found. Only 12 inches thick, the concrete spillway is heavily patched, at some places by clay stuffed into holes below the concrete. \n \"This calls into question whether the portions of the slab that appear undamaged by the failure should be replaced,\" the consultants said, raising the prospect of a much bigger, long-term repair job. \n Repair contracts will have to be awarded by June. \n \"A very significant risk would be incurred if the Gated Spillway is not operational by November 1,\" the report said. \n The report does not specify what that means. \n However, officials with the state Department of Water Resources, which operates the dam, fear a huge rupture that opened in the main spillway could expand to cripple the flood gates that send out controlled releases of water and keep water from spilling over uncontrollably. \n In a statement, spokeswoman Maggie Macias said the agency's objective is to have a fully functional spillway before the start of the next storm season. \n \"We'll be working round-the-clock through spring, summer and fall to make that happen,\" she said. \n The independent consultants were selected by the state at the request of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \n Experts on the panel either declined comment Wednesday or could not immediately be reached. \n The experts called it \"absolutely critical\" that the dam's state operators not use the faulty emergency spillway again. \n The state should start work now redesigning a new emergency spillway for the 50-year-old dam, the consultants said. \n The experts inspected the main spillway before delivering the recommendations to the state. \n Fully repairing the spillway will likely take two years, the consultants said. California still has at least a month left in the current, unusually wet rainy season. A record snowfall in the Sierra Nevada will send more runoff into Lake Oroville as weather warms. \n State water officials plan to use the damaged main spillway sparingly to control the runoff, releasing water to try to ensure it doesn't spill out over the non-functional emergency spillway again. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "California races nature, clock to make key dam repairs"}

Apple didn't respond to a request for comment. \n NEW YORK >> New documents from WikiLeaks point to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple's iPhones and Mac computers using techniques that users couldn't disable by resetting their devices. \n Security experts say the exploits are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. They say that many of the tricks are older \u2014 the iPhone hack involves the 3G model from 2008, for instance. The techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. \n \"The most notable part of this latest WikiLeaks release is that it shows the CIA doing exactly what we pay them to \u2014 exploit specific targets with limited attacks to support our national interests,\" said Rich Mogull, CEO of the security research firm Securosis. \n Apple didn't respond to a request for comment. The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance \"targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans.\" The agency declined further comment Thursday. \n DOCUMENT DUMP \n The leaks Thursday come about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. \n The latest disclosures are much more focused and consist of just 12 documents, all involving Apple products. The documents describe techniques for rewriting devices' firmware in ways that would maintain a hacker's access even if a user resets a phone or computer to factory settings. Doing so wipes out all apps and the operating system and installs a clean version; it is an extreme measure sometimes used to deal with technical problems, but is also the sort of step that someone suspicious of surveillance might take when getting a brand new phone. \n A December 2008 document describes \"NightSkies,\" a tool apparently designed to target the iPhone 3G; the document claims it can retrieve files such as contact lists and call logs and execute other commands. WikiLeaks suggested in a press release that the \"CIA has been infecting the iPhone supply chain of its targets since at least 2008.\" \n However, the document describes only how to install the malware on a \"factory fresh\" version of the 3G \u2014 specifically, the iPhone 3G running the 2.1 version of Apple's operating system, both of which are now nine years old. \n CAVEATS GALORE \n But infecting all phones somewhere in the manufacturing process would be extremely difficult, said Mogull, especially given multiple layers of inspections conducted by Apple and its contractors. At most, he said, the CIA might have shipped a rogue phone individually to a target. \n And while it's possible that the CIA developed similar techniques for later iPhone models, Mogull said iPhones from the past few years have much greater security, including digital security certificates that cannot be overwritten. A flag would be raised during the setup process if certificates do not match. \n Johannes Ullrich, director of the Internet Storm Center at the SANS Institute, said NightSkies might not even be a current project given that the document was last updated in 2008, while the leaks appear to have come in 2016. \n Other documents released describe similar exploits for Mac computers. One hides in the firmware of Apple's Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter and requires someone to plug in that adapter to install the malware. Another targets a specific Mac model, the MacBook Air with the Leopard version of the Mac OS system \u2014 current at the time, but now seven generations old. \n Ullrich said the Mac exploits all appear old. He added that some of the Thunderbolt issues have been fixed to make the hack more difficult to pull off. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "WikiLeaks: CIA hacked Apple devices in ways users can't fix"}

That's a much stronger privacy-protection weapon than letting them use your data until you tell them to stop. As anyone who has ever tried to stop getting targeted ads on the internet knows, opting out is hard. \n Without those protections, consumer advocates fear that broadband providers will be able to do what they like with people's data. \n \"Advertisers and marketers are lining up to get access to all the information that's now available about us,\" said Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, which advocates for tougher internet privacy measures. \n ONLINE PRIVACY? WHAT ONLINE PRIVACY? \n Of course, Google and Facebook already track you. But proponents of the privacy measure argued that the company that sells you your internet connection can see even more about you: every website you visit, every app that sends or receives data, everyone you email and many that you message. Telecom companies argue that companies like Google know far more about users than they do. \n Consumer advocates also point out that it can be hard, in many areas of the country, to dump your cable or phone company for another one if you don't like its practices. Of course, it's also hard to stop using Google or Facebook. \n Undoing the Federal Communications Commission's regulation leaves people's online information in a murky area. Today, you can tell a broadband provider not to use your data. Experts say federal law still requires broadband providers to protect customer information \u2014 but it doesn't spell out how or what companies must do. \n That's what the now endangered rules from the Federal Communications Commission aimed to do. \"There's kind of a void,\" said Perkins Coie telecom attorney Marc Martin. \n BUIDLING DIGITAL-AD BUSINESSESES \n Cable companies, cellphone carriers and the advertising industry attacked the FCC rules as an overreach. Having to get permission from customers to use their browsing and app histories would likely make it more difficult to build stronger ad businesses, as telecomcompanies want to do. \n Internet companies like Google operate under laxer requirements and don't have to ask users' permission before tracking what sites they visit. Republicans and industry groups have blasted that discrepancy, saying it was unfair and confusing for consumers. \n REGULATORY TUSSLE \n If the just-passed measure also clears the House and is signed by President Donald Trump, no future FCC could pass the broadband privacy rules again without further change to U.S. law. \n The Trump-appointed chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a critic of the broadband privacy rules and has said he wants to roll them back , along with other Obama-era policies meant to protect consumers and promote competition. \n He and other Republicans want a different federal agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to police privacy for both broadband companies like AT&T and internet companies like Google. But broadband providers don't currently fall under FTC jurisdiction, and advocates say the FTC has historically been a weaker agency than the FCC. \n \"At the FCC, consumers are much more protected with strong privacy rules that give (internet service providers) clear rules as to what's fair and what's foul,\" Dallas Harris, a policy fellow with consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, said last month. \"The FCC is a stronger entity with a bit more teeth to hold ISPs' feet to the fire.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Senate votes to kill privacy rules guarding your online info"}

Gary Herbert announced today that he will sign legislation giving the predominantly Mormon state the strictest DUI threshold in the country, a change that restaurant groups and representatives of the ski and snowboard industry say will hurt tourism. \n SALT LAKE CITY >> Utah's governor signed legislation Thursday giving the predominantly Mormon state the strictest drunken driving threshold in the country, a change that restaurant groups and representatives of the ski and snowboard industry say will hurt tourism. \n Republican Gov. Gary Herbert said lowering the blood alcohol limit for most drivers to 0.05 percent from 0.08 percent will save lives. \n The change means a 150-pound man would be over the 0.05 limit after two beers, while a 120-pound woman could exceed it after a single drink, though that can be affected by a number of factors, including how much food a person has eaten, according to the American Beverage Institute, a national restaurant group. \n Opponents, including the group, had urged Herbert to veto the bill , saying it would punish responsible drinkers and burnish Utah's reputation as a Mormon-centric place unfriendly to those who drink alcohol. \n \"People are going to try to say this is a religious issue. And that is just absolutely false. This is a public safety issue,\" the governor, who is Mormon, said at a news conference. \n Restaurant groups said they don't support drunken driving but a 0.05 percent limit won't catch drivers who are actually impaired. Plus, the law is \"a total attack on the state's hospitality industry, customers and the tourism industry,\" American Beverage Institute executive director Sarah Longwell said. \n The group took out full-page ads Thursday in Salt Lake City's two daily newspapers and USA Today, featuring a fake mugshot under a large headline reading, \"Utah: Come for vacation, leave on probation.\" \n But proponents say the law will send a resounding message that people should not drink and drive \u2014 no matter how little somebody has consumed. The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety applauded the change, saying it's a \"sensible solution\" to deter drunken driving. \n If drivers are not impaired, they won't violate the law, said Rep. Norm Thurston, the bill's sponsor. The Republican says police won't measure someone's blood alcohol level until they have seen visible signs of impairment and the person fails a field sobriety test. \n He also said Utah became the first state to lower its blood alcohol limit to 0.08 percent in 1983, and since then tourism has flourished. \n Utah's Tourism Office said it's not concerned about the law discouraging visitors, noting that a number of foreign countries such as France, Australia and Italy have similar laws and don't have a problem attracting tourists. \n \"There's not many Mormons in Rome, and they're doing it there,\" Herbert quipped Thursday. \n In the United States, the blood alcohol limit for most drivers is 0.08 percent, but limits vary among states for commercial drivers or motorists with a conviction of driving under the influence. \n The National Transportation Safety Board has encouraged states to drop their blood alcohol levels to 0.05 percent or even lower, but it's met resistance from the hospitality industry. \n Lawmakers in Washington and Hawaii had considered lowering their limits to 0.05 percent this year but both measures appear dead. \n In Utah, the new law would take effect on Dec. 30, 2018, just before New Year's Eve. \n In the meantime, Herbert said he plans to call lawmakers into a special legislative session this summer to improve the law. He said he wants legislators to consider a tiered punishment system with less stringent penalties for those convicted of driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.05 to 0.07 percent. \n Utah has some of the lowest rates of fatal DUI accidents in the country, and though the population has boomed over the past decade, the DUI arrest rate has dropped. \n Mothers Against Drunk Driving has taken a neutral position on the measure. \n J.T. Griffin, a government affairs officer for the group, said in a statement that MADD is focusing on \"countermeasures that work, such as ignition interlock laws for all drunk driving offenders and sobriety checkpoints.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Utah getting toughest drunken driving limit in the U.S."}

But that bitterness may continue. The government did not order AT&T to start carrying SportsNet LA, it only sought to prevent such dealing in the future. \n The settlement also requires the companies to monitor certain communications their programming executives have with their rivals, and to implement antitrust training and compliance programs. \n \"When competitors email, text, or otherwise share confidential and strategically sensitive information with each other to avoid competing, consumers lose,\" Acting Assistant Attorney General Brent Snyder of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division said in a statement. \n The government said DirecTV was the ringleader because it was the only company that unlawfully talked to multiple rivals, and said that DirecTV executives acknowledged that the satellite-TV company would be in a stronger position if competing TV providers also did not carry the Dodgers channel. \n David McAtee, the general counsel for AT&T, which bought DirecTV in July 2015, said in November that cable and satellite TV providers chose not to carry the channel because the companies did not want to pass inflated prices on to customers for a channel devoted only to the Dodgers. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Justice Department settles suit over L.A.

A magistrate judge presiding over a hearing today says she hopes to streamline the legal process to speed the lawsuits along. \n NEW YORK >> For years, family members of those killed on Sept. 11 and insurance companies tried unsuccessfully through the courts to hold Saudi Arabia or businesses and organizations there responsible for the terrorist attacks. Now that Congress has cleared the way, they're making a fresh effort. \n In the next year, the Manhattan federal courts will make rulings signaling to thousands of family members of those killed and injured first responders whether passage of the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act was largely a symbolic exercise or a catalyst to getting them to trial. \n Timothy Litzenburg, a Richmond, Virginia, lawyer, said his firm raced to court hours after Congress overrode former President Barack Obama's veto in late September, hoping to get an early start on winning damages for litigants. \n \"We thought maybe we could do the first trial,\" he said. But now that the lawsuits have been consolidated before a New York federal court, Litzenburg predicts it could be a decade before there is a resolution for over a dozen lawsuits filed against the kingdom. \n U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn tried to put the litigation on a faster track Thursday, telling dozens of lawyers at a Manhattan conference that she believes some of the lawsuits can be combined because they make identical or similar claims. She noted the latest lawsuit had been filed just hours earlier. \n James Kreindler, a plaintiffs' lawyer in one new lawsuit, told her he expects the lawsuits may be combined into two legal actions, perhaps within a month. \n Michael Kellogg, a lawyer for Saudi Arabia, said at Thursday's hearing that lawyers for plaintiffs were unfairly using mostly the same plaintiffs in 9/11 cases brought 14 years ago to make new claims against Saudi Arabia. \n \"They've added a number of different allegations, which will complicate the process,\" he said. \n Saudi Arabia, an important U.S. ally in the Middle East, had lobbied against the new law. \n President Donald Trump had called Obama's veto \"shameful.\" Obama said he rejected it because it could open up the U.S. government to lawsuits around the world claiming that the United States has supported terrorism. \n Sovereign immunity usually protects governments from lawsuits, but the bill creates an exception that lets litigants hold foreign governments responsible if they support a terrorist attack that kills U.S. citizens on American soil. \n Previous efforts to hold Saudi Arabia, its officials, and banks and charitable organizations responsible for the attacks have failed in the courts. Not all of the cases have been tossed out solely for sovereign immunity reasons. \n In 2008, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that four Saudi princes cannot be held liable in the Sept. 11 attacks even if they were aware that charitable donations to Muslim groups would be funneled to al-Qaida. \n The court said the plaintiffs would need to prove the princes engaged in intentional actions aimed at U.S. residents. \n A lower court judge had earlier cited the Sept. 11 commission, saying it found no evidence Saudi Arabia \u2014 the birthplace of Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 hijackers \u2014 funded or supported the Sept. 11 terrorists. \n Saudi lawyers have not responded to requests to comment on the new lawsuits.

The problem is the listless pace of this new Netflix series. \n But such languor isn't the only failing of this latest offering from the Marvel factory, judging from critical pans and fan unrest since the 13-episode season was unveiled last week. \n Any Marvel project (and this is Netflix's fourth, following \"Daredevil,\" \"Jessica Jones\" and \"Luke Cage\") is breathlessly awaited by fans. \"Iron Fist\" was no different. But even before anybody saw it, it was already drawing accusations of \"whitewashing.\" \n The series centers on Danny Rand, the scion of a corporate titan who returns to New York 15 years after he and his parents died in a plane crash over the Himalayas. \n Well, actually, Danny didn't die. He was rescued by a mysterious order of monks. And in this intervening period, he trained in martial arts and gained the mystical power of the Iron Fist. Now he returns to New York to reclaim the corporate empire that was hijacked by brother-and-sister baddies (and his childhood friends) Ward and Joy Meachum. He is also, of course, on a quest to \"get answers.\" \n \"Iron Fist\" stars Finn Jones, who is best known for playing Loras Tyrell on \"Game of Thrones.\" But casting him as Danny was a missed opportunity, according to disgruntled fans who argue that an Asian-American actor should have been chosen. \n Maybe, maybe not. But that would seem to be the least of the ills plaguing \"Iron Fist.\" For instance, the Polygon website wielded iron fists of its own in declaring that the series' \"problems with delivering exposition, crafting consistent characters, and even basic dialogue writing run right alongside \u2026 problems with its portrayal of Asian cultures and Asian-Americans.\" \n \"Not one element of this plodding piece works,\" railed Variety, adding that the story line \"is about as exciting as a slice of Velveeta cheese left out in the sun too long.\" \n The New York Times complained about \"the dawdling featureless\" of the early episodes. And how many viewers could be expected to stick with the series beyond those first installments? Calling it \"the first complete misfire of Netflix's Marvel shows,\" the Uproxx website posed the question: \"Why would anyone but the most devout, masochistic Marvel completist want to watch?\" \n The Twitterverse has been no kinder, with one typical post calling it \"a great show if you're looking to sit back, relax and stare at your phone as it plays in the background.\" Another tweet likened the series' fight scenes to \"an awkward junior high school dance.\" \n Even a forgiving Marvel neophyte who samples \"Iron Fist\" is likely to be put off. The conspicuous lack of action and of visual effects, at least in its early episodes, serves as a stark reminder of how lavish production values, unrelenting action and eye-popping visual effects are taken for granted by today's audience \u2014 and jarring when they're absent. \n Granted, the epic failure of \"Iron Fist,\" now installed for eternity on the Netflix site, will register as just a blip on the Netflix/Marvel landscape. And since Netflix never discloses audience figures, no one will ever know how many viewers choose to avoid or abandon the series who might have watched a better \"Iron Fist\" faithfully. \n But every potential viewer is advised to note an exchange between two characters in an early episode: \n \"We need to know more before we can decide how we should proceed.\" \n \"So we just wait?\" \n \"Yeah. And watch.\" \n Such patience by \"Iron Fist\" viewers is doomed to go unrewarded. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Netflix/Marvel's 'Iron Fist' epic fail, say viewers, critics"}

{"date": "March 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Orlando's top tourist destinations, Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, SeaWorld and several resorts are in legal battles about how much they're worth with the local property appraiser and tax collector. \n ORLANDO, Fla. >> It takes a lot of land to accommodate Cinderella's castle, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter and Epcot's 11-country World Showcase \u2014 and a hefty purse to pay the property taxes on it. \n To cut tax bills in the tens of millions of dollars, the specialists at Orlando's famous theme parks have employed methods from the creative \u2014 placing cows on undeveloped land and claiming an agricultural exemption \u2014 to the traditional \u2014 negotiating or appealing to a county board. \n Over the past couple of years, however, such tactics aren't quite doing the job: Property assessments and taxes have jumped \u2014 and so has the number of lawsuits the theme parks and other businesses have filed against Orange County's property appraiser. That's Rick Singh, who was re-elected to a second four-year term last fall despite the thousands of dollars in donations park officials gave his opponent. \n In lawsuits filed last year, the theme parks said Singh's office had failed to use proper appraisal methodology. Walt Disney Parks and Resorts issued a statement describing increased assessments on some of its properties for 2015 as \"unreasonable and unjustified.\" \n Beyond such terse statements, officials from Disney, the development arm of Universal Orlando and SeaWorld of Florida are saying very little about an issue they hope to resolve in court. \n But they have spoken loudly with their wallets. Groups affiliated with all three companies gave $19,000 to Singh's Republican opponent. Singh, a Democrat, got only $5,000 from the groups. \n The backlash isn't surprising, said Doug Head, chairman of the watchdog group Orange County Watch. Head said the appraiser's position has traditionally been a cushy post for local politicos waiting to retire, but Singh is one of the first to have substantial professional training. \n \"He uses professional expertise, and he clearly figured out there is a lot more value than is properly being reflected,\" Head said. \"He did what he needed to do, and people accustomed to the way business was done weren't happy.\" \n Singh said his methods for assessing properties are no different than those of his predecessors \u2014 except when looking at resorts and hotels. Then, he considers their income statements and the local \"bed tax\" paid by hotel customers, which he said his predecessor didn't use. Income isn't considered when assessing theme parks. \n \"It's a matter of being fair and equitable,\" Singh said. \"If the single mother who is working two jobs has to be held accountable to pay her fair share, so should everybody else.\" \n The importance of the three theme parks to Orange County, which includes Orlando, can't be overstated: The properties owned by Disney, Universal and SeaWorld are valued collectively at about $10.7 billion. Properties owned by the largest resort and timeshare companies are worth another $6.3 billion. \n The three theme park companies pay 7 percent of the county's property taxes \u2014 more than $135 million last year. That revenue helps to mitigate the impact of hosting 66 million visitors in 86,000 hotel rooms and 15,500 timeshare units every year, and to finance law enforcement, schools, parks and public health programs. Disney also pays property taxes to a private government established by the Florida Legislature that provides the Disney parks and resorts with services including utilities, roadways and firefighters. \n Property values for the theme parks, resorts and other large commercial properties are set by a team of almost two dozen of the county's seasoned appraisers in what Singh calls \"the most complex tax roll in the world\" due to the constant growth. \n Singh said the appraisers use a \"cost approach\" when evaluating theme parks. Tax bills go up not just from rising property values but also from new construction, which is constant at the parks. \n \"What does it cost to improve the land? What does it cost to build this? \u2026 What is the labor cost? Factor in all that and then it depreciates, and that's your cost approach,\" he said. \n But the results are meeting a wall of resistance. Last year, Disney, Universal and SeaWorld filed a dozen lawsuits against Singh's office, the tax collector and the state Department of Revenue. Several other Orlando resorts also have sued. \n The companies pay taxes only on their properties' \"assessed\" values; the \"market\" values reflect what the properties could be sold for. \n SeaWorld is fighting the market and assessed values of its flagship SeaWorld Adventure Park, its Aquatica water park and Discovery Cove, an animal-encounter park. In a separate lawsuit the property appraiser's office filed against SeaWorld in 2015, Singh's office listed a market value of $192.5 million; SeaWorld listed it at $143.4 million. \n Universal is disputing the market value of its 20,000-vehicle parking garage, which has nearly doubled in two years, from $148.6 million in 2014, to $297 million in 2016. The garage's assessed value only went up 10 percent a year during that time, however, from $145 million to $175 million. \n Disney is disputing the assessments of properties including four theme parks, 11 resorts and two water parks. An Associated Press tally of all the properties listed in the lawsuit shows that the appraiser gave them a total market value of more than $5 billion in 2015. \n Disney, whose total properties in Orange County have a market value of $8.2 billion, is not saying publicly what it thinks the value should be. But the company's tax bill from Singh's office jumped from $84.5 million in 2014 to $97.2 million in 2015 to $102.6 million in 2016, an average increase of about 10 percent a year. Those numbers exclude what Disney pays its private government in property taxes. \n \"Similar to other property owners in Orange County, we have no choice but to take action to dispute these errors by the property appraiser,\" Disney's statement said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mickey vs. the tax man: Disney, Universal fight tax bills"}

This has been a struggle in part because many rentals, particularly on Oahu, are being operated illegally without permits. \n Hawaii legislative committees have passed new versions of bills addressing vacation rentals. \n Lawmakers have been keen to devise ways to make sure vacation rental operators are paying transient accommodation taxes just like hotels. This has been a struggle in part because many rentals, particularly on Oahu, are being operated illegally without permits. \n State Senate committees on tourism and public safety late Wednesday passed legislation giving hosting platforms like Airbnb the option to pay hotel taxes on behalf of short-term rental operators. \n The bill says platforms that do so would have to ensure operators comply with state and county land use laws. It says platforms would have to ensure operators provide written verification of their compliance. The bill, which amended House legislation, next goes to the Senate Ways and Means Committee. \n \"We want to make sure that this bill doesn't hurt the good actors, but also gives us an opportunity to go after the bad actors out there,\" said Sen. Glenn Wakai, the Senate tourism committee chairman. \n Wakai, who represents Kalihi and other Oahu neighborhoods, said the reporting requirements would help lawmakers understand how many short-term rental units are being offered, what their economic impact is and what the state's tax opportunities are. \n The legislation, he said, offers Honolulu and other counties \"a carrot\" to get their land use regulations in order by offering them a percentage of new taxes the state is able to get from short-term rentals. \n Matt Middlebrook, Airbnb public policy manager, said in a statement that his company is committed to working with lawmakers to more effectively capture an estimated $100 million in taxes generated by the short-term rental industry each year. But he said the Senate bill conflicts with federal law. \n David Louie, an attorney for the Internet Association, a national group representing online companies like Facebook and Expedia, said under federal law websites can't be held liable for the content of other people's postings. They also can't be forced to screen or verify online postings by third parties, he said. \n The House tourism committee on Tuesday passed legislation that also would also allow platforms to pay taxes on behalf of short-term rental operators. But the House bill doesn't require platforms to verify operator compliance with land use laws. This bill next goes to the House finance committee. \n This legislation amended a Senate bill that called for a working group to develop a way to collect data on how vacation rentals affect Hawaii's tax revenue, housing supply and brand as a visitor destination. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hawaii committees pass new versions of vacation rental bills"}

He composed a series of pieces based on the letters of eight Iraqis sharing personal tales during wartime. \n DEARBORN, Mich. >> Rahim AlHaj cried every time he read the letters of eight Iraqis sharing personal, harrowing tales of love, loss and hope in wartime since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Rather than retreat, the Iraqi-American composer and musician immersed himself in the stories and emerged with a collection of songs to illustrate them. \n AlHaj is touring the United States in support of the resulting album, \"Letters from Iraq,\" which is set to be officially released next month on the Smithsonian Folkways label. \n \"I felt obligated to make these stories,\" he told The Associated Press during a phone interview from the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, where he will perform Friday at the Arab American National Museum. \"It has to be heard \u2014 it has to be seen. \u2026 This is what the Iraqi people went through during that time period.\" \n For AlHaj, who plays a stringed instrument with ancient Iraqi roots called the oud, the tears still fall when he recounts the stories behind the music. One is about a teenage boy who was returning home when a car bomb exploded and leveled his home, sending his homing pigeons skyward with nowhere to land and destroying the alibi that allowed him to see his girlfriend while he cared for his birds and she hung laundry. Another is of a man who returns to Baghdad after living in exile \u2014 and finding a place that no longer feels like home. \n Then, there is the letter written by AlHaj's nephew, Fuad, who inspired and encouraged the musical project. Then a teenager, Fuad was getting a haircut at a barbershop when a bomb went off nearby and militants opened fire. Fuad, who could not run because his legs never fully developed, detailed the horror and carnage around him. He ends by writing, paradoxically, what a beautiful day it had been. \n AlHaj said Fuad led him to his friend Riyadh, the teen with the pigeons. From there, the composer collected more correspondences while visiting his homeland, and realized he had to share these stories that might otherwise never be heard by the larger world. \n AlHaj said he initially envisioned reading the letters in lectures, but felt they deserved a broader audience and a more lasting, artistic treatment. He began writing instrumental music for the oud, violin, viola, cello, bass and percussion that \"translates\" the tales, he said. \n \"It's really challenging because it's abstract \u2014 it's not words \u2014 but people understand it,\" AlHaj said. He added that the songs brought many people to tears at a recent Seattle performance, including a woman who approached him afterward. \n \"She took her shawl and put it around my neck,\" he said. \"She gave me a hug and said, 'Thank you for healing me.'\" \n AlHaj graduated from Baghdad's prestigious and competitive Conservatory of Music, but was later imprisoned after refusing to join Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath party and supporting his regime. He fled in 1991 and eventually made his way to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he now lives, and became a U.S. citizen in 2008. \n He has since performed across the globe, released nine albums and received two Grammy nominations along with other awards and fellowships. Still, he said, it was important for his story and accomplishments to take a backseat with \"Letters from Iraq.\" \n \"Musicians have ridiculous egos,\" he said, laughing. \"I put my ego aside to just breathe and cry with these letters. \u2026 I didn't want to show my virtuosity \u2014 I didn't give a damn about that. It's about supporting the voices of those letters.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Iraqi-American composer musically translates wartime letters"}

{"date": "March 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Supreme Court Justice nominee Neil Gorsuch listens as he is asked a question by Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, March 22, 2017, during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n WASHINGTON >> Senate Democrats vowed today to impede Judge Neil Gorsuch's path to the Supreme Court, setting up a political showdown with implications for future openings on the high court. \n Still irate that Republicans blocked President Barack Obama's nominee, Democrats consider Gorsuch a threat to a wide range of civil rights and think he was too evasive during 20 hours of questioning. Whatever the objections, Republicans who control the Senate are expected to ensure that President Donald Trump's pick reaches the bench, perhaps before the middle of April. \n The Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, was among five senators to declare their opposition to Gorsuch, even before the Judiciary Committee hearing on the nomination had ended. \n Schumer said he would lead a filibuster against Gorsuch, criticizing him as a judge who \"almost instinctively favors the powerful over the weak.\" Schumer said the 49-year-old Coloradan would not serve as a check on Trump or be a mainstream justice. \n \"I have concluded that I cannot support Neil Gorsuch's nomination,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"My vote will be no and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\" \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer called on Schumer to call off the filibuster, saying \"it represents the type of partisanship that Americans have grown tired of.\" \n A Supreme Court seat has been open for more than 13 months, since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Like Scalia, Gorsuch has a mainly conservative record in more than 10 years as a federal appellate judge. \n Shortly before Schumer's announcement, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who faces re-election next year in a state Trump won, also announced his opposition. Casey said he had \"serious concerns about Judge Gorsuch's rigid and restrictive judicial philosophy, manifest in a number of opinions he has written on the 10th Circuit.\" \n Democratic Sens. Tom Carper of Delaware and Ron Wyden of Oregon, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, also said they would vote against Trump's nominee, among at least 11 senators who say they will oppose Gorsuch in the face of pressure from liberals to resist all things Trump, including his nominees. \n No Democrat has yet pledged to support Gorsuch, but Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia has said he is open to voting for him. Manchin spoke Wednesday after watching the nominee emerge unscathed from testimony to the Judiciary Committee. \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Democratic threats of delay, in the face of what he called Gorsuch's outstanding performance, stem from their base's refusal \"to accept the outcome of the election.\" \n In an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell seemed ready to change Senate rules, if necessary, to confirm Gorsuch with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes now required to move forward. Such a change also would apply to future Supreme Court nominees and would be especially important in the event that Trump gets to fill another opening and replace a liberal justice or Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court's so-called swing vote. In 2013, Democrats changed the rules to prohibit delaying tactics for all nominees other than for the high court. \n The Judiciary panel is expected to vote in the next two weeks to recommend Gorsuch favorably to the full Senate. \n Hearings for a Supreme Court nominee usually dominate Congress, but that's not been the case over the four days of hearings. The Republican push to dismantle Obama's Affordable Care Act and the controversy surrounding the investigation into contact between Trump associates and Russia overshadowed the hearings. \n Today, lawyers, advocacy groups and former colleagues got their say on Gorsuch during the final session to examine his qualifications. The speakers included the father of an autistic boy whom Gorsuch ruled against. The Supreme Court, ruling in a separate case Wednesday, unanimously overturned the reasoning Gorsuch employed in his 2008 opinion. \n Gorsuch received the American Bar Association's highest rating after what ABA official Nancy Scott Degan called a \"deep and broad\" investigation. But Degan acknowledged that her team did not review materials released by the Justice Department covering Gorsuch's involvement with Bush administration controversies involving the interrogation and treatment of terrorism detainees, broad assertions of executive power and warrantless eavesdropping on people within the United States. \n Some senators and civil rights advocates said emails and memos that were released raise serious questions that Gorsuch did not adequately address. Jameel Jaffer, former deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the Senate should not confirm Gorsuch without getting answers. \"This should not be a partisan issue,\" Jaffer said. \n Among judges who have worked with him, U.S. District Judge John Kane praised Gorsuch's independence and cordiality. \"Judge Gorsuch is not a monk, but neither is he a missionary or an ideologue,\" said Kane, an appointee of President Jimmy Carter. \n Democrats also took another opportunity to voice their displeasure at how Republicans kept Judge Merrick Garland, Obama's choice for the same seat, off the court. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California noted that Garland also received the bar association's top rating, yet did not even get a committee hearing. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Democrats threaten delay on Supreme Court nominee"}

Hughes Corp. had envisioned developing a 500-unit residential project on this site in 2020, but said Thursday that detailed timing for this project is not yet determined. \n The developer has a master plan to develop what it envisions will be 16 towers with up to 4,300 residences and 1 million square feet of retail space on 60 acres formerly known as Ward Centers. To date, one tower called Waiea has been completed and three more \u2014 Anaha, Ae'o and Ke Kilohana \u2014 are under construction. Three other towers \u2014 'A'ali'i and two that share the name Gateway \u2014 have been permitted but have yet to break ground. The Gateway towers will replace much of Ward Warehouse, which Hughes Corp. said last month would close in August and displace roughly 60 tenants. \n HCDA calculated that all the permitted or completed projects at Ward Village represent 44 percent of building density allowed under the developer's master plan. \n ", "author": "By Andrew Gomes agomes@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Howard Hughes to demolish Marukai building"}

{"date": "March 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney, right, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, depart after a Republican caucus meeting on Capitol Hill, Thursday, March 23, 2017, in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Abandoning negotiations, President Donald Trump today demanded a make-or-break vote on health care legislation in the House, threatening to leave \"Obamacare\" in place and move on to other issues if Friday's vote fails. \n The risky move, part gamble and part threat, was presented to GOP lawmakers behind closed doors tonight after a long and intense day that saw a planned vote on the health care bill scrapped as the legislation remained short of votes amid cascading negotiations among conservative lawmakers, moderates and others. \n At the end of it the president had had enough and was ready to vote and move on, whatever the result, Trump's budget director Mick Mulvaney told lawmakers. \n \"'Negotiations are over, we'd like to vote tomorrow and let's get this done for the American people.' That was it,\" Rep. Duncan Hunter of California said as he left the meeting, summarizing Mulvaney's message to lawmakers. \n And if the vote fails, Obamacare \"stays for now,\" Hunter said. \n \"Let's vote,\" White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said as he left the meeting. \n The outcome of Friday's vote was uncertain. Both conservative and moderate lawmakers claimed the bill lacked votes after a long day of talks. \n The Republican legislation would halt Obama's tax penalties against people who don't buy coverage and cut the federal-state Medicaid program for low earners, which the Obama statute had expanded. It would provide tax credits to help people pay medical bills, though generally skimpier than Obama's statute provides. It also would allow insurers to charge older Americans more and repeal tax boosts the law imposed on high-income people and health industry companies. \n The measure would also block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, another stumbling block for GOP moderates. \n The drama unfolded seven years to the day after Obama signed his landmark law, an anniversary GOP leaders meant to celebrate with a vote to undo the divisive legislation. \"Obamacare\" gave birth to the tea party movement and helped Republicans win and keep control of Congress and then take the White House. \n Instead, forced to delay the vote, the anniversary turned into bitter irony for the GOP. As the House recessed and lawmakers negotiated, C-SPAN filled up the time playing footage of Obama signing the Affordable Care Act. \n \"In the final analysis, this bill falls short,\" GOP Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state said in a statement as she became the latest rank-and-file Republican, normally loyal to leadership, to declare her opposition. \"The difficulties this bill would create for millions of children were left unaddressed,\" she said, citing the unraveling of Medicaid. \n In a danger sign for Republicans, a Quinnipiac University poll found that people disapprove of the GOP legislation by 56 percent to 17 percent, with 26 percent undecided. Trump's handling of health care was viewed unfavorably by 6 in 10. \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who as speaker was Obama's crucial lieutenant in passing the Democratic bill in the first place, couldn't resist a dig at the GOP disarray. \n \"You may be a great negotiator,\" she said of Trump. \"Rookie's error for bringing this up on a day when clearly you're not ready.\" \n Obama declared in a statement that \"America is stronger\" because of the current law and said Democrats must make sure \"any changes will make our health care system better, not worse for hardworking Americans.\" Trump tweeted to supporters, \"Go with our plan! Call your Rep & let them know.\" \n Congressional leaders have increasingly put the onus on the president to close the deal, seemingly seeking to ensure that he takes ownership of the legislation \u2014 and with it, ownership of defeat if that is the outcome. \n Yet, unlike Obama and Pelosi when they passed Obamacare, the Republicans had failed to build an outside constituency or coalition to support their bill. Instead, medical professionals, doctors and hospitals \u2014 major employers in some districts \u2014 as well as the AARP and other influential consumer groups were nearly unanimously opposed. So were outside conservative groups who argued the bill didn't go far enough. The Chamber of Commerce was in favor. \n Moderates were given pause by projections of 24 million Americans losing coverage in a decade and higher out-of-pocket costs for many low-income and older people, as predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In an updated analysis, the CBO said late changes to the bill meant to win over reluctant lawmakers would cut beneficial deficit reduction in half, while failing to cover more people. \n And, House members were mindful that the bill, even if passed by the House, faces a tough climb in the Senate. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "White House, in gamble, demands make-or-break health vote"}

{"date": "March 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Energy Secretary Rick Perry speaks during a swearing in ceremony in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House complex in Washington. \n AUSTIN, Texas >> Energy Secretary Rick Perry, whose agency oversees the nation's nuclear arsenal, is inserting himself into an unusually small political dispute: an election for student body president at Texas A&M. \n In an op-ed submitted to the Houston Chronicle, the former Texas governor suggested that his alma mater's first openly gay president may have stolen the outcome. Perry wrote that the campus election \"at best made a mockery of due process and transparency\" and at worst \"allowed an election to be stolen outright.\" \n \"It is difficult to escape the perception that this quest for 'diversity' is the real reason the election outcome was overturned,\" he wrote. \"Does the principle of 'diversity' override and supersede all other values of our Aggie Honor Code?\" \n Those who know Perry best said they're not surprised that he would take the unusual step of weighing in on a parochial issue at his alma mater \u2014 even though he's now a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet. \n \"There are three institutions that are most important to Rick Perry, his wife and family, the U.S. military and Texas A&M. It depended on the day, or the weekend, which one had the top priority,\" said Ray Sullivan, a former Perry chief of staff and veteran of the ex-governor's unsuccessful presidential runs in 2012 and 2016. \n The campus election ended with junior economics major Bobby Brooks winning about 4,200 votes. Another candidate, Robert McIntosh, son of Dallas-based GOP fundraiser Alison McIntosh, got nearly 5,000 but was disqualified amid complaints he intimidated voters and failed to provide receipts for glow sticks used in an online campaign video. \n McIntosh appealed to a student court, which dismissed charges of voter fraud but upheld those of incomplete financial disclosure, awarding the election to Brooks this week. \n Brooks takes office next month but has declined to comment since the publication of Perry's op-ed. He posted on Facebook after being declared election winner, though: \"To those of you who spoke poorly about me based upon my sexual orientation or personal religion (and talk gets around, my friends), I forgive you. I really do.\" \n Perry is following in the footsteps of his new boss, though on a far smaller scale. Trump spent months claiming without any evidence, that his presidential election against Democrat Hillary Clinton would be rigged against him \u2014 until he won it. \n A Texas A&M spokeswoman did not return messages seeking comment Thursday. Energy Department Spokesman Bob Haus said Perry \"did this is in his personal capacity and DOE has no official comment on this op-ed.\" \n A 1972 A&M graduate with a degree in animal sciences, Perry was twice elected yell leader, a coveted role akin to a male cheerleader. He was Texas' longest-serving governor from 2000 until 2015, then moved to a home he built in rural Round Top, Texas, near his alma mater's campus in College Station. \n Perry took an active role in A&M policy as governor, pushing the school to implement a plan devised by a conservative Texas think tank seeking greater scrutiny on faculty productivity that university officials charged put ideology ahead of academics. He also helped place close allies in key school positions \u2014 including one who brandished a pocket knife as the university discussed his firing. Current A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp was once Perry's roommate. \n Perry also has previously been outspoken about what he branded political correctness run wild when it came to another institution near and dear to his heart, the Boy Scouts of America. An Eagle Scout, Perry wrote the 2008 book \"On My Honor: Why the American Values of the Boy Scouts Are Worth Fighting For.\" In it, he questioned whether sexual preference is determined at birth or is a matter of personal choice, while noting he doesn't believe in \"condemning homosexuals that I know personally.\" \n As recently as four years ago, Perry said he hoped the organization wouldn't change its then-longstanding policy prohibiting gay membership, saying the Scouts continue \"to be under attack from the forces of secularism\" and that \"to have popular culture impact 100 years of their standards is inappropriate.\" \n The organization has since reversed course, allowing openly gay members and lifting a ban on openly gay Scout leaders. In January, it announced it would allow transgender boys to join. Perry remained silent about the latest change, though he was at the time facing Senate confirmation to become Trump's energy secretary. \n Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of the gay rights group GLAAD, responded to Perry's accusations via Twitter saying, \"Some advice for SecretaryPerry: Kids like Bobby Brooks are the future, and should be encouraged, not harassed.\" \n But Sullivan said Perry's op-ed may actually raise the energy secretary's standing with Trump given the president's criticism of too much political correctness on university campuses. \n \"I'm sure it will pique interest in Washington,\" Sullivan said. \"But given the curious circumstances of the election and general concern about the state of free speech and political correctness on American campuses, it is not outside the bounds of normal political and public policy discussion.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Perry blasts election of 1st gay Texas A&M student president"}

{"date": "March 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Workers prepared to lift the sunken Sewol ferry, center, in waters off Jindo, South Korea today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Workers tried to raise the sunken Sewol ferry between two barges during the salvage operation in waters off Jindo, South Korea today. The 6,800-ton South Korean ferry emerged from the water today, nearly three years after it capsized and sank under violent seas off the country's southwestern coast. \n SEOUL >> A 6,800-ton South Korean ferry was hoisted to the surface today nearly three years after it capsized and sank in violent seas off the country's southwestern coast, an emotional moment for the country as it searches for closure to one of its deadliest disasters. \n But just when it seemed that the salvaging operation was going smoothly, workers discovered that a vehicle ramp was unlocked and dangling from the ship's left side. That forced a delay that could jeopardize the delicate operation to transport the corroded ship back to land. \n More than 300 people \u2014 most of whom were students on a high school trip \u2014 died when the Sewol sank on April 16, 2014, touching off an outpouring of national grief and soul-searching about long-ignored public safety and regulatory failures. Public outrage over what was seen as a botched rescue job by the government contributed to the recent ouster of Park Geun-hye as president. \n Salvage crews had planned to raise the Sewol until its upper side is about 42 feet above the water's surface by this evening so it could be loaded onto a semi-submersible, heavy-lift vessel that would carry it to a mainland port. \n Lee Cheoljo, an official from the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries, said divers were trying to cut off the ramp with welding equipment because it wasn't possible to fit the ferry into the transport vessel with the ramp hanging down. He said it was vital for the divers to finish the job by Friday morning so the crew will have enough time to load the ferry by midnight Friday. \n The waters where the ferry sank are notorious for dangerous currents. The sea is relatively calm now, but currents are forecast to strengthen on Saturday. \n Lee said the Sewol, which had been lying on its left side in about 145 feet of water, was 33 feet above the surface when the lifting process was halted tonight. \n He said workers may face a decision on whether to continue the salvaging operation if the ferry isn't loaded on the vessel by Friday. \n \"All we can do now is to concentrate all the personnel and equipment we have so that the ramp is cut off by the morning of March 24,\" Lee said. \n Workers on two barges began the salvaging operation Wednesday night, rolling up 66 cables connected to a frame of metal beams divers spent months placing beneath the ferry. \n The bodies of 295 passengers were recovered after the sinking, but nine are still missing. Relatives, some of whom were watching from two fishing boats just outside the operation area, hope those remains will be found inside the ferry. Some cried as they took turns watching the emerging wreckage with telescopes. \n \"I shouted in joy when we heard that the ship surfaced at dawn. I thought we finally can find the missing nine,\" Lee Geum-hee, the mother of a missing school girl, told a television crew. \n \"But when I actually saw the ship coming up, I was devastated. All this time my poor child was in that cold, dirty place. It was heart wrenching.\" \n If the Sewol is successfully loaded onto the transport vessel, it would take days to empty the ferry of water and fuel, and another two weeks for it to reach a port about 55 miles away in the city of Mokpo. \n Workers will then begin clearing mud and debris and search for the remains of the missing victims. An investigation committee will also search for clues that could further explain the cause of the sinking, which has been blamed on overloaded cargo, improper storage and other negligence. \n A group representing the families of the victims issued a statement demanding that it be part of the investigation committee. Many bereaved family members and their supporters have been demanding a more thorough investigation of the government's responsibility in the sinking, questioning why higher-level officials have not been held accountable. \n The ferry's captain survived and is serving a life sentence after a court found him guilty of committing homicide through \"willful negligence\" because he fled the ship without issuing an evacuation order. \n Ousted President Park was forced to defend herself against accusations that she was out of contact for several hours on the day of the sinking. The allegations were included in an impeachment bill lawmakers passed against Park in December, amid broader corruption suspicions. \n Park was formally removed from office by the Constitutional Court earlier this month. She is now under criminal investigation over suspicions that she conspired with a confidante to extort money and favors from companies and allow the friend to secretly interfere with state affairs. \n Salvaging the huge, corroded ferry from a channel notorious for dangerous currents has been a difficult and expensive job. South Korea agreed in 2015 to a $76 million deal with a consortium led by China's state-run Shanghai Salvage Co. to do it. \n While many large shipwrecks around the world have first been cut into sections to be raised, this was never an option for Sewol because there are hopes of finding the remains of the missing victims inside the wreckage. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "South Korean ferry that sank 3 years ago lifted from sea"}

Masood plowed a rented SUV into pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge, killing an American man and a British woman and injuring more than 30 people of almost a dozen nationalities. He then fatally stabbed a policeman inside the gates of Parliament before being shot to death by an officer. \n A 75-year-old victim on the bridge died late today of his wounds, police said. \n Vincenzo Mangiacarpe, an Italian boxer visiting Parliament, said he saw the attacker get out of the car wielding two knives. \n \"You can imagine if someone was playing a drum on your back with two knives \u2014 he gave (the policeman) around 10 stabs in the back,\" Mangiacarpe said. \n The dead were identified as Kurt Cochran, 54, of Utah and British school administrator Aysha Frade, 43 \u2014 both struck on the bridge \u2014 and 48-year-old Constable Keith Palmer, a 15-year veteran of the Metropolitan Police. The 75-year-old victim was not identified. \n Police arrested eight people \u2014 three women and five men \u2014 on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts as authorities sought Masood's motive and possible support network. One arrest was in London, while the others were in Birmingham. Police said they were searching properties in Birmingham, London and Wales. \n Masood's convictions between 1983 and 2003 included assault, weapons possession and public order offenses, London police said. \n But he \"was not the subject of any current investigations and there was no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack,\" police added. \n Many suspects in British terrorist attacks and plots have had roots in Birmingham, England's second-largest city, and several local mosques have been linked to extremist clerics. \n A home raided in Birmingham was one where Masood lived until late last year, a neighbor said. Shown a photo of him, Iwona Romek said \"that is 100 percent\" the man who lived next door to her for about five months. \n Romek said he had a wife and child about 6 years old who he would walk to school. He rarely left home in the evening. \n \"He seemed like a normal family man who liked to take care of his garden,\" she said. But one day she saw him packing their belongings in a black van and they were gone. \n As police investigated, Parliament got back to business, opening the day with a minute's silence for the victims. May saluted the heroism of police and the bravery of ordinary Londoners. \n \"As I speak, millions will be boarding trains and airplanes to travel to London and to see for themselves the greatest city on Earth,\" she said. \"It is in these actions \u2014 millions of acts of normality \u2014 that we find the best response to terrorism. A response that denies our enemies their victory, that refuses to let them win.\" \n In 1,000-year-old Westminster Hall, the oldest part of Parliament's buildings, politicians, journalists and parliamentary staff lined up to sign a book of condolences. One uniformed policeman wrote: \"Keith, my friend, will miss you.\" \n Some parliamentarians said they were shaken by Wednesday's attack, and all were somber. But they also were determined. \n \"There is no such thing as 100 percent security,\" said Menzies Campbell, a member of the House of Lords. \"We have to learn to live with that.\" \n The attack echoed deadly vehicle rampages in Nice, France, and Berlin last year that were claimed by the Islamic State group. \n IS said through its Aamaq News Agency that the London attacker \u2014 whom it did not name \u2014 was \"a soldier of the Islamic State\" who \"carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting citizens of the coalition\" fighting IS in Syria and Iraq. \n IS has been responsible for violence around the globe although the group has also claimed events later found to have no clear links to it. \n Police believe the attacker acted alone, May told lawmakers, with no reason to believe \"imminent further attacks\" are planned. Britain's threat level from terrorism stands at \"severe,\" the second-highest on a five-point scale, meaning an attack is highly likely. \n Years ago, Khalid was \"investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism,\" she said, but called him \"a peripheral figure.\" \n Home Secretary Amber Rudd denied there had been an intelligence failure because the attacker had been known to police. \n \"I think that would be absolutely the wrong judgment to make,\" Rudd told the BBC. \"I'm confident that as we get more information \u2026 that we will learn more and take comfort from the information that we have and the work that the intelligence services do.\" \n British security forces say they have foiled 13 plots in the past four years. \n London has been a terrorism target many times. Last weekend, hundreds of police simulated a attack on a tourist boat on the River Thames, which winds through London. \n The victims were from 11 countries. They included 12 Britons, four South Koreans, three French, two Romanians, two Greeks, two Irish, two Americans and one person each from Germany, Poland, China and Italy. \n Cochran, who was visiting London with his wife, Melissa, for their 25th anniversary, was listed among the dead by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His wife was seriously injured and hospitalized. \n Nigel Farage, former leader of the right-wing U.K. Independence Party, blamed the attack on \"multiculturalism.\" \n But most politicians said the violence should not divide Britain, and May called the rampage \"a perversion of a great faith.\" \n As dusk fell, a silent vigil was held by several thousand people in London's Trafalgar Square, where the bells of Big Ben could be heard in the distance. \n \"Those evil and tortured individuals who try to destroy our shared way of life will never succeed,\" Mayor Sadiq Khan told the crowd. \n Sughra Ahmed, a Muslim woman who traveled from northwest England for the vigil, said she'd been reduced to tears on the square by a woman who embraced her. \n \"Britain is one,\" she said. \"An attack on one is an attack on us all.\" \n Danica Kirka, Gregory Katz, Frank Griffiths, Lori Hinnant and Sophie Berman in London and Bilal Hussein in Beirut contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "London defiant as IS claims attack by British ex-con, 52"}

{"date": "March 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. gestured during a television interview, on March 15, on Capitol Hill in Washington. House Republicans' health care bill provides massive tax cuts to the wealthy while increasing taxes for many lower-income families, adding to America's big income gap between the rich and everyone else. \n WASHINGTON >> House Republicans' health care bill provides massive tax cuts to the wealthy while increasing taxes for many lower-income families, adding to America's big income gap between the rich and everyone else. \n Over the past quarter century, only one group of people has seen significant increases in income \u2014 those at the very top. Families in the middle or at the bottom of the economic ladder have seen little or no increase in wages. \n And since 2000, most middle- and low-income families have seen their incomes drop, when inflation is taken into account, according to Census Bureau data. \n The GOP health bill exacerbates those disparities, according to a new report by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. On average, taxes would go down for families making more than $50,000 a year, while taxes would increase for many families making less, the report said. \n \"This is a massive transfer of wealth from working families to the very richest people in this country,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \"In this case, all the people will be forced to pay more for health insurance while billionaires get a tax break.\" \n Income disparities and an eroding middle class helped spawn two populist political movements during last year's presidential election. Sanders was the standard-bearer on the left as he ran for the Democratic nomination. President Donald Trump led the movement on the right. \n Yet Trump's first piece of major legislation doesn't provide much tax relief for the white working-class voters who supported him. Regardless, Trump is pressing hard for House Republicans to vote for the bill, meeting with wavering lawmakers at the Capitol and the White House. \n The House is expected to vote on the bill today. \n The measure would repeal major parts of former President Barack Obama's health law, capping future funding for Medicaid and cutting tax increases for high-income families, health insurance companies and drug makers. \n The biggest tax cut would eliminate a 3.8 percent tax on investment income for high-income individuals and families. Another would repeal an extra 0.9 percent Medicare tax on wages above $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples. \n Families making more than $200,000 would get tax cuts averaging $5,680 a year, once the bill is fully implemented, according to the Tax Policy Center report. The average tax cut jumps to more than $51,000 for families making more than $1 million a year. \n \"That's not what Trump ran on. He ran on helping the little guy,\" said Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y. \"I would think if you got all of the millionaires in a room, they're not going to turn it down, but they would admit to you they don't need this assistance. They don't need a $50,000 tax break.\" \n House Republicans highlight the tax cuts, noting that many small business owners would get relief. They also say their bill would repeal several Obamacare mandates \u2014 one on individuals to get health insurance and one on large employers to provide coverage to workers. \n In place of these mandates, Republicans say they offer a plan that provides more choice and less government interference for patients. \n \"The bottom line is, we made a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, and we are going to keep our word,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \n The bill raises taxes for some because it repeals tax credits that people can use to purchase health insurance on marketplace exchanges. It replaces them with a new tax credit that is less generous for most. \n The tax hikes would be relatively small but they would hit the working poor who could least afford it. For example, families making between $20,000 and $30,000 a year would get tax increases averaging $200. Families making between $30,000 and $40,000, would get tax hikes averaging $180. \n Many of these families have seen their wages stagnate for much of the past 20-plus years. \n From 1979 to 2015, middle-income households saw their incomes rise by just 14 percent, when inflation is taken into account, according to Census Bureau statistics. These households make an average of $56,800 a year. \n Over the same period, low-income households saw their incomes rise just 2 percent. These households average just $12,500 a year in income. \n Meanwhile, the top 5 percent of households saw their incomes jump 75 percent. The average income for these households: $360,000 a year. \n \"The issue here is that for 30 or 40 years, the middle class in this country has been shrinking,\" said Sanders, echoing one of the main themes of his failed presidential campaign. \n \"Clearly, Trump's so-called health care plan and certainly his budget will make a very bad situation worse \u2014 more tax breaks for the rich, throwing millions off their health insurance and cutting back on programs that working families need,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Republican health bill would widen America's wealth gap"}

{"date": "March 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Javier Righetti made his initial appearance, in Sept. 2011, on charges of the rape and murder of 15-year-old Alyssa Otremba at the Regional Justice Center in Las Vegas. A jury decided that Righetti should be put to death for the rape, murder and mutilation of Otremba in a crime that shocked Las Vegas for its brutality in 2011. \n LAS VEGAS >> A jury in Las Vegas decided a 24-year-old man should become the youngest person on Nevada's death row for the 2011 rape, killing and mutilation of a 15-year-old girl who had texted her mother to say she was on her way home after fetching a school book. \n Javier Righetti was 19 when Alyssa Otremba disappeared and searchers found her charred body the next day in a vacant lot not far from her home in northwest Las Vegas. \n His court-appointed attorney, Christy Craig, declined Wednesday to comment on the verdict, which was read late Tuesday in Clark County District Court. Craig had sought life in prison without parole, and Righetti apologized to people he acknowledged he hurt. \n Righetti is due for formal sentencing in Clark County District Court on May 9 \u2014 his 25th birthday \u2014 on charges also including kidnapping, battery, robbery and sexual assault of a victim under 16 years old. \n He'll become the 83rd person on death row in Nevada, and his sentence will be automatically appealed. The last execution in Nevada was in 2006. \n The slain girl's mother, Jennifer Otremba, told reporters at the courthouse that the verdict wasn't a win for anybody. \n \"Two families have been destroyed,\" she said. \"We have the rest of life to live without Alyssa.\" \n Police said Otremba was abducted, sexually assaulted, stabbed 80 times and had the letters \"LV\" carved in her thigh before her body was left in a tunnel. Righetti returned later to douse the corpse with gasoline and burn it into unrecognizability. \n Investigators said there was no evidence that Righetti knew Otremba. He told police following his arrest he wanted to prove he could be as brutal as the most notorious Las Vegas gang member, although police said there was no evidence he was in a gang. \n The same jury that decided the death sentence found Righetti guilty last week of capital murder in a retrial on an unusually narrow question of whether the slaying was premeditated. \n The Nevada Supreme Court ruled last month that Righetti's plea to the murder charge was unacceptable because he didn't specify that it was willful, deliberate and planned. Righetti's guilty pleas to other charges stood. \n Jurors heard evidence this week that even before Otremba's slaying, Righetti was sought in Mexico on an arrest warrant in a rape case involving his 16-year-old cousin. \n Prosecutors Giancarlo Pesci and Michelle Fleck said the jury decision for death provided justice for all of Righetti's victims. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Jury hands down death penalty for man, 24, in Las Vegas killing"}
