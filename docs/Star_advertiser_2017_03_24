Attorneys said the 18-year-old could be released from a Wisconsin detention center as early as Monday. \n Judge Samuel Cole issued a 13-page decision more than two weeks after Yee's closed-door hearing on the asylum application. \n \"Yee has met his burden of showing that he suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion and has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Singapore,\" Cole wrote. \n Yee left Singapore with the intention of seeking asylum in the U.S. after being jailed for several weeks in 2015 and 2016. He was accused of hurting the religious feelings of Muslims and Christians in the multiethnic city-state; Yee is an atheist. However, many of his blog and social media posts criticized Singapore's leaders. He created controversy in 2015 as the city-state was mourning the death of its first prime minister and he posted an expletive-laden video about Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew just after his death. \n Such open criticism of political leaders is discouraged in Singapore. The case, which raised questions about free speech and censorship, has been closely watched abroad. \n Cole said testimony during Yee's hearing showed that while the Singapore government's stated reason for punishing him involved religion, \"its real purpose was to stifle Yee's political speech.\" He said Yee's prison sentence was \"unusually long and harsh\" especially for his age. \n Officials at Singapore's embassy in Washington, D.C., have not addressed the case and messages left for the government on Saturday morning in Singapore weren't immediately returned. \n The ruling was praised by others. \n \"I think this is a major embarrassment for the government, that all along claimed Amos' persecution was not political,\" Kenneth Jeyaretnam, an opposition politician who gave testimony supporting Yee's asylum, told the Associated Press. \n Jeyaretnam said the decision \"may create waves in Singapore. It may show Singaporeans that there's nothing to be afraid about. The Singapore government is a paper tiger. We don't have to swallow the brainwashing that is constantly put out.\" \n His father, the late J.B. Jeyaretnam, attained folklore stature in the country's politics and was bankrupted after contesting a series of lawsuits by the ruling People's Action Party. \n PAP has dominated national politics since Singapore's independence in 1965 and its detractors often were taken to court on defamation or other charges. \n U.S.-based Human Rights Watch applauded the asylum decision and expressed hope the decision would not be appealed. \n \"Singapore excels at creating a pressure cooker environment for dissidents and free thinkers who dare challenge the political, economic and social diktats from the ruling People's Action Party. It's clear the Singapore government saw Amos Yee as the proverbial nail sticking up that had to be hammered down,\" said a statement from Phil Robertson, HRW's deputy Asia director. \n Yee's attorney Sandra Grossman said her client was elated with the news. \n \"He's very excited to begin new life in the United States,\" Grossman said. \n Yee told the AP in a phone interview from jail this month that he feared returning to Singapore. But he said he'd continue to speak out and had already planned a line of T-shirts and started writing a book about his experiences. \n \"I have an infinite amount of ideas of what to do,\" he told the AP. \n Department of Homeland Security attorneys had opposed the asylum bid, saying Yee's case didn't qualify as persecution based on political beliefs. It was unclear whether they'd appeal the decision or if Yee would have to remain imprisoned if they did. Attorneys have 30 days to appeal. \n Officials with DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn't immediately return messages today.

Congress was debating the measure when it was taken back before a vote. \n The calls to Costa and Maggie Haberman of the New York Times were surprising given the newspapers' aggressive coverage of the president. He has consistently derided their \"fake news\" and mocked the \"failing\" Times, which has been seeing an increase in subscriptions. \n Costa wrote in a first-person piece posted on the Post's web site that when his cell phone rang at 3:31 p.m. EDT, he thought it was a reader complaint because it was a blocked number. \n \"Hello, Bob,\" came the president's voice. \"So, we just pulled it.\" \n Costa multi-tasked, interviewing Trump while posting several updates on Twitter. \n \"President Trump just called me, still on phone,\" he posted at 3:32. \"'We just pulled it,' he tells me.\" \n Costa, a national political reporter for the Post, tweeted a stream of updates: \"I don't blame Paul, Trump tells me\" and \"What a convo. I'll type it up quick.\" \n CNN ran a screen grab of Costa's Twitter feed, even though he's nominally a competitor: Costa also works as an NBC News analyst. \n Before 5 p.m., he had posted a first-person account of the conversation under the headline: \"Hello, Bob: President Trump called my cellphone to say that the health care bill was dead.\" \n Haberman's first tweet came at 3:52 p.m.: \"TRUMP tells me in interview this is now the Democrats' fault, and that he anticipates that when Obama 'explodes,' they will be ready to deal.\" She quickly corrected her typo, meaning Obamacare instead of Obama. \n She wrote on Twitter that Trump had shown uncharacteristic discipline in saying it was the Democrats who had let him down. Besides Twitter, a quote from her interview appeared in the Times' online coverage of the events. Trump spoke before cameras in the Oval Office about an hour after the phone conversations. \n It wasn't Haberman's first phone interview with the president. She wrote a piece shortly after his inauguration about life in the White House. \n Later, Haberman offered a Twitter observation about the president: \"Trump is not going away this weekend. He was deeply disciplined in phone interviews. The big question is what happens now when he sits in the White House residence and watches television coverage of the bill's failure.\" \n Based on the media coverage, it won't be an easy aftermath. \n \"Is there a sense of how ignominious this defeat is?\" CNN's Jake Tapper asked correspondent Dana Bash, calling it an embarrassment for House Republicans and the White House. \n \"The president just suffered a terrible defeat,\" said MSNBC's Brian Williams. \n Fox News Channel's Bret Baier said \"the president took a hit today,\" and batted away colleague Eric Bolling's attempt to pin blame on House Speaker Paul Ryan and Congress, noting Trump had pushed hard for the bill. \n \"When you can't tell the elevator story about what's good about the bill for middle America,\" Baier said, \"you've lost.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump delivers his news to newspaper reporters"}

{"date": "March 24, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The sunken Sewol ferry is loaded onto a semi-submersible transport vessel during the salvage operation in waters off Jindo, South Korea. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> Salvage crews towed a corroded 6,800-ton South Korean ferry and loaded it onto a semi-submersible transport vessel today, completing what was seen as the most difficult part of the massive effort to bring the ship back to shore. \n Government officials say it will take a week or two to bring the vessel to a port (55 miles away so that investigators could search for the remains of nine missing people, who were among the 304 who died when the Sewol capsized on April 16, 2014. \n Most of the victims were students on a high school trip, touching off an outpouring of national grief and soul searching about long-ignored public safety and regulatory failures. Public outrage over what was seen as a botched rescue job by the government contributed to the recent ouster of Park Geun-hye as president. \n \"We just got over one hump \u2026 we are trying hard to stay calm,\" Lee Geum-hee, the mother of a missing school girl, told a television crew. \n Bringing the Sewol back to the port in Mokpo would be a step toward finding closure to one of the country's deadliest disasters. Once the ferry reaches land, government officials say it would take about a month for the ship to be cleaned and evaluated for safety. \n Investigators will then enter the wreckage and begin a three-month search for the remains of the missing victims and for clues further illuminating the cause of the sinking, which has been blamed on overloaded cargo, improper storage and other negligence. \n Workers on two barges began the salvaging operation Wednesday night, rolling up 66 cables connected to a frame of metal beams divers spent months placing beneath the ferry, which had been lying on its left side under 144 feet of water. \n Relatives of the missing victims, some of whom who were watching from two fishing boats just outside the operation area, cried as the blue-and-white right side of the ferry, rusty and scratched and its painted name \"SEWOL\" no longer visible, emerged from the waters on Thursday morning. \n By Friday evening, workers managed to raise the ship 42 feet above the water surface so that they could load it onto the semi-submersible, heavy lift vessel that was about 2 miles away. The timing of the move was vital because dangerous water currents were forecast to worsen Saturday. \n Five towing vessels slowly pulled the two barges with the partially raised Sewol tied between them. They had placed the Sewol on the vessel's submerged dock by 4:10 a.m. Saturday, according to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. \n Lee Cheoljo, a ministry official, said workers will spend several hours disconnecting the Sewol from the barges by removing the wires. They plan to lift the dock and fully raise the Sewol from the water by the end of Saturday before emptying the ship of water and fuel, Lee said. \n The journey to the Mokpo port could be shorter than the initial two-week estimate, depending on weather and other conditions, Lee said. \n Victims' relatives and government officials disagree on how to proceed with the searches. The government favors cutting off the passenger cabin area and raising it upright before searching for the missing victims, while families fear that cutting into the ship might harm any victims' remains. \n A group representing the victim's families has also demanded that it be part of an investigation committee that will be formed to further study the cause of the ship's sinking. Many bereaved family members and their supporters have been demanding a more thorough investigation into the government's responsibility over the sinking, questioning why higher-level officials have not been held accountable. \n The ferry's captain is serving a life prison sentence for committing homicide through \"willful negligence\" because he fled the ship without ordering an evacuation. \n Accusations that Park was out of contact for several hours on the day of the sinking were included in the impeachment bill Parliament passed in December. She was formally removed from office this month and is under criminal investigation over suspicions that she conspired with a confidante to extort money and favors from companies and allow the friend to secretly interfere with state affairs. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Corroded South Korean ferry loaded onto transport vessel"}

{"date": "March 24, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Police officers patrol on Westminster Bridge in London. On Thursday authorities identified a 52-year-old Briton as the man who mowed down pedestrians and stabbed a policeman to death outside Parliament in London, saying he had a long criminal record and once was investigated for extremism \u2014 but was not currently on a terrorism watch list. \n BIRMINGHAM, England >> Long before his short stints in jail turned into years behind bars, Khalid Masood was known as Adrian Elms, with a reputation for drinking and an unpredictable temper. \n At least twice he was convicted of violent crimes, well before he stabbed a police officer to death Wednesday in London with a motion that one horrified witness described as \"playing a drum on your back with two knives.\" \n But as he checked out of his hotel to head toward London for his deadly rampage, the manager said he was struck by his guest's friendly manner. \n Within hours, Masood drove his rented SUV across the crowded Westminster Bridge, leaving a trail of dead and wounded. Then he jumped out and attacked Constable Keith Palmer, an officer guarding Parliament, stabbing him to death before being shot to death by police. \n In all, he killed four people and left more than two dozen hospitalized. \n Masood, who at 52 is considerably older than most extremists who carry out bloodshed in the West, had an arrest record dating to 1983. The violence came later, first in 2000 when he slashed a man across the face in a pub parking lot in a racially charged argument after drinking four pints, according to a newspaper account. \n The victim, Piers Mott, was scarred for life, said his widow, Heather. \n Masood's last conviction was in 2003, also involving a knife attack. It's not clear when he took the name Masood, suggesting a conversion to Islam. \n Heather Mott said Masood appeared to come out of jail \"even worse.\" She said she got chills when she learned the identity of the London attacker. \n \"What a pity they didn't realize he was a nutter,\" she said. \n Police are combing through \"massive amounts of computer data\" and have contacted 3,500 witnesses as they look for clues as to why the British-born man launched the deadly attack. \n \"Clearly that's a main line of our investigation is what led him to be radicalized: Was it through influences in our community, influences from overseas or through online propaganda? Our investigations and our arrests will help in that, but the public appeal will make a big difference if people come forward with more information,\" said Britain's top counterterrorism officer, Mark Rowley. \n A security official who spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about an ongoing investigation confirmed that Masood had spent time in Saudi Arabia but said investigators were still trying to determine how long he stayed and what he was doing. \n Prime Minister Theresa May said Masood was \"investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism\" years ago. But she called him \"a peripheral figure.\" \n The Islamic State group described Masood as \"a soldier,\" claiming responsibility for the attack. Rowley said police are investigating whether he \"acted totally alone inspired by terrorist propaganda, or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him.\" \n People made arrests across the country as they investigate whether anyone else helped Masood prepare his attack. Six people were released without charge Friday night, leaving four in custody on suspicion of preparing terrorist acts. \n Detectives have searched 21 properties in London, Brighton, Wales, Manchester and the central English city of Birmingham in one of Britain's biggest counterterrorism operations in years. Wednesday's attack was the deadliest in Britain since suicide bombers killed 52 commuters on London's transit system on July 7, 2005. \n Once Masood's identity became known, police and the media began tracing his final hours. \n The manager of the Preston Park Hotel in the beachside city of Brighton where Masood stayed the night before the attack said he seemed unusually outgoing and mentioned details about his family, including having a sick father. \n \"He was normal, in fact friendly, because we spent possibly five or 10 minutes talking to him about his background and where he came from,\" Sabeur Toumi told Sky News. He was \"laughing and joking, telling us stories about where he lived.\" \n Police raided the room, searching for clues about Masood. \n Masood's mother lives in rural Wales, according to a website on which she sells handmade cushions and handbags. The listings on Folksy by Janet Ajao have been taken down, but in an archived version of the site, she describes living in \"rural west Wales with my husband, border collie and a few chickens.\" Calls to the home in remote Trelech, Wales, went unanswered Friday. \n When Masood was in school, he took his stepfather's name, Ajao. He was athletic and popular in high school, known as someone who liked to party, according to Stuart Knight, a former classmate, who said the young man was one of only two black students in the school of 600. \n \"I am in shock \u2014 that is not sympathy for what he has done \u2014 he was a nice guy and I'm surprised he turned and did what he did,\" Knight said. \n In one of the last places Masood lived, a home in Birmingham, neighbors recalled him as a quiet man whose wife was veiled and who wore traditional Muslim clothing. But the neighborhood is not among one of the city's many Muslim enclaves, suggesting he was not deeply embedded in its religious community. \n Moazzam Begg, a former Guantanamo prisoner born and raised in Birmingham, said the details emerging of the attacker's life raised questions about where was radicalized. \n \"He did not live in a Muslim neighborhood. In my mind, in my analysis, he was probably a drifter,\" said Begg, adding that no one he knew in the community had met Masood. \"I'd also be surprised if he had any connection with a mosque, because sadly they are places where you can no longer discuss politics or air grievances.\" \n Since British authorities began cracking down on mosques, many people are instead being radicalized online, Berg added. \n Cultural and religious alienation can fuel such violence, he added. \n Begg helps run a group called Cage that has encountered extremists who spoke of their alienation before they committed attacks. While in prison, Begg said he saw others who succumbed to radicalism. He said groups like IS can exploit people's weaknesses and criminality. \n Late Friday, the British government honored a lawmaker who battled to save the life of the police officer slain in the Parliament attack, giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. \n May's office said Tobias Ellwood has been named to the Privy Council, a committee of senior lawmakers, judges and others that advises Queen Elizabeth II. The institution dates back a millennium. \n Security Minister Ben Wallace, who helped coordinate the government response to Wednesday's attack, was also named to the council. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "London attacker cheerful, joking on eve of deadly rampage"}

AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, Volkswagen and several other companies pulled ads earlier this week. \n The defections are continuing even after Google apologized for tainting brands and outlined steps to ensure ads don't appear alongside unsavory videos. \n It's not an easy problem to fix, even for a company with the brainpower that Google has drawn upon to build a search engine that billions trust to find the information they want in a matter of seconds. \n Google depends mostly on automated programs to place ads in YouTube videos because the job is too much for humans to handle on their own. About 400 hours of video is now posted on YouTube each minute. \n The company has pledged to hire more people to review videos and develop even more sophisticated programs to teach its computers to figure out which clips would be considered to be too despicable for advertising. \n Contacted Friday, Google stood by its earlier promise, signaling the company's confidence that it will be able to placate advertisers. As part of that effort, Google intends to block more objectionable videos from ever being posted on YouTube \u2014 an effort that could spur complaints about censorship. \n Some outraged advertisers are making it clear that they won't return to YouTube until they are certain Google has the situation under control. \n \"The content with which we are being associated is appalling and completely against our company values,\" Wal-Mart said in a Friday statement. \n Besides suspending their spending on YouTube, Wal-Mart, PepsiCo and several other companies have said they will stop buying ads that Google places on more than two million other third-party websites. \n If Google can't lure back advertisers, it could result in a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Most analysts, though, doubt the ad boycott will seriously hurt Google's corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. \n Although they have been growing rapidly, YouTube's ads still only represent a relatively small financial piece of Alphabet, whose revenue totaled $73.5 billion last year after subtracting commissions paid to Google's partners. YouTube accounted for $5.6 billion, or nearly 8 percent, of that total, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer Inc. \n At most, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said he expects the YouTube ad boycott to trim Alphabet's net revenue by about 2 percent this year. \n Moody's Investor Service predicted the backlash won't last long because Google is \"laser-focused\" on cleaning things up on YouTube. \n Alphabet's stock price has fallen nearly 4 percent since the boycott began last week after an investigation by The Times in London revealed the ads of major brands were appearing in YouTube videos delving into contentious themes. The shares fell $4.51 to close at $835.14 Friday. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "More big brands pull ads from YouTube in widening boycott"}

{"date": "March 24, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former Penn State president Graham Spanier walks from the Dauphin County Courthouse in Harrisburg, Pa. \n HARRISBURG, Pa. >> Former Penn State President Graham Spanier was convicted Friday of hushing up child sexual abuse allegations in 2001 against Jerry Sandusky, whose arrest a decade later blew up into a major scandal for the university and led to the firing of beloved football coach Joe Paterno. \n The jury found Spanier guilty of one misdemeanor count of child endangerment over his handling of a complaint against the retired assistant football coach but acquitted him of conspiracy and a second child endangerment count. \n Spanier, 68, showed no emotion when the verdict was read after 13 hours of deliberations. He could get up to five years in prison. His lawyer said he will appeal. \n The trial centered on how Spanier and two other university administrators handled a complaint by graduate coaching assistant Mike McQueary, who said he reported seeing Sandusky sexually molesting a boy in a team shower in 2001. The three officials told Sandusky he could not bring children onto the campus anymore but did not report the matter to police or child welfare authorities. \n Sandusky was not arrested until 2011, after an anonymous tip led prosecutors to investigate the shower incident. He was convicted the next year of sexually abusing 10 boys and is serving 10 to 30 years behind bars. At least four victims at Sandusky's trial said they were molested after 2001. \n \"Evil in the form of Jerry Sandusky was allowed to run wild,\" prosecutor Patrick Schulte told the jury. \n The scandal sent shockwaves through Penn State. It led to the ouster of both Spanier and Paterno and resulted in the school paying out more than $90 million to settle claims by over 30 Sandusky accusers. In addition, the NCAA fined Penn State $48 million and briefly erased more than 100 of Paterno's football victories from the record books. \n The Hall of Fame coach was never charged with a crime. He died of cancer in 2012 at age 85. \n Another prosecutor, Laura Ditka, said Spanier was \"convicted for all the children who came to Penn State after what Mike McQueary saw that night.\" \n Two of Spanier's former lieutenants, athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment charges a week ago and testified against Spanier. But all three denied they were told the encounter in the shower was sexual in nature. \n \"The verdict, their words and pleas indicate a profound failure of leadership,\" Penn State said in a statement. \"And while we cannot undo the past, we have re-dedicated ourselves and our university to act always with the highest integrity, in affirming the shared values of our community.\" \n The prosecution's key evidence included notes and email exchanges in which the three debated what to do after McQueary's report. \n Spanier approved a plan to tell the retired coach to stop bringing children to athletic facilities and to inform The Second Mile, a charity for at-risk youth that Sandusky founded. \n At one point, the administrators planned to inform the state Department of Public Welfare. Instead, Spanier approved putting that on hold, and the agency was never contacted. That decision formed the heart of the case against him. \n \"The only downside for us is if the message isn't 'heard' and acted upon, and we then become vulnerable for not having reported it,\" Spanier told Curley and Schultz in 2001 in the email exchange. He called the plan \"humane and a reasonable way to proceed.\" \n Spanier's attorney, Sam Silver, said the case involved judgment calls by the administrators. He said there was no evidence of a crime by Spanier. \n Ditka said during closing arguments that the three university leaders wanted to protect the university's reputation at the expense of children. \n \"They took a gamble,\" she told the jury. \"They weren't playing with dice. They were playing with kids.\" \n A report commissioned by the university and conducted by former FBI Director Louis Freeh concluded that Paterno and the three others hushed up the allegations against Sandusky for fear of bad publicity. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ex-Penn State president convicted over child-sex scandal"}

Apple says the purported hacking techniques have all been fixed in recent iPhones and Mac computers. \n NEW YORK >> Apple said purported hacking vulnerabilities disclosed by WikiLeaks this week have all been fixed in recent iPhones and Mac computers. \n The documents released by the anti-secrecy site Thursday morning pointed to an apparent CIA program to hack Apple devices using techniques that users couldn't disable by resetting their devices. \n The iPhone hack was limited to the 3G model from 2008. In a statement late Thursday, Apple said the flaw was fixed with the release of the iPhone 3GS a year later. Apple also said the Mac vulnerabilities were all fixed in all Macs launched after 2013. \n Apple's statement was consistent with assessments from security experts, who say that many of the apparent vulnerabilities were in older technology. Apple is going further in saying those flaws have all been fixed, based on its preliminary analysis. \n Security experts say the exploits described in the WikiLeaks documents are plausible, but suggest they pose little threat to typical users. Besides being likely out of date, the techniques also typically require physical access to devices, something the CIA would use only for targeted individuals, not a broader population. \n The CIA has not commented on the authenticity of this and earlier WikiLeaks revelations, but has previously said it complies with a legal prohibition against electronic surveillance \"targeting individuals here at home, including our fellow Americans.\" \n The leaks Thursday came about two weeks after WikiLeaks published thousands of alleged CIA documents describing hacking tools it said the government employed to break into computers, mobile phones and even smart TVs from companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Samsung. WikiLeaks has offered to share further details with tech companies to help them fix flaws, though accepting such information might subject companies to certain conditions and put government contracts at risk. \n Apple addressed the offer for the first time in Thursday's statement. \n \"We have not negotiated with WikiLeaks for any information,\" the statement read. \"We have given them instructions to submit any information they wish through our normal process under our standard terms. Thus far, we have not received any information from them that isn't in the public domain.\" \n Apple said that while it takes users' security and privacy seriously, \"we do not condone theft or coordinate with those that threaten to harm our users.\" \n Earlier, Microsoft said WikiLeaks had made initial contact through its public reporting channel, \"and we have followed up, treating them as we would any other finder.\" Mozilla, the organization behind the Firefox web browser, also said it had been contacted through the email address it uses for security vulnerability reporting. Mozilla said it would take steps necessary to fix any vulnerabilities reported that way. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Apple: Software flaws in latest WikiLeaks docs are all fixed"}

Greg Abbott and Charter Communications CEO Thomas Rutledge, left the White House in Washington, today, to talk to reporters following their meeting with President Donald Trump. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Texas Gov. Greg Abbott listened, at left, as Charter Communications CEO Thomas Rutledge spoke to reporters outside the White House in Washington, today, after meeting with President Donald Trump. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump today praised a plan by cable company Charter Communications to hire 20,000 American call center workers. But the hiring initiative dates back to 2015 as part of the company's successful efforts to merge with Time Warner Cable. \n It's the latest corporate jobs announcement made at the White House that capitalized on plans made before Trump won the presidency. Other major companies including General Motors and Ford have allowed Trump to take credit for job decisions that either pre-date his election or involve market forces outside the administration's direct control. \n Charter CEO Tom Rutledge had said at an investment conference in December 2015 that the company would have to make about 20,000 hires once it acquired Time Warner Cable and Bright House to bring outsourced jobs in-house. \n But after meeting with Trump in the Oval Office today, Rutledge credited the administration's call to reduce regulations and corporate tax rates for contributing to the hiring decision. He went on to say that uncertainty over whether the administration can deliver those corporate tax cuts \u2014 in light of the muddle this week over replacing former President Barack Obama's health care law \u2014 could influence the company's hiring commitment. \n As part of the 20,000 jobs to be added over four years, Rutledge said the company will also invest $25 billion and open a new call center in McAllen, Texas, that will employ 600 workers. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also attended the meeting. \n Charter spokesman Justin Venech said the company previously had no timeframe for hiring the 20,000 workers. The company said today that it would happen over four years. Venech also said the $25 billion investment was new, although market analysts were expecting the company to spend roughly $30 billion on capital expenditures, such as buying cable boxes and maintaining its network, through 2020. \n Call center jobs at Charter have a base pay of $14 an hour and total annual compensation of nearly $29,000, according to the jobs site Glassdoor. \n Trump says the plans will be great for American workers, telling Rutledge, \"You watch, it will be one of your really fantastic decisions.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump touts jobs commitment made during Obama era"}

{"date": "March 24, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Graphic designer Janella Williams receives medication from an intravenous drip for a neurological disorder, getting the drugs that she says allow her to walk. Under her Affordable Care Act plan, she pays $480 a month for coverage and has an out-of-pocket maximum of $3,500 a year. \n NEW YORK >> Some Americans breathed a sigh of relief, others bubbled with frustration, and nearly all resigned themselves to the prospect that the latest chapter in the never-ending national debate over health care would not be the last. \n The withdrawal of the Republican-sponsored health bill in the face of likely defeat Friday in the U.S. House seemed to ensure that the deep divisions over the Affordable Care Act and its possible replacement will continue to simmer. \n As news spread, Americans fell into familiar camps, either happy to see a Democratic effort live another day, or eager to see Republicans regroup and follow through with their \"repeal Obamacare\" promises. \n \"Yessssss,\" an elated 27-year-old artist, Alysa Diebolt of Eastpointe, Michigan, typed on Facebook in response to the news, saying she was relieved those she knows on Affordable Care Act plans won't lose their coverage. \"I'm excited, I think it's a good thing,\" she said. \n Millions more shared her view, and #KillTheBill was a top trending topic on Twitter on Friday afternoon. Among those who have long sought to see Obama's health law dismantled, though, there was disappointment or chin-up resolve that they still could prevail. \n \"Hopefully they'll get it right next time,\" said Anthony Canamucio, the 50-year-old owner of a barbershop in Middletown Township, Pennsylvania. He gave his vote to Trump in November and wanted to see Obama's health law repealed, but found himself rooting for the GOP replacement bill to fail. He is insured through his wife's employer, and laments the growing deductibles and out-of-pocket costs, blaming Obama's law even as health economists say those trends in employer-provided health coverage preceded the legislation. \n For Canamucio, the Republicans' bill didn't go far enough in dismantling the ACA. But he remains steadfast behind Trump and said he believes the president will still deliver. \n Cliff Rouse, a 34-year-old banker from Kinston, North Carolina, likewise was willing to give the president he helped elect a chance to make good on his promise. He sees Obama's law as government overreach, even as he knows it could help people like his 64-year-old father, who was recently diagnosed with dementia but refused to buy coverage under a law he disagreed with. Rouse sees Trump's moves on health care as hasty, but believes the GOP will eventually come around with better legislation. \n \"They've not had enough time to develop a good plan,\" Rouse said. \"They should keep going until they have a good plan that Americans can feel confident in.\" \n It remained far more than a petty political debate, though, and some like Janella Williams, framed the issue as a question of life and death. \n The 45-year-old graphic designer from Lawrence, Kansas, spent Friday in the hospital hooked up to an intravenous drip for a neurological disorder, getting the drugs that she says allow her to walk. Under her Affordable Care Act plan, she pays $480 a month for coverage and has an out-of-pocket maximum of $3,500 a year. If she were to lose it, she wouldn't be able to afford the $13,000-a-year out-of-pocket maximum under her husband's insurance. Her treatments cost about $90,000 every seven weeks. \n As she followed the efforts to undo Obama's law, Williams found herself yelling at the TV a lot. She wrote her senators, telling how she felt \"helpless and out of control,\" and how her hope was dwindling. \n After watching coverage on Friday while tethered to a port in an outpatient area, she said when the bill was withdrawn, \"I am thankful. I hope that this makes Trump the earliest lame duck ever.\" \n Whatever comes of the developments, they became the latest chapter in a long-running policy debate \u2014 from Teddy Roosevelt's call for national health insurance in 1912, through waves of New Deal and Great Society legislation that brought Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, but no comprehensive health system for all, to an unsuccessful attempt at universal coverage at the start of Bill Clinton's administration. For now at least, Trump joins a list of American presidents who sought but failed to bring major health reform. \n Trump has railed against the 2010 ACA since the start, and GOP leaders in Congress have rallied for its repeal with dozens of votes during the Obama years. Republicans won the chance to replace the health law with Trump's win and control of both chambers of Congress. \n \"This is our opportunity to do it,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday. \"We've talked about this thing since 2010. Every Republican \u2026 has campaigned, from dogcatcher on up, that they would do everything they could to repeal and replace 'Obamacare.'\" \n Meantime, the Affordable Care Act has enjoyed growing approval with Obama's departure from the White House and the emergence of details of Trump's plan. For the first time, the law drew majority approval in a Pew Research Center poll last month, with 54 percent of Americans in favor. \n Even some of Trump's voters have come around to supporting the Obama law, or to a late realization that their coverage was made possible by it. \n Walt Whitlow, a 57-year-old carpenter from Volente, Texas, gave Trump his vote even as he came to view Obama's law as \"an unbelievable godsend.\" He went without health coverage for nearly 20 years, but after the ACA passed, he signed up. Two months later, he was diagnosed with tongue cancer. He proclaims himself opposed to government handouts that he thinks people grow too dependent on, though he wouldn't say what he hoped would happen with the GOP bill. Still, its withdrawal brought relief for a man who says his ACA coverage kept him from massive debt and maybe worse. \n \"It saved my life,\" he said. \"I really don't know what to say.\" \n Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers David Lieb in Jefferson City, Missouri; Kelli Kennedy in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; P.

{"date": "March 24, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Two young men who left a nearby synagogue watch police activity outside the Jewish Children's Museum following a bomb threat in Brooklyn borough of New York. \n NEW YORK >> Jewish groups had pointed to scores of bomb threats against their communities as the most dramatic example of what they considered a surge in anti-Semitism. Some blamed a far-right emboldened by President Donald Trump. Now, that picture has been complicated by the arrest of an Israeli Jewish hacker who authorities say is responsible for the harassment. \n Israeli police said the motive behind the threats was unclear. An attorney for the 19-year-old man, who was arrested Thursday, said her client had a \"very serious medical condition\" that might have affected his behavior. Earlier this month, U.S. law enforcement had arrested a former journalist in St. Louis, Juan Thompson, on charges he threatened Jewish organizations as part of a bizarre campaign to harass his former girlfriend. But Israeli police say the Jewish teen is the primary suspect in the more than 150 bomb threats in North America since early January. \n Previously, Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, which fights anti-Semitism and monitors extremism, had partly blamed Trump for creating an atmosphere that fueled the bomb threats and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, among other recent harassment. \"His well-documented reluctance to address rising anti-Semitism helped to create an environment in which extremists felt emboldened,\" Greenblatt wrote last month. \n On Feb. 28, in a meeting with state attorneys general, Trump had suggested the phoned-in bomb threats may have been designed to make \"others look bad,\" according to Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro. The remark raised concerns that Trump was downplaying bigotry. That same night, Trump opened his address to Congress with a strong condemnation of the threats and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, which occurred in suburban St. Louis, Philadelphia and elsewhere. \n In a phone interview Thursday from Washington, where Greenblatt was discussing anti-Semitism with members of Congress, he said, \"It's not the identity of the culprit that's the issue,\" but the outcome of threats themselves, which terrified Jews and disrupted Jewish life. \n He said anti-Semitism remained a serious concern, pointing to other recent incidents around the country. Swastikas were drawn throughout a New York City subway car with messages such as \"Jews belong in the oven.\" In South Carolina, a white supremacist with felony convictions was charged with plotting an attack on a synagogue that officials said was inspired by the massacre at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. A Seattle synagogue was vandalized with a spray-painted message, \"The Holocaust is fake history.\" \n Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, a civil rights and social justice group based in New York, said the arrest in Israel doesn't change Trump's record of being slow and insufficiently forceful in condemning anti-Jewish prejudice and bigotry in general. The center had repeatedly pointed to the bomb threats as evidence of \"a national emergency of anti-Semitism\" and accused Trump of failing to recognize the \"real evidence\" behind the problem. \n \"Nobody has said that Donald Trump himself has spray-painted swastikas or tipped over gravestones or that he picked up the phone and made bomb threats,\" Goldstein said. \"What we were condemning was the silence. Organizations had to shame Donald Trump into responding.\" \n The White House has not commented on Thursday's arrest. \n Melissa Plotkin, director of community engagement and diversity at the York Jewish Community Center in Pennsylvania, which was the target of a bomb threat last month, said it was \"troubling\" to find out the suspect was Jewish. \"I'm trying to make sense of it and wonder what was going through the mind of the person when they were carrying this out,\" Plotkin said. The Jewish Federations of North America called the case \"heartbreaking.\" \n Rabbi Joshua Hammerman of Temple Beth El in Stamford, Connecticut, said the case was an uncomfortable reminder of what he had been through. In 1999, medical waste marked with swastikas was left in his synagogue parking lot. The incident prompted an outpouring of support from religious leaders and others in the community. But then police charged a member of his congregation, an outcome Hammerman described as \"somewhat embarrassing\" and \"difficult.\" \n The rabbi expressed concern that the arrest of the Israeli-American teen would fuel denial of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust. Goldstein said his office had received emails Thursday claiming all reports of anti-Semitism were \"fake news.\" \n \"I think we should never jump to conclusions as to who did a particular act and allow the process of investigation to play itself out,\" Hammerman said in a phone interview. \"On the other hand, we should be equally vocal in calling out those who seem to condone such activity or at least don't explicitly condemn it.\" \n Andrew Rehfield, chief executive of the Jewish Federation of St. Louis, said \"finding out this guy was Jewish was baffling to us.\" Rehfield was among local leaders who organized the community's response to the cemetery vandalism last month, which drew donations and offers of help from Christians and Muslims, and political leaders from around the country. Some Jewish institutions in Missouri had also received bomb threats. \n Rehfield worried that efforts to combat anti-Semitism would be undermined not only by the identity of the bomb threat suspect, but also the partisan prism through which such incidents are viewed. Rehfield had been criticized by opponents of Trump for accompanying Vice President Mike Pence on a visit to the vandalized cemetery. Then on Thursday, Rehfield said a Jewish Trump supporter distributed an email demanding Jewish leaders apologize to the president now that police say a Jew was responsible for the threats. \n \"I think it does speak to the extremism on either side and the lack of charity and the lack of nuance,\" Rehfield said. \"None of us attributed this to Trump. None of us attributed this to (White House chief strategist Steve) Bannon. None of us attributed it to David Duke. I'm not going to apologize for wanting the administration to clearly condemn anti-Semitism.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. Jews wrestle with arrest of Jew in bomb threats case"}

She was five months pregnant when she disappeared from the island of Maui in 2014. \n Second Circuit Chief Judge Joseph Cardoza said Friday that Capobianco had lured Scott to her death. He said the defendant is self-centered for killing her and his own son because he didn't want to be tied to Scott as her child's father. \n \"That is so tragic and senseless,\" the judge said. \n Jurors who found Capobianco guilty also agreed that the crime was especially heinous, so Cardoza could have imposed a harsher sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. But the judge suggested Capobianco could successfully appeal that because it's not clear how Scott died. \n Family and friends addressing the court during the sentencing hearing urged Capobianco to reveal the location of Scott's body. \n \"Where is she?\" Scott's mother, Kimberlyn Scott, whispered while facing Capobianco in court. \"Where are they? Give her back to us. Do one decent thing and give her back.\" \n Carly Scott's father, Robert Scott, was removed from the courtroom after he lashed out at defense attorney Jon Apo. \n Robert Scott shouted, pointed at Apo and said he should be ashamed of himself. \n Capobianco, who is three years younger than Scott, met her in 2009. They lived together for two years, but \"the defendant would tell his friends that they were just roommates and he did not like to take pictures with her,\" Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Robert Rivera told jurors in his opening statement at the lengthy trial. \n They broke up, but Scott continued to love him, \"even though she knew he didn't care about her,\" Rivera said. \n When they were no longer a couple, Capobianco had another girlfriend and Scott got pregnant. She decided to continue with the pregnancy even though Capobianco insisted on an abortion, Rivera said. \n Apo countered that Capobianco was starting to come around to the idea of having a child. \n Scott's sister, Fiona Wais, said in court Friday that Scott was forgiving. \n \"She loved you enough to forgive so much,\" Wais said to the defendant. \"You took away the one thing she wanted to be. She wanted to be a mom.\" \n Maui Prosecuting Attorney John \"J.D.\" Kim said he was disappointed in the judge's findings but understood the reasoning. \n Some of Scott's blood-stained clothing and her jawbone were found after her disappearance, ending any hope she might still be alive. \n Jurors also convicted Capobianco of arson after prosecutors said he torched her sport-utility vehicle to cover up the killing. Cardoza sentenced him to 10 years for the arson, to be served consecutively with the murder sentence. \n Capobianco didn't testify during his trial. He also declined to speak at his sentencing hearing. \n \"Where is she?

{"date": "March 24, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., speaks to reporters at the Capitol in Washington, Friday, March 24, 2017. Nunes said Friday that Paul Manafort, the former campaign chairman for President Donald Trump, volunteered to be interviewed by committee members. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump's former campaign manager, a key figure in investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, has volunteered to be interviewed by lawmakers as part of an increasingly partisan House probe of the Kremlin's alleged meddling in the 2016 election. \n The chairman of the House intelligence committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, on Friday announced the prospect of an interview with Paul Manafort, and Nunes cancelled a previously scheduled public hearing in which former Obama administration officials had agreed to testify about the Russia investigation. It was not clear whether Manafort had offered to testify under oath or in a public hearing. \n Manafort volunteered to be interviewed the same week that FBI director James Comey confirmed the existence of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation into possible Trump associates' coordination with Russia and just days after an Associated Press report revealed Manafort worked with a Russian billionaire with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago. \n The confirmation of an ongoing FBI investigation was a blow to the White House, which has described the Russia probe as a ruse. And the new details about Manafort's ties to a close Putin ally appear to contradict what Trump has previously said about Manafort's connections. \n In February, Manafort said he was never involved with \"anything to do with the Russian government or the Putin administration.\" Trump has used the denials to assert that \"to the best of his knowledge\" none of his associates has anything to do with Russia. But documents obtained by the AP reveal Manafort had sought work from a Putin ally and proposed a campaign that he said could \"greatly benefit the Putin government.\" \n Nunes, a former dairy farmer from California and member of the Trump transition team, on Wednesday told reporters that an undisclosed source had shown him intelligence reports revealing that the communications of Trump transition officials were scooped up through routine surveillance and improperly spread through intelligence agencies during the final days of the Obama administration. After he briefed reporters, Nunes met with the president. \n Democrats said Nunes' loyalties to Trump appeared to outweigh his commitment to an independent, bipartisan investigation when he rushed to the White House to deliver the president information that Trump said vindicated him for his claims that former President Barack Obama wiretapping him. Comey, Nunes and other intelligence officials have refuted Trump's claim, and the president has offered no supporting evidence. \n \"To take evidence that may or may not be related to the investigation to the White House, was wholly inappropriate, and, of course, cast grave doubts into the ability to run a credible investigation and the integrity of that investigation,\" the committee's top Democrat, Adam Schiff of California, said Friday. \n Previously, Nunes and Schiff had held joint news conferences. Now what are becoming daily briefings are being done separately. Nunes apologized to Democrats on his committee on Thursday and promised to share the information he had with them. As of Friday, Schiff said the information had not been provided. \n Daniel Jones, former chief investigator for the Senate intelligence committee who now runs his own investigative advisory firm, said Nunes' handling of all of this has been \"bizarre.\" \n \"One of the key priorities of any investigation is to maintain its legitimacy and integrity,\" Jones said. \"You simply can't have the chairman of the investigation reporting to one of the possible targets of the investigation.\" \n Schiff said cancelling Tuesday's hearing was a \"serious mistake,\" especially, he said, after Americans benefited so much from the committee's hearing on Monday. \n That hearing, Schiff said, \"gave the public a real glimpse at why this is so significant, but we also heard for the first time that the FBI is doing a counterintelligence investigation that involves associates of the Trump campaign.\" \n Nunes' office said the White House had \"no input in the decision\" to cancel Tuesday's hearing in which the former directors of national intelligence and the CIA and the former acting attorney general had already agreed to publicly testify. Nunes' spokesman, Jack Langer, said the cancellation was more of a postponement and done because \"we have additional questions arising from Monday's hearing\" that lawmakers wanted to ask in a classified setting. A new date has not been set. \n In the committee's first hearing, Manafort's name came up 28 times. Later that day, White House spokesman Sean Spicer tried to downplay Manafort's role in the Trump campaign. On Thursday, the AP reported that the U.S. government obtained records of offshore financial transactions involving Manafort as part of a federal anti-corruption probe into his work in Eastern Europe. \n In a statement released Friday, Manafort's spokesman, Jason Maloni, said Manafort had agreed to talk with House committee members to specifically \"provide information voluntarily regarding recent allegations about Russian interference in the election.\" When asked whether Manafort would agree to be interviewed about his past work as a political consultant in eastern Europe, Maloni said that the interview would be about Russian interference in the election. \n Manafort, who was working in 2005 as a political consultant in Ukraine, pitched a wide-ranging political influence campaign to aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally, and eventually signed a $10 million annual contract, according business records and people familiar with the payments. \n In a statement to the AP earlier this week, Manafort confirmed that he worked for Deripaska, but denied that the work had been to advance Russia's interests. \n Manafort is one of several Trump associates investigators are looking at for possible coordination with the Russians during the campaign. On Thursday and Friday, Trump adviser Carter Page and Trump associate Roger Stone volunteered to speak to the committee as well. \n Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University who has written extensively about separation of powers, said there has always been a \"murky line\" between Congress and the White House when they're controlled by the same party, and he said he doesn't think Nunes has crossed that line. However, the intelligence committees, Turley said, have always been seen as the least partisan, and it's important that they maintain that reputation. \n Barring the appointment of an independent commission, which Democrats continue to call for, Turley said that the House intelligence committee will play an integral role in producing an investigation the American people can trust. \"It will not be able to do so unless it can maintain its independence from the administration,\" he said. \n Nunes on Friday said he shared the information he had with the president, because he thought it was the right thing to do. \n He said, \"There's politics on both sides of this, and I'm trying to navigate as best as I can.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump campaign chair offers to talk to House panel on Russia"}

Dolezal, who has legally changed her name to Nkechi Amare Diallo, rose to prominence as a black civil rights leader, but then lost her job when her parents exposed her as being white and is now struggling to make a living. \n SPOKANE, Wash. >> A white civil rights leader, fired because she led others to believe she was black, said she struggles to make a living these days because she was portrayed as a fraud. \n Rachel Dolezal said she has been unable to find steady work in the nearly two years since her background became public in media reports, and she is uncertain about her future. \n \"I was presented as a con and a fraud and a liar,\" Dolezal told The Associated Press this week. \"I think some of the treatment was pretty cruel.\" \n Now 40, she still identifies as black, despite being \"Caucasian biologically,\" she said. And she still has the darkened complexion and frizzy hair that allowed her for years to pass as a light-skinned black woman. \n \"People didn't seem able to consider that maybe both were true,\" she said. \"OK, I was born to white parents, but maybe I had an authentic black identity.\" \n Dolezal had blond hair and freckles while growing up near Troy, Montana, with religious parents. She said she began to change her perspective as a teenager, after her parents adopted four black children. Dolezal decided to become publicly black years later, after a divorce. \n The ruse worked for years until 2015, when her parents, with whom she has long feuded, told local reporters their daughter was born white but was presenting herself as a black activist in the Spokane region, an area with few minorities. \n The story became an international sensation, and Dolezal lost the various jobs by which she pieced together a modest living. \n Attacked by both blacks and whites, she was fired as head of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP and was kicked off a police ombudsman commission. She also lost her job teaching African studies at Eastern Washington University in nearby Cheney. \n Despite failing to find a job, Dolezal said, she must stay in the area because of a custody agreement involving one of her sons. \n She has sold some of her artwork and braids hair to earn money. But she said local colleges have refused to hire her, as have nonprofits, government agencies and even grocery stores. \n She was worried she might become homeless in March, but friends bought some of her artwork, which provided enough money to pay the rent for a few months. \n Dolezal has written a book about her ordeal titled \"In Full Color.\" It's scheduled to be published next week. \n Last year, Dolezal legally changed her name to Nkechi Amare Diallo, a West African moniker that means \"gift from the gods.\" She made the change in part to give herself a better chance of landing work from employers who might not be interested in hiring Rachel Dolezal, a name she still intends to use as her public persona. \n \"Maybe if I applied with a new name, people would see me for the qualifications and expertise on my resume, and not toss my application in the trash based on my name,\" she said. \n The local chapter of the NAACP declined to comment on Dolezal. \n \"We moved on long ago,\" the organization said in an email. \n But James Wilburn, a black community leader and former head of the NAACP in Spokane, said Dolezal's presentation of herself as black was troubling. \n \"Just come out and tell the truth. She struggles with that,\" Wilburn said. \n Dolezal is the biological mother of two sons, ages 15 and 1, and also gained legal custody of a stepbrother, who is now 21 and a college student. \n One of the reasons she wrote a book was to \"settle the score.\" \n \"People might as well know the whole truth of my life story,'\" she said. \"My life is not a sound bite.\" \n Race, she said, is a \"social construct\" used to pigeonhole people. \n \"I unapologetically stand on the black side,\" she said. \"Blackness better defines who I am philosophically and socially than whiteness does.\" \n It is hard for her to look toward the future, she said, when she is struggling to survive the present. \n \"I want to provide for my kids,\" she said. \"I want to get back to activism.

Bush appointee, said his job is simply to determine whether the order \"falls within the bounds of the President's statutory authority or whether the President has exercised that authority in violation of constitutional restraints.\" \n At this stage of the lawsuit, Trenga concluded, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood to succeed on the merits. \n A lawyer for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which brought the Virginia case on behalf of multiple clients, said he will appeal to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond. That court is already scheduled to hear the government's appeal from the Maryland case on May 8. \n Trenga wrote that the current executive order is substantially different from the first travel ban sought by the Trump administration, which also was blocked by multiple judges before it was rescinded in favor of the current order. \n This revised order no longer carves out an exception favoring Christians and other religious minorities from Muslim-majority nations included in the ban. It also spells out the administration's justification for the ban and does not seek cancellation of existing visas, as the original order did. \n The council's lawyers described it as just a gussied-up version of the \"Muslim ban\" Trump proposed during his campaign. They urged the judge to look beyond the text and consider its intent in the context of Trump's public statements, which they say reveal an anti-Muslim bias. \n Trenga wrote that the president's past rhetoric has become less significant given the significant changes between the first and second executive orders. \n The Justice Department issued a statement praising the ruling. \"As the Court correctly explains, the President's Executive Order falls well within his authority to safeguard the nation's security,\" spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said. \n Gadeir Abbas, the lawyer for the council, said he is thankful the ruling does not affect the nationwide injunctions imposed by the Hawaii and Maryland judges. \n \"We look forward to the Fourth Circuit and the Supreme Court weighing in on this matter, as those are the bodies that will ultimately decide whether the Constitution will protect the rights of Muslim Americans,\" he said. \n Associated Press writer Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report from Richmond, Virginia. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Federal judge in Virginia declines to block travel ban"}

Greg Walden, R-Ore., one of the stewards of the Republican health care legislation, spoke with reporters outside the House Rules Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, today, where the final wording of the bill was completed before going to the floor for debate. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin passed a waving tourist as he walked from the House Chamber to his office on Capitol Hill in Washington, today as the House neared a vote on their health care overhaul. \n WASHINGTON >> In a humiliating failure, President Donald Trump and GOP leaders yanked their bill to repeal \"Obamacare\" off the House floor today when it became clear it would fail badly \u2014 after seven years of nonstop railing against the health care law. \n Democrats said Americans can \"breathe a sigh of relief.\" Trump said Obama's law was imploding \"and soon will explode.\" \n Thwarted by two factions of fellow Republicans, from the center and far right, House Speaker Paul Ryan said President Barack Obama's health care law, the GOP's No. 1 target in the new Trump administration, will remain in place \"for the foreseeable future.\" \n It was a stunning defeat for the new president after he had demanded House Republicans delay no longer and vote on the legislation today, pass or fail. \n His gamble failed. Instead Trump, who campaigned as a master deal-maker and claimed that he alone could fix the nation's health care system, saw his ultimatum rejected by Republican lawmakers who made clear they answer to their own voters, not to the president. \n He had \"never said repeal and replace it in 64 days,\" a dejected but still combative Trump said at the White House, though he had repeatedly shouted during the presidential campaign that it was going down \"immediately.\" \n The bill was withdrawn just minutes before the House vote was to occur, and lawmakers said there were no plans to revisit the issue. Republicans will try to move ahead on other agenda items, including overhauling the tax code, though the failure on the health bill can only make whatever comes next immeasurably harder. \n Trump pinned the blame on Democrats. \n \"With no Democrat support we couldn't quite get there,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office. \"We learned about loyalty, we learned a lot about the vote-getting process.\" \n The Obama law was approved in 2010 with no Republican votes. \n Despite reports of backbiting from administration officials toward Ryan, Trump said: \"I like Speaker Ryan. \u2026 I think Paul really worked hard.\" \n For his part, Ryan told reporters: \"We came really close today but we came up short. \u2026 This is a disappointing day for us.\" He said the president has \"really been fantastic.\" \n But when asked how Republicans could face voters after their failure to make good on years of promises, Ryan quietly said: \"It's a really good question. I wish I had a better answer for you.\" \n Last fall, Republicans used the issue to gain and keep control of the White House, Senate and House. During the previous years, they had cast dozens of votes to repeal Obama's law in full or in part, but when they finally got the chance to pass a repeal version that actually had a chance to become law, they couldn't deliver. \n Democrats could hardly contain their satisfaction. \n \"Today is a great day for our country, what happened on the floor is a victory for the American people,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who as speaker herself helped Obama pass the Affordable Care Act in the first place. \"Let's just for a moment breathe a sigh of relief for the American people.\" \n The outcome leaves both Ryan and Trump weakened politically. \n For the president, this piles a big early congressional defeat onto the continuing inquiries into his presidential campaign's Russia connections and his unfounded wiretapping allegations against Obama. \n Ryan was not able to corral the House Freedom Caucus, the restive band of conservatives that ousted the previous speaker. Those Republicans wanted the bill to go much further, while some GOP moderates felt it went too far. \n Instead of picking up support as today wore on, the bill went the other direction, with several key lawmakers coming out in opposition. Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, chairman of a major committee, Appropriations, said the bill would raise costs unacceptably on his constituents. \n The defections raised the possibility that the bill would not only lose on the floor, but lose big. \n The GOP bill would have eliminated the Obama statute's unpopular fines on people who do not obtain coverage and would also have removed the often-generous subsidies for those who purchase insurance. \n Republican tax credits would have been based on age, not income like Obama's, and the tax boosts Obama imposed on higher-earning people and health care companies would have been repealed. The bill would have ended Obama's Medicaid expansion and trimmed future federal financing for the federal-state program, letting states impose work requirements on some of the 70 million beneficiaries. \n The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the Republican bill would have resulted in 24 million additional uninsured people in a decade and lead to higher out-of-pocket medical costs for many lower-income and people just shy of age 65 when they would become eligible for Medicare. The bill would have blocked federal payments for a year to Planned Parenthood. \n Republicans had never built a constituency for the legislation, and in the end the nearly uniform opposition from hospitals, doctors, nurses, the AARP, consumer groups and others weighed heavily with many members. On the other side, conservative groups including the Koch outfit argued the legislation did not go far enough in uprooting Obamacare. \n Ryan made his announcement to lawmakers at a very brief meeting, where he was greeted by a standing ovation in recognition of the support he still enjoys from many lawmakers. \n When the gathering broke up, Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee that helped write the bill, told reporters: \"\"We gave it our best shot. That's it. It's done. D-O-N-E done.

{"date": "March 24, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Keystone Steele City pumping station, into which the planned Keystone XL pipeline is to connect to, is seen in Nov. 2015 in Steele City, Neb. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump declared it a \"great day for American jobs\" today as he formally green-lighted the Keystone XL pipeline, clearing the way for the $8 billion project to finally be completed. \n In a reversal of the Obama administration's earlier decision, the Trump administration issued a presidential permit enabling Calgary-based TransCanada to build the pipeline. Appearing alongside TransCanada's CEO in the Oval Office, Trump called it part of a \"new era of American energy policy\" that he said would lower costs, reduce reliance on foreign oil and create thousands of U.S. jobs. \n \"It's going to be an incredible pipeline,\" Trump said. \"Greatest technology known to man or woman and, frankly, we're very proud of it.\" \n He said TransCanada could now build Keystone \"with efficiency and with speed\" and said the federal government was working out final details \"as we speak.\" \n The decision caps a years-long fight between environmental groups and energy industry advocates over the pipeline's fate that became a proxy battle over global warming. It marks one of the biggest steps taken to date by the Trump administration to prioritize economic development over environmental concerns. \n The State Department, responsible for reviewing the project because it crosses an international border, determined that building it serves U.S. national interests. That conclusion followed a review of environmental, economic and diplomatic factors, the department said. \n It wasn't immediately clear what, if anything, had changed since the State Department reached the opposite conclusion two years ago, other than the election of a new administration. President Donald Trump planned to address Keystone during an announcement this morning, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Twitter. \n TransCanada, which first applied for a presidential permit in 2008, called the decision a \"significant milestone.\" \n \"We greatly appreciate President Trump's administration for reviewing and approving this important initiative,\" said TransCanada CEO Russ Girling. \"We look forward to working with them as we continue to invest in and strengthen North America's energy infrastructure.\" \n But Greenpeace, one of the pipeline's most vocal opponents, said it sent a signal to the world that the U.S. is \"moving backwards\" on climate and energy, and pledged to keep fighting it nonetheless. \n \"Keystone was stopped once before, and it will be stopped again,\" said Annie Leonard, the group's U.S. director. \n The 1,700-mile (2,735 kilometers) pipeline, as envisioned, would carry oil from tar sands in Alberta, Canada, to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast, passing through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. The pipeline would move roughly 800,000 barrels of oil per day, more than one-fifth of the oil Canada exports to the U.S. \n Portions of Keystone have already been built. Completing it required a permit to cross from Canada into the U.S. \n Yet even with a presidential permit, the pipeline still faces obstacles \u2013 most notably the route, which is still being heavily litigated in the states. Native American tribes and landowners have joined environmental groups in opposing the pipeline. \n TransCanada said today it would continue engaging with \"neighbors throughout Nebraska, Montana and South Dakota to obtain the necessary permits and approvals to advance this project to construction.\" \n In an unusual twist, the presidential permit was signed by Tom Shannon, a career diplomat serving in a senior State Department role, rather than by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The former CEO of oil company Exxon Mobil recused himself after protests from environmental groups who said it would be a conflict of interest for Tillerson to decide the pipeline's fate. \n Canadian Natural Resource Minister Jim Carr said the Canadian government is pleased with the decision. Ninety-seven percent of Canada's oil exports go to the U.S. \n \"Nothing is more essential to the American economy than access to a secure and reliable source of energy. Canada is that source,\" Carr said. \n Oil industry advocates say the pipeline will improve U.S. energy security and create jobs, although how many is widely disputed. Calgary-based TransCanada has promised as many as 13,000 construction jobs \u2014 6,500 a year over two years \u2014 although the State Department previously estimated a far smaller number. The pipeline's opponents contend the jobs will be minimal and short-lived, and say the pipeline won't help the U.S. with energy needs because the oil is destined for export. \n A Trump presidential directive also required new or expanded pipelines to be built with American steel \"to the maximum extent possible.\" However, TransCanada has said Keystone won't be built with U.S. steel. The company has already acquired the steel, much of it from Canada and Mexico, and the White House has acknowledged it's too difficult to impose conditions on a pipeline already under construction. \n Environmental groups also say the pipeline will encourage the use of carbon-heavy tar sands oil which contributes more to global warming than cleaner sources of energy. President Barack Obama reached the same conclusion in 2015 after a negative recommendation from then-Secretary of State John Kerry. \n TransCanada first applied for a permit in 2008. Years of politicking, legal wrangling and disputes over the pipeline's route preceded Obama's decision to nix the project. \n The Obama administration argued the pipeline would undercut U.S. efforts to clinch a global climate change deal that was reached weeks later in Paris. \n The Trump administration has dropped fighting climate change as a priority and left open the possibility of pulling out of the Paris deal. \n Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Vivian Salama contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump approves Keystone XL, calling it 'great day' for jobs"}
