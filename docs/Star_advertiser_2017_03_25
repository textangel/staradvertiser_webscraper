{"date": "March 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Protesters gathered across the Chicago River from Trump Tower to rally against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act on Friday in Chicago. \n ATLANTA >> Americans who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act are feeling some relief at the failure of Republican efforts to repeal it, but they face new anxieties with President Donald Trump tweeting that \"ObamaCare will explode.\" \n Premiums have risen and major insurers have backed out of the state markets where people can buy insurance online under Obama's signature health care law. But people who say it saved their lives or helped them start a business want lawmakers to fix these problems, not encourage them. \n \"It does need its fixes, I totally see that,\" said Inge Hafkemeyer, 57, who credits the law's subsidies for containing her costs as her home-based event-planning business took off in Mission, Kansas. \"But if your roof leaks, you don't burn down the house to fix it.\" \n Clare Schexnyder, 49, is convinced she's alive today because of it. As a small business owner in Decatur, Georgia, she couldn't afford health insurance until the rollout in 2013. She began getting mammograms, and her breast cancer was spotted in time. Her double mastectomy and reconstruction surgery was priced at $250,000, but she paid no more than her $6,200 annual deductible. \n Then, her daughter spent a week in the hospital after her appendix burst, costing them another $6,200. They took out a second mortgage to pay the bills. \n \"An appendectomy shouldn't have to make me refinance my house,\" she said. \"It's still not a perfect system by any means, but I'm glad we have it.\" \n Schexnyder's insurer pulled out of the Affordable Care Act last year, leaving fewer alternatives in Georgia, one of the states that refused to set up insurance exchanges or participate in Medicaid expansion. \n But she objects to tweets like this one Trump sent today: \"ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry.\" \n \"They're setting it up to fail, which is irresponsible and unforgiveable,\" Schexnyder said. \n Shannon Henson, a 49-year-old unemployed conference planner in the Kansas City suburb of Independence, Mo., said the Affordable Care Act has been a good starting point. \n \"It wasn't going to be perfect from the get-go,\" she said. \n Republican promises to repeal and replace the law foundered on Friday when House Speaker Paul Ryan abruptly pulled the party's health care bill to avoid almost certain defeat. \n \"We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future,\" Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters. \n The law has covered more than 20 million people who were previously uninsured through private insurance sold on the law's marketplaces and by expanding Medicaid, the health program designed to help poor Americans. It required insurers to cover \"essential\" services, including mammograms, and barred them from refusing policies to the very sick or others with pre-existing health conditions. \n But premiums jumped by double digits this year as the cost of medical care and prescription drugs continues to soar, and the marketplaces created by the law are short on the healthy consumers who make insurance companies profitable. In about one-third of U.S. counties, consumers in the individual markets don't have a choice of plans. \n Mina Viladas, 53, of Fairfield, Conn., said she was covered under the Affordable Care Act when she needed emergency surgery. But the self-employed fitness trainer said the insurance plans are getting more expensive. \n \"The Democrats need to work on improving it, with the Republicans, if possible,\" she said. \"But I'm happy it's still where it is because it's saved me.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New anxieties as Trump says Obamacare will 'explode'"}

Keven Stratton looked on as he sat on the House floor on March 9 in Salt Lake City. \n SALT LAKE CITY >> Utah's governor signed legislation today that would require doctors to inform women that medication-induced abortions can be halted after taking just one of two pills, despite doctors' groups saying there is little evidence to back up that idea. \n Proponents of the idea said doctors can give a woman the hormone progesterone to stop an abortion after she has taken the first of two medications needed to complete the abortion. \n The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said that there is no medically accepted evidence that a drug-induced abortion can be interrupted. \n Since 2015, Arkansas and South Dakota have enacted laws requiring doctors to tell women about stopping an abortion. \n Bills are under consideration in Indiana and North Carolina. Colorado also considered a similar proposal this year, but it was killed in a committee in the Democratic-led House earlier this month. \n Arizona passed a similar law in 2015. But it was repealed after Planned Parenthood took the issue to court, arguing that the new law violates abortion providers' First Amendment rights by forcing them to repeat a state-mandated message against their medical judgment. \n Planned Parenthood did not return requests for comment on Utah's bill. It is unclear whether the organization has plans to take the issue in Utah to court. \n Republican Rep. Keven Stratton of Orem, who sponsored Utah's measure, said that the plan would give women more information about their options. \n The law has been scheduled to go into effect in May. \n About a third of women who seek abortions in early pregnancy choose medical abortions because they want a less invasive procedure than a surgical abortion. \n The procedure requires taking two pills. The first is mifepristone, which blocks progesterone and breaks down the lining of the uterus. The second pill is misoprostol, which causes the body to undergo changes similar to a miscarriage. \n Another Utah abortion law passed last year requires doctors to somehow administer anesthesia or painkillers to a fetus before an abortion, based on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain at that stage. Doctors said they didn't know how to comply with the law because it wasn't based on science. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Utah's governor signs abortion-halting legislation"}

{"date": "March 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2014 \n An ultraviolet growth light illuminated a marijuana plant in a grow room at the 3D Dispensary in Denver. \n DENVER >> Colorado is considering an unusual strategy to protect its nascent marijuana industry from a potential federal crackdown, even at the expense of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax collections. \n A bill pending in the Legislature would allow pot growers and retailers to reclassify their recreational pot as medical pot if a change in federal law or enforcement occurs. \n It's the boldest attempt yet by a U.S. marijuana state to avoid federal intervention in its weed market. \n The bill would allow Colorado's 500 or so licensed recreational pot growers to instantly reclassify their weed. A switch would cost the state more than $100 million a year because Colorado taxes medical pot much more lightly than recreational weed \u2014 2.9 percent versus 17.9 percent. \n The measure says licensed growers could immediately become medical licensees \"based on a business need due to a change in local, state or federal law or enforcement policy.\" The change wouldn't take recreational marijuana off the books, but it wouldn't entirely safeguard it either. What it could do is help growers protect their inventory in case federal authorities start seizing recreational pot. \n The provision is getting a lot of attention in the marijuana industry following recent comments from members of President Donald Trump's administration. White House spokesman Sean Spicer has said there's a \"big difference\" between medical and recreational pot. \n Sponsors of the bill call it a possible exit strategy for the new pot industry. It's hard to say how many businesses would be affected, or if medical pot would flood the market, because some businesses hold licenses to both grow and sell marijuana in Colorado. \n The state had about 827,000 marijuana plants growing in the retail system in June, the latest available data. More than half were for the recreational market. \n \"If there is a change in federal law, then I think all of our businesses want to stay in business somehow. They've made major investments,\" said Sen. Tim Neville, a suburban Denver Republican who sponsored the bill. \n If federal authorities start seizing recreational pot, Colorado's recreational marijuana entrepreneurs \"need to be able to convert that product into the medical side so they can sell it,\" Neville said. \n His bill passed a committee in the Republican Senate 4-1 last week. \n But it's unclear whether the measure could pass the full Colorado Senate or the Democratic House. Skeptics of the proposal doubt the classification change would do much more than cost Colorado tax money. \n \"It's a big deal for our taxation system because this money has been coming in and has been set aside for this, that and the other,\" said Sen. Lois Court, a Denver Democrat who voted against the bill. \n Schools would be the first casualty of a tax change. Colorado sends $40 million a year to a school-construction fund from excise taxes on recreational pot. It's a tax that doesn't exist for medical pot. \n Other items funded by recreational pot in Colorado include training for police in identifying stoned drivers, a public-education campaign aimed at reducing teen marijuana use, and an array of medical studies on marijuana's effectiveness treating ailments such as seizures or post-traumatic stress disorder. \n The proposal comes amid mixed signals from the federal government on how the Trump administration plans to treat states that aren't enforcing federal drug law. \n Spicer said the president understands the pain and suffering many people, especially those with terminal diseases, endure \"and the comfort that some of these drugs, including medical marijuana, can bring to them.\" \n But Attorney General Jeff Sessions has voiced doubts about pot's medical value. \n \"Medical marijuana has been hyped, maybe too much,\" Sessions said in a speech to law enforcement agencies in Richmond, Va. \n Marijuana activists say giving the industry an option to keep their inventory legal is a valuable idea for recreational pot states. They point out that a change in federal policy wouldn't make the drug magically disappear from the eight states that allow recreational use, along with Washington, D.C. \n \"It would be very harmful to the state if it reverts back entirely to an underground market,\" said Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, a pro-legalization activist group. \n If the bill becomes law, Colorado would be the first pot state to take action to protect producers from a federal drug crackdown, marijuana analysts said. \n A bill pending in the Oregon Legislature aims to shield the names and other personal information of pot buyers by making it illegal for shops to keep an internal log of customers' personal data, a practice that is already banned or discouraged in Colorado, Alaska and Washington state. \n Other states such as California are considering proposals that would bar local and state law enforcement from cooperating with federal authorities on investigations into cannabis operations that are legal in their jurisdictions. \n Meanwhile, members of Congress from some pot states have talked about trying to block federal intervention in marijuana states. Congress could reclassify marijuana so medical use is allowed, or it could try to block federal enforcement of marijuana prohibition through the federal budget. \n But the proposed Colorado change may be a longshot effort. \n Medical and recreational pot are the same product. The only difference between them is how they are used, and the U.S. Controlled Substances Act says marijuana has no valid medical use. Federal health regulators have rejected repeated attempts to carve out a legal place for marijuana use by sick people. \n Sponsors concede there are no promises that reclassifying all that pot as medicine would stop a federal crackdown. \n But they say Colorado shouldn't sit idly by and wait to see if the Trump administration starts enforcing federal drug law by attacking businesses that are legal under state law. \n \"This bill allows the industry to know there is something after tomorrow, whatever tomorrow may bring,\" Neville said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Colorado weighs strategy for guarding against pot crackdown"}

{"date": "March 25, 2017", "text": "INVISION/AP \n The Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles performed at a ceremony that honored Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. \n LOS ANGELES >> Laughter, music and the tapping of dancing shoes reverberated throughout a public memorial to Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher, which loved ones say is just how the actresses would have wanted it. \n There were few tears throughout the two-hour ceremony today, which honored the mother-daughter duo's impact on film, culture and those who knew them with a mix of photos, videos, and anecdotes that kept the audience laughing and applauding. \n Todd Fisher led the ceremony, which he said was intended to bring fans an intimate view of his mother and sister. He called it a show, saying his mother hated to attend memorials. \n Hundreds of fans \u2014 some wearing \"Star Wars\" attire \u2014 attended the public ceremony that featured numerous family photos and Reynolds' final interview reflecting on her life and philanthropy, and one of Fisher's high school friends sharing some her off-color emails to him. \n A troupe from Reynolds' dance studio performed an homage to \"Singin' in the Rain,\" the film that catapulted Reynolds to stardom at age 19. After an opening film that was an ode to Fisher's \"Star Wars\" role, a working R2D2 unit came on stage, mournfully beeped and parked next to a director's chair with Fisher's name on it. Across the stage, near a piano, sat an empty chair with Reynolds' name on it. \n Fisher, 60, an actress and writer who starred as Princess Leia in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy, died Dec. 27 after suffering a medical emergency days earlier aboard a flight from London. Reynolds, an Oscar-nominated actress for her role in \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown,\" died the following day at age 84. \n Todd Fisher recounted his mother's final moments and her remark that she wanted to be with her daughter. \n \"It was a very peaceful exit that only my mother could have orchestrated,\" he said to booming laughter. \"She was trained in Hollywood where they teach you to make a great entrance, and exit.\" \n Fisher and Reynolds had a complex relationship, with some years of estrangement before they reunited and became close confidantes. \n Actor Dan Aykroyd described Fisher, his one-time fianc\u00e9e, as a chatterbox who never let him speak. He described using the Heimlich maneuver on her once, and joked that if he had been on the plane where Fisher fell ill in December, he \"might have been able to save her again.\" \n He echoed a sentiment expressed by many early in his remarks. \"We really shouldn't be here this soon,\" he said. \n The ceremony was attended by several stars, including Rene Russo, Beverly D'Angelo, \"Dallas\" actress Morgan Brittany, actor-director Fisher Stevens, \"Brady Bunch\" actress Susan Olsen and actor Griffin Dunne. \n Dunne recounted living with Fisher in New York when they were both young actors, and her initial reactions to working on \"Star Wars.\" He recounted Fisher's assessment of the film: \"It's stupid and it's terrible.\" \n After the first screening, they both knew she had been wrong. \"We knew movies would never be the same, and you just knew Carrie's life would never be the same.\" \n When speakers weren't delivering one-liners \u2014 some that had been uttered or penned by Fisher and Reynolds \u2014 music and dance took over the stage. The ceremony featured a new song James Blunt wrote after Fisher's death, and the Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles performed a somber rendition of Cyndi Lauper's \"True Colors\" that celebrated Fisher's status as a feminist icon. \n Actress Ruta Lee celebrated Reynolds' philanthropy in her eulogy, which included her singing to troops during the Korean War and her later efforts raising millions to help those suffering from mental illness. Carrie Fisher battled mental illness and addiction, exploring her struggles in the book \"Postcards from the Edge.\" \n Fisher discussed her mother's charitable work in a video clip, joking: \"She sort of started what this town was going to need quite a bit of, which was treatment for the mentally ill.\" \n Lee said it was OK to feel sadness at the deaths of Reynolds and Fisher, but not to dwell on it. \"Debbie the unsinkable and her beautiful daughter would never want us to mourn,\" she said. \n Author Gavin de Becker, who attended high school with Fisher and recounted how his infatuation with her turned into a lifelong friendship, said his friend \"zoomed through time\" and made so many people's lives better. He recounted how Fisher took him on international trips and \"gave me so many firsts.\" \n \"The first time I had sex was at Carrie's house,\" de Becker said. \"It wasn't with Carrie, but she arranged it.\" \n It was one of many tales about the actresses that drew boisterous laughter. \n After the service, fans were invited to see the actresses' final resting place at Forest Lawn \u2013 Hollywood Hills, a storied cemetery where numerous celebrities, including Bette Davis and Liberace, are buried or interred. \n Many also paused to snap photos with some of the actresses' memorabilia that was displayed outside the theater, including two dresses Fisher wore while filming \"Star Wars\" and \"When Harry Met Sally,\" and two of Reynolds' costumes from \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"Unsinkable Molly Brown.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Reynolds, Fisher honored with humor, music, dance"}

In the days following the March 17 airstrike, U.S. officials had said they were unsure whether American forces were behind the attack. \n The statement issued by the U.S.-led coalition said the airstrike had been requested by Iraqi security forces to target IS fighters and equipment \"at the location corresponding to allegations of civilian casualties.\" U.S.-backed government troops were fighting IS forces in that area of western Mosul, the statement said. \n The coalition said it takes all allegations of civilian casualties seriously and a formal Civilian Casualty Credibility Assessment had been opened to determine the facts surrounding this strike and the validity of the allegation of civilian casualties. \n \"Our goal has always been for zero civilian casualties, but the coalition will not abandon our commitment to our Iraqi partners because of ISIS's inhuman tactics terrorizing civilians, using human shields, and fighting from protected sites such as schools, hospitals, religious sites and civilian neighborhoods,\" the coalition said. \n Altaf Musani, representative of the World Health Organization in Iraq, told the Associated Press in the Jordanian capital of Amman that the organization's priority was quick treatment for those wounded. \n \"It is our understanding that there was an incident and we have worked with the local health actors and they have confirmed more than 100 are dead,\" Musani said. \n Musani said that since the operations in Mosul began in October, there have been at least 5,300 people referred to hospitals in and around the city. He added that since the attack on western Mosul began last month, \"we have managed to capture more than 1,300\" cases. \n \"When you take a better look at what those numbers mean, what is worrying for the WHO and aid actors is that roughly 30 percent of the total numbers are women,\" he said. \"Roughly 30 percent of that large number are children under 15, and that is deeply concerning because of the capacities needed to treat those wounded coming out of the front lines.\" \n President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to dramatically ramp up the assault on Islamic State militants and has vowed to eradicate it. \n U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met in recent days with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Ababi and foreign ministers from the coalition partners at the State Department to explore new ideas to expand the fight against IS in Mosul. \n Earlier today, senior Sunni Muslim politicians expressed concern over reports of airstrikes that allegedly killed the civilians. Residents reported two airstrikes hitting a residential area on March 13 and 17. The Iraqi Defense Ministry has provided no immediate comment. \n In tweets published on his official account, parliament speaker Salim al-Jabouri said \"we realize the huge responsibility the liberating forces shoulder\" and call on them to \"spare no effort to save the civilians.\" \n In a statement issued on his website, Vice President Osama al-Nujaifi, himself from Mosul, described the incident as a \"humanitarian catastrophe,\" blaming the U.S.-led coalition airstrikes and excessive use of force by militarized Federal Police forces. Al-Nujaifi put the number of civilians killed at \"hundreds.\" He called for an emergency parliament session and an immediate investigation into the incident. \n Residents of the neighborhood known as Mosul Jidideh told the AP on Friday that scores of residents were believed to have been killed by two airstrikes that hit a cluster of homes in the area. Resident Ahmed Ahmed said there were over a hundred people within the cluster taking refuge from the missiles. \n AP reporters saw at least 50 bodies being recovered from the wreckage of the buildings. \n Faced with their toughest fight yet against IS, Iraqi and coalition forces have increasingly turned to airstrikes and artillery to clear and hold territory in Mosul's densely populated western neighborhoods. Humanitarian and monitoring officials warned of increased civilian casualties in western Mosul due to the increased reliance on airstrikes and artillery. \n Backed by U.S.-led international coalition, Iraqi forces launched an operation in February to drive IS from the western half of Iraq's second-largest city, after declaring eastern Mosul \"fully liberated\" the previous month. The city is divided by the Tigris River. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. acknowledges its forces were behind Mosul airstrike"}

He was shooting people on the bus. He was just contained to that location. He never exited the bus,\" Clark County Assistant Sheriff Tom Roberts said. \n Two people were taken to the hospital after the shooting, University Medical Center spokeswoman Danita Cohen said. One died, and the other was in fair condition. \n For hours, crisis negotiators, robots and armored vehicles surrounded the bus with authorities uncertain if there were any more victims inside. Meanwhile, officers swept into the casinos to warn tourists to bunker down until further notice, leaving these normally bustling pedestrian areas and a road notorious for taxi-to-taxi traffic completely empty. The Strip was shut down for blocks in both directions. \n Some in the Cosmopolitan \u2014 hotel guests out over their balconies, party people on the pool deck \u2014 saw the tense situation unfold below. \n Former NBA player Scot Pollard, who is staying at the Cosmopolitan, told the Associated Press by phone that he was at a bar at the hotel-casino around 11 a.m. PDT when he saw several people, including staff, running through the area toward the casino and repeatedly screaming \"get out of the way.\" After he was told that the area would be closed, he went back to his room, which oversees the Strip. \n \"We can hear them negotiating. We can hear them saying things like 'No one else needs to get hurt,' 'Come out with your hands up. We are not going anywhere. We are not leaving,' \" he said. \n Visitors were also hiding out inside some of the other prominent casino properties affected, including the Bellagio, Paris, Planet Hollywood and Bally, which in addition to hotels and casinos also hold restaurants, shops and attractions. \n Las Vegas Police officer Larry Hadfield said just before 3:30 p.m. that the man, who had a handgun, surrendered without incident. Police did not open fire and said they believe the man is the only suspect. Terrorism or any connection to an earlier robbery nearby that shut down a part of the Bellagio has been ruled out. No other information about the man has been released. \n By 4 p.m., pedestrians were back in the area and northbound traffic on Las Vegas boulevard had reopened while investigators worked to clean up the other lane where the bus was still grounded. \n The bus is operated by the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada. The agency said its bus driver was not hurt. \n It's unknown how many people were on the bus at the time of the shooting but it appears that those who were there were able to flee. Police have started a hotline in search of those passengers to report what they witnessed. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Gunman in fatal Vegas Strip shooting surrenders peacefully"}

Unlike the 2000s when casinos competed to lure fans of the game, poker's appeal has been weakening during this decade. \n LAS VEGAS >> When the Monte Carlo casino closes its eight-table poker room in about a month as part of a $450 million overhaul, the Las Vegas Strip will be down nearly a quarter of the tables it had a decade ago. \n Casinos constantly adjust their floors to meet customer demand. And unlike the boom years when they competed for card fans after everyman Chris Moneymaker won the World Series of Poker's main event in 2003, poker's appeal in Sin City has been weakening this decade. \n Some casinos have made their poker rooms smaller. Others have eliminated them entirely. \n \"Casinos added more tables in response to popularity, and once it became less popular, they took away the tables,\" said David Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The peak of the poker room was 2007. \n In 2002, before fans of Texas Hold 'Em began to rush to the Strip, casinos had 144 tables and made $30 million from the game. Five years later, casinos had more than tripled their poker revenue to $97 million with 405 tables. Last year, the game netted them only $78 million after the number of tables decreased to 320. \n The situation is similar across the state. Casinos had 907 tables and made $168 million in 2007. Last year, they took in $118 million from 661 tables. \n Even the game's proponents understand poker has never been a big moneymaker for casinos. That's because instead of gambling against the stacked odds of the house as they do in blackjack or slots, players wager against one another and the casinos take a portion as a fee for hosting the games. \n Casinos were willing to do that to keep players in their establishments while the game's popularity soared. The boost was fueled by the rise of internet gambling and a watershed moment in 2003 when Moneymaker, as an amateur, won $2.5 million as people watched on TV. \n The landscape drastically changed in 2011, when the federal government cracked down on internet poker and blacked out major sites \u2014 a moment poker enthusiasts refer to as \"Black Friday.\" \n MGM Resorts International, the owner of the Monte Carlo, attributes its decision to close the property's poker room to an overhaul that includes a full rebranding with the launch of a new luxury hotel named Park MGM and a version of the widely acclaimed NoMad Hotel. The company's nearby Aria and Bellagio properties have poker rooms. \n The Hard Rock Casino Hotel east of the Las Vegas Strip closed its poker room earlier this month. Other Vegas casinos that have shed their poker room since 2010 include Ellis Island, Palms and Tropicana. \n Property officials carefully choose games for their valued space and are always looking to maximize their revenue per square foot. Meanwhile, floors are generally smaller overall as casinos have morphed into full-service resorts with nightclubs, shopping areas, restaurants and other amenities. \n \"Gaming has become a smaller portion of the overall revenue mix and things like poker rooms are candidates for further evaluation as to whether they make sense or not at a casino property,\" said Brian Gordon, a principal at the Las Vegas-based research firm Applied Analysis. \n Caesars Palace, owned by the company that owns the World Series of Poker, relocated and downsized its poker room by two-thirds in 2015. But the revenue it now generates is much higher per square foot, said Seth Palansky, the tournament's spokesman. \n \"We recognized the room was bigger than it needed to be,\" Palansky said. \"You can make a lot more money per square foot with a nightclub-dayclub these days than you can with a poker table.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Poker tables keep decreasing on Nevada casino floors"}

{"date": "March 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Mary Vavrik poses for a photo in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday, March 24, 2017. Vavrik said she felt a little more relaxed after Republican leaders in the U.S. House pulled its replacement bill for the Affordable Care Act, which would have caused her monthly premiums to skyrocket. \n As the political drama over health care legislation in Washington fades, the rest of the country faces a more immediate concern: Getting insurance for next year. \n The Republican health plan designed to replace the Obama-era health law known as the Affordable Care Act would not have taken full effect for a few years anyway \u2014 and now it's dead. \n \"We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said Friday. \n That means millions of Americans will have to navigate a current federal health care system that, while not \"imploding\" as President Donald J. Trump has said, is at least in flux. \n Mary Vavrik, a 57-year-old freelance deposition court reporter from Anchorage, Alaska said she was relieved that the current health law will remain because she's happy with the coverage she gets through her exchange \u2014 even as she acknowledged that reforms are needed. \n \"It's not a perfect plan but I'm really grateful to have what I do have,\" she said. \n Prices for insurance plans offered on the public insurance exchanges set up by the health care law have soared in many markets, and choices for customers have dwindled. That's because insurers have faced sizable financial losses on the exchanges in recent years, and have responded by either hiking prices or pulling out of certain markets altogether. \n Now, attention will turn to administrative changes underway in Washington designed to stabilize the exchanges by preventing more insurer defections. \n The open enrollment period to sign up for insurance for 2018 is slated to start this fall, but insurers are making decisions now about whether to participate. What kinds of plans will be available and how much they will cost will depend on a few key decisions by insurers and regulators in the coming weeks. \n WILL I HAVE PLANS TO CHOOSE FROM? \n It depends on where you live. Choices are dwindling, but chances are at least one insurer will sell in your market. That company may offer several plans. \n Generally, big cities will have more choices than rural areas where there may not be enough customers to attract insurers. \n As of now, there are 16 counties in a region of Tennessee around Knoxville that have no insurers committed to sell coverage on the exchange next year. About a third of the nation's 3,100 counties are down to just one insurer. \n Insurers have been pulling back, and more are expected to leave, but health care researchers are not predicting mass defections. \n \"For most consumers, (2018) will look a lot like '17,\" said Dan Mendelson, president of the consulting firm Avalere. \n Customers can try to find coverage outside their exchange, but then they won't be able to use tax credits to help pay the bills, which may be particularly painful since many markets have seen prices soar. \n ARE THERE FIXES IN STORE? \n Last month, the Health and Human Services Department, which runs exchanges in many states, proposed some adjustments to try to stabilize these marketplaces. \n For example, insurers want greater scrutiny of people who sign up for coverage outside of the open enrollment period. Customers are supposed to be allowed to do so only if they have a life-changing event like the birth of a child, a marriage, or the loss of a job that provided coverage, but insurers have found that people are just waiting to sign up when they need care. \n Another proposed adjustment would let insurers design cheaper plans tailored to younger people who may not need lots of health care but want to be protected in the event of a big injury or sickness. That could be very helpful, because insurers say they have struggled to attract younger and healthier customers to the marketplaces to balance out the claims they pay from those who use their coverage. \n Those changes are expected to be finalized in the next month or so. \n WHEN WILL INSURERS MAKE THEIR DECISIONS ON 2018? \n Some have said they want to see the final version of the proposed federal adjustments before deciding where and what kinds of coverage they will offer. \n But insurers generally have to decide by this spring whether they will participate in order to leave enough time for regulatory approvals and marketing before enrollment starts next fall. \n Aetna, the nation's third largest insurer, has set an April 1 deadline for deciding on 2018. The company has already pared its marketplace participation down to 4 states this year from 15 because of heavy financial losses. \n Customers won't know for certain who is selling on their exchanges until early next fall. While insurers have to apply to sell coverage on their exchanges generally by late spring or early summer, they can drop out later. \n IS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT \"IMPLODING\" AS PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID ON TWITTER? \n No. The marketplaces are not expected to dissolve next year, even though choices have dwindled. \n While there's debate over the law's tax burdens and its impact on government budgets, the federal plan has covered more than 20 million people. \n About 11 million are covered through an expansion of Medicaid, the health program designed to help poor Americans. Another 12 million buy private insurance through the law's marketplaces, most with help from subsidies based on income. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Now what?

{"date": "March 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner arrives for a meeting between President Donald Trump and automobile leaders in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. \n JERUSALEM >> Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, has deep business and personal ties to Israel that could raise questions about his ability to serve as an honest broker as he oversees the White House's Mideast peace efforts. \n But some say these ties, which include a previously undisclosed real estate deal in New Jersey with a major Israeli insurer, may give Kushner a surprising advantage as he is expected to launch the first peace talks of the Trump era. Having the trust of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the thinking goes, could make Kushner well positioned to extract concessions from the hard-line Israeli leader. \n Kushner's family real estate company has longstanding and ongoing deals with major Israeli financial institutions. These relationships, along with a personal friendship with Netanyahu and past links to the West Bank settler movement, could emerge as potential stumbling blocks by creating an appearance of bias. \n Harel Insurance Investments & Financial Services Ltd. confirmed that it shares ownership and profits on a New Jersey apartment building with the Kushner Companies. Harel informed The Associated Press of the joint investment and said it had not previously announced it publicly. In addition, the Kushner Companies confirmed longstanding relationships with two major Israeli banks that have been investigated by U.S. authorities for allegedly helping wealthy clients evade U.S. taxes. \n \"Financial investments in Israel would seem to only further complicate conflicts of interest issues,\" said Larry Noble, senior director of regulatory programs and general counsel at Campaign Legal Center, a group that advocates for strong enforcement of campaign finance laws. \n Jared Kushner headed the billion-dollar family firm before joining the White House as a senior adviser in January. As a condition to taking the job, Kushner has agreed to file a financial disclosure report and divest some holdings that could create a conflict of interest. \n The Trump administration has faced repeated conflict of interest accusations since taking office. Although the billionaire real estate magnate says he's no longer managing his global financial interests, critics say these businesses still stand to profit from the prestige or policy decisions of the presidency. In addition, they note that Trump's children continue to manage many of these ventures, opening the door for the president to continue to wield his clout behind the scenes. \n While Kushner's role in Mideast diplomacy remains unclear, Trump has said his son-in-law will work to \"broker a Middle East peace deal.\" \n Last week, Jason Greenblatt, a White House envoy who reports to Kushner, paid his first official visit to the region, holding a series of meetings with Israeli and Palestinian officials on what was billed as a listening tour to sound out the sides. \n As the U.S. pushes forward, Kushner's family's business and personal ties to Israel have raised questions over his ability to mediate. \n \"Of course the Palestinians are not happy dealing with Jared Kushner \u2026 but they have no other options,\" said Palestinian political analyst Jehad Harb. \"Kushner and the whole new American team assigned to handle the Palestinian-Israeli conflict \u2026 have very close ties with settlements (and) it's unlikely they are going to understand the Palestinian demand of dismantling most of the Jewish settlements, but the Palestinian Authority cannot say no at this stage.\" \n Indeed, Palestinian officials appear very mindful about alienating the new U.S. administration with going public with grievances about a feared bias. And they seem genuinely relieved in recent weeks to be in contact with various U.S. envoys and at signs the administration is moving away from early positions that pleased Israeli nationalists, such as the notion of moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \n The newly disclosed deal with Harel, one of Israel's biggest financial groups, was for a multifamily residential building in New Jersey with Kushner, the Israeli insurer said, adding that both companies continue to collect tenants' rent payments. \n Harel would not say when the property was purchased, how much it cost or even give its address, though it said it was a \"relatively small\" investment. The company, which trades on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, managed some $50 billion in assets as of the end of 2015, according to its website. \n Harel said it has also partnered with Kushner on a much larger deal: A consortium of lenders that provided some $50 million to the Chetrit Group and JDS Development, two New York real estate firms that are trying to build a 73-story residential tower that aims to be Brooklyn's tallest. The loan was repaid and \"yielded a handsome profit,\" Harel said in a statement. \n \"As is known, Kushner (Companies) are experienced and knowledgeable with proven ability in deals in the rental property sector in general and in New Jersey specifically,\" Harel said. \n A Kushner Companies spokeswoman, Risa Heller, said the loan for the Brooklyn project was paid off, but she declined to say if Jared Kushner has sold his interest in the New Jersey property. Jamie Gorelick, an attorney who has advised Kushner on conflict of interest matters, referred questions to Heller. \n The Kushner Companies also confirmed having a \"longstanding relationship\" with two major Israeli banks, Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi, but wouldn't elaborate. Both banks declined to comment. \n The Trump administration has inherited a Justice Department investigation into allegations that Bank Hapoalim helped American clients evade taxes, and the bank could reach a settlement in the case as early as this year. Bank Leumi also allegedly helped U.S. customers evade U.S. taxes from 2002-2010, and reached a settlement with the Justice Department in 2014 to pay $400 million to the U.S. government. \n There is no evidence that Kushner Companies was connected to either investigation, and the Justice Department declined to comment. \n White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not answer specific questions about Jared Kushner's ties to Israeli business partners. \"Mr. Kushner will comply with financial disclosure and ethics requirements, including the obligation to recuse from particular matters involving specific parties if a reasonable person would question his impartiality,\" she said in an email statement. \n Kushner is covered by government conflict of interest laws, so he is required to divest himself of any financial interests that may present a conflict and must not participate in any matter that has a direct effect on his financial holdings. \n While Kushner has divested himself of some financial interests, the assets were put in a trust run by relatives, presenting the potential for a conflict of interest, said Noble, the campaign finance advocate. \n He said the Justice Department investigation into Bank Hapoalim is \"especially problematic\" if Kushner or the White House in any way influence the inquiry. \n Kushner's business ties are just one of the potential pitfalls to his diplomatic career. \n Trump's son-in-law was also co-director of a family foundation that donated tens of thousands of dollars to Jewish settlement groups in the West Bank, according to U.S. tax records. The family also donated at least $298,600 to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, an organization that runs educational and cultural programs for Israeli soldiers, between 2010 and 2012, according to the tax records. \n Palestinians and most of the international community consider Jewish settlements to be obstacles to peace because they are built on territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war that Palestinians want for a future state. The Palestinians also revile the Israeli military after decades of bloodshed. \n Kushner and his family also have longstanding personal ties to Netanyahu. At a White House news conference last month, Netanyahu joked that he has known Kushner since he was a boy. \n Zalman Shoval, a former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. and co-chairman of an Israeli real estate fund that counts Kushner's father, Charles, among its backers, said he doesn't know Jared Kushner personally but thinks his affiliations to Israel will be helpful in peace negotiations. \n \"There's trust. When there's trust on one side, there can also be a more conciliatory attitude on that side,\" Shoval said. \n Prominent Palestinian politician Jibril Rajoub told foreign reporters that Trump made clear to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in a recent phone call that he was his \"strategic partner\" in making a \"real and serious\" peace between Israelis and Palestinians. \n \"There is very, very positive progress,\" Rajoub said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump son-in-law's ties to Israel raise questions of bias"}

{"date": "March 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin listens at right as President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting on the Federal budget in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. Trump wants to tackle tax reform, but the loss on health care deals a blow to that effort. The loss on health care deprives Republicans of $1 trillion in tax cuts, and the GOP is just as divided on what steps to take. \n WASHINGTON >> House Republicans' failure to repeal Barack Obama's health care law deals a serious blow to another big part of President Donald Trump's agenda: tax reform. \n Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., say they will soon turn their attention to the first major re-write of the tax code in more than 30 years. But they will have to do it without the momentum of victory on health care.  \n Just as important, the loss on health care will deprive Republicans of $1 trillion in tax cuts. \n The GOP health plan would have repealed nearly $1 trillion in taxes enacted under Obama's Affordable Care Act. The bill coupled the tax cuts with spending cuts for Medicaid, so it wouldn't add to the budget deficit. \n Without the spending cuts, it will be much harder for Republicans to cut taxes without adding to the federal government's red ink. \n \"Yes this does make tax reform more difficult,\" said Ryan. \"But it does not in any way make it impossible.\" \n \"That just means the Obamacare taxes stay with Obamacare. We're going to go fix the rest of the tax code,\" he added. \n House Republicans couldn't round up enough votes Friday to repeal and replace a law they despise, raising questions about their ability to tackle other tough issues. \n \"Doing big things is hard,\" Ryan conceded as he vowed to press on. \n Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, acknowledged that Friday's turn of events made him doubtful about the Republicans' ability to tackle major legislation. \n \"This was my first big vote and our first big initiative in the line of things to come like tax reform,\" said the freshman. \"I think this would have given us tremendous momentum and I think this hurts that momentum.\" \n Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., said, \"You always build on your last accomplishment.\" \n Nevertheless, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday the administration plans to turn quickly to tax reform with the goal of getting an overhaul approved by Congress by August. \n \"Health care is a very complicated issue,\" Mnuchin said. \"In a way, tax reform is a lot simpler.\" \n Don't tell that to House Republicans who have been struggling with the issue for years. \n The general goal for Republicans is to lower income tax rates for individuals and corporations, and make up the lost revenue by reducing exemptions, deductions and credits. \n Overhauling the tax code is hard because every tax break has a constituency. And the biggest tax breaks are among the most popular. \n For example, nearly 34 million families claimed the mortgage interest deduction in 2016, reducing their tax bills by $65 billion. \n Also, more than 43 million families deducted their state and local income, sales and personal property taxes from their federal taxable income last year. The deduction reduced their federal tax bills by nearly $70 billion. \n Mnuchin said he had been overseeing work on the administration's tax bill for the past two months. He said it would be introduced soon. \n Mnuchin said the White House plan would cut individual and corporate tax rates, though he didn't offer specifics. \n House Republicans have released a blueprint that outlines their goals for a tax overhaul. It would lower the top individual income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, and reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three. \n The House plan retains the mortgage interest deduction but repeals the deduction for state and local taxes. \n On the corporate side, the plan would repeal the 35 percent corporate income tax and replace it with a 20 percent tax on profits from selling imports and domestically produced goods and services consumed in the U.S. \n Exports would be exempt from the new tax, called a border adjustment tax. \n The new tax has drawn opposition from Republicans in the Senate. Mnuchin would not reveal whether the administration will include the border adjustment tax in the White House proposal. He was speaking at a public interview event with the news site Axios. \n Republicans often complained that they couldn't do a tax overhaul when Obama was president. Now, Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House, and they see a great opportunity. \n They plan to use a complicated Senate rule that would prevent Democrats from blocking the bill. But there's a catch: Under the rule, the package cannot add to long-term budget deficits. \n That means every tax cut has to be offset by a similar tax increase or a spending cut. That's why the loss on health care was so damaging to the effort to overhaul taxes. \n Ryan made this case to fellow House Republicans in his failed effort to gain support for the health plan. \n \"That was part of the calculation of why we had to take care of health care first,\" said Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Failure on health bill also hurts prospects for tax overhaul"}

{"date": "March 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., announced that he was abruptly pulling the troubled Republican health care overhaul bill off the House floor, short of votes and eager to avoid a humiliating defeat for Trump and GOP leaders, at the Capitol on Friday. \n WASHINGTON >> House Republicans passed roughly 60 bills over the past six years dismembering President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. Other than minor tweaks, they knew the measures would go nowhere because the Democrat still lived in the White House. \n With a bill that counted Friday, they choked. It was an epic, damaging, self-inflicted collapse that smothered the GOP effort. \n \"We're going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future,\" a flustered Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters after abruptly yanking the legislation off the House floor to avert a certain defeat. \"I don't know how long it's going to take us to repeal this law.\" \n The measure would have erased much of Obama's 2010 law, eliminating its unpopular requirement that people buy coverage, ending its Medicaid expansion and trimming federal assistance to people to help pay medical bills. It represented the culmination of seven years of unsuccessful GOP attempts to craft a replacement bill the party could rally behind \u2014 a unity that ended up eluding them. \n With President Donald Trump serving alongside a Congress controlled by the GOP, the bill was the party's first genuine opportunity to repeal Obama's statute. Ryan shelved it amid defections from centrist Republicans who thought it went too far and conservatives who considered it too weak, plus solid Democratic opposition. \n Its rejection was fueled by nonpartisan congressional analysts concluding it would cause 24 million people to lose coverage in a decade and drive up costs for poorer and older people. There was also opposition from doctors, hospitals, consumer groups and AARP. \n One problem facing the GOP is repercussions from the party's voters. For nearly a decade, they've heard countless Republican congressional candidates promise to repeal Obama's statute, a pledge that became a centerpiece of Trump's presidential campaign. \n \"It's a really good question,\" Ryan said, asked how Republicans could face constituents after failing to deliver on years of promises. \"I wish I had a better answer for you.\" \n Democrats, loyal defenders of Obama's law, were literally jumping for joy. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., removed her shoes and took a victory leap while meeting activists outside the Capitol. \n Obama's statute has spread coverage to 20 million people and required insurers to cover numerous services and barred them from refusing policies to the very sick. \n Top congressional Republicans conceded the measure's demise meant it was time to move onto other issues. \n Among them was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has spoken repeatedly about how unraveling Obama's law was a top priority for his chamber. In a statement, he expressed only gloom about the effort's future. \n \"Obamacare is failing the American people and I deeply appreciate the efforts of the speaker and the president to keep our promise to repeal and replace it, \"McConnell said. \"I share their disappointment that this effort came up short.\" \n Two chief House authors expressed no taste for diving back into the issue. \n \"D-O-N-E done. This bill is dead,\" said Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \n House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said Republicans \"are moving full speed ahead with President Trump on the first pro-growth tax reform in a generation.\" \n Conveying some hope was Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, proposed health care legislation that would let states decide to continue Obama's programs. \n \"Mr. President, Cassidy-Collins is still an option to fulfill your promise to repeal and replace #Obamacare,\" Cassidy tweeted Friday. \n But there was no easy path ahead. Retooling America's health care system \u2014 it comprises one-sixth of the nation's economy \u2014 is a multi-tiered puzzle. \n On the economic side, it involves refashioning how providers, patients and federal programs should interact. And a political balance must be struck between conservatives eager to erase Obama's law and push the system toward a free-market approach, and GOP moderates wary that would strip coverage from some voters and drive up out-of-pocket costs for others. \n Earlier this month, Ryan thought he would find that balance. \n \"We'll have 218 (votes) when this thing comes to the floor, I can guarantee you that,\" he said, referring to the House majority usually needed to pass legislation. \n Ironically, the outcome hewed more closely to a prediction by Ryan's predecessor, former Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. Boehner was forced out of office in 2015 largely by the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, the same group whose opposition was largely responsible for the crumpling of the GOP bill on Friday. \n Boehner said last month that while Republicans would fix some problems of Obama's law, a repeal and replacement is \"not going to happen.\" \n He added, \"Republicans never ever agree on health care.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Epic collapse of GOP health care bill puts effort into limbo"}
