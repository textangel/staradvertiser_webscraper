{"date": "March 26, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n South Korea's ousted leader Park Geun-hye arrived at a prosecutor's office in Seoul on Tuesday. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> South Korean prosecutors said today they want to arrest former President Park Geun-hye for the corruption allegations that triggered a huge political scandal and toppled her from power.  \n The move comes after prosecutors grilled Park for 14 hours last week over suspicions that she colluded with a jailed confidante to extort from companies and committed other wrongdoing when she was in office. \n A Seoul prosecutors' office said in a statement that it wants a local court to issue an arrest warrant for Park. The Seoul Central District Court is expected to ask her to appear at a hearing before deciding on the request. \n An arrest is the next step before Park can be formally charged with crimes such as extortion, bribery and abuse of power. A bribery conviction alone is punishable by up to a life sentence in South Korea. \n Park has denied any legal wrongdoing. \n Even if the court dismisses the request, prosecutors can still indict and charge her. Prosecutors said Park's alleged crimes were \"grave,\" and that she should also be arrested because her alleged accomplice, confidant Choi Soon-sil, and other suspects in the scandal have been arrested. \n Political analysts have said that arresting Park would also boost tensions and create a backlash from her conservative supporters ahead of an election in May to choose her successor. \n While in office, Park had presidential immunity from prosecution and had refused to meet with prosecutors. \n Prosecutors accuse Park of conspiring with Choi and one of a top presidential adviser to pressure 16 business groups, including Samsung, to donate 77.4 billion won ($69 million) to two nonprofits that Choi controlled and used for personal profit. The companies told investigators that they couldn't refuse because they feared business disadvantages such as state tax investigations. \n Prosecutors believe the money Samsung gave Choi could qualify as bribes provided to Park. Prosecutors also accuse Park of conspiring with Choi and top officials to blacklist artists critical of her polices and deny them state financial support. \n Park has apologized for putting trust in Choi, but said she only let her edit some of her presidential speeches and provide the president with some \"public relations\" help. \n The opposition-controlled parliament in December impeached Park over the allegations and suspended her presidential powers and responsibilities before the Constitutional Court ruled on March 10 to dismiss her for the top post. \n Park's allegations plunged the country into political turmoil, with both Park's opponents and supporters staging massive street rallies. Three of Park's supporters, mostly elderly conservative citizens, died during clashes with the police after the March 10 court ruling. \n Park is a daughter of late dictator Park Chung-hee, one of the most divisive figures in South Korean history. Conservative supporters revere him as a hero who lifted a war-torn country from poverty while liberal critics remember him as a horrible human rights abuser who tortured and imprisoned his political rivals. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "South Korea prosecutors push to arrest ex-president"}

Jerry Brown discusses his 2017-2018 state budget plan he released at a news conference in Sacramento, Calif. \n WASHINGTON >> California Gov. Jerry Brown likened President Donald Trump to a strongman whose goal of walling off the U.S.-Mexico border conjures other infamous barriers from the past. \n \"The wall, to me, is ominous. It reminds me too much of the Berlin Wall,\" Brown said during an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \n The pointed reference suggested that the president was, like the leaders of communist East Germany several decades ago, trying to restrict the movements of people on both sides, despite all they have in common. \n \"There's a lot of odor here of kind of a strongman,\" Brown told host Chuck Todd. \"I think Americans ought to be very careful when we make radical changes like a 30-foot (9-meter) wall keeping some in and some out.\" \n Trump made extending the walls that line parts of the nearly 2,000-mile (3,219-kilometer) border a central campaign pledge. Companies seeking to build the wall must soon submit concept papers for sloped barriers that are aesthetically pleasing on the U.S. side. It's still not clear how the administration would pay for the wall. \n Brown said that although California would fight \"very hard\" against the wall, people should not expect a series of knee-jerk lawsuits. \n \"We'll be strategic. And we'll do the right human, and I would even say Christian, thing from my point of view,\" Brown said. \"You don't treat human beings like that.\" \n The governor disputed Trump's suggestion that immigration was a threat, casting it instead as an asset. \n \"Look around at many of our industries,\" he said, citing the state's multibillion-dollar agricultural sector and the technological hotbed of Silicon Valley. \"Twenty-five percent of the people in California were foreign-born. This is our dynamism.\" \n Brown, who visited the nation's capital last week to meet with federal officials, said he's willing to work with Trump and other Republicans on issues including immigration, health care and, especially, infrastructure. \n He called a proposed rail project aimed at relieving traffic congestion between San Francisco and Silicon Valley \"a real test\" for the president.

Since 1989 the bronze bull has stood in New York City's financial district as an image of the might and hard-charging spirit of Wall Street. But the installation of the bold girl defiantly standing in the bull's path has transformed the meaning of one of New York's best-known public artworks. Pressure is mounting on the city to let the Fearless Girl stay. \n NEW YORK >> Should the \"Fearless Girl\" stand up to Wall Street's charging bull forever? \n That's the question New York City officials are facing after a statue of a ponytailed girl in a windblown dress went up in front of the bronze bull early this month and immediately became a tourist draw and internet sensation. \n What was intended as a temporary display to encourage corporations to put more women on their boards is now getting a second look in light of its popularity, which has spawned an online petition seeking to keep it. \n But does keeping the girl past her scheduled April 2 deadline forever alter the meaning of the bull? After all, the 11-foot-tall, 7,100-pound bull has been hugely popular in its own right; it was placed in a lower Manhattan traffic median in the wake of the 1987 stock market crash as a symbol of Americans' financial resilience and can-do spirit. \n Some fans of the bronze girl already see the bull much differently. \n \"The bull represents men and power,\" says Cristina Pogorevici, 18, a student from Bucharest, Romania, who visited the statues this past week. \"So she is a message of women's power and things that are changing in the world right now.\" \n Holli Sargeant, 20, a visitor from Queensland, Australia, says the 4-foot-tall, 250-pound bronze girl \"is standing up against something and we see her as powerful image. She represents all the young women in the world that want to make a difference.\" \n Such shifting perceptions of the bull \u2014 from American hero to villain of sorts \u2014 outrage bull sculptor Arturo De Modica, who wants the girl gone. \n He dismissed Kristen Visbal's statue as nothing more than an \"an advertising trick,\" noting the bronze was a marketing effort on the eve of the March 8 International Women's Day by Boston-based State Street Global Advisors and its New York advertising firm, McCann. \n As for his bull, \"I put it there for art,\" the Italian-born sculptor told MarketWatch, which first reported his anger. \"My bull is a symbol for America. My bull is a symbol of prosperity and for strength.\" \n The girl's sculptor has no hostile feelings toward the bull. \n \"I love Charging Bull!\" Visbal told The Associated Press on Sunday, speaking from her home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. \"But women are here, and we're here to stay.\" \n She was commissioned to create a 36-inch-tall girl with hands on hips and chin up. \"Then we thought, this is a really big bull and we should increase the height to 50 inches,\" she said. \"But I made sure to keep her features soft; she's not defiant, she's brave, proud and strong, not belligerent.\" \n The sculptor based her work on two Delaware children \u2014 a friend's daughter she said had \"great style and a great stance, and I told her to pretend she was facing a bull.\" The second was a \"beautiful Latina girl, so everyone could relate to the Fearless Girl.\" \n Visbal, who was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, while her American father was in the foreign service, is to be honored Monday along with State Street on the steps of New York's City Hall by a group of prominent bipartisan women who are asking that the statue be made permanent. \n A spokesman for New York City, which controls public art in the area, did not say when a decision would be made. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said only that he would try to prolong the girl's presence. \n David Levi Strauss of Manhattan's School of Visual Arts, known for his writings about the impact of art on society and politics, says he is excited by the dynamics the girl statue has brought to the space and agrees the overall meaning has shifted. \n \"The girl has changed the meaning of the bull forever,\" he says. \"With public art like this, you never know what's going to happen; it's a Rorschach test onto which people are projecting their own opinions and feelings.\" \n A similar point-counterpoint was played out at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, erected in 1982 in Washington, with three soldiers in bronze added two years later, seemingly interacting with the stark marble wall bearing the names of the dead. The result prompted debate; some said the soldiers infused life onto the wall, while protesters blasted the statue as a tasteless intrusion. \n When it comes to the girl facing the bull, Strauss said, \"the bull's stature diminishes. She's the individual standing up to the beast of power. \u2026 She's frozen in a sort of dream of winning, and that's what appeals to people.

He warned that Trump is destined to \"lose again\" on other parts of his agenda if he remains beholden to conservative Republicans. \n \"If he changes, he could have a different presidency,\" Schumer said. \"But he's going to have to tell the Freedom Caucus and the hard-right special wealthy interests who are dominating his presidency \u2026 he can't work with them, and we'll certainly look at his proposals.\" \n Their comments came after another day of finger-pointing among Republicans, both subtle and not-so subtle. On Saturday, Trump urged Americans in a tweet to watch Judge Jeanine Pirro's program on Fox that night. She led her show by calling for House Speaker Paul Ryan to resign, blaming him for defeat of the bill in the Republican-controlled chamber. \n Priebus described the two events as \"coincidental,\" insisting that Trump was helping out a friend by plugging her show and no \"preplanning\" occurred. \"He doesn't blame Paul Ryan,\" Priebus said. \"In fact, he thought Paul Ryan worked really hard. He enjoys his relationship with Paul Ryan, thinks that Paul Ryan is a great speaker of the House.\" \n A spokeswoman for Ryan, AshLee Strong, said Ryan and Trump spoke for nearly an hour yesterday and again today about moving forward on the agenda, saying \"their relationship is stronger than ever right now.\" In their conversation, Trump \"was clear his tweet had nothing to do with the speaker,\" Strong said. \n The White House faces a tall task in gaining support for its congressional agenda. Trump, for instance, now lacks the savings anticipated from the health care bill to help pay for tax cuts, while expected legislation to invest $1 trillion in roads and infrastructure and to cut down on illegal immigration will likely need support from Democrats. \n Priebus said Trump was looking ahead for now at debate over the budget and a tax plan, which he said would include a border adjustment tax and middle-class tax cuts. \n \"It's more or less a warning shot that we are willing to talk to anyone, we always have been,\" he said. \"I think more so now than ever, it's time for both parties to come together and get to real reforms in this country.\" \n Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., chairman of the Freedom Caucus, acknowledged he was doing a lot of \"self-critiquing\" after the health care defeat. He insisted the GOP overhaul effort was not over and that he regretted not spending more time with moderate Republicans and Democrats \"to find some consensus.\" \n \"It's incumbent upon those two groups, the conservatives and the moderates, to come together, hopefully in the coming days, to find consensus, to present something to the president that certainly not only gets him 216 votes, but hopefully 235 votes,\" he said. \n Meadows also said he was open to a tax plan that is not fully \"offset\" so it is revenue neutral. That's a shift for a fiscal conservative concerned about deficits. \n \"Does it have to be what they would say revenue neutral, or do you have to have an offset like with the border adjustment tax? \u2026 I think there has been a lot of flexibility in terms of some of my contacts and conservatives in terms of not making it totally offset,\" he said. \n Trump left the White House this morning for the Trump National Golf Course in Potomac Falls, Virginia, returning in early afternoon. Trump also spent Saturday at his Virginia club. \n Priebus spoke on \"Fox News Sunday,\" and Schumer and Meadows appeared on ABC's \"This Week.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Blaming conservatives, Trump signals new openness to Dems"}

Dozens of arrests were reported in Vladivostok. \n Protesters plan to hold unsanctioned rallies in Moscow and St. Petersburg in the afternoon. \n Some demonstrators have showed up with their faces painted green, a reference to a recent attack on Navalny when an assailant threw a green anti-septic liquid onto his face. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Corruption protests held across Russia; arrests reported"}

{"date": "March 26, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former Hong Kong Chief Secretary Carrie Lam declares her victory in the chief executive election of Hong Kong in Hong Kong today. A Hong Kong committee has chosen the government's former No. 2 official Lam to be the semiautonomous Chinese city's next leader. \n HONG KONG >> The candidate favored by China's Communist leadership was chosen as Hong Kong's new leader on Sunday, in the first such vote since huge pro-democracy protests erupted over the semiautonomous Chinese city's election system in 2014. \n A committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites selected Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's former No. 2 official, as the financial hub's chief executive even though she was far less popular than her main rival. Lam received 67 percent of the votes cast by the 1,194-member committee. \n Her victory was hardly a surprise. China's leaders had lobbied heavily behind the scenes for the 59-year-old Lam, who will become Hong Kong's first female leader and its fourth since British colonial control ended in 1997. After the votes were counted, she bowed to the crowd and shook hands with the second-place finisher, former Finance Secretary John Tsang. \n Some pro-democracy supporters in the official seating area yelled slogans and held up a yellow umbrella, the symbol of the 2014 protests, as the results were announced. The elite election committee was at the root of the protests, with activists decrying the lack of a direct choice by Hong Kong's 3.8 million registered voters. \n Democracy supporters called Sunday's vote a \"fake election\" and blasted Beijing for meddling in Hong Kong's affairs. \n Political party Demosisto, founded by the young pro-democracy protest leader Joshua Wong, said in a Facebook post that \"this result is a nightmare to Hong Kongers.\" It said it would organize \"a large civil disobedience protest\" when Lam is sworn in on July 1. \n Lam, a lifelong civil servant, has a reputation as an efficient and pragmatic administrator, but is unpopular with Hong Kongers because she's seen as a proxy for Beijing and out of touch with ordinary people. Tsang, in contrast, is highly popular because of his easygoing persona and deft use of social media. He was nicknamed \"Pringles\" or \"Uncle Chips\" in Cantonese for his signature mustache that drew comparisons to the snack food mascot. \n Lam received 777 of the 1,163 validly cast votes. Tsang got 365 votes, or 31 percent, while the third candidate, retired judge Woo Kwok-hing, had 21 votes. \n As the next leader of the Asian financial center, Lam will inherit a city roiled by political divisions, including a burgeoning independence movement, and saddled with sluggish economic growth. Many fear that Beijing is tightening control and undermining the \"one country, two systems\" framework that guarantees Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. Those fears have been amplified by several cases in recent years, including the secret detention on the mainland of five Hong Kong booksellers and a Chinese tycoon's suspected abduction in Hong Kong by mainland security agents. \n Lam's ability to soothe tensions relies on how much public support she can gain. She lagged far behind Tsang in opinion polls. \n \"My priority will be to heal the divide and to ease the frustrations and to unite our society to move forward,\" she said at a news conference after the results were announced. \n Lam said she would not immediately revive attempts to revamp the electoral system, a potential political flashpoint that could rekindle protests by pro-democracy supporters. She said she wanted to focus on other more pressing issues such as housing, education and health care. \n \"There is a serious divide in Hong Kong, so why don't we start with the easier subjects and try to reach consensus\" on how to tackle them, she said. \n Lam succeeds current leader Leung Chun-ying, who cited family reasons when he ruled out a second term. Political analysts suspect Beijing asked Leung, a highly polarizing figure, to step aside. \n The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, China's Cabinet, said in a statement that Lam met the standards to be the city's leader, including \"being trusted by the central government,\" a key factor that Tsang's opponents repeatedly said he did not enjoy. \n When reporters asked Tsang on Sunday whether he thought Beijing had interfered in the selection process, he said he respected the decision of the election committee members. \n \"I mean, all they have is themselves and their conscience when they voted. So it's their responsibility, nobody else's,\" Tsang said. \n Members of the Hong Kong election committee include tycoons like Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest person. They represent industry and trade groups such as finance, accounting, real estate and textiles. The way the members are chosen also irks democracy activists. Some are elected by peers, but others are uncontested, especially in sectors most supportive of China's Communist leaders. \n Hong Kong lawmakers, local councilors and delegates to China's rubber-stamp parliament also have votes, and some 326 seats, mostly in the education, legal, health and social welfare sectors, are held by pro-democracy supporters. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Beijing's pick Lam chosen as Hong Kong's leader"}

Qamar Javed Bajwa, the head of Pakistan's armed forces, announced the construction of fencing in \"high threat zones\" Saturday during a visit to tribal regions along the border, saying it was in the interest of both countries. \n The two countries share a 2,400-kilometer (1,500-mile) internationally recognized border known as the Durand Line, which was drawn in the 19th century, when the British dominated South Asia. \n The Afghan government has never recognized the border, which runs through the Pashtun heartland, diluting the power of Afghanistan's largest ethnic group on both sides. \n Najib Danish, the deputy spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry, said authorities had not yet seen any signs of construction along the frontier but would move to prevent any such project. \n \"Building fences or any construction is not acceptable for us and we won't allow anyone to do it,\" he said. \n Pakistan and Afghanistan have long accused each other of turning a blind eye to Islamic militants operating along the porous frontier, and Pakistan recently closed the border for more than a month \n Bajwa said Pakistan is trying to develop a bilateral border security mechanism with Afghanistan. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pakistan to build fence along disputed Afghan border"}

{"date": "March 26, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Police operate at a crime scene outside the Cameo Nightclub after a reported fatal shooting today in Cincinnati. At least two people opened fire inside a crowded nightclub early this morning. \n CINCINNATI >> A gunfight broke out inside a crowded Cincinnati nightclub early Sunday, leaving one man dead and 15 others wounded after a dispute among several patrons escalated into a shootout, authorities said. \n No suspects were in custody by late afternoon in the shooting at the Cameo club, which has a history of gun violence, and police said there was no indication of any terrorism link. \n Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac said one of the wounded was in \"extremely critical condition,\" while a hospital spokeswoman said two victims were listed in critical condition. \n Police began receiving calls at 1:30 a.m. about gunshots at the club near the Ohio River east of downtown Cincinnati. Isaac said some 200 people were inside the club, one of the few hip-hop venues in the city, for music and dancing. \n Isaac identified the dead man as 27-year-old O'Bryan Spikes, but provided no other details. He said 15 others were injured, with some already treated and released from hospitals. \n \"What we know at this point in the investigation is that several local men got into some type of dispute inside the bar, and it escalated into shots being fired from several individuals,\" Isaac said. It wasn't clear how many people fired shots. \n Club patron Mauricio Thompson described a chaotic scene in which as many as 20 shots were fired as people scrambled to get away. He said there was a fight and people were yelling for security to intervene before the gunfire began. \n \"Once I got outside, people coming out bloody, gunshot wounds on them, some of their friends carrying them to the car, rushing them to the hospital,\" Thompson told WCPO-TV. \"It was just crazy.\" \n Isaac said the club has its own security operation that uses detection wands and pat-downs, but that police believe several firearms got inside. Four officers were working security in the club's parking lot and some tried unsuccessfully to revive the man who died. \n Cameo's Facebook profile says it caters to college students on Friday nights, when anyone over 18 is allowed in, while Saturdays are \"grown and sexy night\" for ages 21 and older. \n The club has a history of gun violence, including a shooting inside the club on New Year's Day in 2015 and one in the parking lot in September of that year, City Manager Harry Black said. \n Police Capt. Kim Williams said there was \"just a lot of chaos, obviously, when shots were fired.\" \n \"Saturday night, it is a very young crowd. We have had incidents here in the past, but this is by far the worst,\" she said. \n Referring to initial speculation about possible terrorism, Mayor John Cranley said: \"What difference does that make to the victims? Innocent people were shot.\" \n He called the shootings \"unacceptable\" and said authorities would work to find ways to prevent such violence. \n A single body was removed by the coroner shortly after 6 a.m. A federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives team was also at the scene. \n Among the injured, five were treated at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and released, hospital spokeswoman Kelly Martin said. She said two people were in critical condition and another two were listed in stable condition. She had no details on the types of injuries or the ages of the victims. Other injured people were taken to or drove themselves to other hospitals. \n Authorities asked anyone with information to come forward. Investigators were checking to see if surveillance cameras were working, Williams said. \n An Associated Press phone call to the club Sunday morning went unanswered. \n The area is mostly industrial but also home to several nightclubs with a smattering of homes. A regional airport is nearby. The neighborhood is fairly desolate at night, with the exception of the nightlife scene and 24-hour gas stations. The road where the club is located was easily cordoned off by a single police cruiser and officer at either end. \n First responders had problems reaching the shooting victims because the parking lots were full, Sgt. Eric Franz told the Cincinnati Enquirer. \n Ohio Gov. John Kasich said on Twitter that he was \"saddened to learn about last night's shooting\" and that he was offering the state's assistance. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Shooting at Cincinnati nightclub kills 1, injures 15"}
