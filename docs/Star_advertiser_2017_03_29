President Donald Trump's $25 million settlement of a class-action lawsuit that alleged fraud at his now-defunct Trump University may be put on hold because Simpson, former student in Florida, wants a full refund plus interest and an apology. \n SAN DIEGO >> President Donald Trump faces one last hurdle to ending nearly seven years of lawsuits over his now-defunct Trump University when a judge decides Thursday whether to approve a $25 million settlement with former customers. \n When attorneys reached a deal 10 days after Trump's election, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel said he hoped it would be part of \"a healing process that this country very sorely needs.\" A month later, he granted preliminary approval of the deal. \n Last week, attorneys for former customers said their clients will get at least 80 percent of their money back, based on the roughly 3,730 claims submitted. Trump has paid $25 million into escrow to settle two federal class-action lawsuits before Curiel and a civil lawsuit by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. He admitted no wrongdoing. \n The lawsuits allege that Trump University gave nationwide seminars that were like infomercials, constantly pressuring people to spend more and, in the end, failing to deliver on its promises. \n Two customers have objected to the settlement. Sherri Simpson, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, attorney, says she wasn't given enough opportunity to opt out of the lawsuit and should have the right to sue the president. \n Simpson and a partner paid $35,000 in 2010 to enroll in Trump University's \"Gold Elite\" program to be paired with a mentor who would teach them Trump's secret real estate investment strategies. Simpson, who appeared in two anti-Trump campaign ads, said they got little for their money \u2014 the videos were 5 years old, the materials covered information that could be found free on the internet and her mentor didn't return calls or emails. \n \"I would like an admission that he was wrong, an admission that, 'Oops, maybe I didn't handle it as well as I should have, I didn't set it up as well as I should have, that I didn't maintain it or oversee it as well as I should have,'\" Simpson told The Associated Press today. \n Attorneys for Trump and those suing him say the deadline to opt out was in November 2015 and Simpson missed her chance. Thirteen people opted out before that date, none of whom have shown any desire to sue the president. \n Another customer, Harold Doe, objected to the settlement because he wants more money, according to court filings by attorneys for Trump and the plaintiffs. \n Trump University dogged the Republican businessman throughout the campaign as rivals used Trump's depositions and extensive documents filed in the lawsuits to portray him as dishonest and deceitful. Trump brought more attention by repeatedly assailing Curiel, insinuating that the Indiana-born judge's Mexican heritage exposed a bias. \n The settlement was reached 10 days before a trial was set to begin, sparing Trump what would have been a major distraction. The trial would have been pinned on whether a jury believed Trump misled customers by calling the business a university when it wasn't an accredited school and by falsely advertising that he hand-picked instructors. \n Trump vowed never to settle but said after the election that he didn't have time for a trial, even though he believed he would have prevailed. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump University lawsuits face final hurdle to settlement"}

{"date": "March 29, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Zarifa Adiba, 18, an orchestra conductor in Afghanistan, plays during a concert in February in Kabul. \n KABUL, Afghanistan >> Afghanistan's first \u2014 and only \u2014 all-female symphony is trying to change attitudes in a deeply conservative country where many see music as immoral, especially for women. \n The symphony's two conductors show how difficult that can be, but also how satisfying success is. \n One of them, Negin Khpolwak, was supported by her father when she joined the Afghanistan National Institute of Music and then became part of its girls' orchestra, called Zohra. But the rest of her family was deeply against it. Her uncles cut off ties with her father. \n \"They told him he is not their brother anymore,\" said Khpolwak, now 20. \"Even my grand-mother disowned my father.\" \n Khwolpak had learned about the music institute at the orphanage in Kabul where she spent most of her life. Her father sent her to the orphanage because he was afraid for her safety in their home province of Kunar in eastern Afghanistan, an area where Taliban militants are active. \n The institute is one of the only schools in Afghanistan where girls and boys share classrooms, and it draws its students from the ranks of orphanages and street children, giving them a chance at a new life. Khpolwak studied piano and drums before becoming the orchestra's conductor. \n More than 30 girls aged 12 to 20 play in Zohra, which is named after a goddess of music in Persian literature. In January, the orchestra, which performs traditional Afghan and Western Classical music, had its first international tour, appearing at the World Economic Forum in Davos and four other cities in Switzerland and Germany. \n \"The formation of the orchestra is aimed at sending a positive message to the community, to send a positive message to the girls, to encourage families and girls to join the music scene of the country,\" said Ahmad Naser Sarmast, the institute's founder and director. \n Sarmast has experienced firsthand the militants' hatred of music. In 2014, a Taliban suicide bomber blew himself up at a concert Sarmast was attending. He was wounded and a German man in the audience died. \n The Zohra orchestra was created in 2014 when one of the institute's students, a girl named Meena, asked Sarmast if there could be a group where girls could play together. Sarmast leaped at the idea. \n Since then, Meena has disappeared. Last year, the 7th grader told the school she had to attend her sister's wedding in her family's village in eastern Nangarhar province. She never returned, a sign of how tenuous people's situation is in a country where war rages, communications are poor and poverty is rife. Sarmast said the school has not been in contact with her, but he's hopeful she'll return to the school and Zohra. \n The orchestra's other conductor, 18-year-old Zarifa Adiba, faced resistance from her family just as Khpolwak did. \n When she joined the school in 2014, she only told her mother and step-father, not her four brothers and her uncles, because she knew they would disapprove. Her mother and step-father tried to tell them about the importance of music \u2014 without mentioning Adiba \u2014 but they weren't convinced. \n \"If my brothers and uncles had known about me learning or playing music, they 100 percent would have stopped me because they had a very negative view toward music,\" Adiba said. \n Her family's opposition to music was so intense she hesitated to join the orchestra's trip to Davos. But she ended up going, and as one of the conductors she was widely interviewed in the media there and appeared on TV. \n When she returned, her uncles were the first to congratulate her. Two of her brothers are still not happy about her involvement with music but now she has the support of the rest of the family, she has more courage, and she said she is sure her brothers will eventually come around. \n \"I changed my family, now it is time for other girls to change their families because I am sure that slowly all Afghanistan will change,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "First Afghan women's orchestra tries to change attitudes"}

She said Gonzales-Mugaburo would threaten to shoot the boys or run them over with a car if they didn't obey him. \n \"It was a horrific place to live, eating on the floor, and not allowed to do anything without asking permission first including going to the bathroom,\" Moroff said outside the court. \"They lived in fear, they were afraid.\" \n Defense attorney Donald Mates said there was no truth to the charges, calling it a \"witch hunt.\" He said the accusers were all troubled boys. Some had psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, ADHD, bipolar disorder and other conditions, Mates said. \n \"When you hear an allegation of eight children over 20 years and there has been more than 100 children in his home eight is really not a lot,\" Mates said outside the courtroom. \n Gonzales-Mugaburu, 60, was arrested in January 2016, after authorities said two boys in his care reported alleged abuse to a caseworker. Prosecutors said that prompted a wider investigation, which led to additional charges involving other alleged victims. \n In addition to the alleged abuse of the boys, prosecutors also said the man sexually abused a dog in front of a child. \n Gonzales-Mugaburu has pleaded not guilty to child endangerment, sexual misconduct and other charges, and remains jailed on $1 million bond. His lawyer disputes that any abuse took place at his client's home. \n The case against the Long Island man sparked an investigation into New York's foster care system that found \"abysmal\" communication among the child welfare agencies involved. \n Prosecutors said Gonzales-Mugaburu earned more than $1.5 million over two decades as a foster parent, caring for particularly troubled boys, which entitled him to a higher income than a traditional foster parent. He cared for as many as six to eight children at a time since at least 1996. \n An 83-page report released by Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota last month outlined a remarkable series of failures that allowed Gonzales-Mugaburu to take in more than 100 children over 20 years, despite being the subject of 18 separate child abuse investigations. None of those investigations led to criminal charges. \n The report said rules intended to protect the reputations of falsely accused foster parents were partly to blame. Substandard abuse investigations were another issue. But the biggest problem, the report said, was the simple failure of four governmental and one nonprofit child welfare agencies to share information. \n Mates said he disagreed with the findings in the report. There never was any reason for the agencies to fail to uncover abuse, because, he said, it never happened. Mates also said that at least some of the alleged victims have a financial reason to see Gonzales-Mugaburu convicted because they have filed lawsuits against an agency that placed them in his home. \n A spokeswoman for SCO Family of Services, one of the state's largest foster home providers which placed dozens of children with Gonzales-Mugaburu, has said it never uncovered any evidence of abuse prior to his arrest. \n SCO said since the scandal erupted, it has worked with the state, the Administration for Children's Services and Suffolk County \"to diligently address each and every concern about the quality of care provided in this home.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Prosecutors: Foster father's home a 'horrific place'"}

{"date": "March 29, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This graph shows the trend in pedestrian deaths in the U.S. \n WASHINGTON >> Pedestrian deaths are climbing faster than motorist fatalities, reaching nearly 6,000 deaths last year \u2014 the highest total in more than two decades, according to an analysis of preliminary state data to be released Thursday. \n Increased driving due to an improved economy, lower gas prices and more walking for exercise and environmental reasons are some of the likely reasons behind the estimated 11 percent spike in pedestrian fatalities in 2016. The figures were prepared for the Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state highway safety offices. \n But researchers say they think the biggest factor may be more drivers and walkers distracted by cellphones and other electronic devices, although that's hard to confirm. \n Walking and miles driven are up only a few percentage points, and are unlikely to account for most of the surge in pedestrian deaths, said Richard Retting, safety director for Sam Schwartz Transportation Consultants and the author of the report. Meanwhile, texting and use of wireless devices have exploded, he said. \n \"It's the only factor that seems to indicate a dramatic change in how people behave,\" Retting said. \n The report is based on data from all states and the District of Columbia for the first six months of 2016 and extrapolated for the rest of the year. It shows the largest annual increase in both the number and percentage of pedestrian fatalities in the more than 40 years those national records on such deaths have been kept, with the second largest increase occurring in 2015. Pedestrian deaths as a share of total motor vehicle crash deaths increased from 11 percent in 2006 to 15 percent in 2015. \n \"This latest data shows that the U.S. isn't meeting the mark on keeping pedestrians safe on our roadways,\" said Jonathan Adkins, the safety association's executive director. \"Every one of these lives represents a loved one not coming home tonight, which is absolutely unacceptable.\" \n Traffic fatalities overall jumped 6 percent last year, pushing deaths on U.S. roads to their highest level in nearly a decade and erasing improvements made during the Great Recession and economic recovery, according to data released last month by the National Safety Council, a leading safety organization. The council estimates there were more than 40,200 traffic deaths in 2016. The last time there were more than 40,000 fatalities in a single year was in 2007, just before the economy tanked. There were 41,000 deaths that year. \n But pedestrian deaths are sharply outpacing fatalities overall, climbing 25 percent from 2010 to 2015, according to Retting's research. Total traffic deaths increase about 6 percent over the same period. \n \"We cannot look at distracted driving solely as an in-vehicle issue,\" said Kelly Nantel, a spokeswoman for the safety council. \"That discounts the impact distraction could have on pedestrians.\" \n On the other hand, \"walking is working,\" she said. \"Just as we need drivers to be alert, pedestrians have to be, too.\" \n Another factor in pedestrian deaths is alcohol. Thirty-four percent of pedestrians and 15 percent of drivers involved in fatal crashes were intoxicated at the time, Retting said. But there is no indication that there has been a change in drinking habits that would account for the spike in deaths, he said. \n More than twice as many states reported an uptick in pedestrian fatalities than had decreasing numbers. \n The problem is greatest in large population states that have urban areas where people do a lot of walking. Delaware, Florida and Arizona had the highest rates of pedestrian deaths relative to their populations, while North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming had the lowest. \n The striking increase in pedestrian deaths has grabbed the attention of the National Transportation Safety Board, the government panel that investigates accidents and makes safety recommendations. The board held a forum on pedestrian safety last year, and currently has an investigation underway to broadly examine the causes and potential solutions to the problem. \n Pedestrians \"are our most vulnerable road users,\" said NTSB member Bella Dinh-Zarr. \n People are \"more easily distracted than when we didn't have so many easily accessible, essentially, computers in our palms,\" she said. \"We look at that as an increasing risk for pedestrians.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Distraction cited as cause for spike in pedestrian deaths in 2016"}

She did not comment to reporters. The court is expected to decide by Friday morning whether to approve her arrest. \n If the court approves the arrest warrant requested by prosecutors, Park will be immediately sent to a detention facility as prosecutors can detain her for up to 20 days before laying formal charges. \n If the court rejects the arrest request, prosecutors can still indict and charge her. \n Prosecutors accuse Park of colluding with a confidante to extort from big businesses, take a bribe from one of the companies and commit other wrongdoings. The allegations prompted millions of South Koreans to stage streets protests every weekend for months before the Constitutional Court ruled to dismiss her on March 10. Park's presidential powers had already been suspended after parliament impeached her in December. \n It was a dramatic setback to Park, South Korea's first female president who rose to power four years ago amid conservatives' nostalgia for her late dictator father who is credited by supporters for pulling a war-torn country out of poverty in the 1960-70s. Liberal critics revile her father as a ruthless leader who tortured and imprisoned his opponents. \n Earlier Thursday, hundreds of her supporters, mostly elderly conservative citizens, gathered near her Seoul home, waving national flags and chanting slogans when she left for the court. \n Prosecutors say they want to arrest Park because her alleged crimes are \"grave\" and other suspects involved the scandal, including her confidante Choi Soo-sil, have already been arrested. \n In the coming weeks, prosecutors are expected to formally charge Park with extortion, bribery and abuse of power. A bribery conviction alone is punishable by up to life in prison in South Korea. \n Park and Choi deny most of the allegations. Park has said she only let Choi edit some of her presidential speeches and got her help on \"public relations\" issues. Choi made similar statements. \n The women, both in their 60s, have been friends for 40 years. Park once described Choi as someone who helped her when she had \"difficulties,\" an apparent reference to her parents' assassinations in the 1970s. Park's father Chung-hee was gunned down by his own intelligence chief in 1979, five years after his wife was killed in an assassination attempt that targeted him. Park Geun-hye served as first lady after her mother's death. \n While in office, Park Geun-hye had refused to meet with prosecutors, citing a law that gives a leader immunity from prosecution except for grave crimes such as treason. \n South Korea is to hold an election in May to choose Park's successor. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "S.

Though Congress has opportunities to block the sale, it is unlikely it will act to do so, given the Republican majority's strong support for the sale. \n The decision is the latest signal that the Trump administration is prioritizing support for Sunni-led countries seen as critical to opposing Iran's influence in the region over human rights issues that President Barack Obama had elevated. Under Obama, the U.S. withdrew approval before the deal was finalized because it said Bahrain hadn't taken steps it had promised to improve human rights. \n Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker's office said the committee was told Wednesday by the State Department that it plans to proceed with the sale. The State Department declined to comment. \n The notice triggers a 40-day \"consultation\" period in which committee staff can review a draft of the Bahrain approval, ask questions about the sale and raise any concerns. Then the State Department will send a formal notification to Congress, setting off a final, 30-day review period, during which Congress could pass a joint resolution or take other steps to stop the sale. \n Lockheed had lobbied strenuously for the sale's approval, even as rights groups and pro-democracy activists urged the administration not to jettison human rights conditions. Brian Dooley of the Washington-based group Human Rights First said decoupling the sale from such conditions would \"encourage further repression\" and fuel instability during a tense period for Bahrain. \n \"The sale will send exactly the wrong signal to the dictatorship: that the White House thinks the political crackdown is not just morally acceptable but also not dangerous, when in fact it's what's fueling the country's instability,\" Dooley said. \n But Corker, R-Tenn., praised the move and said the caveats would have been \"unprecedented and counterproductive\" for security and human rights. \n \"There are more effective ways to seek changes in partner policies than publicly conditioning weapons transfers in this manner,\" Corker said in a statement. \n Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet and an under-construction British naval base, is a predominantly Shiite island off the coast of Saudi Arabia ruled by a Sunni monarchy. Government forces, with help from U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, crushed the 2011 uprising by Shiites and others who sought more political power. \n Among the steps the Obama administration had sought from Bahrain was the release of Nabeel Rajab, a famed human rights activist who helped lead the 2011 protests. Rajab, whose trial has been repeatedly delayed, awaits sentencing on a charge of spreading \"false news\" via Twitter over his posts about the ongoing Saudi-led war in Yemen, as well as allegations of torture by authorities at a local prison. \n The State Department said as recently as this week that it was calling for Rajab's release. The U.S. has said Bahrain lacks evidence against him. \n Since the beginning of a government crackdown nearly a year ago, activists have been imprisoned or forced into exile. Bahrain's main Shiite opposition group has been dismantled. Lawmakers recently approved military tribunals for civilians while its feared domestic spy agency regained some arrest powers. Independent news gathering on the island also has grown more difficult. \n Meanwhile, a series of attacks, including a January prison break, have targeted the island. Shiite militant groups have claimed some of the assaults. Bahrain has accused Iran's Revolutionary Guard of training and arming some militants, something the Shiite regional power has dismissed as a \"futile and baseless lie.\" \n Bahrain's government and Lockheed could not be immediately reached for comment. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump admin drops human rights conditions for Bahrain F-16s"}

{"date": "March 29, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A potato plant grows inside a Mars simulator in Lima, Peru. The simulator mimicks the harsh conditions found on Mars. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Peruvian scientist David Ramirez points to a potato plant in a simulator akin to a Mars' conditions, in Lima Peru. Sprouting from dry Peruvian desert soil, hope for one day growing food on Mars is emerging in the form of a potato plant. \n LIMA, Peru >> In a lab in the Peruvian capital of Lima, a simulator mimicking the harsh conditions found on Mars now contains a hint of life: a nascent potato plant. \n After experimenting in the Andean nation's dry, desert soil, scientists have successfully grown a potato in frigid, high carbon-dioxide surroundings. \n Though still in early stages, investigators at the International Potato Center believe the initial results are a promising indicator that potatoes might one day be harvested under conditions as hostile as those on Mars. \n The findings could benefit not only future Mars exploration, but also arid regions already feeling the impact of climate change. \n \"It's not only about bringing potatoes to Mars, but also finding a potato that can resist non-cultivable areas on Earth,\" said Julio Valdivia, an astrobiologist with Peru's University of Engineering and Technology who is working with NASA on the project. \n The experiment began in 2016 \u2014 a year after the Hollywood film \"The Martian\" showed a stranded astronaut surviving by figuring out how to grow potatoes on the red planet. \n Peruvian scientists built a simulator akin to a Mars-in-a-box: Frosty below-zero temperatures, high carbon monoxide concentrations, the air pressure found at 6,000 meters (19,700 feet) altitude and a system of lights imitating the Martian day and night. \n Though thousands of miles away from colleagues at NASA's Ames Research Center in California providing designs and advice, Peru was in many ways an apt location to experiment with growing potatoes on Mars. \n The birthplace of the domesticated potato lies high in the Andes near Lake Titicaca, where it was first grown about 7,000 years ago. More than 4,000 varieties are grown in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, where potatoes have sprouted even in cold, barren lands. \n The Peruvian scientists didn't have to go far to find high-salinity soil similar to that found on Mars, though with some of the organic material Mars lacks: Pampas de la Joya along the country's southern coast receives less than a millimeter of rain a year, making its terrain somewhat comparable to the Red Planet's parched ground. \n International Potato Center researchers transported 700 kilos (1,540 pounds) of the soil to Lima, planted 65 varieties and waited. In the end, just four sprouted from the soil. \n In a second stage, scientists planted one of the most robust varieties in the even more extreme conditions of the simulator, with the soil \u2014 Mars has no organic soil \u2014 replaced by crushed rock and a nutrient solution. \n Live-streaming cameras caught every tiny movement as a bud sprouted and grew several leaves while sensors provided around-the-clock monitoring of simulator conditions. \n The winning potato: A variety called \"Unique.\" \n \"It's a 'super potato' that resists very high carbon dioxide conditions and temperatures that get to freezing,\" Valdivia said. \n NASA itself also has been doing experiments on extraterrestrial agriculture, both for use on spacecraft and perhaps on Mars. \n Ray Wheeler, the lead for advanced life support research activities at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, said plant survival in the open on Mars would be impossible given the planet's low-pressure, cold temperature and lack of oxygen, but showing plants could survive in a greenhouse-type environment with reduced pressure and high carbon-dioxide levels could potentially reduce operating costs. Most research on growing plants in space has focused on optimizing environments to get high outputs of oxygen and food. \n \"But understanding the lower limits of survival is also important, especially if you consider pre-deploying some sort of plant growth systems before humans arrive,\" he said. \n In the next stage of the experiment, scientists will build three more simulators to grow potato plants under extreme conditions with the hope of gaining a broader range of results. They will also need to increase the carbon dioxide concentrations to more closely imitate the Martian atmosphere. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Potato plant grows in lab simulating harsh Mars climate"}

The law led some businesses to boycott the state. \n RALEIGH, N.C. >> \n North Carolina Republican lawmakers and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper said late Wednesday that they have agreed on legislation to resolve a standoff over the state's \"bathroom bill\" through a replacement measure that still restricts LGBT nondiscrimination protections. \n GOP leaders announced the new legislation would be debated and voted on Thursday, but it was unclear whether there were enough House and Senate votes to pass it. And leaders of gay rights groups were incensed about the anticipated proposal and vowed political punishment for elected officials who support it. \n Cooper, who ran successfully last fall on a platform that included repealing House Bill 2, said in a release that he supported the compromise. \n \"It's not a perfect deal, but it repeals House Bill 2 and begins to repair our reputation,\" he said. \n The late-night work came as the NCAA has said North Carolina sites won't be considered for championship events from 2018 to 2022 \"absent any change\" in the March 2016 law known as House Bill 2, which it views as discrimination. The NCAA said decisions would be made starting this week on events. North Carolina cities, schools and other groups have offered more than 130 bids for such events. \n The NCAA already removed championship events from the state this year because of the law, which limits LGBT nondiscrimination protections and requires transgender people to use restrooms in schools and government buildings corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate. \n HB2 has prompted some businesses to halt expansions and entertainers and sports organizations to cancel or move events, including the NBA All-Star game in Charlotte. An Associated Press analysis this week found that HB2 already will cost the state more than $3.76 billion in lost business over a dozen years. \n The new proposal would repeal HB2 but would leave state legislators in charge of policy on public multi-stall restrooms. Local governments also couldn't pass ordinances extending nondiscrimination covering things like sexual orientation and gender identity until December 2020. That temporary moratorium, according to House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger, would allow time for pending federal litigation over transgender issues to play out. \n \"Compromise requires give and take from all sides, and we are pleased this proposal fully protects bathroom safety and privacy,\" Berger and Moore said in a prepared statement. \n Moore and Berger made the announcement after several hours of private meetings among lawmakers, with the two shuttling between their corner offices at the Legislative Building. GOP lawmakers and Cooper have been grappling for months over what to do about HB2, which the Republican-controlled legislature passed in response to a Charlotte ordinance that allowed transgender people to use restroom aligned with their gender identity. \n Cooper narrowly defeated GOP Gov. Pat McCrory, who signed the law. A potential compromise failed during a special session in December, when Cooper was governor-elect. \n Social conservatives want HB2 to remain in place, saying ordinances like the one in Charlotte make it easy for male sexual predators to enter public restrooms designated for the opposite sex. \n Anything except a full repeal \u2014 nothing else \u2014 has drawn opposition from gay rights groups, who responded before the announcement to anticipated provisions in the legislation. \n \"At its core, it's a statewide prohibition on equality,\" Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin told reporters earlier Wednesday as details of the proposal began surfacing. \"Just like we did with \u2026 McCrory, we will hold all elected officials accountable \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 who target our community by advancing this statewide ban on nondiscrimination protections.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "N.C. lawmakers announce deal to repeal 'bathroom bill'"}

In response, Tusk told Britain: \"We already miss you.\" \n May's invocation of Article 50 of the EU's key treaty sets the clock ticking on two years of negotiations until Britain becomes the first major nation to leave the union \u2014 as Big Ben bongs midnight on March 29, 2019. \n The U.K. joined what was then called the European Economic Community in 1973. Its departure could not come at a worse time for the EU, which has grown from six founding members six decades ago to a largely borderless span of 28 nations and a half billion people. Nationalist and populist parties are on the march across the continent in revolt against the bloc's mission of \"ever-closer union.\" And in Washington, President Donald Trump has derided the EU, NATO and other pillars of Western order built up since World War II. \n \"This is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back,\" May told lawmakers in the House of Commons, moments after her letter was hand-delivered to Tusk in Brussels by Britain's ambassador to the EU, Tim Barrow. \n In the letter, May said the two sides should \"engage with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation.\" \n But for all the warmth, the next two years will be a tough test of the notion that divorcees can remain good friends. \n May is under pressure from her Conservative Party and Britain's largely Euroskeptic press not to concede too much in exchange for a good trade deal with the EU. For their part, the other 27 members of the bloc will need to stick together and stand firm as they ride out the biggest threat in the union's history. \n Brexit has been hailed by populists across Europe \u2014 including French far-right leader Marine Le Pen \u2014 who hope the U.K. is only the first in a series of departures. EU leaders are determined to stop that happening. \n \"The European Union is a historically unique success story,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Berlin. \"It remains one even after Britain's withdrawal. We will take care of that.\" \n Britons voted 52 percent to 48 percent in favor of leaving the bloc in a referendum nine months ago, and they remain deeply divided over Brexit. \n In the pro-Brexit heartland of Dover on England's south coast \u2014 whose white cliffs face toward France \u2014 some were jubilant as May pulled the trigger. \n \"I'm a local church minister, and I said to my wife, 'All I want to do before I die is see my country free from the shackles of Europe,'\" said 70-year-old Mike Piper, buying a copy of the Sun tabloid with the front-page headline \"Dover and Out.\" \n Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who campaigned for years to take Brexit from a fringe cause to a reality, said Britain had passed \"the point of no return.\" \n \"I can still, to be honest with you, scarcely believe today has come,\" he said. \n But many young Britons who have grown up in the EU and voted overwhelmingly for Britain to remain a member worry about how much they could lose. \n \"I'm really anxious about it. It was a bad idea,\" said Elaine Morrison, an 18-year-old who was traveling to Barcelona with friends. \"I like traveling to other countries And it will be a trouble now. The pound is weaker so it will cost more to buy the euros, and the costs of travel will be more expensive. And there will be red tape.\" \n People in London's financial district, the City, are anxious about the uncertainty. \n \"No one knows how this is going to go,\" said City worker Nicola Gibson. \"It's a gamble, it's a risk.\" \n May's six-page letter to Tusk was conciliatory, stressing that Britons want to remain \"committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent.\" \n But there was a hint of steel in May's assertion that without a good deal, \"our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened.\" \n That could be seen by some in Europe as a threat to withdraw British security cooperation if the U.K. does not get its way. \n European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt responded diplomatically: \"I cannot, as a gentleman, even imagine that a lady as Mrs. May is using blackmail, is thinking of blackmail.\" \n Tusk said he will respond by Friday with draft negotiating guidelines for the remaining 27 member states to consider. They'll meet April 29 to finalize their platform. Talks between the EU's chief negotiator, French diplomat Michel Barnier, and his British counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, are likely to start in the second half of May. \n As in many divorces, the first area of conflict is likely to be money. The EU wants Britain to pay a bill of as much as 50 billion euros ($63 billion) to cover pension liabilities for EU staff and other commitments the U.K. has agreed to. \n Britain acknowledges it will have to pay something, but is sure to quibble over the size of the tab. May did not indicate Wednesday how much Britain would be willing to pay, saying only that it will no longer pay \"significant sums of money on an annual basis\" to the EU. \n But, May added: \"We're a law-abiding nation. We will meet obligations that we have.\" \n Negotiations will also soon hit a major contraction: Britain wants to strike \"a bold and ambitious free trade agreement\" with the bloc of some 500 million people, but says it will restore control of immigration, ending the right of EU citizens to live and work in Britain. The EU says Britain can't have full access to the single market if it doesn't accept free movement, one of the bloc's key principles. \n Both Britain and the EU say a top priority will be guaranteeing the rights of 3 million EU citizens living in Britain, and 1 million Britons living elsewhere in the bloc. In her letter, May said \"we should aim to strike an early agreement about their rights\" \u2014 but for now they remain in limbo. \n The two sides also appear to disagree on how the talks will unfold. EU officials say the divorce terms must be settled before negotiators can turn to the U.K.'s future relationship with the bloc, while Britain wants the two things discussed simultaneously. \n Britain wants to seal a new trade deal within two years, but Verhofstadt told The Associated Press there would have to be a further transition period of \"no more than three years to discuss, to detail the content of this future.\" \n A final deal must be approved by both the British and European parliaments \u2014 and Verhofstadt said EU lawmakers \"will use our veto power\" if they do not like the outcome. \n Brexit has profound implications for Britain's economy, society and even unity. The divisive decision has given new impetus to the drive for Scottish independence and shaken the foundations of Northern Ireland's peace settlement. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who says the Brexit vote means Scotland should get a referendum on independence, accused May of making \"a reckless gamble.\" \n But anti-EU politicians saluted Wednesday as the day Britain regained its sovereignty from Brussels bureaucrats. \n \"If you've been locked inside a dark and cramped dungeon and you step out into sunlight, it's going to be a bit intimidating,\" pro-Brexit lawmaker Douglas Carswell said. \"We as a country have got to rediscover the art of self-governance.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "It's not EU, it's me: UK files for EU divorce after 44 years"}

Zinke said geographic and physical challenges will make it difficult to build the \"big, beautiful wall\" that President Donald Trump has promised on the U.S.-Mexico border. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Tourists kayak through Santa Elena Canyon on the Rio Grande river, along a cliff face that is Mexico, left, at Big Bend National Park in Texas, Monday. Here the Rio Grande slides between two sheer cliff faces, one in Mexico and one in the United States, that tower 1,500 feet above the water. \n WASHINGTON >> Geographic and physical challenges \u2014 including the Rio Grande and threatened wildlife \u2014 will make it difficult to build the \"big, beautiful wall\" that President Donald Trump has promised on the U.S.-Mexico border, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said today. \n Building a wall \"is complex in some areas,\" including Big Bend National Park and along the river, which twists through nearly half of the 2,000-mile border, Zinke said. \n Hundreds of species live within 30 miles of the border, including threatened jaguars and Mexican gray wolves. The Trump administration is poised to relax protections for the jaguars, which live in northern Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States, to make it easier to build the wall. \n Throughout the campaign, Trump energized his crowds with his insistence that a wall will be constructed along the border and that Mexico will pay for it. Zinke's comments, and the administration's budget proposal seeking billions in U.S. taxpayer dollars to finance the project, offer a reality check and a possible sign the president is moving away from his initial plan. \n The complications Zinke highlighted were the same faced by Trump's predecessors, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as they sought to build or complete hundreds of miles of fencing along the border. \n Fencing that is already in place is a mixture of various designs, including towering steel bollards designed to keep both people and vehicles from moving north and shorter steel posts aimed only at blocking cars. In parts of Texas' Rio Grande Valley, some stretches of fencing are nearly a mile away from the border in part to accommodate flood plains and an international treaty. \n And in Texas, almost all of the land along the border is privately owned. When Bush tried to build border fencing starting in 2006, he faced stiff opposition from local ranchers and farmers, many of whom took the government to court on plans to use their land. \n The Department of Homeland Security is responsible for the border wall, but Zinke said the Interior Department will play a critical support role. According to the Government Accountability Office, federal and tribal lands make up about 632 miles, or roughly 1/3 of the nearly 2,000-mile border. \n \"At the end of the day, what's important is American security and to make sure we have a border,\" Zinke told reporters on a conference call. \"Without a border a nation cannot exist.\" \n An internal report prepared for Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly estimated that a wall along the entire border would cost about $21 billion. Congressional Republicans have estimated a more moderate price tag of $12 billion to $15 billion. \n Customs and Border Protection said in a statement today that cost estimates are \"premature as there are many variables that are currently unknown.\" The agency said it could not provide a detailed estimate for the project. \n Kelly told Congress in January that a wall wouldn't be a complete fix for the border. \n \"A physical barrier in and of itself will not do the job,\" Kelly said during his confirmation hearing. \"Certainly it has to be a layered approach.\" \n Zinke's comments appeared to bolster that view and followed remarks he made Tuesday to the Public Lands Council, a group that represents Western ranchers. \n \"The border is complicated, as far as building a physical wall,\" Zinke said in remarks first reported by E&E News. \"The Rio Grande, what side of the river are you going to put the wall? We're not going to put it on our side and cede the river to Mexico. And we're probably not going to put it in the middle of the river.\" \n Electronic monitors may be more appropriate in that region, Zinke said, while areas with imposing natural features may not require additional reinforcements. \n The border is already dotted with underground sensors and camera towers, along with about 700 miles of fencing in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, and it's unclear how much new fencing the Trump administration is proposing. \n According to new budget details sent to Congress, the administration wants immediate funding to complete an existing barrier in the Rio Grande Valley, $500 million to complete 28 miles of a border levee wall near McAllen, Texas, and $350 million for construction along two segments near San Diego. \n Senate Democrats have threatened to filibuster any provision providing money for the wall. Many Republicans aren't very enthusiastic about the plan and say the White House has given them few specifics. \n Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, a key budget negotiator, said the Senate is unlikely to include money for a border wall in a broader spending package to avert a partial government shutdown next month. \n Customs and Border Protection, the Homeland Security agency that will eventually patrol and maintain any new fencing or walls, has asked contractors to submit proposals for a 30-foot-high wall that is difficult to climb or cut through. Bids were originally due to the government by today, but the deadline was extended to April 4 amid questions from possible bidders. \n In a pair of contract notices made public two weeks ago, the government said proposals could lay out plans for a solid concrete wall or a structure that can be seen through by border agents. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Zinke: Border wall 'complex,' faces geographic challenges"}

Murray announced today that Seattle is suing President Donald Trump over his executive order that threatens to withhold federal funds from communities over immigrant issues. \n SEATTLE >> Seattle filed a lawsuit today over President Donald Trump's executive order that threatens to withhold federal funds from communities that refuse to cooperate with efforts to find and deport immigrants in the country illegally. \n Mayor Ed Murray said the order issued in January punishing \"sanctuary cities\" is unconstitutional and creates uncertainty around the city's budget. \n Other governments have sued Trump over the sanctuary issue. San Francisco filed a lawsuit earlier this year, also saying the order was unconstitutional. California's Santa Clara County and two Massachusetts cities with large Latino populations \u2013 Chelsea and Lawrence \u2013 have also taken legal action. \n The Justice Department said in a statement that \"the American people want and deserve a lawful immigration system that keeps us safe and serves our national interest\" and that the federal government will enforce relevant laws. \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions reiterated this week that the Justice Department would deny grant money to cities that violate a federal law dealing with information-sharing among local police and federal authorities. Sessions said the cities are making their communities unsafe. \n Murray challenged that claim. \n \"Apparently the Trump administration, their war on facts has now become a war on cities,\" Murray said during a news conference. \"Let me be clear about the facts. We are not breaking any laws and we are prioritizing safety.\" \n Under the order, Seattle could face at least $10.5 million in cuts to public safety programs, he said. \n Trump's order violates the constitution by trying to make local law enforcement enforce federal immigration law, Murray said. \n The order also makes communities less safe by forcing people underground, said City Attorney Pete Holmes. \n When people are marginalized and made to fear police, they are less likely to come forward as witnesses to crime, Murray said. \n The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court asks a judge to declare that Seattle is in compliance with the law and that the executive order is unconstitutional under the 10th Amendment and the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution. \n \"This administration has created an atmosphere of anxiety in cities across America and has created chaos in our politics,\" Murray said. \"It is time for cities to stand up and ask the courts to put an end to the anxiety in our communities and the chaos in our system.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Seattle announces lawsuit over Trump sanctuary cities threat"}

{"date": "March 29, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2016 \n The major update to Microsoft's Windows 10 system will start reaching consumers and businesses on April 11, 2017. New features in the \"Creators Update\" include 3-D drawing tools, game-broadcasting capabilities and the ability to annotate maps and photos. Microsoft also is changing its update procedures to make them less disruptive. \n NEW YORK >> A major update to Microsoft's Windows 10 system will start reaching consumers and businesses on April 11, offering 3-D drawing tools, game-broadcasting capabilities and better ways to manage your web browsing. \n This \"Creators Update\" also aims to make future updates less disruptive. \n Microsoft said Wednesday that it will roll out the Creators Update to some 400 million Windows 10 devices worldwide over time. Though there's no set schedule, devices that came with Windows 10 installed will likely get the update first. That will make it easier for Microsoft to work out kinks for older devices, which are potentially more problematic. \n Once you get it, here are five things to check out. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n WEBSITE CLUTTER \n Throughout the day, you're likely using your web browser for a variety of tasks \u2014 researching a trip, checking the news and, gasp, doing actual work. Having all those websites open at once could prove cumbersome. \n Windows 10's Edge browser now has a small icon on the upper left corner for setting aside a group of websites. Say, your deadline on a work project is rapidly approaching. Just hit the button to clear out website tabs for your Caribbean getaway. When you're ready to return to trip planning, hit an adjacent icon to restore those tabs you've set aside. \n You can set aside multiple groups; the most recent ones appear on top. When things get rough, you can scroll down to check the set of job search sites you set aside weeks ago. \n Though browsers let you bookmark sites, you probably don't want permanence for trips and short-term projects. Once you restore tabs using the new feature, you'll need to set them aside again when you're done for future access. And tabs won't sync across devices. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n DIGITAL DOODLES \n Last year's \"Anniversary Update\" introduced Windows Ink, the ability to highlight, mark and otherwise doodle on documents with a finger or stylus, provided you have a touch-screen computer. \n Updated Windows apps for Microsoft's Maps and Photos will let you do more. Though the apps are available separately, getting the Creators Update ensures you have them. \n In Photos, you can draw on photos and videos with virtual markers and share your creations with friends. For example, you can circle that guy in the background and call attention to how goofy he looks. \n For maps, you can mark a specific spot in a park for friends to meet. Technically, you can already do that with web versions of Google, Bing and other maps, so long as you're using the Edge browser and its doodling function. Microsoft's Maps app offers extras. For instance, you can have the app calculate the distance of the bike route you're tracing; be sure to first hit the \"measure distance\" icon (the one with the red diagonal). \n Ink would have been great for a new e-book feature coming to Windows. Microsoft is now selling e-books through its online store, and books open as a tab in Edge, with no separate app needed. But Microsoft says Ink is disabled on e-books because of publisher restrictions. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n IN 3-D \n Paint, a graphics app Microsoft first shipped with Windows 1.0 in 1985, is getting a major refresh. You can now create images in 3-D . \n Start by pressing the cube icon at the top. You can create 3-D images from scratch or choose an object, such as a cylinder, a fish or a person. You can get additional models from a 3-D online community called Remix and even share your creations there. You can add stickers, such as eyes, by tapping the icon to the right of the cube. \n Play around to get a feel for all the capabilities. Expect lots of trial and error \u2014 and frequent use of the \"undo\" button. \n 3-D images created through paint will be compatible with 3-D printers and printing services. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n GAMERS, REJOICE \n A game mode optimizes the computer for gaming. Other tasks can still run in the background but won't consume as much of the system resources. Game mode is on by default; you can turn it off through a new central location for system-wide game settings (individual games might still have their own settings). \n Windows 10 also gets a broadcasting service called Beam, which Microsoft bought last year. Before, to share live streaming of game play, gamers had to install and activate Beam or a competing service separately. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n LESS-ANNOYING UPDATES \n Although Creators Update is only the second major update since Windows 10's release in 2015, Microsoft has issued many smaller ones along the way. They often require a restart and can come at inopportune times \u2014 such as the start of an important meeting. Users with the Home edition of Windows 10 had no options for postponing updates. \n Microsoft says it has listened and will give all users the ability to schedule a time or defer updates for three days. This doesn't mean you can avoid updates forever, but it gives you more say over when. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Windows update will bring 3-D, game tools and doodling"}

{"date": "March 29, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Summer Zervos, right, a former contestant on \"The Apprentice,\" announced claims last October that Trump made unwanted sexual contact with her at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007. She sued after Trump dismissed as \"fabricated and made-up charges.\" \n NEW YORK >> Republican President Donald Trump's lawyers say he's immune while president from defamation claims brought by a former contestant on his reality TV show \"The Apprentice\" who accused him of unwanted sexual contact. \n The lawyers said in a state Supreme Court filing Monday they'll formally ask for a dismissal or a suspension of the January claims by Summer Zervos until he leaves office. They said the Constitution immunizes Trump from being sued in state court while he's president. \n The lawyers said their position is supported by a long line of U.S. Supreme Court cases requiring courts to show deference to the president and his schedule. \n Zervos was a contestant on Trump's reality show in 2006. She sued after Trump dismissed as \"fabricated and made-up charges\" her claims at a news conference that he made unwanted sexual contact with her at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007. \n The lawsuit sought an apology and $2,914. \n Trump's lawyers said in Monday's filing that the president denies \"these unfounded accusations\" and was prepared to show that they were \"false, legally insufficient and made in a transparent politically-motivated attack.\" They said the allegations have been disputed even by a member of Zervos' family. \n Zervos was among several women who made sexual allegations against Trump when he was the Republican nominee during the presidential race last year. Trump has strenuously denied their allegations. \n After appearing on Trump's show, Zervos said she later asked him for a job. She said they met and he kissed her on the lips and asked for her phone number. She said at a later meeting at a California hotel he became sexually aggressive, kissing her and touching her breasts. \n During the presidential campaign, a tape of Trump talking about fame enabling him to grope and try to have sex with women emerged. On the 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape, Trump says when he's attracted to beautiful women \"I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet.\" He says when you're a star, women let you. \n \"Grab them by the p\u2014\u2014,\" Trump adds. \"You can do anything.\" \n Trump later said in a presidential debate that he never did any of the actions heard on the tape, which he described as locker room talk. \n Trump's wife, Melania Trump, blamed \"Access Hollywood\" host Billy Bush for what Trump said. She said they were involved in \"boy talk, and he was led on, like egged on, from the host to say dirty and bad stuff.\" \n A Zervos attorney, Gloria Allred, said she doesn't believe the president of the United States enjoys legal immunity from a defamation lawsuit. She said the Supreme Court addressed the legal immunity issue in a case involving Democratic President Bill Clinton and \"determined unanimously that no man is above the law, and that includes the president of the United States.\" \n \"We look forward,\" she said, \"to arguing this issue in court.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's lawyers: 'Apprentice' contestant can't sue president"}

The Paterson resident is CEO and owner of Muscle Team Entertainment, a company that promotes hip-hop. \n Prosecutors did not immediately specify who was robbed, what was taken or why Thomas was charged with receiving stolen property. \n Thomas did not enter a plea during his brief court appearance Wednesday.

It said it had opened an investigation and suspended the magistrate. \n The alleged sexual assault occurred in Veracruz in January 2015. The then 17-year-old victim was standing outside a club with friends waiting for her ride when four men, all wealthy and in their 20s, allegedly forced her into a black Mercedes. Two allegedly assaulted her in the car and when they arrived at one of their homes, she allegedly was raped by a third. \n No charges were brought against the men until the girl's father started a public campaign denouncing them. They became known derisively through social media as \"Los Porkys,\" after the 1981 movie about misbehaving U.S. teens in the 1950s. \n People outraged by the latest ruling posted photos of the magistrate on social media sites, with the slogan \"Judge Porky\" and \"Don't forget this face!\" \n The Network for Children's Rights in Mexico called the ruling \"absurd.\" \n \"This ruling represents a serious step backward in the access to justice for girls and adolescent women who are victims of sexual violence, and set a precedent for impunity,\" the group said in a statement. \n Social and traditional media played a key role in getting the defendants charged in the first place. \n After authorities appeared to ignore the case for months, her father took the story to the press in 2015, along with a video of three of the men appearing to confess. The men have since denied wrongdoing. \n Weeks of social media outrage over apparent impunity for the wealthy young men followed by daily reporting in Mexico's national television and print news outlets appeared to finally force the state to bring charges. \n Many complained about the logic of the judge's ruling. \n The victim \"was not defenseless, given that she had the possibility of changing places (in the car) and thus avoiding the contact with the suspect,\" the judge said, even though the victim testified she had been pushed, had her cellphone taken away and was laughed at by the perpetrators when she pleaded with them to stop. \n \"There is no evidence of a look, a comment, an intent or a suggestion in the testimony that would prove an intention by the suspect to satisfy a carnal desire or excessive (sexual) appetite or eroticism,\" the judge wrote. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Outrage over sex assault ruling in Mexico, judge suspended"}

A White House official said her title will be Assistant to the President. \n In a statement, the White House said it was \"pleased that Ivanka Trump has chosen to take this step in her unprecedented role as First Daughter and in support of the President. \" \n Trump previously announced she was getting a West Wing office and a security clearance, but would not officially join the administration. That decision had drawn criticism from ethics experts. \n Several attorneys and government watchdog leaders last week wrote a letter to White House counsel Don McGahn asking him to reconsider his approval of Ivanka Trump serving her father without becoming an official government employee. Such a designation carries with it the requirement to follow an array of transparency and ethical provisions, including a law prohibiting conflicts of interest. \n Trump had said she'd voluntarily follow such provisions. \n Norman Eisen, who was President Barack Obama's ethics counselor, was among those who signed the letter. He said that \"for a change in what has largely been an ethics disaster, the White House came to their senses. Let's hope it doesn't turn out to be an isolated moment of sanity.\" \n Fred Wertheimer, president of the government watchdog group Democracy 21 and a co-writer of the letter to McGahn, said he commended Ivanka Trump for formalizing her status. \"Democracy 21 praises Ms. Trump for her decision, which recognizes that it would have been wrong for her to function as a White House employee and not be subject to the same rules that apply to other White House employees,\" he said in a statement. \n Ivanka Trump's attorney Jamie Gorelick said she will file the financial disclosures required of federal employees and will be bound by official ethics rules. \n \"Ivanka's decision reflects both her commitment to compliance with federal ethics standards and her openness to opposing points of view,\" Gorelick said. \n Trump had already sought to distance herself from her business interests. \n She continues to own her brand. But she has handed daily management to the company president and has set up a trust to provide further oversight. The business cannot make deals with any foreign state, and the trustees will confer with Gorelick over any new agreements.

A total of 14 senior adults were on the bus and the driver was the only person in the pickup when the vehicles collided about 12:30 p.m. on U.S. 83 outside Garner State Park in northern Uvalde County, according to Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Conrad Hein and a church statement. The area is about 75 miles (120.7 km) west of San Antonio. \n Hein said two other bus passengers and the pickup driver were injured and hospitalized. One of those passengers died at a San Antonio hospital late Wednesday, DPS Lt. Johnny Hernandez said. The lone surviving passenger was hospitalized in critical condition, while the truck driver was hospitalized in stable condition, he said. \n It was not immediately clear what caused the collision about 120 miles (193.1 km) from the church, where the members were headed. \n The National Transportation Safety Board has sent investigators to the scene, NTSB spokesman Terry Williams said. \n Photos and video of the crash's aftermath showed heavy damage to the front drivers' sides of both vehicles where it appeared the two had collided. The back of the bus was up on a guardrail, with glass and debris scattered onto the grass below. \n Hein said the small bus was a 2004 Turtle Top, though he did not know the specific model. Turtle Top's website features shuttle buses with capacities ranging from 17 to 51 passengers, which they bill as \"a great alternative to the standard 15-passenger van.\" Safety concerns have long surrounded the 15-passenger vans, also frequently used by churches and other groups, with advocates saying they can be difficult to control in an emergency. \n Church officials said in a statement on the First Baptist website that the members were returning from a three-day retreat at the Alto Frio Baptist Encampment in Leakey, about 9 miles (14.5 km) north of where the crash happened. \n The church officials were \"ministering to family members to help them deal with this tragedy,\" according to the statement.

Chris Christie, were scheduled to be sentenced today for their roles in the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Bill Baroni arrived for sentencing at federal court in Newark, N.J. today. Baroni and Bridget Kelly, former aides to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, were scheduled to be sentenced today for their roles in the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal. \n NEWARK, N.J. >> Two former aides to Gov. Chris Christie were sentenced to prison today for their role in a political revenge plot involving traffic jams at the country's busiest bridge, a scandal that sank the Republican's presidential aspirations. \n Bridget Kelly, 44, was sentenced to 18 months and Bill Baroni, 45, was sentenced to two years after they were convicted for their roles in the 2013 George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal. Both must also serve 500 hours of community service. \n They had been convicted in November of all the counts against them, including wire fraud, conspiracy and misusing the bridge for improper purposes. They had sought probation. \n U.S. Judge Susan Wigenton told Baroni he misled a legislative committee when he tried to pass the gridlock off as a legitimate traffic study and later misled the jury with the same contention. \n \"It was completely intended to wreak havoc,\" she said. \"It only served a punitive purpose. You clearly knew, and know today, that it was not\" legitimate. \n Kelly, who sent the infamous \"time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\" email, wiped her eyes with a tissue when she was sentenced after Baroni and apologized, saying she never intended to cause harm. \n \"I accept responsibility for the tone of my emails and texts,\" she said. \"My emails and texts were disrespectful and I am absolutely embarrassed by them. They don't reflect who I am.\" \n The government's star witness, David Wildstein, testified that he and the co-defendants had sought to retaliate against the Democratic mayor of nearby Fort Lee for not endorsing Christie's re-election. Fort Lee was plunged into gridlock for four days in September 2013. Text messages and emails produced at trial showed Mayor Mark Sokolich's increasingly desperate pleas for help being ignored by Kelly and Baroni. \n \"I let a lot of people down who believed in me and relied on me. Most of all I let Mark Sokolich down. That was my choice and my responsibility. And I made the wrong choice,\" Baroni told the judge. \n \"I was wrong and I am truly sorry, and I've waited three years to say that,\" he said. \n Sokolich said that the sentence was fair and that he hopes Baroni \"gets through things and resumes his life\" after he serves his term. \n \"I'm not a grudge kind of guy. It's not really in my DNA,\" he said. \"I will tell you I've moved on with this. My responsibility is to the taxpayers of Fort Lee. To devote my energies to venom and dislike, it's not my style.\" \n Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes said that Baroni's time as a state lawmaker, lawyer and school teacher gave him the experience and judgment to conduct himself ethically. \n \"But when Bill Baroni was put to the test and made a choice, he chose to abuse his official power. And then he chose to lie about it,\" Cortes said, calling Baroni's conduct \"brazen, calculated, and a mean-spirited abuse of power\" that had \"real-life consequences on the people he was supposed to serve.\" \n The scandal derailed Christie's presidential aspirations and likely cost him a chance to be President Donald Trump's running mate. While the sentencing was happening today, Christie was at the White House to launch a drug addiction task force. \n Questions remain over when, and how much, Christie knew about the plan to realign access lanes from Fort Lee to the bridge's upper level. The bi-level bridge is considered the busiest in the country. \n At the time of the traffic jams, Kelly was Christie's deputy chief of staff and Baroni was his appointee to the Port Authority, overseeing Wildstein as deputy executive director. Baroni testified that Wildstein was viewed as Christie's enforcer, and several Port Authority officials testified that he was almost universally disliked at the agency. \n Wildstein, a former political blogger and classmate of Christie's, was hired as the director of interstate capital projects at the powerful Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the bridge. The position was created for Wildstein, according to testimony. \n Christie was not charged with any wrongdoing. But his version of events \u2014 that he was not aware that anyone in his office was involved until months after the fact \u2014 was contradicted by testimony from Baroni, Kelly and Wildstein. \n In addition to focusing on dozens of text messages and emails exchanged between the co-conspirators, testimony at the trial painted an unflattering portrait of the Christie administration's modus operandi. \n Christie was described as cursing and throwing a water bottle at Kelly over an apparently innocent question and another time leaving a profane and threatening voicemail for a county officeholder who had angered him. \n Wildstein testified that Christie's subordinates used the Port Authority, the bistate agency that oversees huge chunks of New York's transportation and commerce infrastructure, as a source of political favors for Democratic politicians whose endorsements he sought. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "2 former Christie aides get prison for bridge revenge plot"}

{"date": "March 29, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Federal Police soldiers gesture to other soldiers near the old city, during fighting against Islamic State militants on the western side of in Mosul, Iraq, Tuesday, March 28, 2017. \n WASHINGTON >> U.S. airstrikes probably played a role in the death of dozens of civilians in Mosul earlier this month, but an ongoing investigation may reveal a more complicated explanation, the top commander of American forces in Iraq said Tuesday. One possibility is that Islamic State militants rigged the building with explosives. \n Speaking from Baghdad to reporters at the Pentagon, Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend said a recent spate of civilian casualties in Mosul was \"fairly predictable\" given the densely populated urban neighborhoods that Islamic State fighters are defending against Iraqi government troops. \n The civilian deaths cannot be attributed to any loosening of American military rules of combat, he said, and Washington hasn't decided to tolerate greater risk of civilian casualties in U.S. airstrikes. \n Witnesses say the March 17 explosions may have killed at least 100 people. And Amnesty International on Tuesday said the rising death toll suggested the U.S.-led coalition isn't taking adequate precautions as it helps Iraqi forces try to retake the city. The Pentagon arranged a short-notice briefing by Townsend amid the growing chorus of criticism. \n Defending U.S. precautions against civilian deaths, Townsend acknowledged the U.S. conducted multiple airstrikes in the area of the explosions. Coupled with initial inquiries done by U.S. technical experts who visited the scene, he said: \"My initial assessment is that we probably had a role in these casualties.\" \n But Townsend said the type of munitions used by the U.S. in the airstrikes should not have been able to bring down the entire building, raising questions about the level of the American involvement. \n U.S. officials also are assessing the possibility that IS forced civilians to gather there to act as human shields or to lure the U.S. into attacking, he added. \n \"It sure looks like they were,\" Townsend said. Another possibility he said was being examined: That IS filled the building with explosives. \n In the most extensive U.S. explanation of what is known about the event, Townsend stressed that no one should think it was a deliberate U.S. act. \n \"If we did it \u2014 and I'd say there is at least a fair chance we did \u2014 it was an unintentional accident of war,\" he said. \n The fight for western Mosul began in December after Iraqi security forces pushed IS out of the eastern side of the Tigris River city. In recent weeks, IS defenders have packed into neighborhoods with narrow streets and trapped civilians, Townsend said. \n \"It is there that the enemy has invested two-and-a-half years of defensive preparations,\" he said. \"It is there that the fighting has gotten extraordinarily brutal.\" He called it the \"toughest phase\" of the war. \n \"I think that's really the explanation for the civilian casualties,\" Townsend added. \"Civilians are there. Some of them have been able to escape. Those that have not been able to escape are held against their will\" or are afraid to try to leave. \n \"Although our partners and the coalition have made mistakes that harmed civilians, we have never targeted them \u2014 not once,\" he said. \n Townsend also said he believes U.S. airstrikes are not to blame in a separate instance of alleged civilian casualties, in Syria. A leading Syrian opposition group, the Syrian National Coalition, has said it believes coalition forces were behind an airstrike March 21 alleged to have killed at least 30 civilians in a school outside of Raqqa, Syria. \n \"I think that was a clean strike,\" Townsend said, adding that the allegation that those targeted in the building were civilians is \"going to play out to be unfounded.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Commander says U.S. may have played role in Mosul deaths"}

They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the business arrangement openly. \n In his newspaper ads responding to the AP's story, Deripaska said he never signed \"a $10 million contract 'to greatly benefit the Putin Government' with Paul Manafort.\" \n \"I have never made any commitments or contracts with the obligation or purpose to covertly promote or advance 'Putin's Government' interests anywhere in the world,\" Deripaska wrote. \n The AP's story said that Manafort wrote a strategy memo proposing that the work he would do for Deripaska would \"benefit the Putin Government,\" not that the contract contained that language. \n \"This AP Exclusive report falls into the negative context of current US-Russian relations and causes fresh unfair and unjustified concerns and alarm in the US Congress about Russian involvement in US domestic affairs,\" Deripaska's ad says. \n The AP stands by its reporting, spokeswoman Lauren Easton said. \n The revelations about Manafort come as Trump campaign advisers are the subject of an FBI probe and two congressional investigations, and they appear to guarantee that Manafort will be sought as a key witness in upcoming hearings. He has volunteered to appear. \n Investigators are reviewing whether the Trump campaign and its associates coordinated with Moscow to meddle in the 2016 campaign. Manafort has dismissed the investigations as politically motivated and misguided. The documents obtained by AP show Manafort's ties to Russia were closer than previously revealed. \n Deripaska is one of Russia's wealthiest men. He amassed his fortune under Putin and has bought assets abroad in ways widely perceived to benefit the Kremlin's interests. U.S. diplomatic cables from 2006 described him as \"among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis\" and \"a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin's trips abroad.\" \n A spokesman for Manafort has confirmed that Manafort worked for Deripaska representing him on business and personal matters, but has denied that the work involved \"representing Russia's political interests.\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said last week that Trump was not aware of Manafort's work for Deripaska a decade ago. \n The AP reported last week that Manafort proposed an ambitious political strategy in a June 2005 memo that was based on work he had done in Ukraine. Manafort described how his plan could be used to influence politics, business deals and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and former Soviet republics to the benefit of the Russian government. \n \"We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success,\" Manafort wrote in the 2005 memo to Deripaska. The effort, Manafort wrote, \"will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government.\" \n Manafort wrote that the plan would bolster the legitimacy of governments friendly to Putin and undercut anti-Russian figures through political influence campaigns, nonprofit front groups and media operations. \n The $10 million contract Manafort signed in 2006 outlined the political and communications activities in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Georgia in more detail, but the AP noted last week that the work actually performed is unclear. \n Manafort and Deripaska had a falling out laid bare in 2014 in a Cayman Islands court. The dispute involved a nearly $19 million investment that Manafort was orchestrating for Deripaska in a Ukrainian TV company called Black Sea Cable, according to legal filings by Deripaska's representatives. \n In the filing, Deripaska accused Manafort and his associates of taking the money and then failing to respond to his queries about how the funds had been used. \n Early in the 2016 presidential campaign, Deripaska's representatives openly accused Manafort of fraud and pledged to recover the money from him. After Trump earned the presidential nomination, Deripaska's representatives said they would no longer discuss the case. \n Last week, Deripaska wrote in a statement to the AP that \"there was an agreement between Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Manafort to provide investment consulting services related to business interests of Mr. Deripaska, which now is a subject to legal claims.\" \n ___ \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Russian Manafort client: Willing to speak to Congress"}
