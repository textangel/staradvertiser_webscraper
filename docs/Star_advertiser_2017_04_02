{"date": "April 2, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump's White House senior adviser Jared Kushner has played the role of shadow diplomat, advising on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. \n NEW YORK >> President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, is visiting Iraq with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, an official said tonight. \n Details about the trip to the Middle East with Gen. Joseph Dunford were not released. A senior administration official said Kushner wanted to see the situation in Iraq for himself and show support for the Iraqi government. The official wasn't authorized to speak about confidential meetings by name and demanded anonymity. \n Kushner's West Wing portfolio is robust. He has been deeply involved with presidential staffing, recently launched a task force meant to modernize government using lessons drawn from the private sector, and has played the role of shadow diplomat, advising on relations with the Middle East, Canada and Mexico. \n And though Kushner had no previous diplomatic or government experience, Trump also tasked him with trying to broker a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. \n \"If you can't produce peace in the Middle East, nobody can,\" Trump told Kushner at a gala a few days before his inauguration. \n Kushner was also the latest Trump associate to be swept up into the ongoing probe into contacts with Russian officials. The White House confirmed last week that he had volunteered to be interviewed by the Senate intelligence committee. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the committee's chairman, said that Kushner would likely be under oath and would submit to a \"private interview\" about arranging meetings with the Russian ambassador and other officials. \n Kushner is married to Trump's oldest daughter, Ivanka. He was expected to have a major role in meetings later this week between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Trump's winter retreat in Florida. \n The Iraq trip was first reported by The New York Times. \n Kushner's trip began against a backdrop of an ongoing investigation into civilian deaths in an area of Mosul near the site of an air-strike by U.S.-led coalition forces last month. \n His visit marked an early foray for the Trump administration into the situation in Iraq and came just two weeks after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said he was assured by the president the U.S. will accelerate its support for his country's struggle against the Islamic State group. \n Al-Abadi met with Trump and Kushner in Washington last month and said he had the impression that the Trump administration would take a more aggressive approach, although he did not say what that might entail. \n Defense Secretary Jim Mattis recently presented Trump with the outlines of a comprehensive approach to defeating IS and other extremist groups on a global scale, but specifics have yet to be worked out. Officials have indicated that the approach is unlikely to depart radically from the Obama administration's strategy, at least with regard to ongoing efforts in Iraq and Syria. \n Iraq was part of the Trump administration's original travel ban but was removed from the revised version after a request from the Pentagon and the State Department highlighting Iraq's key role in fighting the Islamic State. The second travel ban, which restrictions immigration from six Muslim-majority countries, has been halted by a federal court. The U.S. Justice Department has announced an appeal. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Official: Trump senior adviser Kushner travels to Iraq"}

{"date": "April 2, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Winemaker Orestes Estevez posed among dozens of wine jugs at his house in Havana. Estevez and his family fill the glass jugs with grapes, ginger and hibiscus, then slip a condom over each glass neck to start the unusual process of winemaking in a land famed for rum. \n HAVANA >> The sweet smell of fermenting fruit fills the streets around the modest Havana home where Orestes Estevez and his family fill glass jugs with grapes, ginger and hibiscus, then slip a condom over each glass neck to start the unusual process of winemaking in a land famed for rum. \n From origins as an illicit backyard still, Cuba's \"El Canal\" winery has become a flourishing business that annually produces thousands of gallons of wine flavored with guava, watercress and beets. \n Estevez, 65, has made wine for decades. After a career in the military and security services he legalized his business and opened a tiny winery in 2000 as communist Cuba took the first steps toward allowing private enterprise. \n Today, Estevez, his wife, son and an assistant tend to 300 jugs containing five gallons (20 liters) of wine apiece. The main ingredient is Cuban grapes, but added flavors include tropical fruits and vegetables of virtually every variety. \n The winery has become a neighborhood attraction, with residents of the El Cerro neighborhood sitting on the curb at all hours sipping Estevez's wine from green glasses. \n The most remarkable sight, however, are hundreds of bottles capped with condoms that slowly inflate as the fruity mix ferments and produces gases. When the fermentation is over and there are no more gases, the condom stops inflating and falls, and the wine is ready for bottling. \n \"Putting a condom on a bottle is just like with a man,\" Estevez said. \"It stands up, the wine is ready, and then the process is completed.\" \n All told, it takes a month to 45 days to produce a jar of wine. Estevez's product is bottled and sold for consumption in homes and restaurants, with sales at an average of 50 bottles a day for 10 Cuban pesos (40 cents) apiece. It's an accessible pleasure for Cubans who earn an average of $25 a month and can't afford imported wine that sells for at least half of that, and often many times more, in state-run liquor stores. \n Thanks to a U.S. trade embargo and the inefficiencies of Cuba's centrally-planned economy, thousands of products are near-impossible to find on the island. That forces Cubans to make do with what they have, and condoms have been put to many new uses. \n Dozens of fishermen inflate them and use them off Havana's seaside promenade, or Malecon, where the improvised floats carry bait far out to sea and increase its resistance against tugging fish. In the case of Estevez's business and dozens of smaller home wineries across Cuba, the condoms are pricked with a pin once or twice to allow the slow release of gas and replace the sophisticated valves used to trap and release pressure in more technologically advanced winemaking operations. \n Angel Garcia, a 43-year-old state auditor, said he used to buy homemade wine of dubious quality from an acquaintance in Havana's Vedado neighborhood, but Estevez had won his business. \n \"I like coming here a lot,\" Garcia said. \"I earn $16 a month and I'm not going to spend it buying wine from the store.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Cuban uses condoms, tropical fruit to make own brand of wine"}

{"date": "April 2, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Presidential candidate Lenin Moreno, left, and his running mate Jorge Glas. \n QUITO, Ecuador >> Ruling party candidate Lenin Moreno looked headed to victory in Ecuador's presidential runoff today but his rival refused to recognize the results, claiming he was the victim of fraud in what could set the stage for protests. \n The election in the small Andean nation of 16 million was being watched closely for whether it marked a comeback for leftist candidates after a string of right-wing victories across Latin America, \n With almost 96 percent of voting acts counted, the National Electoral Council said Moreno had 51 percent of the vote to banker Guillermo Lasso's 49 percent. A difference of 214,000 votes separated the two candidates with about twice the number of votes still left to count. \n Lasso demanded a recount after three exit polls showed him winning. He also questioned why results that took three days to calculate following the first round of voting in February were announced so quickly in today's runoff. \n \"This is very sickening. We're not going to allow it,\" said Lasso, who called on supporters to protest the results peacefully but firmly. \n \"They've crossed a line, which is pretending to abuse the people's will\" and install an \"illegitimate\" government, Lasso said. \n So far the only evidence of possible fraud presented by Lasso's campaign are the results in one tiny provincial voting center that it said were reversed when they were reported to electoral authorities in Quito \n Thousands of outraged Lasso supporters shouting \"fraud\" broke through metal barricades and almost reached the entrance of the electoral council's headquarters in Quito before being pushed back by police. A similar scuffle took place outside the electoral offices in Guayaquil. \n Moreno supporters celebrated and accused their opponents of trying to disavow results. The head of the electoral council, a favorite punching bag of the opposition, appealed for calm. \n \"Ecuador deserves that its political actors show ethical responsibility in recognizing the democratic will expressed by the people at the voting booths,\" said National Electoral President Juan Pablo Pozo. \"Not a single vote has been given or taken away from anyone.\" \n Three exit polls, including one that accurately predicted the first-round results, showed Lasso winning by as much as six percentage points. A quick count of voting acts by a respected local watchdog found there was a technical tie with a difference of less than 0.6 percentage points separating the two candidates. The group refrained from saying which candidate had the advantage. \n \"The moral fraud of the right-wing won't go unpunished,\" Correa said on Twitter, referring to what Moreno called misleading exit polls that had \"lied\" to his rival. \n Earlier, a jubilant Lasso claimed victory and told supporters in Guayaquil that he would free political prisoners and heal divisions created by 10 years of iron-fisted rule by Correa. Before the election, he said he would evict WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from the Ecuadorean embassy in London within 30 days of taking office while Moreno has said he will allow him to stay. . \n With Ecuador's economy slated to shrink by 2.7 percent this year as oil prices remain low and with a majority of citizens stating in surveys that they are eager for change, analysts had been anticipating that Ecuadoreans would back Lasso and join the growing list of Latin American nations shifting to the right. \n Yet in the final weeks of the race, Moreno had inched ahead in polls amid an aggressive campaign led by Correa to cast Lasso as a wealthy, out-of-touch politician who profited from the country's 1999 banking crisis. \n Authorities deployed thousands of officers to beef up security at vote-processing centers around the country after a contentious first-round election on Feb. 19, in which Moreno fell just short of the required threshold to avoid a runoff. \n The vote count dragged on for several days before the official results were announced, provoking accusations of fraud from both sides and angry protests that have injected an unusual degree of volatility in the election results. \n Fearing a contested election, church leaders have appealed to both campaigns to accept whatever the results. \n Lasso has put forward a pro-business agenda aimed at attracting foreign investment, reducing taxes and generating more jobs and in recent days drew comparisons between continuing a Correa-style government and going down the same path as socialist Venezuela. \n Lasso has benefited from ongoing corruption allegations related to bribes Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht paid to officials in Correa's government and a $12 million contracting scandal at state-run PetroEcuador, but analysts say he has not connected with lower-income voters. \n While Lasso has said he would evict Assange from the embassy where Ecuador granted him asylum in 2012 to prevent his extradition to Sweden, Moreno has said he could stay, increasing international interest in today's vote. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Leftist Moreno heading to disputed win in Ecuador election"}

{"date": "April 2, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People lined up outside a cemetery to look for their missing relatives in Mocoa, Colombia. \n MOCOA, Colombia >> Jose Albeiro Vargas last saw his grandson the night a fierce rain came and unleashed havoc on this small city surrounded by rivers and mountains in southern Colombia. \n From what the store owner has been able to gather, the torrents of mud, water and debris unleashed on the city of Mocoa by the rain-swollen river swept away his 18-month-old grandson, Jadir Estiven. Today, Vargas was searching for the boy and the infant's young mother, his daughter. The baby's father survived. \n \"They were hit by the strongest avalanche,\" said Vargas, the owner of a clothing store who was so tired from the search effort that he could barely open his eyes or speak. \n He is far from the only person in Mocoa searching desperately for young loved ones. At least 43 children were among the 210 confirmed dead from the devastating flood, according to President Juan Manuel Santos. The young may have been particularly vulnerable in this disaster because they were in bed when the floods surged through the city of 40,000 Friday night and early Saturday. \n Maria Cordoba, a 52-year-old resident, said two of her nephews, ages 6 and 11, were killed when their house was destroyed. \"The mother as well was totally beaten up\" but managed to save her 18-month-old baby, she said as she used the river to try to clean items she salvaged from her home. \n The death toll from the flood, one of the worst natural disasters to strike the country in years, was expected to rise as many people were injured or remained unaccounted for, and bodies were still being pulled from the thick mud, tree limbs and debris that covered much of the city. The deluge smashed houses, tore trees out by the roots and washed cars and trucks away. \n Search-and-rescue teams combed through the debris and helped people who had been clawing at huge mounds of mud by hand. Many had little of their former lives left to search through. \n \"People went to their houses and found nothing but the floor,\" said Gilma Diaz, a 42-year-old woman from another town who came to search for a cousin. \n Dozens stood in the door of a hospital, hoping for news of family members who were not on the list of those confirmed dead or injured. Others frantically knocked on relatives' doors, hoping to find someone with information about their loved ones. \n A rescue worker in an orange jumpsuit emerged from one search area with the body of an infant wrapped in a towel. Not far away, Abelardo Solarte, a 48-year-old resident of Mocoa, held a child's shoe as he helped clear debris. \n \"You have no idea how many kids there are around here,\" Solarte said. \n Jair Echarri, who came from a nearby town to help, also struggled to comprehend the loss of so many children. \"I feel an enormous sadness because it's filled with kids' things, toys, clothes, school books,\" he said. \"I am a father and this breaks my heart.\" \n Santos, who visited Mocoa for a second straight day Sunday, declared the area a disaster zone. The president said the avalanche of water and debris also destroyed roads and bridges, knocked out power in half of the province of Putumayo, where Mocoa is located, and destroyed the area's fresh water network, creating dangerous and unsanitary conditions. \n Mocoa is vulnerable to flooding. It is surrounded by the three rivers in a natural basin created by the surrounding mountains. \n The danger has grown worse in recent years because of deforestation, which eliminates some protection from runoff, and because many people built their homes close to the water. But the triggering event was rainfall of more than 5 inches (130 millimeters) that began late Friday. \n \"The rain fell on Mocoa with an intensity and force that was without precedent and devastating,\" Santos said. \"It rained in two hours what falls in a month in Bogota.\" \n A 1989 hydrology report for the Agricultural Ministry warned that just such a disaster could happen unless steps were taken to reinforce the riverbanks, channel water away from the town and restore some of the forest. It was not immediately clear why those steps had not been taken. \n Juan Chanchi de Ruiz, 74, said the noise of the surging flood woke her up and gave her enough time to get to higher ground. Her house was unscathed, but several neighbors' homes were heavily damaged and many people fled with some of their belongings. \n \"Around here, there's nobody. Everybody left,\" she said. \n Colombian officials pledged aid to rebuild homes, and the attorney general launched an investigation into whether local and national authorities responded adequately to the disaster. Santos also said they would launch a health and vaccination campaign in the city to prevent an outbreak of disease. \n \"Mocoa needs to rise up from this blow,\" he said. \"And it will.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Families search for children in flood-hit Colombian city"}

Investigators didn't specify how many others would likely be charged, but they did say one adult male was among them. \n Police were careful not to release too many details of the ongoing investigation, but they did provide some that helped illustrate why Superintendent Eddie Johnson remained visibly upset as he has been since the investigation began. \n Commander Brendan Deenihan said that the victim saw one of the suspects, whom she knew, on the day of the attack. She said the suspect \"lured\" her into the home of one of the offenders in the North Lawndale neighborhood on the city's West Side, where she also lives. \n \"She was not allowed to leave and she did not consent to what occurred,\" he said. \n Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said the girl was threatened by suspects, but he would not say what those threats entailed. \n Deenihan also said there were multiple cellphone videos made of the attack, not just the one streamed live on Facebook that was viewed by about 40 people \u2014 none of whom reported it. \n \"It disgusts me that we have people who would look at those videos and not pick up a phone and dial 911,\" he said. \n Deenihan declined to say if either of the teens who are already facing charges streamed the live video.

Roy Cooper holds a press conference at the Executive Mansion in Raleigh, N.C., Thursday, March 30, 2017, to announce that he signed a HB142, a compromise replacement bill for HB2, that the N.C. General Assembly passed earlier in the day. \n RALEIGH, N.C. >> Gay rights groups that fiercely supported Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's winning campaign last fall because of his pledge to repeal North Carolina's \"bathroom bill\" now say he betrayed them by accepting the recent compromise, calling it a \"dirty deal\" with Republicans. \n Many fellow Democrats also were upset with the compromise, which got rid of the provision requiring transgender people to use public restrooms corresponding to their birth certificate but kept state lawmakers in charge of future bathroom policies. That provision in particular angered businesses, the NCAA, the NBA and others who withdrew events and expansions from North Carolina at a steep cost. \n \"I am torn apart because I want to support my governor, and I want to support the efforts that we are trying to make, to make things at least a little bit better,\" Democratic Rep.

Although she voted for the compromise, she said: \"there is more to this than about using the bathroom.\" \n Indeed there is: The law known as House Bill 2 also had prevented local and state governments from passing nondiscrimination ordinances protecting on the basis of categories such as sexual orientation and gender identity. It was replaced by a moratorium on local governments passing them in most cases for nearly another four years. \n For months, opponents of the law insisted they would accept only a full repeal. Some joined hard-line conservatives in opposing the bill, though their reasons differed: Many Republicans saw no need for any repeal. \n \"It kicks HB2 down the road until 2020, keeping most of the awful law on the books for someone else to deal with,\" said Chris Sgro, executive director of Equality North Carolina. \"That's not leadership, Gov. Cooper.\" \n Cooper said the compromise was the best he could get with Republican leaders holding veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate. But he said it got HB2 repealed and restored some local LGBT protections for workers and contracts. \n \"This is not a perfect deal, and it is not my preferred solution,\" he said during a news conference. \n HB2 caused the NCAA to cancel championships in the state this year and has discouraged some companies from relocating to or expanding in the state. An Associated Press analysis last week found that HB2 would cost the state more than $3.76 billion in lost business over a dozen years. \n The NCAA set a deadline of last week for action on HB2 or North Carolina likely would miss out on holding championship events through 2022. Officials now say they'll decide this week whether the new law goes far enough. \n \"The jobs are leaving now. The money's going out of pockets from people now. \u2026 We had to repeal this law now,\" Cooper said. As for gay rights groups opposing the bill, \"I hope that they will see and that they will know my heart and they will see that I will continue to fight for LGBT rights.\" \n To be sure, Human Rights Campaign, Equality NC and other groups also leveled plenty of blame on GOP legislative leaders. But many of the same people who spent last year protesting Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, who signed HB2, protested Cooper. \n \"Roy Cooper forfeited the chance to make a principled stand against a new bill that essentially is window-dressing,\" said Grayson Haver Currin of Raleigh, a registered Democrat who last year led weekly blastings of air horns and noisemakers near the Executive Mansion in protest of HB2. He and about 50 others performed again Thursday evening across the street to oppose Cooper's signing of the new bill. \n Twenty-one Democrats in the legislature voted against the compromise Cooper asked them to support. Some House Democrats said on the floor they couldn't support a measure that still keeps discrimination on the books. \n The next gubernatorial election isn't until 2020. While some Democrats who voted for the bill could face primary challenges in 2018 because of their \"yes\" votes, the party also has a vested interest in eliminating the Republicans' veto-proof majorities to give the governor more leverage. \n Mac McCorkle, a political consultant to the two previous North Carolina Democratic governors, said he doesn't think complaints from outside groups will hurt Cooper unless he disappoints them repeatedly. The electorate won't turn on Cooper if businesses consider the state again, he said. \n \"The barometer for most people is going to be the national economic developments,\" McCorkle said. \n And despite the complaints, nearly 40 Democrats voted for the agreement. Democratic Rep. Mickey Michaux of Durham, a veteran of the civil rights movement, said it was the best deal the governor could assemble given the circumstances. \n \"I'm not going to throw my governor under the bus,\" Michaux said before voting for the bill. \"I'm going to support my governor so that he has an opportunity for a second term.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'Bathroom bill' compromise angers Democratic gov's allies"}

{"date": "April 2, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Joyce Endresen wears an Optune therapy device for brain cancer, as she speaks on a phone at work in Aurora, Ill. \n WASHINGTON >> It sounds like science fiction, but a cap-like device that makes electric fields to fight cancer improved survival for the first time in more than a decade for people with deadly brain tumors, final results of a large study suggest. \n Many doctors are skeptical of the therapy, called tumor treating fields, and it's not a cure. It's also ultra-expensive \u2014 $21,000 a month. \n But in the study, more than twice as many patients were alive five years after getting it, plus the usual chemotherapy, than those given just the chemo \u2014 13 percent versus 5 percent. \n \"It's out of the box\" in terms of how cancer is usually treated, and many doctors don't understand it or think it can help, said Dr. Roger Stupp, a brain tumor expert at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. \n He led the company-sponsored study while previously at University Hospital Zurich in Switzerland, and gave results Sunday at an American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington. \n \"You cannot argue with them \u2014 they're great results,\" and unlikely to be due to a placebo effect, said one independent expert, Dr. Antonio Chiocca, neurosurgery chief at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. \n Dr. George Demetri of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and a board member of the association hosting the conference, agreed but called the benefit modest, because most patients still die within five years. \"It is such a horrible disease\" that any progress is important, he added. \n ABOUT THE TREATMENT \n The device, called Optune, is made by Novocure, based in Jersey, an island near England. It's sold in the U.S., Germany, Switzerland and Japan for adults with an aggressive cancer called glioblastoma multiforme, and is used with chemo after surgery and radiation to try to keep these tumors from recurring, as most do. \n Patients cover their shaved scalp with strips of electrodes connected by wires to a small generator kept in a bag. They can wear a hat, go about their usual lives, and are supposed to use the device at least 18 hours a day. It's not an electric current or radiation, and they feel only mild heat. \n It supposedly works by creating low intensity, alternating electric fields that disrupt cell division \u2014 confusing the way chromosomes line up \u2014 which makes the cells die. Because cancer cells divide often, and normal cells in the adult brain do not, this in theory mostly harms the disease and not the patient. \n WHAT STUDIES SHOW \n In a 2011 study, the device didn't improve survival but caused fewer symptoms than chemo did for people whose tumors had worsened or recurred after standard treatments. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it for that situation. \n A second study, in newly diagnosed patients, was stopped in 2014 after about half of the 695 participants had been tracked for at least 18 months, because those using the device were living several months longer on average than the rest. \n The FDA expanded approval but some doctors were leery because the device wasn't compared with a sham treatment \u2014 everyone knew who was getting what. Study leaders say a sham was impractical, because patients feel heat when they get the real thing, and many would refuse to shave their heads every few days and use an inconvenient device for years if the treatment might be fake. \n Some doctors said they would withhold judgment until there were long-term results on the whole group. \n THE NEW RESULTS \n Now they're in: Median survival was 21 months for those given Optune plus chemo versus 16 months for those on chemo alone. Survival rates were 43 percent versus 31 percent at two years; 26 percent versus 16 percent at three years, and 13 percent versus 5 percent at five years. \n Side effects were minimal but included blood-count problems, weakness, fatigue and skin irritation from the electrodes. \n \"The device is now impossible to ignore \u2026 it absolutely is an advance,\" said Dr. Andrew Lassman, brain tumor chief at the Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital. He consults for Novocure, as do some doctors running the study. \n The latest National Comprehensive Cancer Center guidelines include Optune as an appropriate treatment for brain tumors. It's also is being tested for pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancers; electrodes are worn on the belly or chest for those. \n THE PRICE \n A big issue is cost \u2014 roughly $700 a day. Most U.S. insurers cover it but Medicare does not and \"we are paying,\" said Novocure's chief executive, Bill Doyle. \"We've never refused a patient regardless of insurance status.\" \n The price reflects \"an extremely sophisticated medical device, made in very low quantities,\" with disposable parts changed several times a week and a support person for each patient, he said. Plus 17 years of lab, animal and human testing. \n That cost? \"The round number is half a billion dollars,\" Doyle said. \n ONE PATIENT'S EXPERIENCE \n Joyce Endresen's insurance covers all but about $1,000 a year for her device. \"It's a great plan, and that's why I still work,\" said Endresen, 52, employed by a direct mail company in suburban Chicago. \n She has scans every two months to check for cancer and \"they've all been good,\" she said. \"We celebrated two years of no tumor in December and went to South Africa.\" \n Doctors say many patients won't try the device because of the trouble involved or because they don't want a visible reminder of their cancer. Not Endresen. \n \"I wear it and wear it proudly,\" she said. \"It's an incredible machine and I'm fine not having hair.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "A 'sci-fi' cancer therapy fights brain tumors, study finds"}

{"date": "April 2, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Donald Trump speaks during a rally in Louisville, Ky. On Friday, March 31, 2017, a federal judge rejected Trump's free speech defense against a lawsuit accusing him of inciting violence against protesters during his campaign. \n POTOMAC FALLS, Virginia >> President Donald Trump brought Sen. Rand Paul to his Virginia golf course today, planning to discuss health care with the outspoken critic of the failed plan to repeal and replace so-called Obamacare. \n The outing to Trump National Golf Club came hours after Trump tweeted that talks on replacing the law have been going on and \"will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck.\" \n He added that anyone who thinks the effort is dead \"does not know the love and strength in R Party!\" \n White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Trump would be golfing and talking policy, including health care, with Paul and budget director Mick Mulvaney. \n Trump vanquished Paul in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. The Kentucky senator came out strongly against the House GOP legislation, and its collapse humiliated Trump in the early days of his administration. \n Trump and aides had argued for a vote in the final hours of negotiations around the bill, but Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan ultimately agreed to pull it, rather than face a loss if it had been put to a vote. \n In an interview with the Financial Times published online Sunday, Trump said the bill was pulled because \"I didn't want to take a vote. It was my idea.\" \n Still, Trump said that \"one way or the other, I promised the people great health care. We are going to have great health care in this country. Now, it will be in one form or another. It will be a repeal and replace of Obamacare which is the deal that is being negotiated now.\" \n It is not clear how a new health care bill will come together, with deep divides among Republicans and little interest in cooperation from Democrats. Since the bill went down, Trump has repeatedly lashed out at members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who contributed to the defeat. \n On CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, a member of the caucus, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, responded to those attacks. He said \"tweets and statements and blame don't change facts. And the facts remain the same. When you look at the document, when you look at the legislation, it doesn't repeal Obamacare.\" \n Trump told the Financial Times that members of the caucus were \"friends of mine.\" But he added: \"if we don't get what we want, we will make a deal with the Democrats and we will have in my opinion not as good a form of health care, but we are going to have a very good form of health care and it will be a bipartisan form of health care.\" \n The Sunday golf outing was not unusual for Trump, who has visited his golf courses in Virginia and Florida repeatedly since taking office. Sometimes these rounds incorporate official business, like when he played with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Florida. \n For years, Trump railed against Obama when he was in office for golfing. Candidate Trump said if he won the election he'd probably be too busy to golf and would only play with people with whom he was looking to make deals. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump hits golf course with Sen.
