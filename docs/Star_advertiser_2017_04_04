{"date": "April 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The \"Pink Star\" diamond, the most valuable cut diamond ever offered at auction, is displayed by a model at a Sotheby's auction room in Hong Kong. \n HONG KONG >> A stunning 59.6 carat diamond known as the \"Pink Star\" sold for $71.2 million at a Sotheby's auction Tuesday in Hong Kong, setting a new world record for any diamond or jewel, according to the auction house. \n The oval mixed-cut diamond smashed the $60 million pre-sale estimate set by Sotheby's when it went on the block. \n The sale comes three years after the gem was sold at an even higher price at another Sotheby's auction in Geneva. That deal later fell apart after the buyer defaulted. \n The gem is the largest flawless fancy vivid pink diamond ever graded by the Gemological Institute of America. \n Three telephone bidders competed for the stone during five tense minutes of bidding. The crowd in the packed auction room applauded when it was sold for a hammer price of $63 million , not including the buyer's premium. \n Sotheby's Asia Chairwoman Patti Wong said the winning bidder was Hong Kong jeweler Chow Tai Fook \n \"We're very happy,\" Wong said. \"I know there was a lot of talk about the economy in China not being as positive as it was a few years ago,\" but the results from its jewelry auction Tuesday, which included nearly 200 other lots, were very strong, she said. \n Wong said the company is not worried about another default because the bidders were vetted and have longstanding relationships with Sotheby's. \n \"We're very, very confident that all three bidders had the financial capability, and of course the buyer definitely had the financial capability,\" she said. \n Until now, the most expensive diamond ever sold at auction was the \"Oppenheimer Blue,\" which fetched 56.8 million Swiss francs (then $57.6 million) last May. The previous world auction record for a pink diamond was $46.2 million for the 24.78 carat \"Graff Pink\" in 2010. \n Sotheby's decided the time was right to bring the diamond back to the market because of rising demand from wealthy Asian buyers. \n \"The Asian element in the jewelry market is extremely important and from what I've been hearing from members of the trade I've been talking to, in the last six months they have become more and more important,\" said David Bennett, chairman of the auction house's jewelry division. \n The \"Pink Star\" was mined in Africa by De Beers in 1999 as a raw 132.5 carat gem and cut over a two-year period. In November 2013 it was auctioned for a record $83 million to New York diamond cutter Isaac Wolf, who failed to pay. \n The auction house was then forced to buy the diamond itself because had guaranteed a $60 million sale price. Last year it sold an unspecified stake in the diamond, valued at $72 million on its balance sheet, to two companies, diamond specialist Diacore and New York jeweler Mellen Inc. \n ", "author": "", "title": "Pink diamond fetches record $71.2M in Hong Kong auction"}

The vote tally will be made official April 24. \n Traynere spokesman Tom Bowen acknowledged because of the number of outstanding votes, Traynere is facing an \"uphill battle.\" \n \"Jackie called him and congratulated him on a great race,\" Bowen said. \n Claar did not return telephone calls late Tuesday seeking comment. \n Claar hosted a fundraiser for Trump in September, which angered some voters in the suburb of about 75,000 people. As a result, support for Traynere poured in from top Democrats nationwide, including from U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois and a group spun out of Sanders' campaign. \n The municipal contest was seen as an early test of whether local candidates who supported Trump in last year's blistering presidential election face backlash at the polls. \n Traynere said Trump's visit to the community roughly 30 miles from Chicago \"opened a door of opportunity that we wouldn't have had.\" \n \"There's clearly something in the air for change,\" Traynere said. \n Claar easily won previous re-election battles since taking office in 1986. \n He has previously dismissed the situation in Bolingbrook, saying Democrats are \"trying to take over\" and partisan politics shouldn't be a factor in the race. His tenure has seen major development and growth in Bolingbrook. \n The municipal contest is technically nonpartisan. But concerns raised in the presidential campaign and initial months of Trump's tenure have hit home in the racially-diverse community with two mosques and where at least 20 percent of the community is foreign born. \n More than 1,000 people signed a petition asking Claar not to hold the Trump fundraiser, noting the Republican's derogatory comments about immigrants, Muslims and women. Claar was also a Trump delegate at the Republican National Convention. In November, the community backed Hillary Clinton with more than 60 percent of the vote. \n Turnout is typically low in such municipal contests where voters weigh in on local offices like assessor and county commissioner. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump-supporting mayor appears to survive re-election scare"}

Diehl-Armstrong, a woman convicted in a bizarre Pennsylvania bank robbery plot that left a pizza delivery driver dead when a bomb strapped to his neck exploded has died in prison. \n ERIE, Pa. >> A woman convicted in a bizarre bank robbery plot that left a pizza delivery driver dead when a bomb strapped to his neck exploded has died in prison. \n Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong died Tuesday of natural causes, the Federal Bureau of Prisons said. Her last location in the federal prison system was the Federal Medical Center-Carswell in Fort Worth, Texas, bureau spokesman Justin Long said. \n Wells, later identified as an unindicted co-conspirator although his family maintains he was a hostage, told state troopers he was forced to wear the collar at gunpoint shortly before robbing the bank in 2003. Wells was sitting down, handcuffed and waiting for a bomb squad to arrive, when the device exploded. \n The case remained a mystery until Diehl-Armstrong and her fishing buddy Kenneth Barnes were indicted in 2007 on charges they concocted the plot along with her ex-boyfriend William Rothstein. \n Barnes later pleaded guilty and testified against Diehl-Armstrong. Rothstein died of cancer before the grand jury indictment was returned. \n Investigators said Rothstein made the time bomb collar using two egg timers provided by Diehl-Armstrong. They said he even ordered the pizzas that lured Wells to a dead-end road where Wells was forced to wear the device before he was given handwritten instructions about how to rob the bank and disarm the bomb. \n Prosecutors said they believe Wells was in on the plot but was fooled into believing the collar bomb would be a decoy. \n By the time Diehl-Armstrong was indicted, she was serving seven to 20 years in state prison in the death of another ex-boyfriend, William Roden, two weeks before Wells died. Prosecutors said she killed Roden with a shotgun to keep him from going to authorities about the bomb plot, but she insisted it was a crime of passion prompted by his abuse. \n Prosecutors argued that Diehl-Armstrong instigated the plot to raise $250,000 to hire Barnes to kill her father in a dispute over her future inheritance. The defense called that outlandish, noting, among other things, that Wells took only $8,701 from the bank. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Woman serving life in collar bomb robbery dies in prison"}

{"date": "April 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump listens to a question during a town hall with business leaders in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington today. \n WASHINGTON >> Confronted by one of his first foreign crises, President Donald Trump today split the blame for Syria's worst chemical weapons attack in years between its Russian-backed leader and former President Barack Obama, as the new American administration struggled to explain what it might do in response. \n In a surprising statement, Trump called the assault in an opposition-held town in northern Syria \"reprehensible\" and one that \"cannot be ignored by the civilized world,\" rhetoric that harkened back to Obama's criticism in 2013 of an earlier chemical attack ascribed to President Bashar Assad's forces. Trump said Assad was responsible for Tuesday's deaths, yet also targeted his predecessor's failed strategy to deter such attacks. \n \"These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration's weakness and irresolution,\" Trump said. It was a clear reference to four years ago, when Obama failed to deliver on his \"red line\" when he didn't authorize military action against Assad in response to a sarin gas attack that killed hundreds outside Damascus. \n Obama aides declined today to comment on Trump's assignment of blame. \n The political tone of Trump's statement took many U.S. officials by surprise. They noted that U.S. presidents have rarely attacked their predecessors so aggressively for events like a chemical weapons attacks that Democrats and Republicans both abhor. \n Several officials involved in internal administration discussions said Trump's National Security Council had been preparing a different statement, until the president's closest advisers took over the process. The officials weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. \n Trump left it to his top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, to assign culpability to Russia and Iran, Assad's most powerful allies. Tillerson noted both countries signed up as guarantors to a recent Syrian ceasefire and said they must pressure Assad not to conduct more such attacks. \n The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 58 people, including 11 children, died in the town of Khan Sheikhoun. Witnesses claimed Sukhoi jets operated by the Russian and Syrian governments were involved. Videos from the scene showed volunteer medics using firehoses to wash the chemicals from victims' bodies and lifeless children being piled in heaps. \n \"Russia and Iran also bear great moral responsibility for these deaths,\" Tillerson said. \n The twin statements illustrated the competing forces pulling at the Trump administration. While Trump tries to show he's dealing with extremist groups in Syria more aggressively than Obama, his administration has suggested it could align with Russia, Assad's key military backer. And in recent days, top U.S. officials like U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley have suggested Assad's removal is no longer a U.S. priority. \n But America's Arab and European allies oppose any accommodation with Assad. Tillerson, in Turkey last week, outraged some foreign partners when he said Assad's future was up to the Syrian people. And the idea of even an indirect alliance with a Syrian government that is gassing its own people will be a hard sell with a U.S. public appalled by the reams of footage of the six-year civil war's horror. \n \"It is at the least embarrassing to have Assad be massacring civilians with chemical weapons at the same time Trump is trying to make the case that they're potentially a partner,\" said Phil Gordon, Obama's top Mideast adviser from 2013 to 2015, including when the U.S. president declined to retaliate militarily against Assad. Obama opted instead for a Russian-backed agreement to remove Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles. \n The chapter was seen internationally as a major blow to U.S. credibility and, for Obama's critics, a prime example of weak leadership. Syrian chemical weapons attacks continued after the deal with Russia and Syria. \n Trump, Gordon noted, was facing the same dilemma and lack of solutions that plagued Obama's deliberations. \n In 2013, internal debate focused on everything from so-called pinprick operations that would have negligible effect on Assad to a broader strategy to push him from power. But regime change had its drawbacks, too, because it would require significant U.S. military force and potentially leave a vacuum that could be filled by al-Qaida-linked and other extremist fighters among the opposition. \n The Islamic State group's later emergence only hardened Obama's resistance to intervening. By the end of his tenure, the Obama administration had largely abandoned its pressure, first advocated by the president in 2011, for Assad to immediately leave power. \n \"President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a 'red line' against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing,\" Trump's statement said. But while Trump called the latest attack \"intolerable,\" he offered no suggestion of what he would now do. \n It was a far different view than one Trump took at the time. Among his tweets on the matter, he urged Obama in all caps, \"DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA \u2014 IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.\" \n Asked how Trump might respond now, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said today, \"I'm not ready to talk about our next step but we'll talk about that soon.\" \n Both Trump and Tillerson referred flatly to chemical weapons usage, rather than a \"suspected\" or \"reported\" attack. The lack of restraint suggested the U.S. had reached a high degree of confidence about what transpired and who was responsible. \n U.S. officials said there were some indications nerve gas had been used, though they suggested it could also be another in a series of chlorine gas attacks by Assad's military. Chlorine isn't a banned chemical substance, though it cannot be used as a weapon of war. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump blames Assad and Obama for chemical attack in Syria"}

(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) \n North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the waters off its east coast today, U.S. and South Korean officials said, amid worries that the North might soon conduct banned nuclear or long-range rocket tests. \n The firing was also made as North Korea expressed anger over annual military drills between the United States and South Korea that North Korea sees as an invasion rehearsal. \n The U.S. Pacific Command, based at Camp H.M. Smith on Oahu, said it detected and tracked what it assessed as a North Korean missile launched from land near the eastern city of Sinpo. A U.S. statement said initial assessments indicate the type of missile was a KN-15 medium-range ballistic missile. \n \"U.S. Pacific Command detected and tracked what we assess was a North Korean missile at 11:42 a.m. Hawaii time April 4,\" according to a statement from Pacific Command. \"The North American Defense Command determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.\" \n South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a statement saying the missile flew about 37 miles, which is a much shorter distance than other North Korean missiles flew in their recent test-launches. \n Two weeks ago, the South Korean and U.S. militaries said they had detected a failed North Korean ballistic missile launch. South Korean media speculated at the time that North Korea might have attempted to test a missile that it hasn't deployed. Earlier in March, North Korea fired four ballistic missiles that flew about 620 miles, with three of them landing in waters that Japan claims as its exclusive economic zone. \n The North's latest launch came as outside satellite imagery show possible preparations for a new nuclear test at the North's main nuclear test site, such as communication cables used to initiate a test and collect data being already laid. North Korea's state media has also said the world will soon witness what it calls \"eventful successes\" the country achieves in the space development. Washington, Seoul and others call the North's space program a cover for its long-range missile development program. \n North Korea is pushing hard to upgrade its weapons systems to cope with what it calls U.S. hostility. Many weapons experts say the North could have a functioning nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the continental U.S. within a few years. North Korea carried out two nuclear tests last year. \n North Korea also often responds to U.S.-South Korean military drills with its own military training and harsh rhetoric. The allies say the drills set to run until the end of this month are defensive in nature. \n ", "author": "Associated Press & Star-Advertiser staff", "title": "N.Korea fires missile off its east coast, Pacific Command says"}

{"date": "April 4, 2017", "text": "A Maui man who breached security at Honolulu Airport in February had methamphetamine in his system and died after his heart suddenly stopped beating, the Honolulu Medical Examiner's office said. \n Charles Kosi, 48, died of complications of sudden cardiac arrest during a physical struggle, the office said today. Other factors in his death were: methamphetamine toxicity, dilated cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis coronary artery disease, hypertension, and obesity, the office said. The manner of his death was ruled a homicide. \n Sudden cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating, halting the flow of blood to the brain and other organs, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Sudden cardiac arrest differs from a heart attack, which happens when a blockage stops blood flow to the heart, and the heart usually doesn't stop beating, the organization said. \n Deputy Medical Examiner Masahiko Kobayashi said Kosi had 900 nanograms of methamphetamine per milliliter of blood in his system. Asked to provide a frame of reference for that amount of methamphetamine, Kobayashi said he has seen cases in which individuals had higher amounts of methamphetamine and others where individuals died of lower amounts. \n Kobayashi said the autopsy does not show when Kosi took the drugs or how much he took. Also found in Kosi's system were the breakdown products of methamphetamine, a prescription drug for his heart condition, and caffeine. \n Kobayashi said the case was classified a homicide under the guidelines of the National Association of Medical Examiners. A homicide means actions by others appear to have contributed to a death and does not imply criminality or an intent to harm or kill, he said. \n The state Department of Transportation said Kosi used force to pass through the exit of a security checkpoint at the commuter terminal about 5:50 a.m. Feb. 18. \n He made it through a set of secured doors to a walkway outside of the building when security grabbed him, a DOT spokesman said. \n Kosi was combative and struggled with security after being detained, then became unresponsive, the spokesman said. Officials treated Kosi, who later died at a hospital. \n A police spokeswoman said the case remained under investigation. \n ", "author": "By Rob Shikina rshikina@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Autopsy: Maui man who breached airport security had used meth"}

King was standing on the motel's balcony when he was shot down by a sniper's bullet on April 4, 1968. He was in the midst of his \"Poor People's Campaign\" when he came to Memphis to support striking sanitation workers seeking better pay, safer working conditions and union rights. \n Led by a 220-piece band from Talladega College in Alabama, marchers chanted \"This is what democracy looks like\" and held signs saying \"I Am A Man.\" Some wore T-shirts emblazoned with the words \"Show Me $15. Real Change. No Pennies.\" \n The Fight for $15 group wants a higher hourly minimum wage for low-pay workers, including fast food employees and home and child care workers. The Black Lives Matter movement developed after the deaths of unarmed black men during confrontations with white police officers and has waged protests throughout the country. \n Marchers also came from Arkansas and Missouri to join their Tennessee colleagues. Police did not immediately have an estimate of the number of marchers who participated. \n Renita Moore, a 54-year-old nursing assistant from St. Louis, said raising the minimum wage is important because her cost of living keeps going up. \n \"We've all come together as one,\" Moore said. \"It's very important that we stick together, stand together and fight together.\" \n The march was one of many King-related events in Memphis. \n Earlier today, more than 200 people gathered at Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church to hear the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. William Barber talk about how King's fight for economic and racial equality and social justice is far from over. A vocalist belted out a religious hymn and another song, \"The Impossible Dream,\" and attendees held hands in prayer. \n Barber, known for his firebrand public speaking style, called for those seeking progress on social and economic issues affecting poor people to help register more blacks voters and engage in \"civil disobedience.\" \n The pastor of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, N.C., was critical of President Donald Trump, including his effort to suspend new visas for people in six Muslim-majority countries. He called Trump a \"narcissistic tweeter.\" \n \"We are not those who believe the terrible lies that the best way to better America is to attack public education and attack Muslims and attack immigrants and attack living wages,\" said Barber, progressively raising his voice. \"How in the world can America attack refugees when we sing 'God bless America, shed his grace on us,' but we don't have grace for immigrants? That's contradictory to everything we say we believe.\" \n Then, he added: \"We are the crowd that believes in justice and love and mercy and goodness and hope, the common good, the general welfare. We believe 'liberal' is a good word, and 'conservative' is a good word.\" \n Outside the church, Sharon Johnson, 60, said she came to the rally to honor King's memory. \n \"He came from the right place in his heart, believing that all people are equal, that everyone should be treated with respect, that people deserve equal pay for their work,\" said Johnson, a pharmacy technician. \"He sacrificed his life to make that happen.\" \n Rallies also were scheduled in Florida, California, Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan. In Boston, dozens of people marched through the Boston Common to call for less racism and a higher minimum wage.

{"date": "April 4, 2017", "text": "CHICAGO >> A federal appeals court ruled for the first time today that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects LGBT employees from workplace discrimination, setting up a likely battle before the Supreme Court as gay rights advocates push to broaden the scope of the 53-year-old law. \n The 8-to-3 decision by the full 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago comes just three weeks after a three-judge panel in Atlanta ruled the opposite, saying employers aren't prohibited from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation. \n The 7th Circuit is considered relatively conservative and five of the eight judges in the majority were appointed by Republican presidents, making the finding all the more notable. \n The case stems from a lawsuit by Indiana teacher Kimberly Hively alleging that the Ivy Tech Community College in South Bend didn't hire her full time because she is a lesbian. \n In an opinion concurring with the majority, Judge Richard Posner wrote that changing norms call for a change in interpretation of the Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin or sex. \n \"I don't see why firing a lesbian because she is in the subset of women who are lesbian should be thought any less a form of sex discrimination than firing a woman because she's a woman,\" wrote the judge, who was appointed by Republican Ronald Reagan. \n The decision comes as President Donald Trump's administration has begun setting its own policies on LGBT rights. Late in January, the White House declared Trump would enforce an Obama administration order barring companies that do federal work from workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual identity. But in February, it revoked guidance on transgender students' use of public school bathrooms, deferring to states. \n Hively said after today's ruling that she agreed to bring the case because she felt she was being \"bullied.\" She told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that the time has come \"to stop punishing people for being gay, being lesbian, being transgender.\" \n \"This decision is game changer for lesbian and gay employees facing discrimination in the workplace and sends a clear message to employers: it is against the law to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation,\" said Greg Nevins, of Lambda Legal, which brought the case on behalf of Hively. \n Ivy Tech said in a statement that its policies specifically bar discrimination based on sexual orientation and that it denies discriminating against Hively, a factual question separate from the 7th Circuit's finding regarding the law. \n The Chicago ruling came on the anniversary of the assassination of civil rights icon Martin Luther King, whose marches against racism prompted Congress to pass the landmark civil law. A GOP-majority House and Senate make it unlikely the current Congress will amend the Civil Rights Act, likely leaving it for the Supreme Court to decide. \n Debate in the Hively case revolved around the meaning of the word 'sex' in Title VII, the section of the law that deals with discrimination. Other courts have concluded that Congress meant for the word to refer only to whether a worker was male or female. They said that it would be wrong to stretch the meaning of 'sex' in the statute to include sexual orientation. \n The majority of the 7th Circuit sided with a broader meaning. \n \"Any discomfort, disapproval, or job decision based on the fact that the complainant \u2014 woman or man \u2014 dresses differently, speaks differently, or dates or marries a same-sex partner, is a reaction purely and simply based on sex. That means that it falls within Title VII's prohibition against sex discrimination \u2026,\" Judge Diane Wood, a President Bill Clinton appointee, wrote for the majority. \n The dissenting opinion \u2014 written by Judge Diane Sykes, a conservative who was on Trump's list of possible Supreme Court appointees \u2014 said the majority were stretching the meaning of the law's text too far. \n \"We are not authorized to infuse the text with a new or unconventional meaning or to update it to respond to changed social, economic, or political conditions.\" \n The dissent alludes to the judicial philosophy of Trump's high-court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, who advocates adhering largely to original legislative texts in deciding legal disputes. \n \"It's understandable that the court is impatient to protect lesbians and gay men from workplace discrimination without waiting for Congress to act. Legislative change is arduous and can be slow to come. But we're not authorized to amend Title VII by interpretation,\" Sykes wrote. \n Posner, though, said sticking to outdated meanings and cultural standards didn't make sense. \n \"It is well-nigh certain that homosexuality, male or female, did not figure in the minds of the legislators who enacted Title VII,\" he wrote in his concurring opinion. \n \"(Lawmakers in the 1960s) shouldn't be blamed for that failure of foresight,\" he wrote. \"We understand the words of Title VII differently not because we're smarter than the statute's framers and ratifiers but because we live in a different era, a different culture.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Court rules Civil Rights Act protects LGBT employees"}

The company said the dog got away from the owners and began pursuing the officer as he was asking them to leave the unauthorized parking area. \n \"Despite repeated requests from the officer to the owners to restrain the pursuing pit bull, the owners were unable to control the loose animal,\" the press release said. \n \"The officer attempted to evade the pit bull's pursuit by moving backwards and sideways.

As the Pit Bull lunged toward him, the officer fired a single shot at close range, in self defense to prevent being attacked.\" \n Trying to evade the pit bull, the officer fell backwards into a tree and was injured, and is currently on medical leave. \n Securitas said the officer, \"has expressed his sorrow and condolences to the family for the loss of the pit bull.

She said he shouted at them and pulled out his weapon. \n \"My dog stood up. \u2026 He was wagging his tail,\" she said last week. \n She said Kai'ele's chain broke but that she immediately grabbed his collar before the dog pulled away. \n Ramos said she was holding her 5-month-old baby when the guard shot the dog in the forehead from a few feet away. \n According to state Sen. Will Espero last week, the security officer is being investigated for reckless endangering in the second degree and was previously fired as a civilian police officer for the Army \"for pulling a gun too much.\" \n Espero, the former chairman of the Senate's Public Safety Committee, said a high-ranking sheriff's deputy based at the Sheriff's Department's airport sub-station told him that the unidentified \"older \u2026 airport police\" officer previously provided Department of Defense security as a civilian at Fort Shafter and possibly Fort DeRussy but was fired, although the date is unclear. \n There have been frictions between Securitas' armed \"airport police\" and sheriff's deputies at the airport.

The Trump administration blamed the Syrian government for the attack, one of the deadliest in years, and said Syria's patrons, Russia and Iran, bore \"great moral responsibility\" for the deaths. \n The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 58 people died, including 11 children, in the early morning attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun, which witnesses said was carried out by Sukhoi jets operated by the Russian and Syrian governments. \n Videos from the scene showed volunteer medics using fire hoses to wash the chemicals from victims' bodies. Haunting images of lifeless children piled in heaps reflected the magnitude of the attack, which was reminiscent of a 2013 chemical assault that left hundreds dead and was the worst in the country's ruinous six-year civil war. \n Today's attack drew swift condemnation from world leaders, including President Donald Trump, who denounced it as a \"heinous\" act that \"cannot be ignored by the civilized world.\" The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Wednesday in response to the strike, which came on the eve of a major international donors' conference in Brussels on the future of Syria and the region. \n In a statement, Trump also blamed former President Barack Obama for \"weakness\" in failing to respond aggressively after the 2013 attack. \n \"These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration's weakness and irresolution,\" Trump said. \"President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a 'red line' against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing. The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this intolerable attack.\" \n Trump left it to his top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, to assign at least some blame to Russia and Iran, Assad's most powerful allies. Tillerson called on both countries to use their influence over Assad to prevent future chemical weapons attacks, and noted Russia's and Iran's roles in helping broker a cease-fire through diplomatic talks in the Kazakh capital, Astana. \n \"As the self-proclaimed guarantors to the cease-fire negotiated in Astana, Russia and Iran also bear great moral responsibility for these deaths,\" Tillerson said. \n In a statement, the Syrian government \"categorically rejected\" claims that it was responsible, asserting that it does not possess chemical weapons, hasn't used them in the past and will not use them in the future. It laid the blame squarely on the rebels, accusing them of fabricating the attack and trying to frame the Syrian government. The Russian Defense Ministry also denied any involvement \n Photos and video emerging from Khan Sheikhoun, located south of the provincial capital of Idlib, showed the limp bodies of children and adults. Some were struggling to breathe; others appeared to be foaming at the mouth. \n The activist-run Assi Press published video of paramedics carrying victims, stripped down to their underwear and many appearing unresponsive, from the scene in pickup trucks. \n It was not immediately clear if all those killed died from suffocation or were struck by other airstrikes that occurred in the area around the same time. \n It was the third claim of a chemical attack in just over a week in Syria. The previous two were reported in Hama province, in an area not far from Khan Sheikhoun. \n Opposition activists and a doctor in Idlib said it was the worst incident since the 2013 gas attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta that killed hundreds of civilians and which a U.N. investigation said used sarin gas. \n Faced with international outrage over that attack, Assad agreed to a Russia-sponsored deal to destroy his chemical arsenal. His government declared a 1,300-ton stockpile of chemical weapons and so-called precursor chemicals that can be used to make weapons, all of which were destroyed. \n But member states of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have repeatedly questioned whether Assad declared everything. The widely available chemical chlorine was not covered in the 2013 declaration and activists say they have documented dozens of cases of chlorine gas attacks since then. \n The Syrian government has consistently denied using chemical weapons and chlorine gas, accusing the rebels of deploying it in the war instead. \n Dr. AbdulHai Tennari, a pulmonologist who treated dozens of victims of today's attack, said it appeared to be more serious than a chlorine attack. \n In a Skype interview, he said doctors were struggling amid extreme shortages, including of the antidote used to save patients, Pralidoxem. \n Most of the fatalities died before they reached hospitals, Tennari said. \"If they got to the hospital we can treat them. Two children who took a while before they were lifted out of the rubble died,\" he said. \n Dr. Mohammed Tennari, a radiologist and AbdulHaj Tennari's brother, said today's attack was more severe than previous ones in the province, most of which used chlorine cylinders. \n \"Honestly, we have not seen this before. The previous times the wounds were less severe,\" he said. The doctor, who testified before the United Nations in 2015 about renewed Syrian government use of chemical attacks despite claims it has destroyed its stockpiles, said there was a chlorine smell after today's attack, but it was mixed with another unknown \"toxic gas which causes poison and death.\" \n Mohammed Hassoun, a media activist in the nearby town of Sarmin, where some of the critical cases were transferred, said doctors there also believed it was likely more than one gas. \"Chlorine gas doesn't cause such convulsions,\" he said, adding that doctors suspect sarin was used. \n \"There are 18 critical cases here. They were unconscious, they had seizures and when oxygen was administered, they bled from the nose and mouth,\" he told The Associated Press. \n Tarik Jasarevic, spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva, said in an e-mailed statement that the agency was gathering more information about today's incident. The Syrian American Medical Society, which supports hospitals in opposition-held territory, also said it had sent a team of inspectors to Khan Sheikhoun and an investigation was underway. \n Hussein Kayal, a photographer for the Idlib Media Center, said he was awakened by the sound of a bomb blast around 6:30 a.m., and when he arrived at the scene he found entire families inside their homes unable to move, with their eyes wide open and their pupils constricted. He put on a mask, and he and others took victims to an emergency room. He said he later felt a burning sensation in his fingers and was treated for that. \n The province of Idlib, which is almost entirely controlled by the opposition, is home to some 900,000 displaced Syrians, according to the United Nations. Rebels and opposition officials have expressed concerns that the government is planning to mount a concentrated attack on the crowded province. \n New York-based Human Rights Watch has accused the Syrian government of conducting at least eight chemical attacks using chlorine gas on opposition-controlled residential areas during the final months of the battle for Aleppo last year that killed at least nine civilians and injured 200. A joint investigation by the United Nations and the international chemical weapons watchdog determined the Syrian government was behind at least three additional attacks in 2014 and 2015 involving chlorine gas, and that the Islamic State group was responsible for at least one, involving mustard gas. \n Late today, Abu Hamdu, a rescue worker in Khan Sheikhoun, said people were still searching for their family members, nearly 12 hours after the attack. \n \"People are still very lost,\" he said. \n Associated Press writers Philip Issa in Beirut, Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow, Vivian Salama and Josh Lederman in Washington, and Mike Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Chemical attack kills dozens in Syria, U.S. blames Assad"}

A bomb blast tore through a subway train deep under Russia's second-largest city St. Petersburg Monday, killing several people and wounding many more in a chaotic scene that left victims sprawled on a smokey platform. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People reacted at a symbolic memorial at Technologicheskiy Institute subway station in St. Petersburg, Russia, today. A bomb blast tore through a subway train deep under Russia's second-largest city St. Petersburg Monday, killing several people and wounding many more in a chaotic scene that left victims sprawled on a smoky platform. \n ST. PETERSBURG, Russia >> Investigators searched for possible accomplices of a 22-year-old native of the Central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan identified as the suicide bomber in the St. Petersburg subway, as residents came to grips today with the first major terrorist attack in Russia's second-largest city since the Soviet collapse. \n The bomber, Akbarzhon Dzhalilov, had lived in St. Petersburg for several years, working as a car repairman and later at a sushi bar. Pages on his social media networks reflected his interest in radical Islam and boxing, but those who met Dzhalilov described him as a calm and friendly man. \n Russia's health minister raised the death toll to 14, including the bomber. About 50 others remained hospitalized, some in grave condition. Many were students heading home Monday after classes on one of the city's busy north-south lines. \n No one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, which came as President Vladimir Putin was visiting his hometown, raising speculation it could have been timed for his trip. The attack follows a long string of bombings of Russian planes, trains and transportation facilities. Many of the attacks were linked to radical Islamists. \n Before Dzhalilov traveled to St. Petersburg where he eventually got Russian citizenship, his ethnic Uzbek family lived in Osh, the city in southern Kyrgyzstan that saw more than 400 people killed and thousands injured in clashes between ethnic Kyrgyz and minority Uzbeks in 2010. \n St. Petersburg has a large diaspora of people from Kyrgyzstan and other mostly Muslim former Soviet republics in Central Asia. They have fled ethnic tension, poverty and unemployment for jobs in Russia. While most Central Asian migrants hold temporary work permits or work illegally, thousands have received Russian citizenship in recent decades. \n Russian media said Dzhalilov worked with his father in a car repair shop and then became a cook at one of the city's many sushi bars. He stayed in St. Petersburg when his parents moved back to Kyrgyzstan. \n One former colleague at the sushi chain described Dzhalilov, who turned 22 on Saturday, as \"a very kind person.\" \n \"He was a non-conflict person. We didn't expect to hear such news today,\" said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared for her personal safety. \n Neighbors in Osh also described him as a nice and friendly man. \n Dzhalilov visited his home country about a month ago, and unlike past trips when he traveled directly back to St. Petersburg, he returned via Moscow. Investigators are looking into whether he met possible accomplices in Moscow, according to Russian media reports. \n Security cameras caught the bespectacled Dzhalilov as he entered the subway, appearing calm and clad in a red parka with a fur collar and blue wool hat. He wore a backpack believed to hold the bomb that was loaded with metal balls and screws for maximum damage. \n The Investigative Committee, Russia's top investigative agency, said it also found Dzhalilov's DNA on a bag with a similar bomb that was found and deactivated at another subway station shortly after the blast. \n Security experts have described people from Central Asia as fertile recruits for radical Islamist preachers, who have become increasingly active on social networks. Dzhalilov followed some radical Islamist pages on Russian social network, and media reports quoted investigators alleging he was linked to the Islamic State group. \n Putin has said that between 5,000 and 7,000 people from Russia and other former Soviet republics were fighting alongside the Islamic State group and other militants in Syria. He has named the IS threat as one of the reasons behind Russia's military campaign in Syria. \n Chinara Esengul, an expert on radical Islam based in Kyrgyzstan, said on Dozhd TV that about 850 people from Kyrgyzstan have joined the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, according to official figures. \n Russian security agencies have been checking Dzhalilov's contacts in St. Petersburg, while Kyrgyz law enforcement agencies have been talking to his parents in the impoverished nation. \n The Russian business daily Kommersant said that security agencies had learned of a terror plot in St. Petersburg from a Russian man affiliated with IS who had come from Syria. However, the man knew little and they tried to learn more by tapping phones of his contacts, the newspaper said. \n When Dzhalilov blew himself up, 10 other passengers were killed instantly. Three others died shortly after. \n Train driver Alexander Kaverin continued to the next station after hearing the blast, a decision that aided evacuation efforts and helped save many lives. \"I had no time to think about fear at that moment,\" he said. \n Viktor Khasiyev said he got a call from his father who was in the car hit by the explosion: \"I heard screams, and then he said: 'Son, we got blown up. Please come.'\" \n Khasiyev rushed across St. Petersburg to find his father covered in blood and soot. \"When he saw me, he cried,\" the son recalled, adding that his father is being treated for a concussion and burns, but that his life isn't in danger. \n \"I still can't believe that it happened in our city,\" the younger Khasiyev said. \n While Moscow and many other Russian cities have seen numerous attacks linked to Islamic militants, the city of imperial palaces and world-famous art museums largely had escaped such violence until Monday. \n The entire subway was shut down and evacuated, paralyzing traffic in the city of 5 million before partial service resumed six hours later. Typically crowded during rush hour, the subway this morning looked almost deserted as many residents opted for buses. \n \"First, I was really scared,\" said Viktoria Prishchepova, who did ride the subway. \"I didn't want to go anywhere on the Metro because I was nervous. Everyone was calling their loved ones yesterday, checking if they were OK and how everyone was going to get home.\" \n This morning, 53-year-old Oleg Alexeyev, who trains bomb-detecting police dogs, went to the station where the stricken train pulled in and victims were taken off. He laid flowers there in memory of those who died. \n \"I traveled on the same route this morning just to see how it felt and think about life. You begin to feel the thin line about life and death,\" he said. \n Contributing were Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow, Iuliia Subbotovska in St. Petersburg and Leila Saralayeva in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.  \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Russian police hunt possible accomplices of suicide bomber"}

{"date": "April 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A volunteer health care worker wore a T-shirt, March 2014, while getting people to sign up for the new health care programs, in Miami. \n WASHINGTON >> Most young Americans want any health care overhaul under President Donald Trump to look a lot like the Affordable Care Act signed into law by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. \n But there's one big exception: A majority of young Americans dislike \"Obamacare's\" requirement that all Americans buy insurance or pay a fine. \n A GenForward poll says a majority of people ages 18 to 30 think the federal government should be responsible for making sure Americans have health insurance. It suggests most young Americans won't be content with a law offering \"access\" to coverage, as Trump and Republicans in Congress proposed in doomed legislation they dropped March 24. The Trump administration is talking this week of somehow reviving the legislation. \n Conducted Feb. 16 through March 6, before the collapse of the GOP bill, the poll shows that 63 percent of young Americans approve of the Obama-era health care law. It did not measure reactions to the Republican proposal. \n The most popular element of the law is allowing young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26, which is favored by 75 percent of 18-30 year olds. It's not just that they personally benefit \u2014 an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in January found that provision was equally popular among all adults. That proposal was included in the failed GOP overhaul. \n But the Republican plan also contained provisions that most young Americans \u2014 the racially diverse electorate of the future \u2014 do not support, according to the poll. Two-thirds of young people agree with a smaller majority of Americans overall that the government should make sure people have health care coverage. And they understand that will cost more: Sixty-three percent want the government to increase spending to help people afford insurance. \n Those feelings cut across racial lines and include most whites, who formed the base of Trump's political support in the presidential election. \n \"I do believe the government should offer it because we pay taxes,\" said Rachel Haney, 27, of Tempe, Arizona. \"I do feel like it's a right.\" \n GenForward is a survey of adults age 18 to 30 by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the AP-NORC Center. The poll pays special attention to the voices of young adults of color, highlighting how race and ethnicity shape the opinions of a new generation. \n Only about a quarter of young people want \"Obamacare\" repealed. That includes 16 percent of young adults who want it repealed and replaced as Trump has vowed and another 10 percent who want it repealed without a replacement. \n Just over a third of young whites want to see the law repealed, making them more likely than those of other racial and ethnic groups to say so. \n \"He just wants to protect us from al-Qaida, and terrorism,\" said Kervin Dorsainvil, 18, a computer technician from Port Charlotte, Florida. \"I feel like health care should be much higher on the list. I feel like we have the resources, the medical technology and everything in place to provide the health care to the people. So why wouldn't we do that?\" \n Young people are more likely than Americans overall to say the government should make sure people have health care. A recent AP-NORC poll of U.S. adults, conducted during and after the collapse of the GOP proposal, found just 52 percent called it a federal government responsibility to make sure all Americans have coverage. \n Despite their overall approval of \"Obamacare,\" young Americans' views on the law aren't all rosy. Just a third say the law is working relatively well, while another third think the health care policy has serious problems. About 2 in 10 consider the law to be fatally flawed. \n The law's requirement that all Americans buy insurance or pay a fine is opposed by 54 percent of young people and favored by just 28 percent. \n On the other hand, 71 percent favor the law's Medicaid expansion, 66 percent of young adults favor the prohibition on denying people coverage because of a person's medical history, 65 percent favor requiring insurance plans to cover the full cost of birth control, 63 percent favor requiring most employers to pay a fine if they don't offer insurance and 53 percent favor paying for benefit increases with higher payroll taxes for higher earners. \n About a quarter of young adults say they personally have insurance through their parents, while another 1 in 10 have purchased insurance through an exchange. \n The poll of 1,833 adults age 18-30 was conducted using a sample drawn from the probability-based GenForward panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. young adult population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4 percentage points.  \n The survey was paid for by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago, using grants from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Ford Foundation.  \n Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone.  \n ONLINE \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Poll: Most young people say government should pay for health care"}

{"date": "April 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. paused during a news conference today on Capitol Hill in Washington. Ryan said Republicans are talking about reviving the failed health care bill, but said it would be premature to say where the legislation stands or how much support it could garner. \n WASHINGTON >> Republicans entertained a fresh White House offer to revise the party's failed health care bill today as the GOP tried to resuscitate the measure that crashed spectacularly less than two weeks ago. But the proposal was getting mixed reviews from both conservative and moderate lawmakers, raising doubts about the rescue mission. \n \"We're at the concept stage right now,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan. The Wisconsin Republican said he believed his party was moving toward consensus but conceded he didn't know if the House would vote on the measure before beginning a two-week recess later this week. \n Vice President Mike Pence, who's been touting the administration's new bid to congressional Republicans, said today that he and President Donald Trump were optimistic. \n \"The president and I remain confident that working with the Congress we will repeal and replace Obamacare with health care reform that will work for the American people and work for the American economy,\" he said. \n Pence and two top White House officials made the offer Monday night in a closed-door meeting with members of the House Freedom Caucus, participants said. Opposition from the hard-line group, which has around three dozen conservative Republicans, helped prompt Ryan to withdraw the bill from a March 24 vote that would have produced a certain defeat. \n Under the White House proposal, states could apply for federal waivers from several coverage requirements that President Barack Obama's 2010 health care law imposes on insurers. \n These would include waivers from an Affordable Care Act provision that obliges insurers to cover \"essential health benefits,\" including mental health, maternity and substance abuse services. The current version of the GOP legislation would erase that coverage requirement but would let states reimpose it on their own. \n \"The biggest change was putting the essential health benefits back in,\" said Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y. \"That really took some this Morning group folks to yes from no,\" he said, using the name of an organization of House GOP moderates. \n The White House offer would also let states seek an exemption to the law's requirement that insurers must offer coverage to people with serious diseases. Conservatives have argued that such requirements have the effect of inflating insurance costs. \n Freedom Caucus members said they wanted to see the White House offer in writing \u2014 expected today \u2014 before deciding whether to accept it. In the meantime, caucus chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., called Monday's session a \"good meeting.\" \n One member of that caucus, Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., said today he remained opposed to the legislation. He said states should be allowed to unilaterally opt out of Obama's insurance requirements, not seek federal permission to do so. \n \"It is wrong to require the states to come to Washington, D.C., on bended knee,\" Brooks said. \n Another member of the caucus \u2014 Scott Perry of Pennsylvania \u2014 cited previous rewrite problems. \n \"We've had the same kind of conversations in the past. And then when you see the language, it isn't what you spoke about,\" Perry said. \n Moderates expressed a reluctance to vote quickly on a new bill. \n \"If leadership hasn't learned the lessons of the failures of two weeks ago, then they'll bring something forward where nobody knows about it and try and get it passed,\" said Rep. Jim Renacci, R-Ohio. \n When Ryan pulled the legislation from the House last month, he had faced opposition from moderate GOP lawmakers upset that it went too far with cuts in Medicaid coverage for the poor and higher premiums for many low earners and people in their 50s and 60s. \n Also at Monday evening's meeting with conservatives were White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and budget director Mick Mulvaney. \n The details of the conservatives' meeting with Pence and others were described by Meadows and another participant who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private strategy session. \n The Freedom Caucus has drawn the most wrath for its opposition to the bill. Trump has tweeted threats of opposing members' 2018 re-elections, and fellow House Republicans have accused them of inflexibility that led to the downfall of the bill. \n AP reporters Erica Werner, Richard Lardner and Ken Thomas contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "White House woos GOP lawmakers with revised health care bill"}

{"date": "April 4, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin, addressed a House Veterans' Affairs Committee's hearing, March 7, on Captiol Hill in Washington. The Department of Veterans Affairs is telling skeptical lawmakers it has already fixed problems with its suicide hotline that were highlighted in an internal watchdog's report released just two weeks ago. \n WASHINGTON >> The Department of Veterans Affairs told skeptical lawmakers today it has already fixed problems with its suicide hotline that were highlighted in an internal watchdog's report released just two weeks ago. \n A March 20 audit by the VA inspector general had found that nearly a third of calls to the Veterans Crisis Line as recently as November were bounced to backup centers run by an outside contractor. The rollover calls happen when phone lines are busy, leading to possible waits of 30 minutes or more. \n It was unwelcome news for VA Secretary David Shulkin, who has made suicide prevention a signature issue at the troubled agency, riven with scandal since reports of delays in treatment at veterans' hospitals last year. \n Approximately 20 veterans take their lives each day. Testifying before a House panel, Steve Young, VA's deputy undersecretary for health for operations and management, pointed to a dramatic turnaround in calls answered by the hotline since November, indicating that the most serious issues have been resolved. \n The crisis hotline \"is the strongest it has been since its inception in 2007,\" Young told the House Veterans Affairs Committee. He described the hotline in recent months as \"offering superior access for veterans during their time of need.\" \n Calls to the Veterans Crisis Line that rolled over to backup centers steadily declined from 31 percent in early November, to just 0.1 percent as of March 25, according to internal VA data released today. That came despite growing workloads in which weekly calls to the hotline jumped from 10,558 in November to 13,966 last month, the VA said. \n As recently as mid-December, when the IG was finalizing its audit, the share of rollover calls had declined close to the VA's goal of 10 percent. That figure dropped to less than 1 percent by early January, according to the agency. \n Shulkin, who previously served as VA's top health official, has also described the issue as resolved. \"Fixing the Veterans Crisis Line was a critical step in keeping our commitment to veterans,\" he said in a March 21 statement. \n That drew some sharp retorts from lawmakers. \n Minnesota Rep. Tim Walz, the top Democrat on the House panel, pointed to \"re-occuring issues we see time and time again at VA\" that were identified by the IG, such as poor training, weak leadership and lack of clear procedures. The crisis hotline has operated without a permanent director for more than year. \n \"These have not been addressed,\" he said. \"I would be very careful in saying you fixed the problems.\" \n Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., a physician who chairs the House committee, questioned whether the VA intended to fully implement reforms. \"There is very clearly a need for more to be done \u2014 and soon \u2014 so that we can be assured that every veteran or family member who contacts the VCL gets the urgent help he or she needs every single time without fail or delay.\" \n VA inspector general Michael Missal said he cannot confirm the VA's latest data, but emphasized that the Veterans Health Administration had not implemented any of the IG's proposed improvements, dating back to February 2016. The department had previously \"concurred\" with the report's March 20 findings. \"Until VHA implements fully these recommendations, they will continue to have challenges,\" he said. \n Missal also identified fresh problems, such as inadequate procedures to measure the hotline's success in thwarting suicide attempts. \n Launched in 2007, the crisis hotline has answered nearly 2.8 million calls and dispatched emergency services more than 74,000 times, figures show. Featured in a documentary that won an Oscar in 2015, it later received negative attention after its former director reported frequent rollovers due to poor work habits. Last year, Congress passed a law requiring that all calls and messages to the hotline be answered in a timely manner. \n The most recent rollover problems appear to stem from the VA's opening of a second call center last October. \n Spurred by veterans' complaints, the IG said the department launched a follow-up review to its February 2016 audit in which the VA promised to make improvements by last September. Instead, it found many rollover calls, due in part to the VA's decision to divert some staff from its upstate New York call center to help train new workers in Atlanta. \n The IG suggested the Atlanta center was slow in becoming operational, but the VA says that rollover calls in fact began to fall significantly as workers became trained. \n It wouldn't be the first time the VA disagreed with auditors. Both the VA inspector general and the Government Accountability Office previously found the department's figures on wait times for medical care to be misleading, which the VA disputes. The GAO still lists the VA as \"high risk\" for waste, fraud or mismanagement. \n The Veterans of Foreign Wars organization said the latest VA data might be accurate, but said it was worried that the agency sometimes focuses too much on metrics \u2014 the number of calls received and handled. It urged better call monitoring to improve training and service. \n \"The VFW believes that while the number of calls going to backup centers decreasing at such a rapid rate is a positive, it is not a sign of the quality of work being provided,\" said Kayda Keleher, VFW's legislative associate. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "VA defending work to fix troubled veteran suicide hotline"}

Al Franken, D-Minn., questioned the Republican side as the panel met to advance the nomination of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, Monday, on Capitol Hill in Washington. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Supreme Court Justice nominee Neil Gorsuch testified on Capitol Hill, March 21, in Washington during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, wrapped up a meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington, Monday, after his panel voted along party lines on the nomination of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. \n WASHINGTON >> Democrats have secured the votes to block President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee under current rules, putting the Senate on a partisan collision course over confirming Neil Gorsuch to a lifetime appointment that could reverberate for decades. \n Debate over the 49-year-old appellate judge gets under way in the full Senate today, with Republicans and Democrats bitterly divided over the next steps. \n While Democrats have the votes for a filibuster, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is ready to lead the GOP in a unilateral change in a Senate floor procedure so significant that it has been dubbed the \"nuclear option.\" The tactic if invoked would lower the confirmation threshold to a filibuster-proof simple majority of 51 votes in the 100-member Senate rather than the 60 votes currently needed to stop delaying tactics by opponents. \n The likelihood of more partisan wrangling left veteran GOP senators frustrated \u2014 and hoping that Democrats would relent in their opposition to the Colorado jurist. \n The nuclear option would be \"damaging to the Senate, damaging to them and damaging to the country. Maybe a light will come on somewhere,\" said Sen. Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican. \n After hours of debate Monday, the Judiciary Committee voted 11-9, along party lines, to send Gorsuch's nomination to the full Senate, where McConnell, R-Ky., has vowed he will be confirmed on Friday. \n Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware became the key 41st vote for the Democrats, declaring during a committee debate that Gorsuch's conservative record showed an activist approach to the law, often in favor of business interests, and that he evaded questions during his confirmation hearings. Coons also said that Republicans' treatment of former President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, left lasting scars after they denied him so much as a hearing following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia early last year. \n \"We are at a historic moment in the history of the United States Senate\" due to actions by both parties, Coons said. \"We have eroded the process for reaching agreement and dishonored our long traditions of acting above partisanship.\" \n The long-term consequences of the coming confrontation could be profound, as the rules change Republicans intend to enact would apply to future Supreme Court nominees as well, allowing them to be voted onto the court without any input from the minority party. And though predicting a justice's votes can be difficult, confirmation of the 49-year-old Gorsuch is expected to restore the conservative majority that existed while Scalia was alive and that majority could be expanded in coming decades if Republicans remain in control of the process. Some of the more liberal justices are among the oldest on the court, so more court openings could pop up. \n For Republicans and Trump, Gorsuch's confirmation would be a moment of triumph, a bright spot in a troubled young administration that's failed on the legislative front with the health care bill and is under investigation over Russia connections. The nomination of Gorsuch, by contrast, has won universal praise from Republicans, some of whom call his appointment Trump's best move so far as president. \n Gorsuch has spent more than a decade on the federal appeals bench in Denver where he's issued consistently conservative rulings, and he appeared on Trump's list of potential candidates partly generated by the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation during the campaign. \n Gorsuch's confirmation would also serve as vindication for McConnell's strategy of refusing to fill Scalia's seat last year, instead leaving it open for the next president, even though few imagined then that that person would be Trump. \n The showdown over the \"nuclear option,\" expected on the Senate floor Thursday, is likely to be accompanied by much hand-wringing from senators bemoaning the decay of the chamber's traditions of bipartisanship and comity. \n But both parties are to blame. When the Democrats were in the majority, they removed the 60-vote threshold for nominees to federal benches lower in the judicial system than the Supreme Court. This change came in 2013 as Republicans, who were in the minority at the time, were blocking Obama picks for critical court vacancies. Republicans said at the time that Democrats would come to regret the move. \n Gorsuch will be confirmed \"and he should be,\" John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said during Monday's debate. \"If Judge Gorsuch is unacceptable to our Democratic colleagues, there will never be a nominee by this president that you will find acceptable. Never.\" \n Gorsuch now counts 55 supporters in the Senate: the 52 Republicans, along with three moderate Democrats from states Trump won last November \u2014 Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. A fourth Senate Democrat, Michael Bennet from Gorsuch's home state of Colorado, has said he will not join in the filibuster against Gorsuch but has not said how he will vote on final passage. \n Democrats claim the Republicans' treatment of Garland was worse than anything they ever did or are doing, and with Trump in the White House they are under intense pressure from liberal voters to oppose the president on every front. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Senate begins debate on Gorsuch, headed for showdown"}
