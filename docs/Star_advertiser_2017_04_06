{"date": "April 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Lee Jae-yong, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co., arrives for his trial at the Seoul Central District Court in Seoul, South Korea today. The scion of South Korea's Samsung business empire Lee Jae-yong, has appeared in court on trial for bribery and other charges. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> The scion of South Korea's Samsung business empire, Lee Jae-yong, appeared in court Friday to face trial for bribery and other charges. \n Lee sat quietly and did not speak as South Korean prosecutors presented a slew of evidence they said showed why and how the 48-year-old used 43 billion won ($38 million) in corporate funds to bribe the country's impeached president, Park Geun-hye, and a close confidante of hers, mainly in exchange for supporting a smooth leadership transition at Samsung. \n The prosecutors focused on Lee's alleged motivation for seeking government help with a father-to-son leadership transition in the country's largest business group. \n Samsung has denied any wrongdoing and Lee, who was arrested in February, has pleaded not guilty. \n Lee assumed de facto leadership of the conglomerate after his father Lee Kun-hee, who is Samsung Electronics' chairman, fell sick in May 2014. \n Stakes in the trial are high for both sides, since it involves the princeling of South Korea's richest family. \n Prosecutors blamed close ties between the government and big business for the scandal that toppled Park and has implicated dozens of other people at a number of chaebol, or big business conglomerates. \n Such relations may have aided South Korea's rapid economic ascent but now are a source of growing public discontent and a key target of contenders in a May 9 snap presidential election. \n For Samsung, a conviction could hurt Lee's stature as future leader of the company founded by his grandfather. \n The prosecutors said their evidence includes 39 handwritten notebooks where a former economic adviser of the impeached South Korean president scribbled down her orders. They argued that the huge sum of corporate money was used for Lee's personal benefit \u2014 to secure a business merger and lobby regulators to help strengthen his control over Samsung. \n Lee is \"the biggest beneficiary who reaped enormous profits,\" said special prosecutor Yang Jae-sik, according to a media pool report. Yang denied Lee's argument that Samsung was coerced into giving Park and Choi money, saying the victims of the dealings were national pension fund holders, affiliates of Samsung and its shareholders, who suffered losses due to a merger allegedly engineered for Lee's sake. \n Lee faces five charges that could entail at least five years in prison if he is found guilty. A ruling is expected by late May. \n One of his lawyers, Song Woo-chul, presented about 70 slides in a presentation, contending the prosecutors' argument was unreal and \"full of contradictions.\" \n Song said Samsung was unaware of Park's friend, Choi Soon-sil, until after the scandal over their relationship and allegations of influence-peddling surfaced late last year. Samsung did not need Park's help with the 2015 merger, which was aimed at helping Samsung's future growth, not aiding the leadership succession, Song contended. \n \"Prosecutors argue that Lee Jae-yong needed to take excessive measures for the leadership succession due to the sudden illness of Chairman Lee Kun-hee. But there was no such need,\" Song said. \n Even as the Samsung de facto leader and four other executives face corruption charges, the latest earnings preview showed the company's business is thriving. \n Samsung Electronics, the world's largest maker of smartphones and display panels, said Friday is expecting its best quarterly profit in more than three years thanks to the booming memory chip business. \n The company's stock is trading near historic highs, despite Lee's troubles and the scrapping last year of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone due to fire-prone batteries. \n Samsung's January-March operating income rose 48 percent to 9.9 trillion won ($8.8 billion), from 6.7 trillion won a year earlier. The result was higher than the market expectations. \n Samsung is due to give more details of its financial results later this month. Last week, it presented and began taking preorders for its Galaxy S8, its first major smartphone launch since the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trial of Samsung heir focuses on father-to-son succession"}

Their first-night summit dinner wrapped up shortly before the U.S. announced the missile barrage on an air base in Syria in retaliation against Syrian President Bashar Assad for a chemical weapons attack against civilians caught up in his country's long civil war. \n Ahead of the Thursday night dinner with their wives, Trump said he and Xi already had had a long discussion and had \"developed a friendship,\" and then joked, \"I have gotten nothing, absolutely nothing.\" \n The White House downplayed expectations for a breakthrough on issues like trade and tariffs, insisting that the 24-hour summit is mostly an introductory meeting for the two leaders. Within Trump's administration, divisions remain over how to approach China. \n Still, the crisis in North Korea was a top priority for Trump in the meetings with Xi. The American president told reporters traveling with him to Florida that he thinks China will \"want to be stepping up\" in trying to deter North Korea's nuclear ambitions. \n While Trump would not say what he wants China to do specifically, he suggested there was a link between \"terrible\" trade agreements the U.S. has made with China and Pyongyang's provocations. He said the two issues \"really do mix.\" \n Trump has said that if China doesn't exert more pressure on North Korea, the U.S. will act alone. The missile strikes on Syria bring more weight to that statement. \n Both as a candidate and president, Trump has taken an aggressive posture toward China, labeling Beijing a \"tremendous problem\" and arguing that lopsided trade deals with China shortchange American businesses and workers. Last week, the president predicted in a tweet that his meeting with Xi would be \"very difficult.\" \n Ahead of the summit, Trump signed a pair of executive orders focused on reducing the U.S. trade deficit, an apparent shot at China, which accounted for the vast bulk \u2014 $347 billion \u2014 of last year's $502 billion trade deficit. \n For his part, Xi was expected to seek assurances that Trump will not interfere in the territorial dispute over the South China Sea or question the \"One China\" policy by reaching out to Taiwan's leader again, as Trump did during the transition. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump, Xi meet again \u2013 in shadow of missile strikes on Syria"}

{"date": "April 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Baltimore Police Department Commissioner Kevin Davis speaks at a news conference at the department's headquarters in Baltimore, in response to the Department of Justice's request for a 90-day delay of a hearing on its proposed overhaul of the police department. \n BALTIMORE >> The Trump Justice Department expressed \"grave concerns\" about an agreement the Obama administration reached with the city of Baltimore to overhaul its police department in the wake of the racially explosive Freddie Gray case. \n A government attorney weighed in on the proposed consent decree at a public hearing Thursday as about 50 Baltimore residents lined up to endorse the reforms and complain of deep-seated racism, abuse and deadly force at the hands of the police. \n \"The consent decree needs to be passed for us to feel we can call on the Baltimore Police Department without them making us into the criminals when we are the victims,\" black high school student Shane-jah McCaffity said. \n But Justice Department lawyer John Gore said Attorney General Jeff Sessions is worried about whether the agreement \"will achieve the goals of public safety and law enforcement while at the same time protecting civil rights.\" \n Gore said there has been a spike in crime in Baltimore and the administration wants to make sure the agreement \"will help rather than hinder public safety.\" \n The stand represents the start of what appears to be a retreat by President Donald Trump's administration from the federal consent decrees that have been put in place in several U.S. cities in recent years to root out racism, excessive force and other abuses against minorities. \n In April 2015, Baltimore erupted in the worst rioting in decades over the death of Gray, a 25-year-old black man whose neck was broken during what prosecutors said was a jolting ride in a police van while handcuffed and shackled. \n The Justice Department launched an investigation and issued a scathing report outlining widespread mistreatment of black people, including excessive force and unlawful stops. The proposed agreement to remedy the abuses was negotiated during the final days of President Barack Obama's administration. \n Baltimore Solicitor David Ralph said Thursday that the plan was designed to help police fight crime while also protecting residents' rights and repairing trust between the community and the department. \n The plan discourages officers from writing up minor offenses such as loitering and bars them from arresting people simply because they are in high-crime areas. It also calls for more training for officers on handling mentally ill people, and the continuation of a program that is issuing body cameras to all officers. \n The agreement is subject to approval by U.S. District Judge James Bredar. It would then be up to him to make sure the parties abide by it. \n The Justice Department initially wanted the judge to postpone the hearing. He refused, and now the department wants him to delay signing the agreement for at least 30 days. Bredar did not indicate when he would decide on the plan. \n The Obama Justice Department opened roughly two dozen investigations of police departments, and 14 of them ended in consent decrees, in such cities as Ferguson, Missouri; Miami; Cleveland; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Newark, New Jersey. \n In a memo made public this week, however, Sessions ordered a review of all such consent decrees, saying the federal government should not be managing local law enforcement agencies. He also said heavy scrutiny of the police is making them less aggressive and leading to a rise in crime in some cities. \n Nearly all residents who testified Thursday voiced strong support for the consent decree and urged the judge to sign it swiftly. \n \"Non-white residents feel distrustful, attacked, bullied, defensive, scared, scarred and singled out,\" said Shantay Guy, a community mediator. \"Officers generally feel misunderstood, ill-equipped, labeled, targeted, mischaracterized, stereotyped, demoralized, criticized and limited.\" \n She added: \"Both groups indicate that change is important to them \u2014 change in their interactions with each other that give them the safety and respect they're looking for.\" \n The judge also heard from mothers whose sons were killed by police. \n \"I don't know if the officer was anxious, but he shouldn't have been the judge, jury and executioner,\" said Darlene Cain, who said she lost her 29-year-old son. \n \"It's very important for all of our children to realize their lives matter. And I want the police department to know: It is crucial that we stop burying our children every single day. It is crucial that our children stop getting killed by the Baltimore city police.\" \n Mayor Catherine Pugh and Police Commissioner Kevin Davis have vowed to press on with police reform regardless of what happens with the consent decree. But they stressed they would prefer to see a court-enforceable agreement. \n Gene Ryan, president of Baltimore's police union, has complained that the union wasn't involved enough in the negotiations, and he supported the Justice Department's request to delay the proceedings. \n After the hearing, the judge praised those who testified. \n \"Let this be a model of how we continue to relate to each other in confronting some very challenging circumstances,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Justice Department cites Baltimore police reform 'concerns'"}

{"date": "April 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the Senate will resume debate on Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, pictured, on Friday, with a vote expected about midday. \n WASHINGTON >> In a confrontation that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations, Republicans tore up the Senate's voting rules Thursday to allow Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch to ascend to the high court over furious Democratic objections. \n Democrats denounced the GOP's use of what both sides dubbed the \"nuclear option\" to put Gorsuch on the court, calling it an epic power grab that would further corrode politics in Congress, the courts and the nation. Many Republicans bemoaned reaching that point, too, but they blamed Democrats for pushing them to it. \n \"We will sadly point to today as a turning point in the history of the Senate and the Supreme Court,\" declared Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \n \"This is going to be a chapter, a monumental event in the history of the Senate, not for the better but for the worse,\" warned Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a senior Republican. \n A final confirmation vote on Gorsuch is expected Friday, and he should be sworn in soon to hear the final cases of the term. He was nominated by President Donald Trump shortly after the January inauguration. \n The Senate change, affecting how many votes a nominee needs for confirmation, will apply to all future Supreme Court candidates, likely ensuring more ideological justices chosen with no need for consultation with the minority party. Trump himself predicted to reporters aboard Air Force One that \"there could be as many as four\" Supreme Court vacancies for him to fill during his administration. \n \"In fact, under a certain scenario, there could even be more than that,\" Trump said. There is no way to know how many there will be, if any, but several justices are quite elderly. \n Even as they united in indignation, lawmakers of both parties, pulled by fierce political forces from left and right, were unwilling to stop the confirmation rules change. \n The maneuvering played out in a tense Senate chamber with most members in their seats, a rare and theatrical occurrence. \n First Democrats tried to mount a filibuster in an effort to block Gorsuch by denying him the 60 votes needed to advance to a final vote. That was successful only briefly, as Gorsuch fell five votes short. Then Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., raised a point of order, suggesting that Supreme Court nominees should not be subjected to a 60-vote threshold but instead a simple majority in the 100-member Senate. \n McConnell was overruled, but he appealed the ruling. And on that he prevailed on a 52-48 party-line vote. The 60-vote filibuster requirement on Supreme Court nominees was effectively gone, and with it the last vestige of bipartisanship on presidential nominees in an increasingly polarized Senate. \n The developments were accompanied by unusually bitter accusations and counter-accusations. And yet in many ways the showdown had been pre-ordained, the final chapter in years of partisan warfare over judicial nominees. \n In 2005, with the Senate under GOP control, Republicans prepared to utilize the \"nuclear option\" to remove the filibuster for lower-court nominees. A bipartisan deal at the time headed off that change. But then in 2013, with Democrats in charge and Republicans blocking President Barack Obama's nominees, the Democrats did take the step, removing the filibuster for all presidential appointments except the Supreme Court. \n McConnell accused Democrats of forcing his hand by trying to filibuster a highly qualified nominee in Gorsuch, 49, a 10-year veteran of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver with a consistently conservative record. \n \"This is the latest escalation in the left's never-ending judicial war, the most audacious yet, and it cannot and will not stand,\" McConnell said. \n But Democrats were unable to pull back from the brink, partly because they remain livid over McConnell's decision last year to block Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, who was denied even a hearing after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016. Instead McConnell kept Scalia's seat open, a calculation that is now paying off for Republicans and Trump. \n Even as Graham and other senior Republicans lamented the voting change, McConnell and some allies argued that all they were doing was returning to a time, not long ago, when filibusters of judicial nominees were unusual, and it was virtually unheard-of to try to block a Supreme Court nominee in that fashion. Even Clarence Thomas got onto the court without a filibuster despite highly contentious confirmation hearings involving sexual harassment claims. \n Some senators fear that the next to go could be the legislative filibuster, one of the last remaining mechanisms to force bipartisan cooperation on Capitol Hill. Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Chris Coons of Delaware were circulating a letter to colleagues Thursday in support of keeping the filibuster in place for legislation. \n With his final vote set for Friday, Gorsuch counts 55 supporters: the 52 Republicans, along with three moderate Democrats from states that Trump won \u2014 Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. A fourth Senate Democrat, Michael Bennet from Gorsuch's home state of Colorado, refused to join in the filibuster Thursday but announced he would vote against Gorsuch's confirmation. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Senate vote on Gorsuch expected midday Friday"}

{"date": "April 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2016 \n Rep. Tulsi Gabbard met twice in January with President Bashar Assad during a trip with her husband to Syria and Lebanon. She told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser in February that she thought it was important to meet with adversaries if there is any chance it will bring about peace. \n Two members of Hawaii's congressional delegation condemned President Donald Trump's air strike on a Syrian air force base, with U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard invoking the possibility of nuclear war among the potential ramifications. \n In Syria early today (Thursday in Hawaii), U.S. cruise missiles rained down on the military base suspected to be the origin of a deadly chemical bomb air attack on Syrian civilians earlier this week. \n Gabbard criticized the U.S. air strike in a written statement. \"It angers and saddens me that President Trump has taken the advice of war hawks and escalated our illegal regime change war to overthrow the Syrian government,\" Gabbard said. \"This escalation is short-sighted and will lead to more dead civilians, more refugees, the strengthening of al-Qaeda and other terrorists, and a possible nuclear war between the United States and Russia.\" \n Gabbard met twice in January with Syrian President Bashar Assad during a much-criticized trip with her husband to Syria and Lebanon. The trip's organizers have ties to a pro-Assad political party. She also met with the Muslim critic who threatened the U.S. with suicide bombers. She told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser in February that it was important to meet with adversaries if there is any chance it will bring about peace. \n \"This administration has acted recklessly without care or consideration of the dire consequences of the United States attack on Syria without waiting for the collection of evidence from the scene of the chemical poisoning,\" Gabbard said in her statement last night. \n \"If President Assad is indeed guilty of this horrible chemical attack on innocent civilians, I will be the first to call for his prosecution and execution by the International Criminal Court,\" she said. \"However, because of our attack on Syria, this investigation may now not even be possible. And without such evidence, a successful prosecution will be much harder.\" \n U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz released a statement condemning both the use of chemical weapons and the U.S. air strike. \"The Assad regime's use of chemical weapons is abhorrent, but a military response is not the answer,\" he said. \"The president has failed to articulate a strategy to end the Syrian civil war. A one-off strike may satisfy our desire to hold Assad accountable, but it risks deeper escalation without any sense of direction or objective. And unless this conflict ends, we will never defeat ISIL and prevent its return. \n \"Regardless, Congress must debate and authorize any escalation of U.S. military involvement against the Syria regime, as it is well beyond the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force,\" he said. \"The United States must focus on leading a diplomatic effort among our partners and allies in the region to achieve a political solution that results in a post-Assad Syrian government that brings stability to the region.\" \n The other two members of Hawaii's all-Democrat congressional delegation were less critical of the U.S. attack, while saying the Republican president must present a strategy for dealing with war-torn Syria. \n U.S. Sen. Mazie K. Hirono, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said, \"The repeated use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime against his own people is an atrocity and breach of international law, and the international community must hold him accountable. The Civil War in Syria adds layers of complexity in a country and region where there are no easy answers and opportunities for missteps are great. \n \"In light of this, President Trump must present a coherent strategy for addressing the ongoing situation in Syria, including our own responsibility in confronting the humanitarian catastrophe and refugee crisis,\" she said. \n U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement, \"The U.S. strikes on Syrian military assets Thursday night were a targeted and measured response to what is widely believed to be Bashar al-Assad's uncivilized and atrocious use of chemical weapons against his own people, especially the children. \n \"While the U.S. cannot ignore the internationally banned use of chemical weapons, the president's failure to seek Congressional approval is unlawful and I expect that in the days and weeks ahead, President Trump will work in close coordination with Congress to clarify his administration's plan to address the civil war in Syria, restore stability in the region and protect the innocent lives of those living in the war-torn state. Further, Congress and the American people deserve a clearer understanding of President Trump's short term and long term strategies in Syria and the region.\" \n ", "author": "By Leila Fujimori lfujimori@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Gabbard: U.S. missile attack on Syria could lead to nuclear war with Russia"}

At right is his daughter Ivanka Trump. \n WASHINGTON >> The U.S. missile strikes Thursday on a Syrian air base were conducted without formal congressional approval. Some questions and answers about how and why presidents can conduct military action without permission from the 535 representatives of the American people. \n DID CONGRESS KNOW?  \n Trump did let Congress know of his plans to launch 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles Thursday evening, targeting the air base from which Syrian President Bashar Assad launched a chemical weapons attack earlier this week against his own people, killing more than 80 men, women and children. A White House official said more than two dozen members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, were briefed Thursday by White House and Cabinet officials. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the No. 3 U.S. official, said he was among those informed. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n IS INFORMING THEM ENOUGH? DON'T THEY GET A SAY? \n The War Powers Resolution, enacted in 1973, long after American troops began fighting in Vietnam, required the president to consult with Congress before sending U.S. armed forces into combat unless there already had been a declaration of war. The troops could not stay more than 90 days unless lawmakers backed the decision. The law also sought to give the president \"leeway to respond to attacks or other emergencies,\" according to the Council on Foreign Relations. \n And it is that leeway that presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and now Trump have used to their advantage. Following the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001, Congress gave Bush authority to attack any countries or groups involved in the attacks, which was generally accepted to mean al-Qaida. Obama used that same authority to fight the Islamic State militant group, which emerged in 2014 as an outgrowth of al-Qaida. Trump has used that same authority to continue military action in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. \n The Obama administration maintained in 2011 that U.S. involvement in the months-long air campaign against Libya didn't require congressional permission because American forces were largely playing a supporting role as part of an international coalition. \n In February 2015, Obama asked Congress to formally authorize war against the Islamic State, saying the militant group could threaten the U.S. homeland if left unchecked. His resolution would have limited authorization to three years, with no geographic restrictions for U.S. forces. It would have banned \"enduring offensive combat operations,\" an ambiguous term that attempted to define a middle ground between Democrats leery of another protracted Middle Eastern conflict involving ground troops, and Republicans, who largely believe the U.S. needs maximum flexibility to pursue IS. \n Congress held a few hearings, but never acted on the proposal. \n \u2014\u2014 \n WHAT DOES CONGRESS THINK NOW?  \n Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said before Thursday's missile launch that he thought it would be prudent to consult with Congress, but didn't insist Congress had to approve Trump's actions. \n Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, insisted that if the U.S. increased the use of military force in Syria, \"we should follow the Constitution and seek the proper authorization from Congress.\" Kentucky lawmakers Thomas Massie and Rand Paul, both Republicans, agreed. \n \"President Trump should make his case in front of the American people and allow their elected representatives to debate the benefits and risks of further Middle East intervention to our national security interests,\" Lee said in a statement. \n Other Republicans, like former Trump primary opponent Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, applauded the strikes without mentioning congressional approval. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Can the president attack another country without Congress?"}

That is important or people would be chilled from speaking out, particularly when they are speaking out against the government.\" \n The government so far hasn't specified a reason for wanting to know the identity or identities behind the Twitter handle. \n In the two months of its existence, the account has been critical of the Trump administration's immigration policies and \"highlighted what the user views as a history of waste and mismanagement within USCIS and DHS,\" according to the lawsuit. \n It is one of dozens of rogue Twitter accounts purporting to represent current or former federal employees that have sprung up since Trump took office.

It must prove that a criminal or civil offense has been committed, that it's not asking for information with the intent of suppressing free speech, and that the interests of the investigation outweigh the First Amendment rights of Twitter and its users, Twitter said. \n But the federal agencies and other defendants \"have not come close\" to demonstrating any of this, the lawsuit states. \n \"We are very heartened that Twitter is standing up for its users and making such full-throated defense of their free-speech rights,\" Bhandari said. \n OTHER LAWSUITS \n This is not the first time Twitter has filed suit in defense of its and its users' First Amendment rights. \n In 2012, the company fought back against a court order compelling it to turn over basic user information and tweets from an Occupy Wall Street protester. The protester later pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct. The posts had been public. \n In 2014, Twitter sued the U.S. government (under President Barack Obama) seeking to publish its full \"transparency report\" outlining government requests for information. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Twitter challenges U.S. order for anti-Trump user records"}

President Donald Trump cast the U.S. assault as vital to deter future use of poison gas and called on other nations to join in seeking \"to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria.\" \n RELATED \n It was the first direct American assault on the Syrian government and Trump's most dramatic military order since becoming president just over two months ago. The strikes also risk thrusting the U.S. deeper into an intractable conflict that his predecessor spent years trying to avoid. \n Announcing the assault from his Florida resort, Trump said there was no doubt Syrian President Bashar Assad was responsible for the chemical attack, which he said employed banned gases and killed dozens. \n \"Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,\" Trump declared. \n The U.S. strikes \u201459 missiles launched from the USS Ross and USS Porter \u2014 hit the government-controlled Shayrat air base in central Syria, where U.S. officials say the Syrian military planes that dropped the chemicals had taken off. The U.S. missiles hit at 8:45 p.m. in Washington, 3:45 Friday morning in Syria. The missiles targeted the base's airstrips, hangars, control tower and ammunition areas, officials said. \n The attack killed some Syrians and wounded others, Talal Barazi, the governor of Syria's Homs province, told The Associated Press. He didn't give precise numbers. \n SUPPORTERS OF U.S. ATTACK ON SYRIA \n OPPOSERS OF U.S. ATTACK ON SYRIA \n Trump ordered the strikes without approval from Congress or the backing of the United Nations. U.S. officials said he had the right to use force to defend national interests and to protect civilians from atrocities. \n Syrian state TV reported a U.S. missile attack on a number of military targets and called the attack an \"aggression.\" \n The U.S. assault marked a striking reversal for Trump, who warned as a candidate against the U.S. being pulled into the Syrian civil war that began six years ago. But the president appeared moved by the photos of children killed in the chemical attack, calling it a \"disgrace to humanity\" that crossed \"a lot of lines.\" \n U.S. officials placed some of the blame on Russia, one of Syria's most important benefactors. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, in Florida with Trump, said Moscow had failed in living up to a 2013 agreement that was intended to strip Syria of its chemical weapons stockpiles. \n \"Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of the agreement,\" Tillerson said. \n The U.S. Tomahawk missiles, fired from warships in the Mediterranean Sea, targeted an air base in retaliation for the attack that America believes Syrian government aircraft launched with the nerve agent sarin mixed with chlorine gas. The president did not announce the attacks in advance, though he and other national security officials ratcheted up their warnings to the Syrian government throughout the day Thursday. \n READ MORE: Can the president attack another country without Congress? \n The strike came as Trump was hosting Chinese President Xi Jinping in meetings focused in part on another pressing U.S. security dilemma: North Korea's nuclear program. Trump's actions in Syria could signal to China that the new president isn't afraid of unilateral military steps, even if key nations like China are standing in the way. \n \"This clearly indicates the president is willing to take decisive action when called for,\" Tillerson said. \n Trump has advocated greater counterterrorism cooperation with Russia, Assad's most powerful military backer. Just last week, the Trump administration signaled the U.S. was no longer interested in trying to push Assad from power over his direction of a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and led to the worst refugee crisis since World War II. \n U.S. officials portrayed the strikes as an appropriate, measured response and said they did not signal a broader shift in the Trump administration's approach to the Syrian conflict. \n \"The intent was to deter the regime from doing this again,\" said Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, the Pentagon spokesman. \"It will be the regime's choice if there's any more, and it will be based upon their conduct going forward.\" \n Still, the assault risks plunging America into the middle of Syria's conflict, complicating the safety of the hundreds of U.S. forces fighting a separate campaign against the Islamic State group in the north of the country. If Assad's military persists in further gas attacks, the Trump administration might logically pursue increased retaliation. \n Russia and Iran, Assad's allies, pose other problems. Russian military personnel and aircraft are embedded with Syria's, and Iranian troops and paramilitary forces are also on the ground helping Assad fight the array of opposition groups hoping to topple him. \n Before the strikes, U.S. military officials said they informed their Russian counterparts of the impending attack. The goal was to avoid any accident involving Russian forces. \n Nevertheless, Russia's Deputy U.N. ambassador Vladimir Safronkov warned that any negative consequences from the strikes would be on the \"shoulders of those who initiated such a doubtful and tragic enterprise.\" \n The U.S. also notified its partner countries in the region prior to launching the strikes. \n Trump's decision to attack Syria came three-and-a-half years after President Barack Obama threatened Assad with military action after an earlier chemical weapons attack killed hundreds outside of Damascus. Obama had declared the use of such weapons a \"red line.\" At the time, several American ships in the Mediterranean were poised to launch missiles, only for Obama to abruptly pull back after key U.S. ally Britain and the U.S. Congress balked at his plan. \n He opted instead for a Russian-backed plan that was supposed to remove and eliminate Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles. \n Thursday night's strikes were launched from the USS Ross and USS Porter and landed in the early morning Friday in Syria. \n The world learned of the chemical attack earlier in the week in footage that showed people dying in the streets and bodies of children stacked in piles. The international outcry fueled an emotional response from Trump, who appeared to abandon his much-touted \"America First\" vision for a stance of humanitarian intervention, akin to that of previous American leaders. \"I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity,\" he said Thursday. \n Trump seemed to rapidly reconsider his feelings about Assad, saying: \"He's there and I guess he's running things, so something should happen.\" \n The show of force in Syria raises legal questions. It's unclear what authority Trump is relying on to attack another government. When Obama intervened in Libya in 2011, he used a U.N. Security Council mandate and NATO's overall leadership of the mission to argue that he had legal authority \u2014 arguments that many Republicans opposed. Trump can't rely on either justification here. \n Unclear also is whether Trump is adopting any broader effort to combat Assad. Under Obama, the United States largely pulled back from its support for so-called \"moderate\" rebels when Russia's military intervention in September 2015 led them to suffer a series of battlefield defeats. Instead, Obama sought to work with Russia on a negotiated transition. \n Trump and his top aides had acknowledged in recent days the \"reality\" of Assad being in power, saying his ouster was no longer a priority. But the chemical weapons attack seemed to spur a rethink. In Florida on Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said of Assad: \"There's no role for him to govern the Syrian people.\" \n Click here for the timeline of the Syrian civil war and U.S. response. \n 'To prevent and deter': Trump's statement on Syria strike \n My fellow Americans: \n On Tuesday, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians. Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children. It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror. \n Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the airfield in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched. It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons. There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, and ignored the urging of the U.N. Security Council. \n Years of previous attempts at changing Assad's behavior have all failed, and failed very dramatically. As a result, the refugee crisis continues to deepen and the region continues to destabilize, threatening the United States and its allies. \n Tonight, I call on all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria, and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types. We ask for God's wisdom as we face the challenge of our very troubled world. We pray for the lives of the wounded and for the souls of those who have passed. And we hope that as long as America stands for justice, then peace and harmony will, in the end, prevail. \n Goodnight. And God bless America and the entire world. Thank you. \n BEIRUT >> Below is the latest on events in Syria (all times local): \n 10:45 a.m. \n Russia says it's suspending a deal with the U.S. to prevent mid-air collisions over Syria in response to the U.S. strike on a Syrian air base. \n The Russian Foreign Ministry said in Friday's statement that Moscow is suspending a memorandum with the U.S. to prevent incidents and ensure flight safety. \n Under the memorandum, signed after Russia launched an air campaign in Syria in September 2015, Russia and the U.S. had exchanged information about their flights to avoid incidents in the crowded skies over Syria. \n Russia has several dozen warplanes and batteries of air-defense missiles at its base in Syria. \n ___ \n 10:35 a.m. \n Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed support for the U.S. missile attack on a Syrian government-controlled air base. \n Abe on Friday said Japan understood and supported the U.S. strategy, saying the strikes were \"a means to prevent further deterioration of the situation\" referring to the suspected chemical attack earlier in Syria this week. \n About 60 U.S. Tomahawk missiles hit the Shayrat air base, southeast of Homs, a small installation with two runways, where aircraft often take off to bomb targets in northern and central Syria. \n ___ \n 10:35 a.m. \n Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it's concerned by unilateral foreign actions in Syria including the U.S. attack on a Syrian government air base on Thursday night. \n Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir said Indonesia rejects the use of chemical weapons for any purpose and condemns a chemical weapons attack in Syria earlier this week that killed dozens of civilians. \n But it did not praise President Donald Trump's retaliation against the government of Syria's President Bashar Assad. \n Nasir says, \"We are also very concerned by unilateral actions that have been taken by many parties including the recent launch of Tomahawks in response to the use of chemical weapons.\" \n ___ \n 10:35 a.m. \n NATO's chief was warned that the United States was to launch missile strikes in Syria and is making no comment on the incident. \n Jens Stoltenberg's office said Friday that \"we can confirm that NATO Secretary-General was informed by the US Secretary of Defense prior to the strikes.\" \n But it said \"we refer you to the US authorities regarding the strikes in Syria.\" \n ___ \n 10:25 a.m. \n Syrian military says the U.S. missile attack on one of its air bases in central Syria has killed six and caused extensive damage, calling it an aggression that undermines Damascus' counter terrorism operations. \n The statement read on TV Friday came hours after the U.S. sent nearly 60 Tomahawk missiles into the Shayrat air base, southeast of Homs, the first American attack against the Syrian army since the war started in 2011. \n General Ali Ayyoub , the chief of the General Staff of the Syrian Army, said Washington has used the chemical attack in the northern town of Khan Sheikhoun earlier this week as a \"pretext\" to carry out the \"blatant aggression\" , without knowing what really happened. Syria blames the opposition fighters of stockpiling chemical weapons. \n ___ \n 9:40 a.m. \n A communication link between the U.S. and Russia used to protect their pilots flying sorties over Syria was used ahead of an American missile strike on the country. \n The so-called \"deconfliction line\" is operated by the U.S. military's Central Command at the sprawling al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar. It serves as a crucial link to make sure the increasingly crowded Syrian airspace doesn't see any accidental collisions or attacks on each other. \n Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis says: \"U.S. military planners took precautions to minimize risk to Russian or Syrian personnel located at the airfield\" targeted in Syria's Homs province. U.S. Central Command did not immediately respond to an Associated Press query on specifics of how the line was used. \n About 60 U.S. Tomahawk missiles launched early Friday hit the Shayrat air base, southeast of the city of Homs, a small installation with two runways. The attack came in response for a chemical weapons attack Tuesday in Syria. \n ___ \n 9:35 a.m. \n Turkey has welcomed the U.S. missile strike on Syria, saying it was an \"important and meaningful\" development but called for a continued tough stance against President Bashar Assad that would render him \"no longer able to harm his people.\" \n Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said in a live television interview Friday: \"It is imperative that the Assad regime is fully punished by the international community.\" \n \"We see the (air strikes) as positive, but we believe that this should be completed,\" Kurtulmus said. \"The Assad regime's barbarism must immediately be stopped.\" \n Kurtulmus added that he hoped the U.S. action would help accelerate peace efforts in Syria. \n Turkey is a strong opponent of Syrian President Bashar Assad and has backed the Syrian opposition fighting against him. \n ___ \n 9:20 a.m. \n The Kremlin says President Vladimir Putin believes that the U.S. strike on a Syrian air base is an \"aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law.\" \n Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in Friday's statement carried by Russian news agencies that Putin believes that the U.S. has dealt the strikes under \"far-fetched pretext.\" \n Russia has argued that the death of civilians in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun on Tuesday resulted from Syrian forces hitting a rebel chemical arsenal there. \n Peskov said that the U.S. has ignored past incidents of the use of chemical weapons by Syrian rebels. He argued that the Syrian government has destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles under international control. \n ___ \n 9 a.m. \n A survivor of the chemical attack in a northern Syrian town says he hopes the U.S. missile attack could help put an end to Syrian government airstrikes, creating a safe area for civilians. \n Alaa Alyousef, a 27-year old resident of Khan Sheikhoun, said Friday the U.S. missile attack \"alleviates a small part of our sufferings,\" but he worries it will be like \"anesthetics,\" to save face. AlYousef said the U.S. is capable of \"paralyzing\" Syrian warplanes . \n \"What good is a strike on Shayart air base alone while we have more than 15 other air bases,\" he said. Alyousef lost at least 25 relatives in this week's gruesome chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun. The Syrian government denies it was behind the attack, believed to have deployed chemical weapons. \n ___ \n 8:50 a.m. \n A Syrian official tells The Associated Press that the U.S. missile attack that hit military targets in central Syria has killed three soldiers and two civilians. \n Talal Barazi, the governor of Homs province, said seven others were wounded in the early Friday attack. He had earlier said a fire raged in the air base in Homs for over an hour following the barrage of missiles. \n A Syrian opposition monitor said the attack killed four soldiers, including a general. \n The attack came in fiery retaliation for this week's gruesome chemical weapons attack against civilians. \n ___ \n 7:45 a.m. \n Iran has condemned the U.S. missile strike on Syria, saying the \"unilateral action is dangerous, destructive and violates the principles of international law.\" \n That's according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi. He made the comments in a report carried Friday by the semi-official ISNA news agency. \n Iran is one of the biggest supporters of embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad. Its hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard is deeply involved in the war. America's Sunni Arab allies in the Gulf view Syria as a proxy conflict between it and Shiite power Iran. \n Ghasemi described Iran as \"the biggest victim of chemical weapons in recent history,\" referencing Iraqi use of the weapons during its 1980s war with the Islamic Republic. He said Iran condemned the missile launch \"regardless of the perpetrators and the victims\" of Tuesday's chemical weapons attack in Syria. \n He also warned it would \"strengthen terrorists\" and further add to \"the complexity of the situation in Syria and the region.\" \n ___ \n 8:25 a.m. \n Saudi Arabia is praising the \"courageous decision\" by U.S. President Donald Trump to launch missile strikes on Syria over a deadly chemical weapons attack. \n A statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency on Friday firmly blames the government of embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad for the chemical weapons attack. \n The Saudi Foreign Ministry said the missile launch by Trump was the right response to \"the crimes of this regime to its people in light of the failure of the international community to stop it.\" \n Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia is a longtime opponent of Assad and has supported the rebels fighting against him. It also views the long-running war as a proxy conflict between it and its Middle East archrival, the Shiite power Iran. \n ___ \n 8:20 a.m. \n A senior Russian lawmaker says that U.S. strike on Syria likely has put an end to hopes for Russia-U.S. cooperation in Syria. \n Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the Kremlin-controlled upper house of parliament said on his Facebook that the prospective U.S.-Russian anti-terror coalition has been \"put to rest without even being born.\" \n Kosachev added that \"it's a pity,\" suggesting that Trump had been pressured to act by the Pentagon. \n He added that while \"Russian cruise missiles strike the terrorists, U.S. missiles strike Syrian government forces who are spearheading the fight against the terrorists.\" \n ___ \n 8:10 a.m. \n A Syrian opposition monitor says the U.S. missile attack on an air base in the country's center has killed at least four Syrian soldiers, including a general, and caused extensive damage. \n The head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the early Friday missile attack damaged over a dozen hangars, a fuel depot and an air defense base. \n About 60 U.S. Tomahawk missiles hit the Shayrat air base, southeast of Homs, a small installation with two runways. A Syrian official the attack caused deaths and a fire, but didn't elaborate. \n The U.S. attack came in fiery retaliation to Tuesday's deadly chemical attack that officials said used chlorine mixed with a nerve agent, possibly sarin. More than 80 were killed in that attack that drew wide international condemnation. \n ___ \n 8 a.m. \n Israel's ambassador to the U.N. says the U.S. sent a \"significant message\" to the region and beyond with the attack on a Syrian air base. \n Danny Danon told Channel 10 TV \"it was a moral decision that delivered a triple message.\" He said it told the Syrians to stop using chemical weapons and sent a message to Iran and North Korea. He said it also told the international community that \"if the U.N. is incapable of acting in these situations it will lead.\" \n Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier \"this message of resolve in the face of the Assad regime's horrific actions will resonate not only in Damascus, but in Tehran, Pyongyang and elsewhere.\" \n Israel's military says it was notified ahead of the strike. \n ___ \n 7:55 a.m. \n Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says the \"Australian government strongly supports the swift and just response of the United States\" in launching a rocket attack on a Syrian air base. \n He tells reporters in Sydney on Friday: \"This was a calibrated, proportionate and targeted response. It sends a strong message to the Assad regime, and \u2026 has been struck at the very airfield from which the chemical attack was delivered.\" \n \"But we are not at war with the Assad regime and the United States have made it clear that they are not seeking to overthrow the Assad regime,\" he added. \n ___ \n 7:45 a.m. \n Russia's Foreign Ministry says it is preparing a statement regarding U.S. strikes on a Syrian base. \n Shortly before the strikes, the head of information policy commission in the upper house of Russian parliament, Alexei Pushkov, said on Twitter said that if Trump launches a military action in Syria it would put him in \"the same league with Bush and Obama.\" \n Russian deputy envoy to the U.N., Vladimir Safronkov, said Russia had warned the U.S. to \"think about what military actions have led to in Iraq, Libya and other countries,\" according to the Interfax news agency. \n ___ \n 7:30 a.m. \n A Syrian official tells The Associated Press that the U.S. missile attack that hit a number of military targets in central Syria has left a number of dead and wounded. \n Talal Barazi, the governor of Homs province, didn't say how many were killed in the early Friday attack. He said a fire raged in the air base in Homs for over an hour following the barrage of missiles. \n Barazi says the evacuation and transfer of casualties is ongoing. He called the air base, which is about 45 kilometers (28 miles) east of the city of Homs, a \"supporting base\" for Syria's fight against terrorism. \n Islamic State group militants operate in the central Homs province. Activists and rebels say the base serves as one of the government's most active launching pad for airstrikes on all rebel areas in central and northern Syria. Syria's government calls all armed groups \"terrorists.\" \n The attack came in fiery retaliation for this week's gruesome chemical weapons attack against civilians. \n ___ \n 5:50 a.m. \n Israel's prime minister has welcomed the U.S. attack on a Syrian air base saying he \"fully supports\" President Trump's decision. \n Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday in a statement that \"In both word and action\" Trump \"sent a strong and clear message\" that \"the use and spread of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.\" \n Israel's Channel 2 TV said Israel along with other allies was notified about the U.S. strike. \n The attacks in neighboring Syria have worried Israel, which has warned against \"game-changing\" weapons reaching Hezbollah in Lebanon from the country, which supports the militant group.

{"date": "April 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reacts after being asked if she planned on running for office again during the Women in the World Summit at Lincoln Center in New York. \n NEW YORK >> Hillary Clinton said she is \"deeply concerned\" about allegations of Russian meddling in last year's presidential election and says there needs to be an independent, nonpartisan investigation to make sure it doesn't happen again. \n Speaking in New York at a summit on women's issues, Clinton said Russian involvement was meant to sow \"distrust and confusion.\" \n \"I think what was done to us was an act of aggression and it was carried out by a foreign power under the control of someone who has a deep desire to dominate Europe and send us into a tailspin,\" she said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n Clinton called on Congress to put party squabbles aside and look into it. Otherwise, she said, \"They will be back.\" \n Her appearance at the Women in the World Summit is the latest in a string of public appearances for Clinton in the past few weeks. \n In a one-on-one conversation with columnist and author Nicholas Kristof, Clinton touched on a range of issues, including lessons learned in the election, the war in Syria and her own plans, which include the book she's writing. \n Clinton said the book would examine what happened in the election, and the various factors that went into the end result, from her own actions to outside events like FBI Director James Comey's decision just days before the election to reopen and then once again close an investigation into her emails. \n She said misogyny played a role in the election's outcome, and encouraged women determined to run for office to grow a thick skin, and to take criticism seriously, but not personally. \n \"I want you to be involved, I'm thrilled by all the activity that's going on,\" she said. \n When asked about the first 100 days of Republican President Donald Trump's administration, Clinton said she didn't \"take any pleasure in seeing the kind of chaotic functioning\" going on and the \"public growing pains,\" and that she didn't \"understand the commitment to hurt so many people that this administration, this White House, seems to be pursuing.\" \n She cited the president's proposed travel restrictions on people from certain countries and the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \n While stating at the beginning of her remarks that she was concerned about what was going on in the country, she acknowledged a slightly different reaction while watching the attempt to repeal the health care bill flounder. \n \"I don't know that any of them had ever even read the bill, read the law, understood how it worked,\" she said. As they saw how complicated it was, she added, \"I do admit, that was gratifying,\" earning a laugh and applause from the crowd. \n When asked if her plans would include running for office again, Clinton demurred. She said she was looking for interesting things to do, and included on the list supporting young people hoping to get into political office and help Democrats take back control of Congress. \n \"I don't think that will ever include running for office again,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Clinton: 'Deeply concerned' about Russian election role"}

Jerry Brown waived some permitting and review requirements today for Oroville Dam as California rushes to repair a main spillway that partially washed away under heavy winter runoff. \n Brown signed an executive order directing state agencies to make repairs at the dam, the nation's tallest, a priority.

Fifteen other people were injured. Beckley also was indicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter, inducing panic, weapons offenses and felonious assault. \n Davis also was charged in Spikes' slaying, but those charges were dismissed after Davis died on Tuesday. Deters said Davis would have faced a similar indictment if he had survived.

California courts require twice the bail amount if property is used instead of cash. She is required to turn over her passports, wear an electronic monitor and remain under house arrest. \n Li and her mother were born in China, where the mother was financially successful in the construction industry, said Li's attorney, Geoff Carr. Li and her mother are naturalized U.S. citizens, Carr said. \n Carr said all defendants except those accused of death penalty-eligible crimes are entitled to \"reasonable bail.\" The $35 million bail his client faced is the highest ever in San Mateo County's history, a county official said. \n Li has pleaded not guilty to charges she directed her boyfriend and another man to kill Keith Green, 27, and dispose of his body last year. Prosecutors say she feared losing custody of her young children to Green. \n A friend of Green's said that she was disappointed and shocked that Li was able to pay for her freedom pending her murder trial in September. \n \"Nothing about this seems right,\" said Angela Dunn, adding that Green stayed at her house for six months after he and Li split up. \"It's very difficult for all of us, especially Keith's mom.\" \n San Mateo District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said he's concerned Li is a flight risk and is disappointed the judge didn't set the bail even higher.

It is carried by rats and transmitted by snails and slugs. \n Officials say residents can reduce the risk of contracting the potentially life-threatening disease by thoroughly washing fruits and vegetables before consumption. \n Experts are still determining the best way to get rid of the invasive slugs, Pang said.

Mark Sanford, R-S.C., arrives at the White House in Washington. The White House on Wednesday talked up progress with Republicans on resuscitating the moribund GOP health care bill, but offered no timeline on reshaping a measure that could win enough votes for House approval. \n WASHINGTON >> The Republican health care bill remained in shambles today as House leaders threw up their hands and sent lawmakers home for a two-week recess. GOP chiefs announced a modest amendment to curb premium increases, but internal divisions still blocked their promised repeal of former President Barack Obama's law. \n \"This brings us closer to the final agreement that we all want to achieve,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said of the new amendment, flanked by about two dozen GOP lawmakers at a news briefing meant to project unity. \n But in a sentiment echoed by other leaders, Ryan conceded \"we have more work to do\" over the \"days and weeks ahead.\" That underscored the longer timeline Republican leaders acknowledge they'll need to resolve disputes between conservatives and moderates that blew up their legislation last month, dishing a mortifying defeat to Ryan and President Donald Trump. \n Ominously, lawmakers from both ends of the party who've opposed the GOP legislation said today's revision wasn't enough to turn them around. They included Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, a hotbed of opposition, and moderate GOP Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey. \n \"I favor making sure no one is denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition. So I doubt this would be enough,\" said Lance. \n Frustration over the bill's dismal performance in Congress spilled out during a meeting Ryan and other House leaders attended late Wednesday at the White House, according to several Republicans who'd been told about the session. \n White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and others expressed unhappiness that the legislation remained unfinished, and the fanfare accompanying the amendment introduced today was a direct result of that meeting, the Republicans said. \n \"The president and the speaker had a very good, long conversation last night and they remain fully on the same page on the path ahead,\" Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong said. Trump and Ryan spoke after the White House meeting. \n The new language was aimed at containing premiums by providing an additional $15 billion over a decade to help insurers cover the costs of seriously ill people, said Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., a sponsor of the amendment. Such customers' expensive care can drive up premiums for all consumers. \n The money would be on top of a $100 billion fund already in the GOP bill that states could use for various purposes, including high-risk insurance pools where people with medical problems can get coverage. \n House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., emailed GOP lawmakers that if a breakthrough on the bill occurred during the recess, \"We will advise members immediately and give you sufficient time to return to Washington.\" The prospects for that seemed remote, at best. \n Two weeks ago, Ryan called off a House vote on the measure repealing much of the 2010 health care overhaul. The GOP legislation replacing it would scale back the federal role in health care, covering 24 million fewer people over time while cutting taxes for upper-income earners. \n Deep differences among hardliners and moderates have impeded the Republican march. Each side blames the other, and the recess could drain more momentum from the repeal drive. \n A proposal discussed between the White House and leaders of the Freedom Caucus would let states seek federal waivers of two insurance requirements the law established. \n One forbids insurers from charging higher premiums on account of people's medical problems or pre-existing conditions. The other spells out categories of benefits, like hospitalization and substance abuse treatment, that all insurance plans must cover. \n Conservatives who want the federal government out of health care argue that those provisions have driven up premiums and decreased choice. \n Critics say eliminating those insurance requirements would raise premiums for people with serious medical problems and threaten to leave many people without coverage they need. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "GOP health bill in shambles, House commences two-week break"}

A criminal complaint claims his cellphone found on the slopes at the Heavenly ski resort was filled with nude photos of prepubescent females. The complaint was filed with a grand jury indictment handed up on Wednesday. \n Federal agents say a search of DeGraffenreid's home in January found additional images of 3- and 4-year-old children taken in a bathroom at a Gardnerville daycare center. \n DeGraffenreid was scheduled to appear at a preliminary examination in U.S. District Court in Reno this afternoon two counts of attempted exploitation and one count of possession of child pornography, in addition to the first charge.

Devin Nunes, R-Calif. is pursued by reporters as he leaves Capitol Hill in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> The normally secretive House Ethics Committee made a rare public pronouncement today, announcing it has launched a high-profile investigation into allegations that the House intelligence committee chairman may have improperly disclosed classified information while leading a probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \n The inquiry into Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., marks the first time in more than two decades that the ethics panel has publicly acknowledged investigating possible misuse of classified information by a House member. \n Nunes said he is stepping aside from leading the inquiry, citing the ethics review. Nunes called the charges false and politically motivated, but said it was in the best interest of the intelligence panel to have Rep. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, temporarily take charge of the Russia probe. \n The ethics investigation will be led by Chairwoman Susan Brooks, R-Ind., and Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., the panel's ranking member. \n Two watchdog groups, Democracy 21 and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, had requested an inquiry into whether Nunes disclosed classified information he learned from intelligence reports. At a news conference last month, Nunes said that communications involving associates of President Donald Trump had been swept up by U.S. spy agencies and, he suggested, mishandled by the Obama administration. \n Watchdog groups said Nunes had apparently violated House rules by disclosing the existence of a foreign surveillance warrant. \n Lawmakers \"take an oath that they will not disclose classified information,\" said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit that promotes government accountability and transparency. \"The question is whether (Nunes) violated that oath or not.\" \n Noah Bookbinder, executive of CREW, a separate watchdog group that files frequent ethics complaints, said he was grateful that the ethics panel responded quickly following the groups' complaint last week. \n \"We hope they do a serious investigation, do it quickly and come to a conclusive finding,\" said Bookbinder, adding that ethics investigations can sometimes become \"a black hole\" with little public accountability or transparency. \n The ethics panel declined to comment beyond its one-page statement, but ethics probes can drag on for months or years before public resolution. \n The panel has a range of options, from a finding of no wrongdoing to a letter of reproval, which amounts to a public scolding. The panel also could recommend that the full House vote on a reprimand or censure \u2014 or, more ominously, vote to expel Nunes. Expulsion would take a two-thirds vote of the House and is considered highly unlikely. \n The last time the House voted to reprimand a lawmaker was 2012, when Rep. Laura Richardson, D-Calif., was cited and fined $10,000 for compelling congressional staff members to work on her re-election campaign. \n The House censured Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., in 2010 for failure to pay income taxes and misuse of his office to solicit campaign donations. \n In 1995, the ethics committee said Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., had acted in a manner \"contrary\" to House rules by providing classified information to the New York Times. \n The inquiry by the full 10-member ethics panel could face one complication: Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., serves on the ethics committee and has been tapped by House Speaker Paul Ryan to help Conaway lead the Russia probe. \n Gowdy, who led a two-year inquiry into the deadly attacks on a U.S. facility in Benghazi, Libya, could not be reached for comment.

Military leaders discussed options with the White House, likely including a missile strike. \n President Donald Trump suggested that Assad may have to leave power, and his comments were strongly underscored by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who told reporters \"there's no role for him to govern the Syrian people.\" \n Among the options being considered was an immediate, overnight strike, according to two U.S. officials, who weren't authorized to discuss military planning publicly and requested anonymity. One of the officials said Tillerson and other top national security figures were hastily called to a meeting to discuss military options. \n The administration has been put to the test this week amid an international outcry over the newly horrifying violence in Syria. Over the past seven years, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the nation's civil war, triggering the worst refugee crisis since World War II. \n Trump's tone has grown more grave with the passing days. On Wednesday, he said this week's attack crossed \"a lot of lines\" \u2014 not just the \"red line\" of chemical weapons use that President Barack Obama once set as an ultimatum for the Assad government. \n Trump has shown a particularly emotional response to photos and video of dead children, and he said, \"I think what happened in Syria is a disgrace to humanity.\" Asked if Assad should remain in power, he said that \"he's there and I guess he's running things so something should happen.\" \n Trump commented aboard Air Force One en route to meet China's President Xi Jinping at a Florida summit, which will include talks about North Korea's missile and nuclear programs. \n The range of possible military options against Syria would be likely to mirror those shelved at the last minute by the Obama administration in 2013. Then, the U.S. was poised to launch missiles from ships in the Mediterranean, targeting military airfields, command and control facilities and other key locations. \n A precise missile strike, potentially against targets associated with the chemical weapons attack, would be considered a limited response, especially in an area where there would be little possibility Russian troops would be present. \n The U.S. doesn't want to start a war with Moscow, and there are Russian troops, aircraft and other equipment on most of the Syrian bases. \n Any action in Syria while Trump is meeting Xi in Florida could also serve as a message to China. \n Washington is trying to persuade Beijing to adopt a tougher approach to its North Korean ally, much like the U.S. pressure campaign with the Russians on Syria. Strikes in Syria would show the Chinese that Trump isn't afraid of unilateral military steps to advance American interests, even if key nations are standing in the way. \n Tillerson, who spoke almost simultaneously after greeting Xi in Florida, said there was \"no doubt in our minds\" that Assad's government was behind the attacks and the U.S. was evaluating an appropriate response. \n \"The process by which Assad would leave is something that will require an international community effort,\" Tillerson said, adding that there needs to be a balance between defeating the Islamic State group and stabilizing Syria to prevent the civil war from escalating further. \n Tillerson also issued a warning to Russia that its support of the Assad government is something that it should \"consider carefully.\" \n Late Wednesday, Trump advisers had huddled at the White House to discuss options for responding to the chemical attack, including both military action and economic sanctions, according to a senior administration official. It was unclear how fast the president planned to decide and implement a response, according to the official, who insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the sensitive planning. \n Tillerson has been in contact with his Russian counterparts, the official said, but Trump has not spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump told reporters traveling with him to Florida that he may speak with Putin. \n In Moscow, Putin's spokesman said Russia's support for Assad has limits but there must be a full investigation of the attack before the United Nations takes any action. \n As for Russia's influence, Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with The Associated Press that \"it is not correct to say that Moscow can convince Mr. Assad to do whatever is wanted in Moscow. This is totally wrong.\" \n In Washington, two senior Republican senators called for Trump to strike at Syria's air force in response to the attack, which killed more than two-dozen children. \n Sens. John McCain of Arizona, who spoke to Trump on Wednesday, and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement that Assad \"must pay a punitive cost for this horrific attack.\" \n \"This is a test of the new administration, but also for our entire country,\" said Graham and McCain, who have been among Trump's harshest congressional critics. \"Assad is trying to see what he can get away with.\" \n Graham later told reporters he doesn't believe Trump needs Congress to authorize the use of military force in Syria. \"Hit this guy,\" Graham said of Assad. \n Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, took a more measured approach, saying he first wanted to hear from the White House what military options it may be considering. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. hints at military action to retaliate against Assad"}

{"date": "April 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Don Rickles was honored for best individual performance in a variety or music program, in Sept. 2008, for \"Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project,\" at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. Rickles, the hollering, bald-headed \"Merchant of Venom\" whose barrage of barbs upon the meek and the mighty endeared him to audiences and his peers for decades died today at his home in Los Angeles. He was 90. \n LOS ANGELES >> He was only kidding. \n Really. Don Rickles loved everybody: black or white, gay or straight, fat or thin. \n But don't get him started on his wife, or the time she dove into their swimming pool while wearing all her jewelry. \n And drowned. \n For more than half a century, the hollering, bald-headed \"Mr. Warmth\" let everyone have it. Insults rained on the meek and the mighty, from unsuspecting fans to such fellow celebrities as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Johnny Carson. \n And few seemed to mind. Rickles, who died today at age 90, was among the most loved people in the business. \n He was the acknowledged grandmaster of insult comedy. Despite jokes that from other comics might have inspired boycotts, he was idolized by everyone from Joan Rivers and Louis CK to Chris Rock and Sarah Silverman. James Caan once said that Rickles helped inspire the blustering Sonny Corleone of \"The Godfather.\" An HBO special was directed by John Landis of \"Animal House\" fame and included tributes from Clint Eastwood, Sidney Poitier and Robert De Niro. Carl Reiner would say he knew he had made it in Hollywood when Rickles made fun of him. \n Rickles appeared everywhere from strip joints to the 1985 inaugural gala for President Ronald Reagan and remained a popular act well after his ethnic and racial humor had become outdated. In 2008, he won an Emmy for best individual performance in a variety show for the Landis film \"Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project.\" At the ceremony, he joked: \"I've been in this business for 55 years and the biggest award I got was an ashtray from the Friars in New York.\" The Friars gave him a nice statuette in 2013 when they presented him a lifetime achievement award. \n Rickles' many friends returned the wisecracks, whether labeling him as a man everyone loved to hate or, as his pal Bob Newhart once joked, a man with whom it was annoying to travel. But the topper came, from all people, radio host Casey Kasem, who dressed up as Hitler at a Martin roast in Rickles' honor and told the comedian: \"You are the only man I know who has bombed more places than I have.\" \n Placed by Jerry Seinfeld on the \"Mount Rushmore\" of comedy, Rickles patented a confrontational style that stand-up performers still emulate, but one that kept him on the right side of trouble. He emerged in the late 1950s, a time when comics such as Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl were taking greater risks, becoming more politicized and more introspective. \n Rickles managed to shock his audiences without cutting social commentary or truly personal self-criticism. He operated under a code as old the Borscht Belt: Go far \u2014 ethnic jokes, sex jokes, ribbing Carson for his many marriages \u2014 but make sure everyone knows it's for fun. \n \"I think the reason that it (his act) caught on and gave me a wonderful career is that I was never mean-spirited,\" he once said. \"Not that you had to like it, but you had to be under a rock somewhere not to get it.\" \n In the 1960s, Rickles was welcomed for the first time to the \"Tonight Show\" with Carson. He sat down on the couch and muttered, \"Hello, dummy.\" The studio audience was initially startled, but when the host began laughing uncontrollably, so did everyone else. He appeared countless more times, haranguing Carson about not being invited more often or mocking his own love life. \n \"I love my wife, but she's ill,\" was a typical joke. \n To his great disappointment, Rickles was never able to transfer his success to a long-running weekly situation comedy. \"The Don Rickles Show\" lasted just one season (1972). \"C.P.O. Sharkey,\" in which he played an acid-tongued Navy chief petty officer, aired from 1976 to 1978. The show's most notable moment was unplanned: Carson barged in the middle of a live taping to complain that Rickles had broken his cigarette box when the comedian had appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" the night before. \n Rickles had set out to be a serious actor, enrolling in New York's American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where classmates included Jason Robards. He had little luck finding acting jobs, however, and supported himself by selling used cars, life insurance and cosmetics \u2014 badly, he said. (\"I couldn't sell air conditioners on a 98-degree day.\") \n He finally decided to try comedy, appearing at small hotels in New York's Catskill mountains and in rundown nightclubs. The turning point came at a strip joint in Washington, D.C. \n \"The customers were right on top of you, always heckling, and I gave it right back to them,\" he recalled in 1982. \n The audience laughed and wanted more. In a style sometimes compared to an earlier insult comic, Jack E. Leonard, Rickles continued to hone his act and got another big break through an unlikely facilitator, his mother. Etta Rickles had befriended Frank Sinatra's mother, Dolly, and persuaded her to encourage her son to check out Don Rickles' act. When the singer stopped by one night in 1957, comic history was made. \n \"Hey, Frank, make yourself at home,\" Rickles snapped. \"Hit somebody.\" \n Instead of being angered, the volatile singer was overcome with laughter. Rickles became the unofficial court jester of Sinatra's Rat Pack, ridiculing his singing, his love life and his alleged connections to organized crime. In a famous 1966 profile of Sinatra for Esquire magazine, Gay Talese described a Rickles performance in Las Vegas attended by the singer and his entourage. \n \"His humor is so rude, in such bad taste, that it offends no one \u2014 it is too offensive to be offensive. Spotting Eddie Fisher among the audience, Rickles proceeded to ridicule him as a lover, saying it was no wonder that he could not handle Elizabeth Taylor,\" Talese wrote. \n \"Then he focused on Sinatra, not failing to mention (then-girlfriend) Mia Farrow, nor that he was wearing a toupee, nor to say that Sinatra was washed up as a singer, and when Sinatra laughed, everybody laughed.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Don Rickles, king of insult comedy, dies at 90"}

{"date": "April 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Supreme Court Justice nominee Neil Gorsuch listened as he was asked a question by Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, on Capitol Hill in Washington, March 22, during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. signalled a thumbs-up as he leaves the Senate chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, today, after he led the GOP majority to change Senate rules and lower the vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees from 60 votes to a simple majority in order to advance Neil Gorsuch to a confirmation vote. \n WASHINGTON >> Republicans invoked the \"nuclear option\" in the Senate today, unilaterally rewriting the chamber's rules to allow President Donald Trump's nominee to ascend to the Supreme Court. \n Furious Democrats objected until the end, but their efforts to block Judge Neil Gorsuch failed as expected. Lawmakers of both parties bemoaned the long-term implications for the Senate, the court and the country. \n \"We will sadly point to today as a turning point in the history of the Senate and the Supreme Court,\" said Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \n The maneuvering played out in an atmosphere of tension in the Senate chamber with most senators in their seats, a rare and theatrical occurrence. \n First Democrats mounted a filibuster in an effort to block Gorsuch by denying him the 60 votes needed to advance to a final vote. Then Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky raised a point of order, suggesting that Supreme Court nominees should not be subjected to a 60-vote threshold but instead a simple majority in the 100-member Senate. \n McConnell was overruled, but appealed the ruling. And on that he prevailed on a 52-48 party line vote. The 60-vote filibuster requirement on Supreme Court nominees was effectively gone, and with it the last vestige of bipartisanship on presidential nominees in an increasingly polarized Senate. \n A final confirmation vote on Gorsuch is expected Friday and he could then be sworn in in time to take his seat on the court later this month and hear the final cases of the term. \n The maneuvering played out with much hand-wringing from all sides about the future of the Senate, as well as unusually bitter accusations and counter-accusations as each side blamed the other. The rules change is known as the \"nuclear option\" because of its far-reaching implications. \n McConnell accused Democrats of forcing his hand by trying to filibuster a highly qualified nominee in Gorsuch, 49, a 10-year veteran of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver with a consistently conservative record. McConnell vowed that the rules change would block the Gorsuch filibuster, and all future ones, a change many lawmakers lamented could lead to an even more polarized Senate, court and country. \n \"This will be the first, and last, partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee,\" McConnell declared. \"This is the latest escalation in the left's never-ending judicial war, the most audacious yet, and it cannot and will not stand.\" \n Supreme Court filibusters have been nearly unheard of in the Senate, but the confrontation is playing out amid an explosive political atmosphere with liberal Democrats furious over the Trump presidency and Republicans desperate to get a win after months of chaos from Trump. \n Democrats also remain livid over McConnell's decision last year to deny consideration to then-President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, who was ignored for the better part of a year by Senate Republicans after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Instead, McConnell kept Scalia's seat open, a calculation that is now paying off hugely for Republicans and Trump, who will be able to claim the biggest victory of his presidency to date if Gorsuch is confirmed as expected. \n \"We believe that what Republicans did to Merrick Garland was worse than a filibuster,\" Schumer said. \"We didn't hear two words in the long speech of Senator McConnell: Merrick Garland.\" \n Emotions were running high ahead of the votes with raised voices on the floor where proceedings are normally sedate. All involved were keenly aware of the long-term implications of the proceedings, some of them hard to predict for the future of Trump's presidency and the 2018 midterm elections, when Republicans will be defending their slim 52-48 Senate majority and 10 vulnerable Democrats in states Trump won will be up for re-election. \n Senators on both sides of the aisle lamented the trajectory they were on toward the Senate rules change, though they themselves were in position to prevent it from happening and failed to do so. \n Moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said roughly 10 senators of both parties worked over the weekend to come up with a deal to stave off the so-called \"nuclear option,\" as the rules change is known, but couldn't come to agreement. In 2005, a bipartisan deal headed off GOP plans to remove the filibuster barrier for lower-court nominees, but in 2013 Democrats took the step, leaving the filibuster in place only for Supreme Court justices. \n And now it too is gone. For now the filibuster barrier on legislation will remain, though many fear it could be the next to go. \n \"I fear that someday we will regret what we are about to do. In fact, I am confident we will,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. \"It is imperative we have a functioning Senate where the rights of the minority are protected regardless of which party is in power at the time.\" \n Nonetheless, McCain voted with McConnell on the rules change, saying he felt he had no choice. \n With the final vote set for Friday, Gorsuch counts 55 supporters in the Senate: the 52 Republicans, along with three moderate Democrats from states that Trump won last November \u2014 Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. A fourth Senate Democrat, Michael Bennet from Gorsuch's home state of Colorado, refused to join in the filibuster but announced Thursday he would vote against Gorsuch's confirmation. \n Associated Press writers Mark Sherman and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed. \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "Senate GOP 'goes nuclear,' clearing way for Trump court pick"}

Congressional Republicans and Democrats are wrestling over whether to include a down payment for the wall \u2014 financed by U.S. taxpayers instead of Mexico, despite Trump's repeated promises \u2014 in the spending bill to keep the government open at the end of the month. Trump has yet to pass a major bill through Congress as his 100th day in office nears. \n The poll offers a mixed view of Trump's budget plan, which drew criticism from Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. Americans supported cuts to foreign aid, but opposed Trump's planned cuts to spending on environmental programs and fighting climate change. People were more likely to oppose than favor cutting federal help for public broadcasting and the arts and by huge margins supported additional money for veterans' programs. \n \"The military is depleted, and the veterans have been hurting,\" said Margaret Hall, 77, a Trump supporter from Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. \n Trump's spending plans are facing their first test on Capitol Hill, as lawmakers debate his request for $30 billion for an immediate cash infusion for the military and $3 billion for additional border security, including a $1 billion down payment for new fencing and other barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. \n The public opposes new spending for the wall, 58 percent to 28 percent. Nearly half say they strongly oppose funding for the project. \n \"I honestly think the wall is going to be a fiasco. If they want to get into the country, they're going to get into the country, regardless of what you put up there,\" said Wes Drought, 61, a firefighter and paramedic from Winnebago, Illinois, who strongly disapproves of Trump. \"If you're going to do something, do it with the border patrol. If you want to create jobs, there's a job.\" \n Democrats have come out strongly against the wall construction, and some Republicans are signaling they're not interested in a confrontation. \n \"I don't like the concept \u2014 I don't think it's needed \u2014 of a 2,000-mile wall as some envision,\" said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., whose state is home to some of the most rugged terrain along the border. \"It's just not needed. In some areas you just don't need it. In some areas you need wall, in some areas you need fences. In some areas you need surveillance.\" \n Testifying on Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the wall won't be from \"sea to shining sea,\" but in places where border agents say it would be most effective. He said the wall could extend beyond a physical barrier and include a mix of technology including drones. \n Eighty-six percent of Democrats and 57 percent of independents oppose new spending for a border wall with Mexico. Republicans break about 2-1 in favor of the wall, but that's more narrow support than on other priorities. \n The most popular proposal by far in the Trump budget is increasing spending on Veterans Affairs, which is supported by 74 percent of Americans and opposed by just 8 percent. \n Americans are also more likely to favor than oppose increased spending on border patrol (50 percent to 32 percent) and decreased spending on foreign aid (50 percent to 30 percent). By a 47 percent to 34 percent margin, more also favor than oppose increasing spending on defense and the military. \n But other pieces of the proposed Trump budget draw negative reviews. By a 64 percent to 19 percent margin, most oppose decreasing spending on scientific and medical research. That's a complaint echoed by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, including the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who holds significant sway as Congress uses the president's proposal as a blueprint but writes the budget. \n Most Americans also oppose cuts to spending on the environment and on climate change, by a 52 percent to 28 percent margin. Finally, Americans are more likely to oppose than favor cutting spending for public television, radio and the arts, 44 percent to 32 percent. \n Large majorities across party lines favor increasing Veterans Affairs spending, although Republicans are particularly supportive. And decreasing spending for scientific and medical research is largely opposed across party lines, by 78 percent of Democrats, 58 percent of independents and 51 percent of Republicans. \n But there are large political divides on several other pieces of the budget proposal. Seventy-five percent of Republicans but just 40 percent of independents and 26 percent of Democrats favor increased military spending. Eighty percent of Republicans and 49 percent of independents, but just 26 percent of Democrats, favor increased border patrol spending. And 72 percent of Republicans and 54 percent of independents, but just 30 percent of Democrats, favor decreased foreign aid spending. \n The AP-NORC poll of 1,110 adults was conducted March 23-27 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

{"date": "April 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. was pursued by reporters, on March 28, on Capitol Hill in Washington. Nunes says he's temporarily stepping aside from Russia probe amid ethics accusations. \n WASHINGTON >> The Republican chairman is stepping aside from leading a congressional investigation of Russian interference in last year's U.S. presidential election, citing ethics complaints that he mishandled classified information. \n The decision by Rep. Devin Nunes of California comes amid partisan turmoil on the House intelligence committee. Democrats have alleged that Nunes, who was on President Donald Trump's transition team, is too close to the White House and cannot lead an impartial inquiry. In an extraordinary step, the usually-quiet House Ethics Committee said that it is investigating whether Nunes improperly disclosed classified information. President Donald Trump said Nunes is \"a very honorable guy.\" \n Nunes blamed \"left-wing activist groups\" for filing accusations against him with the Office of Congressional Ethics. \n \"The charges are entirely false and politically motivated and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power,\" Nunes said in a statement. \n Nunes' move could be seen as a win for Democrats whose cries for an independent panel to investigate Russia's possible ties with the Trump campaign have grown. They have pointed in particular to two Nunes trips to the White House \u2014 one announced, one not \u2014 as evidence that his loyalty to Trump outweighs his commitment to leading a bipartisan investigation. \n By all accounts, the intelligence committee's growing partisanship has become a distraction from its underlying investigations. \n The top Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff of California, said he appreciated Nunes' decision to step aside from the Russia investigation. \n \"There was a cloud hanging over us after the White House incident,\" Schiff told The Associated Press today. While Schiff said the panel's investigation is back on track, the Republicans had not signed off on rescheduling a public hearing with former Obama administration officials. Schiff said it was important that the public hear testimony from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates about why Trump's first national security adviser was fired. Nunes canceled the hearing. \n As the majority party in the House, Republicans will keep the committee chairmanship. GOP Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas, with help from Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and Rep. Tom Rooney of Florida, will temporarily take charge of the investigation, said Speaker Paul Ryan. \n Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he doesn't know Conaway, but he heard he was well-respected. \"High quality,\" Trump said. \n Schiff said Conaway does not have the same history with the White House that Nunes does. \n Two watchdog groups, Democracy 21 and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, had asked the House Ethics Committee to investigate whether Nunes disclosed classified information he learned from intelligence reports. \n In a statement, CREW spokesman Jordan Libowitz said the group believes that Nunes' potential violation of House ethics rules \"is so grave that it needs to be investigated right away.\" \n Nunes last month disclosed that Trump associates' communications had been swept up by U.S. spy agencies and, he suggested, mishandled by Obama administration officials. \n The announcement was striking, as it is unusual for a member of the committee to publicly discuss the existence of what would be classified intelligence reports. \n Nunes later acknowledged that the material had been shared by a secret source on the White House grounds, raising fresh questions about his coordination with the White House. Trump seized on the information as evidence backing up his unfounded claim that President Barack Obama wiretapped the phones at his New York skyscraper. \n Schiff later saw the same material, but refused to publicly discuss what he learned. He said he understood the material was now to be shared with other intelligence committee members. \n Republican Speaker Ryan said he supported Nunes' decision to step aside. \n \"It is clear that this process would be a distraction for the House intelligence committee's investigation into Russian interference in our election,\" Ryan said. \n A Republican aide said Nunes met with Ryan on Wednesday night to discuss stepping aside from the Russia probe. That's when Ryan learned of the House ethics probe, according to the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. \n Nunes said in his statement, \"I will continue to fulfill all my other responsibilities as committee chairman, and I am requesting to speak to the Ethics Committee at the earliest possible opportunity in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims.\" \n The Ethics Committee investigation of Nunes' actions will be led by Republican Chairwoman Susan Brooks of Indiana and Democrat Ted Deutch of Florida. \n Conaway's ascendance immediately drew attention to his statement earlier this year expressing skepticism about the subject of the investigation. \n In January, Conaway compared Russia's interference in the 2016 election to the Democrats' employing Mexican entertainers to help turn out the Latino vote. \n \"Those are foreign actors, foreign people, influencing the vote in Nevada,\" Conaway told the Dallas Morning News. \"You don't hear the Democrats screaming and saying one word about that.\" \n During the intelligence committee's first hearing on the Russia probe last month, his questions were focused on how intelligence agencies prove who is behind a hack and what a foreign leader's \"intent\" is. \n All 17 intelligence agencies have agreed that Russia was behind the hack of Democratic email systems and tried to influence the 2016 election to benefit Trump. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Nunes steps away from Russia probe, citing ethics complaints"}

{"date": "April 6, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Las Vegas police and SWAT officers surround a home of Nicolai Howard Mork as they clear the property, Wednesday, April 5, 2017, in Las Vegas. Mork, who had been free on bail for three months while fighting explosives and firearms charges, was arrested late Wednesday on counts of terrorism and possession of weapons of mass destruction, authorities said. \n LAS VEGAS >> A Las Vegas man who has been free on bail for three months while fighting explosives and firearms charges was arrested late Wednesday on counts of terrorism and possession of weapons of mass destruction, authorities said. \n Mork had posted $220,000 bail following his arrest in December. \n Mork was taken into custody at one of his homes in a southern Las Vegas neighborhood after police evacuated residents from several nearby homes, police Sgt. Jeff Clark said. He called the evacuations a precautionary move. \n Mork legally possessed materials commonly used for targets that can explode when shot during firearms target practice, his lawyer said, \n Woolridge said similar devices are commercially available and not prohibited under federal law. \n Deputy Las Vegas Police Chief Chris Jones declined to specify the materials that police seized Dec. 29 with a search warrant at Mork's home. \n Mork was arrested at the time on charges that he illegally possessed explosives, a silencer and a gun with a serial number removed. \n \"The manner in which this individual was using these materials was not for legal purposes,\" Jones said. \"These substances could be used in the manufacture of powerful explosive devices. The more you use, the larger the device, the more destructive it's going to be.\" \n Chief Deputy Clark County District Attorney Jacob Villani said the chemicals were strong enough to penetrate a military tank, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported (http://bit.ly/2nFaXqJ). \n Woolridge disputed the newspaper's characterization of Mork as a theoretical mathematics graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Woolridge said his client had a master's in business administration from the school. \n An FBI spokeswoman in Las Vegas said the bureau wasn't involved in the case. Officials at several gun stores and a public gun range in Las Vegas declined to comment about the commercial availability of explosive targets. \n Jones, who heads the police department's Homeland Security unit, said the investigation arose after several explosions in two neighborhoods where Mork lived, and complaints by neighbors about damage to their property. \n \"Devices had either exploded or were found unexploded,\" Jones said. \"They clearly were not being used for legal purposes.\" \n Clark County District Court Judge Douglas Herndon ruled that because of the seriousness of the charges, Mork will have to show the source of money used for his bail. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Nevada man arrested on terrorism, weapon charges in Vegas"}
