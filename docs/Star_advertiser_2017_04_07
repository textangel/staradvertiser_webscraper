But despite earlier reports, Steve Perry did not perform with the current Journey members. Instead, Arnel Pineda sang lead as the band performed their hits, including \"Don't Stop Believin'.\" \n Perry, estranged from the band for many years, did embrace guitarist and co-founder Neal Schon onstage. \n \"You're the one who put us here,\" Perry said to the Journey fans, earning one of the night's loudest applauses. \"I've been gone a long time but you've never not been in my heart.\" \n Like Shakur and Pearl Jam, Baez and ELO were all elected in their first year as nominees. \n Baez, one of folk's most iconic voices, said it felt \"cool\" to be inducted. She also said earning the Rock Hall honor would help young people learn who she is, and what she's accomplished. \n \"My granddaughter had no clue who I was until I took her backstage to a Taylor Swift concert,\" said Baez, who added that her granddaughter took a selfie with Swift and now had \"newfound respect for her grandmother.\" \n She was inducted by Jackson Browne, who said the first album he bought with his own money was Baez's second album. \n ELO \u2014 who kicked off the show with Berry's \"Roll Over Beethoven\" \u2014 and progressive British rockers Yes were also inducted Friday. \n \"It was 49 years ago tonight I met Chris Squire at a bar,\" singer Jon Anderson said of the band's founding bass player who died in 2015. \"Magic moment.\" \n Berry wasn't the only late legend who was honored: Lenny Kravitz paid tribute to Prince after the \"In Memoriam\" section with an explosive performance of \"When Doves Cry,\" backed by a choir and beaming purple lights. \n Pharrell said kind words about Nile Rodgers, who received a special honor at the event, which will air April 29 as a special on HBO. \n To be eligible, all of the nominees had to have released their first recording no later than 1991.

Capriles announced that he has been banned from running for office for 15 years, a move sure to ratchet up tensions amid a growing street protest movement. \n CARACAS, Venezuela >> Venezuela's government has barred opposition leader Henrique Capriles \u2014 twice a major presidential candidate \u2014 from running for office for 15 years, a surprise move sure to ratchet up tensions amid a growing street protest movement. \n Capriles read from excerpts of the comptroller general's order at a rally Friday night in which he urged supporters to take to the streets, beginning with a previously scheduled demonstration Saturday, to defend their political rights and demand the removal of President Nicolas Maduro. \n \"When the dictatorship squeals it's a sign we're advancing,\" he said in a speech surrounded by other leading opposition figures, many of whom themselves have been targeted. \"The only one who is disqualified here is you, Nicolas Maduro.\" \n The 44-year-old Capriles has been the most prominent leader of Venezuela's opposition over the past decade, twice coming close to winning the presidency despite institutional obstacles that tilted races in favor of the government. He's currently governor of Miranda state, which surrounds Caracas, and is one of the most recognizable leaders behind the protest movement that has been roiling the country this week. \n Maduro didn't comment on the order in an appearance late Friday on state TV, but urged his supporters not to be distracted by tough language coming from \"Capriloca,\" a play on the Spanish word for \"crazy.\" Leaders in the ruling socialist party have accused Capriles in recent days of trying to provoke a bloodbath through his leadership of near-daily protests, many of which have ended in tear gas and rubber bullets \n \"The right wing's treason of our national interests is cause for indignation,\" said Maduro. \n The move against Capriles is part of a broader government crackdown that began with a decision last week by the Supreme Court to gut the opposition-controlled congress of its last vestiges of power. The move was later reversed amid widespread international condemnation, but with the unpopular Maduro under increasing pressure to call elections, the constant arrests at marches and threats against party leaders may be his best way to stunt the opposition's momentum, analysts said. \n \"They are trying to raise the costs of protest, plain and simple,\" said Michael McCarthy, a research fellow focused on Venezuela at American University. \"But this move may well backfire, as Capriles is likely to harness this smear campaign to place himself front and center in the push to hold transition elections.\" \n Authorities have been investigating Capriles since the beginning of the year for what they say are a half dozen administrative irregularities, including taking suspicious donations from abroad. \n Among Maduro's opponents, he's considered a moderate, having criticized a wave of protests in 2014 that led to scores of deaths. Those protests ended with the arrest of his main rival within the fractious opposition, Leopoldo Lopez, whose dogmatic politics appeals to hardliners but has often alienated poor voters who backed Hugo Chavez's revolution but are fed up with Maduro's inability to fix widespread shortages and triple-digit inflation. \n Capriles is a scion of one of Venezuela's wealthiest families, but his sometimes vulgar talk and mannerisms echo the late Chavez's populist style and he has tried to reach out to Chavez supporters. He prides himself on staying close to home when others in the opposition have been quick to fly off to Washington and other capitals to seek help. \n While those divisions over strategy and style haven't gone away, the opposition seems more united than it has for a long time. \n This week's protests appear to have claimed their first victim Thursday night. Nineteen-year-old law student Jairo Ortiz was shot dead by a police officer near his home in a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of Caracas. \n The Interior Ministry said that transit police officer had been arrested but denied opposition claims that Ortiz was taking part in any demonstration. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Venezuela opposition leader banned from running for office"}

The pilot program was ordered by a judge following a 2013 ruling that officers were wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program. At the time, few police departments used body cameras. \n Their use has since exploded around the country following a string of killings of unarmed blacks by police and the ambush killings of officers in New York City, Dallas and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Both officers and citizens have said cameras could help de-escalate situations that lead to violence. \n The NYPD's deployment was delayed by a lengthy process to choose the camera company and questions on how they would work. \n The department sought public comment through a questionnaire and worked with New York University's Policing Project to analyze the results. Some 25,000 people, plus 5,000 police officers, responded anonymously, and NYPD officials made changes based on the outcome. \n Public response was disproportionately white relative to the city's population, police officials acknowledged. But the report found that on many key questions, there was little difference in response by race. \n \"I think this shows that the public can have a voice in policing,\" said Barry Friedman of NYU's Policing Project. \n One change based on the results was to alert civilians they are being recorded. \n \"New Yorkers \u2026 really want to be told they're being recorded,\" assistant deputy commissioner Nancy Hoppock said. \"And officers really don't want to tell them.\" \n Police won't record every interaction \u2014 even though the public would prefer it \u2014 because there's not enough storage capability and it would bump up against privacy laws and could stop witnesses from coming forward, officials said. The decision was heavily criticized by advocacy groups. \n According to the proposal, submitted Friday to a federal monitor for approval, officers will turn on their cameras for arrests, summonses, vehicle stops, interactions with crime suspects, interactions with a mentally unstable person who is violent, or when using force. They record property searches. They won't record demonstrations unless there is a crime or other enforcement. The tapes will be kept for a year and the footage released publicly only in certain cases. \n Lawyers on the federal stop-and-frisk case, who are working with the NYPD, said the policy creates too much confusion on when to record. \n \"Making a call to turn on a camera in the heat of the moment is much more burdensome for officers,\" said attorney Darius Charney. \"Just turning on the camera at the beginning is a much more straightforward approach.\" \n The New York Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups say officers get too much control over the footage collected, and criticized the decision to allow police to view their tapes before making official statements on encounters. \n The policy \"won't help address police brutality, abuses and unjust killings of New Yorkers,\" said Mandela Jones of the group Communities United for Police Reform. \n Officers will receive a day of training, and the order will be revised as the department gets feedback and does its own study using a yearlong comparison to officers without cameras. \n Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he wants all 23,000 of its patrol officers outfitted with cameras by 2019. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "New York police set to deploy 1,200 bodycams around the city"}

Their efforts to strike a better balance have been mostly unsuccessful so far. \n For instance, only 19 percent of Google's technology jobs are held by women. Overall, nearly one-third of Google's more than 70,000 workers are women. \n The Labor Department's probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless the company complied with an audit of its employee-compensation records. Google has said it has turned over some of the requested records, but withheld other information that it believes would invade its workers' privacy. \n While Google and its peers have been disclosing embarrassing sexual and racial imbalances in their workforces for the past few years, the technology industry so far has kept its compensation practices a closely guarded secret. \n The Labor Department is now scrutinizing Silicon Valley for patterns of pay and hiring discrimination under its powers to vet companies that bid for lucrative government contracts.

Lahren hasn't posted to her Facebook page since March 19. \n Her co-workers placed yellow caution tape spelling an 'X' on Lahren's dressing room door. The Blaze terminated her work email account, according to the lawsuit. Supervisors cut off communication with Lahren, said her lawyer, Brian Lauten. \n That was all retaliation and added up to her being fired, even if The Blaze considers her status there a suspension, Lauten said. He said the company has already breached the contract \"100 times over\"; for example, the firm hasn't fulfilled its promise to produce 230 one-hour episodes of Lahren's show per year. He said Lahren wants to be free of her contract so she can go back to posting online and look for another job. \n \"She's like an eagle that feels like it's had its wings clipped,\" Lauten said. \"She's ready to pursue her career and reconnect with her millions of followers.\" \n The suit asks a judge to grant Lahren a temporary restraining order, which would protect her right to speak freely as well as block The Blaze from destroying any evidence related to the dispute. She's asking for attorneys' fees and costs, \"as well as all other relief \u2026 which she may show herself justly entitled.\" \n \"She's very disappointed and sad that we're in this situation,\" Lauten said, \"but they left her with no choice.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lahren sues Glenn Beck, The Blaze for wrongful termination"}

The U.S. engines were made at the Hyundai's engine plant in Alabama. \n The companies say in documents posted Friday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that debris left from manufacturing can restrict oil flow to connecting rod bearings. Since they are cooled by oil, the restriction can increase temperatures and cause the bearings to wear and fail, and the engines could stall. \n Owners will hear a knocking sound from the engine that increases in frequency as the engine speed rises. They also could get engine warning lights on their dashboard, Hyundai spokesman Jim Trainor said. Those with problems should contact their dealers. \n Hyundai and Kia will notify owners and dealers will inspect the engines. They'll replace the block if needed at no cost to owners. The recall is scheduled to start on May 19. \n Trainor said the company has no reports of any crashes or injuries. \n The U.S. recall is the second in the past two years for the same engine problem.

Watson said there was \"significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus\" behind the ban, which prevents new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries and suspends the nation's refugee program. The administration appealed to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. \n The U.S. Department of Justice said in court documents filed with the 9th Circuit today that Watson second-guessed Trump's judgment that the order was needed to protect the nation and wrongly relied on statements Trump made on the campaign trail to conclude the travel ban was motivated by religious discrimination. \n \"The Order applies to all nationals of the listed countries, and all refugees from any country, regardless of anyone's religion \u2026,\" the DOJ said in its filing. \"To be sure, this Order has been the subject of heated debate.

{"date": "April 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump receives a briefing on the Syria military strike from his National Security team after the strike at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., \n PALM BEACH, Fla. >> The United States vowed today to keep the pressure on Syria after the intense nighttime wave of missile strikes from U.S. ships, despite the prospect of escalating Russian ill will that could further inflame one of the world's most vexing conflicts. \n Standing firm, the Trump administration signaled new sanctions would soon follow the missile attack, and the Pentagon was even probing whether Russia itself was involved in the chemical weapons assault that compelled President Donald Trump to action. The attack against a Syrian air base was the first U.S. assault against the government of President Bashar Assad. \n Much of the international community rallied behind Trump's decision to fire the cruise missiles in reaction to this week's chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of men, women and children in Syria. But a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the strikes dealt \"a significant blow\" to relations between Moscow and Washington. \n At the United Nations, Russia's deputy ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, strongly criticized what he called the U.S. \"flagrant violation of international law and an act of aggression\" whose \"consequences for regional and international security could be extremely serious.\" He called the Assad government a main force against terrorism and said it deserved the presumption of innocence in the chemical weapons attack. \n U.S. officials blame Moscow for propping up Assad. \n \"The world is waiting for the Russian government to act responsibly in Syria,\" Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said during an emergency Security Council session. \"The world is waiting for Russia to reconsider its misplaced alliance with Bashar Assad.\" \n Haley said the U.S. was prepared to take further action in Syria but hoped it wouldn't be necessary. \n In Florida with the president, meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, \"We will be announcing additional sanctions on Syria as part of our ongoing effort to stop this type of activity and emphasize how significant we view this. We expect that those will continue to have an important effect on preventing people from doing business with them.\" \n Thursday night's strikes \u2014 some 60 cruise missiles fired from two ships in the Mediterranean \u2014 were the culmination of a rapid, three-day transformation for Trump, who has long opposed deeper U.S. involvement in Syria's civil war. Advisers said he was outraged by heartbreaking images of young children who were among the dozens killed in the chemical attack and ordered his national security team to swiftly prepare military options. \n The decision undercut another campaign promise for Trump: his pledge to try to warm relations with Moscow. After months of allegations of ties between his election campaign and the Kremlin \u2014 the subject of current congressional and FBI investigations \u2014 Trump has found himself clashing with Putin. \n Today, senior U.S. military officials were looking more closely at possible Russian involvement in the poison attack. Officials said a drone belonging to either Russia or Syria was seen hovering over the site after the assault earlier this week. The drone returned late in the day as citizens were going to a nearby hospital for treatment. Shortly afterward, officials say the hospital was targeted. \n The officials, who insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the sensitive matter, said they believe the hospital attack may have been an effort to cover up evidence of the earlier assault. \n White House officials caution that Trump is not preparing to plunge the U.S. deeper into Syria. Spokesman Sean Spicer said the missile attack sent a clear message to Assad, but he avoided explicitly calling for the Syrian to leave office. \n \"The president believes that the Syrian government, the Assad regime, should at the minimum agree to abide by the agreements they made to not use chemical weapons,\" Spicer said when asked if Assad should step down. \n The impact of the strikes was also unclear. Despite intense international pressure, Assad has clung to power since a civil war broke out in his country six years ago, helped by financial and military support from both Russia and Iran. Russian military personnel and aircraft are embedded with Syria's, and Iranian troops and paramilitary forces are also on the ground helping Assad fight the array of opposition groups hoping to topple him. \n Trump spent today in Florida, in private meetings with visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping. U.S. officials noted that the timing of the strike had the possible added benefit of signaling to China that Trump is willing to make good on his threat to act alone to stop North Korea's nuclear pursuits if Beijing doesn't exert more pressure on Pyongyang. \n The missile strikes hit the government-controlled Shayrat air base in central Syria, where U.S. officials say the Syrian military planes that dropped the chemicals had taken off. The missiles targeted the base's airstrips, hangars, control tower and ammunition areas, officials said. \n Trump's decision to strike Syria won widespread praise from other nations, including Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which support the Syrian opposition. British Prime Minister Theresa May's office said the action was \"an appropriate response to the barbaric chemical weapons attack launched by the Syrian regime, and is intended to deter further attacks.\" France, Italy and Israel also welcomed the strikes. \n Not everyone was cheering in Washington, where the president's decision to act without congressional authority angered a mix of libertarian Republicans, Democrats and the far right. \n \"The Constitution is very clear that war originates in the legislature,\" said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a leader of the party's non-interventionist wing who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination. \"You vote before you go to war, not after you go to war.\" \n Still, most Republican leaders applauded the president, and some Democrats backed him, too. \n Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said the strikes were \"a limited but necessary response\" and called on Trump to \"develop a comprehensive strategy to end Syria's civil war.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. strikes win global praise \u2014 but ratchet up Russia tension"}

Two male Marines have been demoted and about two dozen other military members are being investigated in connection with the investigation into nude photographs that were shared online, the Marine Corps said. \n WASHINGTON >> Two male Marines have been demoted and about two dozen other military members are being investigated in connection with nude photographs that were shared online, the Marine Corps said today. \n The administrative punishments are the first from the photo scandal that included violent and disparaging comments about women in the pictures. \n The two enlisted Marines made negative comments on a social media site under a photo of a woman, but their remarks were about a male senior leader, not her. \n In an interview with The Associated Press today, Marine Gen. Glenn Walters, the assistant commandant, said that commanders can punish Marines for such behavior because it violates the military code of good order and discipline. \n \"Good order and discipline is a requirement for all Marines and if you do something that does not promote good order and discipline in a unit then you can be held accountable,\" he said. \"All of these activities on social media that disparage a female Marine or any Marine for that matter is not good order and discipline and we have an adjudication process in place to assure that.\" \n The other service members being investigated are either active duty or reserve Marines. \n A number of former and current female Marines have come forward to say that their photographs and those of other female service members were posted online without their consent. The postings triggered investigations by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the Army Criminal Investigation Command. So far, only female Marines have come forward as victims. \n According to Marine Lt. Col. Warren Cook, commander of 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, the two demoted Marines posted derogatory comments on the social media page \"United States Grunt Corps.\" He said the two unit members pleaded guilty and were demoted by one pay grade, and put on 45 days of restriction and 45 days of extra duties. \n Regarding the civilians identified by investigators, two cases have been referred to state authorities, Walters said. In both cases the states decided not to pursue the matter any further, he said. \n Andrew Traver, NCIS director, said that the investigative team of about 100 people has already reviewed more than 75,000 images and 150 different websites. He said that about half of the photos are of women and half are of men, and the overwhelming majority of the photos are so-called selfies \u2014 taken voluntarily by the subject. \n In addition, he said, most of the photo and comment postings were done by civilians. And in the bulk of the cases, they don't rise to the level of criminal activity, he said. \n NCIS is also using facial recognition software to help women determine whether or not their photos may have been circulated on the websites. So far, he said, there have been \"a handful\" of matches. \n Walters said that NCIS will build criminal cases when possible, but if there are no criminal charges the case will be referred to the service to determine if there were code violations and if administrative action is appropriate. \n \"Everything we teach in combat is about teamwork,\" said Walters. \"If we have some members of the team that we're not getting the best out of because we're treating them bad, then we're not going to be successful on the battlefield.\" \n In the month since the scandal broke, the Marine Corps has issued a longer and more detailed social media policy that lays out the legal ramifications for service members who commit misconduct online.

Moments before he shot her in the head, Kristine Kirk told a 911 dispatcher her husband was hallucinating and was getting a gun after eating pot candy. \n Kirk initially pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder but right before he was about to go on trial in 2015, he changed his plea to not guilty by reason of insanity, claiming that he was intoxicated with THC, marijuana's psychoactive ingredient. \n In February, he agreed to plead guilty to second-degree murder in a deal with prosecutors, avoiding a potential life sentence that could have come with a conviction on the more serious charge. \n His lawyers still sought lenience on the grounds that he had consumed THC to relieve back pain and it had severely impaired his judgment. Denver District Judge Martin Egelhoff did not address that argument Friday in sentencing Kirk to the high end of the 25- to 30-year range set out in his plea agreement. \n Authorities have said low levels of THC were found in Kirk's blood, and a partially eaten piece of marijuana candy was found in the house. But they have not said what role, if any, they thought pot played in the shooting. \n According to investigators, the couple had escalating marital and financial problems, and Kristine Kirk had told a friend she was afraid of her husband because they had been fighting so much. \n Kristine Kirk told dispatchers that her husband was acting more drunk than violent, crawling through a bedroom window and cutting his legs on broken glass. But prosecutors said he had the wherewithal to remember the code to a locked gun safe and press the weapon to his wife's head. \n District Attorney Beth McCann has said that plea deal was reached because the family wanted to avoid a trial given the emotional toll they have already suffered. Under the plea deal, Kirk also allowed his wife's parents, Marti and Wayne Kohnke, to adopt the couple's three children. \n Last year, the Kohnkes sued two marijuana businesses that sold candy to Richard Kirk, saying they failed to warn him about its potency and possible side effects. \n In response to the Kirk case and the death of a Wyoming college student who jumped from a hotel balcony after eating a potent marijuana cookie, Colorado lawmakers tightened regulations on marijuana snacks that became popular after the state legalized recreational marijuana stores. The state also now has stricter limits on how much marijuana they can contain and tougher labeling requirements. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Man who said marijuana made him kill his wife gets 30 years"}

{"date": "April 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Seattle Mayor Ed Murray speaks at a celebration of Indigenous Peoples' Day in Seattle, Wash. Murray was sued by a man who claimed Murray abused him 30 years ago when he was a teenager. Murray's personal spokesman, Jeff Reading, said in a statement that the allegations are false, politically motivated and that Murray would fight them. \n SEATTLE >> Ed Murray led a long campaign to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington state, toiled for nearly two decades as a state lawmaker and won his biggest personal political victory in 2013 when he unseated Seattle's incumbent mayor by promising the ultra-liberal city to raise the minimum hourly wage to $15. \n Just as he took on a role as a high-profile critic of President Donald Trump and prepared to launch a re-election campaign, Murray was hit Thursday with a political bombshell \u2014 accusations from three men that Murray sexually abused them in the 1980s. \n On Friday, Murray held a brief news conference to deny allegations in a lawsuit by one man, saying \"they were very painful for me. It was painful for my husband.\" Through a spokesman he has also denied the allegations by the other men. \n He said he will not step down and is sticking to re-election campaign plans but refused to answer reporters' questions, saying the case \"is now a legal matter that is in the courts.\" \n Murray's spokesman, Jeff Reading, previously suggested unnamed Murray enemies were behind the claims. \"It is not a coincidence that this shakedown effort comes within weeks of the campaign filing deadline,\" Reading said. \n Calls to city councilmembers earlier for Friday for comment about the mayor and what impact the allegations could mean for his political future went unreturned. \n Murray, 61, grew up in working class neighborhoods in and around Seattle as one of seven children in an Irish Catholic family and became one of the state's most prominent political figures. \n \"Things have never come easily to me in life, but I have never backed down and I will not back down now,\" Murray told reporters in remarks that lasted less than two minutes. \n As a young man, he considered joining the priesthood and spent a year at a seminary in 1976 before studying sociology at the University of Portland, a private Catholic institution. \n Murray ended up working a paralegal with public defender lawyers in Portland before returning to Seattle and joining the vanguard of the gay rights movement in the 1980s, serving as campaign manager for Cal Anderson, a Seattle state senator who was the state's first openly gay member. \n Anderson, Murray's mentor, died in 1995. Murray failed in his bid to win Anderson's seat, but he was appointed to fill the legislative seat of the state representative who won the state senate campaign. \n During his 18 years as a state lawmaker, Murray was the prime sponsor of Washington's gay marriage law, spearheaded an effort to protect LGBTQ youth in public schools and led the state's push to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation. \n \"As a legislator, Ed was a warrior for core Democratic values,\" said state Sen. Reuven Carlyle, a fellow Seattle Democrat. \"He was unquestionably a tough negotiator with an eye on the long game for progress.\" \n The 2013 mayoral race was a bruising campaign that focused on whether Murray would be more liberal and effective than incumbent Mike McGinn, a fellow Democrat, in the notoriously difficult city to govern because of competing liberal factions and an older, established political order resistant to change. \n Murray kept his promise about the minimum wage increase. The higher minimum wage was phased in over time. Murray also recently fought to boost funding to address Seattle's homelessness crisis. \n Murray has been with his partner, Michael Shiosaki, for 24 years. They married in 2013. Shiosaki hugged Murray after he made his statement Friday. \n \"He's ambitious,\" state Sen. Jamie Pedersen, a fellow Democrat, said of Murray. \"Not that he's always right \u2014 there are issues I disagree with him on. But when you look at the agenda that he had and what he's been able to accomplish in four years, he's done a huge amount for the city.\" \n After Trump was elected last fall, Murray became a frequent critic. He announced last week that Seattle was suing over Trump's executive order that threatens to withhold federal funds from communities that refuse to cooperate with efforts to find and deport immigrants in the country illegally. \n Murray on Thursday afternoon was planning on touting new numbers showing progress made by the Seattle Police Department under federal supervision \u2014 until the news broke of the lawsuit by a man who is now 46 and said in court documents that the mayor \"raped and molested him\" over a period of several years beginning in 1986. \n The man identified only by his initials, D.H., said he was 15 and addicted to crack cocaine at the time and that Murray was in his 30s. \n On Friday Murray said D.H.'s allegations \"are simply not true\" and said he felt sad for the \"troubled\" individual. \n The man's, Lincoln Beauregard, sent a letter Friday to Murray's lawyer offering to make D.H. available for a video deposition and disputed that the lawsuit was politically motivated. Following Murray's statement Beauregard said Murray wasn't being truthful. He said the mayor's representatives never asked for his client's identity and that if Murray is being forthright \"he should have no idea who my client is \u2026 how can he paint him as 'troubled.' \" \n In the lawsuit filed Thursday, however, the man had said he had sought mental health counseling and was taking part in addiction-recovery programs. \n An entry in a case-tracking system shows that the Multnomah County District Attorney's office rejected pursuing a third-degree sodomy case against Murray in 1984, District Attorney Don Rees said. \n Portland police have found no records linking either man to Murray, said Sgt.

The posts were a prank, but the 11-year-old boy apparently believed them. \n Moments later, his mother found him hanging by the neck in his room in Marquette, Michigan. Now a prosecutor is pursuing criminal charges against a juvenile accused of being involved in the scheme, which Katrina Goss described as \"a twisted, sick joke.\" \n Goss described her son as appearing \"fine\" just 40 minutes before she found him. \n \"I just want it be exposed and be addressed,\" Goss said of school bullying in general and cyberbullying in particular. \"I don't want it be ignored.\" \n Using a cellphone he bought without his mother's knowledge, Tysen on March 14 was reading texts and other messages about the faked suicide and decided he would end his life too, his mother said. \n After seeing the posts about his girlfriend, Tysen replied over social media that he was going to kill himself, and no one involved in the prank told an adult, Goss said. \n The boy died Tuesday at a Detroit-area hospital. \n Authorities would not release the age of the juvenile charged or comment on what relationship the person had with Tysen. The juvenile is being charged with malicious use of telecommunication services and using a computer to commit a crime. \n The girl whose death was faked and friends who were in on the prank attended the same school as Tysen, Goss said.

He said the district has been educating students and parents through its health curriculum, health fairs, community forums and other efforts. \n \"After the gut-wrenching loss of a student, we ask ourselves, 'How can we do more?'\" Saunders wrote. \n Most states, including Michigan, have enacted legislation designed to protect children from bullies. \n Michigan's anti-bullying act, signed in 2011 by Gov. Rick Snyder, requires school districts to have anti-bullying policies on the books. It was known as \"Matt's Safe School Law\" after Matt Epling, a 14-year-old who killed himself after a 2002 hazing incident. \n The law was updated two years ago to direct school districts to add language to those policies that address cyberbullying. \n Former Republican state Rep. Phil Potvin, who sponsored the original bill, said schools have a responsibility to do more than include anti-cyberbullying rules in their written policies. \n \"They have to have a person \u2014 spelled out \u2014 to make sure that policy is followed,\" said Potvin, of Cadillac in northern Michigan. \"Some schools have failed to do that. They may have put something in, but there is no follow-up. There is no checking up on these things.\" \n In 2006, Megan Meier committed suicide after a woman who lived in her family's neighborhood in St. Charles County, Missouri, encouraged the 13-year-old to kill herself. The woman had created a fake MySpace admirer named \"Josh,\" who befriended Megan. \n The woman was convicted in a California federal court of three misdemeanors, but a judge overturned the conviction. \n Pranks \"definitely happen,\" said Tina Meier, who runs a national bullying and cyberbullying prevention foundation named after her daughter. \n \"The problem is when they are pranking somebody \u2026 to them it's just been a joke,\" Meier said. \"To the other person, it's been real.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Michigan boy, 11, hangs himself after social media prank"}

On Thursday, Twitter charged that efforts by the government to \"unmask\" the people behind the account violated the First Amendment. \n \"The speed with which the government buckled shows just how blatantly unconstitutional its demand was in the first place,\" American Civil Liberties Union attorney Esha Bhandari said in a statement. Bhandari represents the unidentified person or people behind the Twitter account. \n ALT-FIGHT \n The account in question is ALT\u2014uscis, a reference to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office. In the two months of its existence, the account has been critical of the Trump administration's immigration policies. The account described its users to The Associated Press in February as employees and former employees of the agency. \n The account is one of dozens of rogue Twitter accounts that have sprung up since Trump took office, purporting to represent current or former federal employees at various agencies who oppose the administration's policies.

{"date": "April 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., center, speaks to reporters following a briefing on Syria on Capitol Hill in Washington. Amid measured support for the U.S. cruise missile attack on a Syrian air base, some vocal Republicans and Democrats are reprimanding the White House for launching the strike without first getting congressional approval. \n Trump burnished an \"America first\" foreign policy during his 2016 campaign, warning that rival Hillary Clinton would dangerously order U.S. soldiers into international conflicts. He was often critical of former President Barack Obama's handling of the Syria crisis in 2013 and urged him at the time to seek congressional approval for any military action. \n But the president said Thursday night that the airstrikes were in the \"vital national security interest\" of the U.S. and accused Syrian President Bashar Assad of having \"choked\" his own citizens in a chemical attack. \n Trump's decision to launch the airstrikes on a Syrian military base represented an about-face at the start of his presidency and angered Republicans and Democrats, who said the U.S. Constitution gave Congress sole power to declare war. They urged Trump to come to Congress to get authorization for military force. \n \"The Constitution is very clear that war originates in the legislature,\" said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a leader of the party's non-interventionist wing who challenged Trump for the GOP nomination. \n Paul, who called the Syria strike unconstitutional, said today before a closed-door briefing for lawmakers that they weren't learning about the intelligence that led the president to order the strike until the day after the missiles were launched. \n \"You vote before you go to war, not after you go to war,\" Paul told reporters. \n Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said, \"If there's no strategy on Syria, he clearly made this decision based off of an emotional reaction to the images on TV, and it should worry everyone about the quixotic nature of this administration's foreign policy.\" \n Any attempt by Trump to push a new war powers resolution through Congress would be difficult. Obama asked lawmakers two years ago to formally authorize war against the Islamic State but they never acted on the proposal. \n The Trump administration had only days earlier suggested that Assad's hold on power was a political reality. And Trump, in a December rally in North Carolina after his election, vowed that the U.S. would \"stop racing to topple \u2026 foreign regimes that we know nothing about, that we shouldn't be involved with.\" \n Trump's transformation did not sit well with Republican supporters in Congress and in the media who had backed his non-interventionist stances during the campaign. Conservative author and commentator Ann Coulter noted on Twitter that the president had campaigned on not getting involved in the Middle East because it would help enemies of the U.S. and lead to more refugees. \n Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, once considered for press secretary in the Trump White House, tweeted: \"Missiles flying. (Marco) Rubio's happy. (John) McCain ecstatic. Hillary's on board. A complete policy change in 48 hrs.\" \n Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., questioned how it would affect Trump's efforts to defeat the Islamic State group. \n \"Didn't the missile attack just make the situation better for ISIS?\" Massie tweeted today. \n In Palm Beach, Florida, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the action was \"very decisive, justified and proportional\" and said Article II of the Constitution allowed the military action in support of U.S. national security. \n An outside group formed to back Trump's agenda, America First Policies, tweeted a photo of Trump departing Air Force One with the words: \"Enough is enough. This is a POTUS who is not afraid to act.\" \n But Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., disputed the Trump administration's justification. \n \"The idea this chemical weapons attack affects the national security of the United States is fairly tenuous,\" Amash said. \"It's a rather flimsy argument.\" \n Republican leaders, many of whom back a more hawkish view of foreign policy, praised Trump's actions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he supported \"both the action and objective,\" while House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., called the strike \"appropriate and just.\" \n Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, another Trump rival during the 2016 Republican primaries, said he told the president he had done \"the right thing\" during a phone call Thursday night after the airstrikes. \n The South Carolina lawmaker, who has favored a more aggressive stance in Syria, said Trump's opposition to being an interventionist during the campaign needed to shift. \n \"I think what he's got to realize is, the campaign rhetoric has all been replaced by reality,\" Graham said. \"The reality in Syria is if we end this conflict where Iran dominates Damascus it never ends.

{"date": "April 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Bonobos manager Stephen Lusardi arranges clothing at the brand's Guideshop, in New York's Financial District. The U.S. government issues the March jobs report, Friday, April 7, 2017. \n WASHINGTON >> U.S. employers cut back sharply on hiring in March, yet today's jobs report still had much to be encouraged about, including a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.5 percent, the lowest in a decade. \n Employers added just 98,000 jobs, the Labor Department said. It was barely half the previous month's gain. \n Yet unemployment dropped from 4.7 percent, reaching its lowest point since May 2007. While the rate has fallen in the past because of unemployed workers who had given up looking, it happened this time because of a healthy gain in the number of people with jobs. \n \"Within the disappointing 98,000 net new jobs added, there seems to be a lot more going on beneath the surface, and what is going beneath the surface is mostly good,\" said Mark Vitner, an economist at Wells Fargo. \n Here are the positive aspects of the report, followed by some parts that were not so hot: \n \u2014 JOB GROWTH STILL OK \n In the past three months, employers have added an average of 178,000 jobs a month. That's much better than March's increase and is closer to the underlying trend, economists said. \n That's also just below the average gains of 187,000 jobs a month last year. Hiring should rebound closer to that level in the coming months, economists say. \n \u2014 HIT FROM WEATHER PROBABLY TEMPORARY \n One reason last month's weak gain was probably a blip is that harsh winter weather in New England and the Midwest most likely hurt hiring in construction, retail and other weather-sensitive industries. Also, construction companies reported huge job gains in January and February, when the weather was unseasonably warm, so they didn't need to engage in their usual spring hiring. \n \u2014 BETTER JOBS \n The job gains last month, while tepid, occurred in better-paying industries, such as manufacturing and a category that includes accounting, engineering and other professional services. \n Lower-paying fields, such as retail, cut jobs, while a category that includes restaurants and hotels posted a small gain. \n And all the new jobs added were full time, the government said. The number of Americans who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job fell. \n An alternative unemployment measure, which includes involuntary part-time workers, fell to 8.9 percent, its lowest level since December 2007, when the Great Recession started. \n That's down from a peak in 2010 of 17.1 percent. \n Yet there were some discouraging signs: \n \u2014 MORE OPTIMISM, SAME ECONOMY \n Consumer and business optimism has soared since the presidential election. Many companies eagerly await the tax cuts and deregulation promised by President Trump. \n Yet so far, there is little evidence that better sentiment has translated into more hiring, spending or economic growth. Companies are adding workers at the same pace they did last year. And consumers trimmed their inflation-adjusted spending in January and February. \n \u2014 STAGNANT WAGES \n Average hourly earnings climbed 2.7 percent over the past year, not much of a win for workers. And after factoring in inflation in the past year, paychecks are essentially flat. \n \"Right now, real wages are basically stagnant,\" said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management. \"That's why things like retail sales growth and other indicators for consumer demand have been so anemic.\" \n The situation is even tougher for front-line workers, who account for the majority of all jobs. Their wages have risen just 2.3 percent, so after inflation they have fallen. \n \u2014 HIRING NOT WIDELY SPREAD \n The drop in the unemployment rate is good news, but it doesn't mean everyone has benefited. Women made up nearly all those who gained jobs, with the unemployment rate for adult men unchanged, at a still-low 4.3 percent. \n \u2014 DISAPPEARING RETAIL JOBS \n Online shopping is taking its toll on traditional retailers who can no longer compete on price or convenience as they once did. \n Department and general merchandise stores trimmed 34,700 workers from their payrolls last month. Clothiers let go of 5,800. Amid these job losses, wage growth for retail workers was a paltry 1.1 percent before inflation, far worse than the national average. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hiring slows, but U.S. unemployment falls to 10-year low"}

Those strikes added weight to Trump's threat last week to act unilaterally against North Korea's weapons program. \n Trump said in a brief appearance before reporters that he and Xi made \"tremendous progress\" in their first face-to-face talks and that he believes \"lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away.\" \n He did not elaborate on the progress or the problems. But the two days of talks at Trump's private estate in Florida were expected to focus on what Trump has described as China's unfair trade practices and inadequate efforts to halt North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile program. \n Xi said the delegations covered important topics and have established a good friendship and working relationship. He said he believes the U.S. and China can continue to develop the relationship, noting that it's the historic responsibility of both countries to work toward peace and stability. \n The U.S. announced the missile barrage shortly after Trump and Xi wrapped up dinner Thursday. The strikes were retaliation against Syrian President Bashar Assad for a chemical weapons attack against civilians caught up in his country's long civil war. \n China has sided with Russia at the United Nations in opposing condemnation of Assad's government but has not become directly involved in the conflict. \n China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying today said China opposed the use of chemical weapons by any party under any circumstances but didn't comment on the U.S. attack. \n The timing of the attack could send a message to the Chinese. Trump told the Financial Times in the days before Xi's arrival that he is prepared to go it alone on North Korea if China doesn't work with the U.S. to crack down on North Korea's nuclear program \n Military options against North Korea are much riskier than those against Syria. It has already tested nuclear weapons and South Korea's capital, Seoul, is in range of North Korean artillery. \n Taking action against North Korea has been a sticking point in U.S. talks with the Chinese. China is North Korea's most important ally and trading partner. \n Before Thursday's dinner, Trump said he and Xi already had had a long discussion and had \"developed a friendship,\" and then joked, \"I have gotten nothing, absolutely nothing.\" \n However, Xi apparently got something out of dinner. Chinese state media reported late Thursday that Trump has accepted Xi's invitation to visit China this year. The official Xinhua News Agency said Trump will travel to China at an \"early date\" in 2017, but gave no details. \n The White House downplayed expectations for a breakthrough on issues like trade and tariffs, insisting that the 24-hour summit is mostly an introductory meeting for the two leaders. Within Trump's administration, divisions remain over how to approach China. \n As a candidate and president, Trump has taken an aggressive posture toward China, labeling Beijing a \"tremendous problem\" and arguing that lopsided trade deals with China shortchange American businesses and workers. Last week, the president tweeted that his meeting with Xi would be \"very difficult.\" \n He also last week signed a pair of executive orders focused on reducing the U.S. trade deficit, an apparent shot at China, which accounted for the vast bulk \u2014 $347 billion \u2014 of last year's $502 billion trade deficit. \n Speaking to reporters while traveling to Florida, Trump suggested a link between \"terrible\" trade agreements the U.S. has made with China and Pyongyang's provocations. He said the two issues \"really do mix.\" \n While Trump would not say what he wants China to do specifically, he said he thinks China will \"want to be stepping up\" on the North Korea issue. \n Xi was expected to seek assurances that Trump will not interfere in the territorial dispute over the South China Sea or question the \"One China\" policy by reaching out to Taiwan's leader again, as Trump did during the transition. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump lauds 'outstanding' relationship with Chinese leader"}

{"date": "April 7, 2017", "text": "STAR-ADVERTISER / 2016 \n The Federal Aviation Administration is restricting drone flights over 133 military facilities for security reasons. It's the first time these restrictions have been applied only to drones. \n WASHINGTON >> Drone flights over 133 military facilities will be restricted for security reasons, marking the first time such flight restrictions have been applied only to drones rather than aircraft in general, the U.S. aviation safety authority said today. \n The restrictions are in response to requests from the Defense Department and other security and intelligence agencies, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. No specific threat was cited. \n While drones can't fly over the facilities, the FAA's agreement with the Defense Department permits drone flights below 400 feet high within the side boundaries of the facilities, the statement said. Small drones in general are limited by the FAA to flights no higher than 400 feet anywhere without special permission. \n An attorney for a coalition of companies that want to make or use drones said the language of the restriction is broadly written and may be used to apply to other types of facilities besides military installations. \n The FAA announcement came as a surprise to the drone industry, said Michael Drobac of the Small UAV Coalition. Companies in general weren't asked for their views ahead of the decision despite efforts to work closely with the agency through numerous committees and working groups, he said. The \"imprecise\" language in the new restrictions leaves drone operators uncertain exactly what will and what won't be allowed, he said. \n \"We lack the kind of clarity and specificity that industry depends upon from government,\" Drobac said. \n An aviation law passed by Congress last year requires the FAA to come up with rules to determine what types of facilities, in addition to military facilities, are safety or security critical and may be designated as no-drone zones. The agency was supposed to propose a plan to do that in January, but missed the deadline, Drobrac said. \n FAA officials also promised to propose by the end of 2016 long-sought rules under which operators can fly drones over densely populated areas and crowds, which isn't permitted now except by special waiver. The rules are a necessary step to clear the way for package deliveries by drones. But that proposal was derailed at the last minute when military and law enforcement officials expressed concern that they don't have a way yet in which to identify whether drones operating present a threat or not. \n FAA officials have now set aside their work on rules for flights over populated areas in order to first address the security concerns. \n The new flight restrictions are effective beginning April 14. Only a few exceptions will be permitted and they must be coordinated with the individual facility or the FAA. Operators who violate the restrictions could be subject to fines or criminal charges. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. restricts drone flights over 133 military facilities"}

Jerry Brown declared an end to California's historic drought today, lifting emergency orders that had forced residents to stop running sprinklers as often and encouraged them to rip out thirsty lawns during the state's driest four-year period on record. \n The governor's order that keeps in place conservation measures came as a springtime storm bears down on the waterlogged state. \n The drought strained native fish that migrate up rivers, killed millions of trees, and forced farmers in the nation's leading agricultural state to rely heavily on groundwater, with some tearing out orchards. It also dried up wells, forcing hundreds of families in rural areas to drink bottled water and bathe from buckets. \n Brown declared the drought emergency in 2014, and officials later ordered mandatory conservation for the first time in state history. Regulators last year relaxed the rules after a rainfall was close to normal. \n But monster storms this winter erased nearly all signs of drought, blanketing the Sierra Nevada with deep snow, California's key water source, and boosting reservoirs. \n \"This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,\" Brown said in a statement. \"Conservation must remain a way of life.\" \n The governor lifted the drought emergency in all California counties except Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne, where emergency drinking water projects will continue to help address diminished groundwater supplies. \n Water conservation will become a way of life in the nation's most populous state, said Felicia Marcus, chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, who led conservation planning. Officials already have started charting long-term rules to make California more resilient as climate change makes weather patterns more severe. \n \"There's a greater appreciation of just how precious water is,\" she said. \"We've got to plan for longer droughts.\" \n Cities and water districts throughout the state will be required to continue reporting their water use each month, said the governor order, which also bans wasteful practices, such as hosing off sidewalks and running sprinklers when it rains. \n New rules are expected to permanently ban wasteful practices, such as hosing off sidewalks and watering landscapes in the days after it rains.

{"date": "April 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch spoke during his confirmation hearing, March 22, on Capitol Hill in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> The Senate confirmed Neil Gorsuch to become the newest associate justice on the Supreme Court today, elevating Donald Trump's nominee following a corrosive partisan confrontation that could have lasting impacts for the Senate and the court. \n Vice President Mike Pence was presiding as the Senate voted 54-45 in favor of Gorsuch, a 49-year-old veteran of the 10th U.S. Circuit of Appeals in Denver whose conservative rulings make him an intellectual heir to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose seat he will fill. \n (Hawaii's two Democratic senators, Mazie K. Hirono and Brian Schatz both voted against confirmation.) \n Gorsuch won support from 51 of the chambers' Republicans as well as three moderate Democrats up for re-election in states Trump won last fall: Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia, who has been recovering from back surgery, did not vote. \n The outcome was a major win for Trump, his biggest congressional victory to date, as well as for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who kept Scalia's seat open after the justice's death in February 2016. McConnell refused to hold hearings for President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland, a move that enraged Democrats but that Republicans now hail as a political master stroke. \n After he is sworn in, Gorsuch will restore the court's conservative voting majority that existed before Scalia's death, and which could persist for years or even grow over the course of Trump's administration. He is expected to be sworn in Monday, in time to hear the final cases of the term. He was nominated by Trump shortly after the January inauguration. \n Republicans exulted in the victory. \n \"This is a person of extraordinary credentials who will bring honor to the Supreme Court for many, many years to come. So it is indeed a proud day,\" McConnell said. He told reporters that he views his refusal to fill Scalia's seat, which was initially questioned by some fellow Republicans, as \"the most consequential decision I've ever been involved in.\" \n For many conservatives, Trump's choice of Gorsuch made up for any number of other weaknesses in his candidacy and his administration. Gorsuch was on a list of potential justices recommended by the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation during the campaign, and some Republicans even credit the Supreme Court vacancy as one reason Trump won the November election. In exit polls, 21 percent of voters called Supreme Court appointments \"the most important factor\" to their vote, and among those people 56 percent voted for Trump. \n Democrats denounced the GOP's use of what both sides dubbed the \"nuclear option\" to put Gorsuch on the court, calling it an epic power grab that would further corrode politics in Congress, the courts and the United States. Many Republicans bemoaned reaching that point, too, but they blamed Democrats for pushing them to it. \n Gorsuch's confirmation today was preceded by a Senate floor showdown Thursday in which Democrats initially mounted a filibuster, denying Gorsuch the 60 votes needed to proceed. Republicans then acted unilaterally to lower the vote threshold on Supreme Court filibusters from 60 to a simple majority in the 100-member Senate. \n Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a senior Republican, warned of the implications of lowering the 60-vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees, thereby eliminating any role for the minority party in ratifying the selection. \n \"I am very concerned about the future, which will then, with only a 51-vote majority required, lead to polarization of the nominees as far as their philosophies are concerned, when the majority does not have to consider the concerns and the votes of the minority,\" McCain said, though he himself voted with McConnell and the rest of the Republicans to lower the vote threshold. \n \"I believe it will make this body a more partisan place,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"It will make the cooling saucer of the Senate considerably hotter, and I believe it will make the Supreme Court a more partisan place.\" \n The Senate change, affecting how many votes a nominee needs to advance to a final confirmation vote, will apply to all future Supreme Court candidates as well. Trump himself predicted to reporters aboard Air Force One Thursday that \"there could be as many as four\" Supreme Court vacancies for him to fill during his administration. \n \"In fact, under a certain scenario, there could even be more than that,\" Trump said. There is no way to know how many there will be, if any, but several justices are quite elderly. \n Even as they united in indignation, lawmakers of both parties, pulled by fierce political forces from left and right, were unwilling to stop the confirmation rules change. And in many ways the showdown had been pre-ordained, the final chapter in years of partisan warfare over judicial nominees. \n Even as senior Republicans lamented the voting change, McConnell and some allies argued that all they were doing was returning to a time, not long ago, when filibusters of judicial nominees were unusual, and it was virtually unheard-of to try to block a Supreme Court nominee in that fashion. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Senate confirms Trump pick Gorsuch to Supreme Court"}

{"date": "April 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov spoke, Thursday, with The Associated Press in Moscow, Russia. \"President (Vladimir) Putin believes that the U.S. strikes on Syria represent an aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law under a far-fetched pretext,\" Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement. \n MOSCOW >> Russia said today it was cutting a hotline intended to prevent midair incidents over Syria in response to the U.S. missile attack on a Syrian base. The response that demonstrates Moscow's readiness to defy Washington and could even put the two nuclear superpowers on a course toward military confrontation. \n Russia President Vladimir Putin signaled he was ready to risk a clash with the U.S. and abandon hopes for mending ties under President Donald Trump, rather than accept the humiliation of standing by while his ally is bombed. \n Russia's decision to suspend the hotline established after the launch of the Russian air campaign in Syria in September 2015 effectively means that Russian and U.S. planes could fly dangerously close to each other during combat missions, raising the risk of inadvertent or deliberate clashes in the crowded skies over Syria. \n Senior U.S. military officials told The Associated Press that the U.S. and Russia will maintain the hotline. But Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the U.S. was informed that Russia would \"suspend its obligations\" at 11 a.m. Hawaii time. \n By freezing the information channel between the two potent militaries, Russia is signaling to Washington that it will tolerate no further strikes on Syrian government facilities. \n Syria has aging Soviet-built aircraft and air defense missile systems, while Russia has deployed dozens of its cutting edge warplanes and air defense batteries at its base in Syria's coastal province of Latakia. It also has a strategically important naval outpost in the Syrian port of Tartus, which is protected by air defense assets. \n Further upping the ante, the Russian Defense Ministry said it will now help strengthen Syrian air defenses. \n U.S. officials accused Russia of failing to ensure Syrian President Bashar Assad's commitment to a 2013 deal for the destruction of Assad's chemical weapons arsenal. The U.S. says that arsenal was tapped for a chemical attack that killed dozens of civilians in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province. \n Trump cited the chemical attack as justification for the missile strike on a Syrian air base. But the Kremlin insists Assad's government wasn't responsible for the attack, saying civilians in Khan Sheikhoun were exposed to toxic agents from a rebel arsenal that was hit by Syrian warplanes. \n \"President Putin believes that the U.S. strikes on Syria represent an aggression against a sovereign state in violation of international law under a far-fetched pretext,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a statement. \"Washington's move deals a significant blow to Russia-U.S. relations, which are already in deplorable shape.\" \n Until the attack on the Syrian air base, the U.S. had avoided striking Assad's forces for fear of provoking a clash with the Russian military. \n The action comes ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's trip to Moscow next week. \n The Kremlin initially had been encouraged by Trump's goal of repairing ties with Moscow, which plunged to post-Cold War lows under former President Barack Obama, but hopes for a thaw have withered amid the congressional investigation of possible links between Trump campaign officials and Russia. The U.S. missile strike could make it all but impossible to improve relations. \n \"Some people here thought that it would be easy to deal with Trump,\" Yelena Suponina, a Moscow-based Mideast expert, said in televised remarks. \"No, it will be very difficult. He's not only ready to make tough decisions, he is unpredictable.\" \n Mikhail Yemelyanov, a senior member of the lower house of parliament, warned that the U.S. action raised the threat of a direct clash between Russia and the U.S. \n \"Consequences could be grave, up to military confrontation and exchange of blows, nothing can be excluded,\" he said, according to the Interfax news agency. \n Tillerson said Russia had \"failed in its responsibility\" to deliver on a 2013 deal it helped broker to destroy Syria's chemical arsenal. \n \"So either Russia has been complicit, or Russia has been simply incompetent on its ability to deliver,\" he said. \n By ordering the strike, Trump threatened the military assets of Assad, who has enjoyed Russia's support throughout the six-year conflict. Russia's military has helped turn the war in Assad's favor and Moscow has used its U.N. Security Council veto to protect Damascus from censure. \n Russia also has important military facilities in Syria that could be put at risk if Assad is removed from power, a goal of Western powers that had recently been put on the back burner because of the focus on fighting Islamic State extremists in Syria and Iraq. \n Peskov said the U.S. gave Russia advance notice about the strike. He added that Moscow believes it makes no sense to maintain the hotline. \n Asked if the decision to freeze the information exchange could raise the risk of midair incidents, Peskov said it was the U.S. attack that increased such danger. \n Peskov wouldn't say if Russia could use its military assets to protect Syrian facilities from future U.S. strikes. \n Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Russia will quickly \"strengthen the Syrian air defense system and increase its efficiency in order to protect Syria's most sensitive infrastructure facilities.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Russia ups ante by freezing communications with U.S. in Syria"}

Officials announced flags at government offices would fly at half-mast Saturday to honor the victims. \n \"The country is in a state of shock,\" he said. \"The aim of terrorism is to undermine democracy. But such a goal will never be achieved in Sweden.\" \n There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Police arrested a man in Marsta, a northern Stockholm suburb close to the city's international airport, as a possible suspect. \n The stolen beer truck traveled for more than 500 yards (meters) along a main pedestrian street known as the Drottninggatan before it smashed into a crowd outside the upscale Ahlens department store about 3 p.m. It came to rest in the entrance to the building. TV footage showed smoke coming out of the store after the crash. \n \"People were screaming and running in all directions,\" said Brandon Sekitto, who was in his car nearby. \"(The truck) drove straight into the Ahlens entrance.\" \n \"I saw the driver, a man in black who was light around the face,\" Brandon told Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter. \"Some women were screaming, 'Run! Run!'\" \n Late into the night, forensic experts in full white suits could be seen working on the truck, collecting evidence. \n Although there was initial confusion on the number of victims, police told reporters in the evening that four people had been killed and 15 were wounded, nine of them seriously. \n Authorities evacuated the city's nearby Central Station, a hub for regional trains and the subway system. All trains to and from the main station were halted and several large shopping malls in Stockholm were shut down. Sweden's national theater, Dramaten, canceled three performances this evening. \n Jan Evensson of the Stockholm police told a news conference that the man who was arrested looked like the person depicted wearing a greenish hood in a surveillance camera photo that police released earlier. He said police were \"particularly interested\" in him. \n \"We continue to investigate at full force,\" Evensson said, urging people not to go to central Stockholm tonight. \n Stefan Hector of Sweden's national police said the working hypothesis was that \"this is an act of terror.\" \n \"We will be working as long as necessary\" to determine who was responsible, Stockholm police spokesman Lars Bystrom told The Associated Press. \n The Swedish brewery Spendrups said one of its trucks had been hijacked just a few blocks from the crash scene earlier today. \n \"It is one of our delivery trucks. In connection with a delivery to a restaurant called Caliente, someone jumped into the truck and drove it away while the driver was unloading his delivery,\" Spendrups spokesman Marten Luth told the Swedish news agency TT. \n The beer company's truck driver was not injured, he said. \n The truck crash appeared to be the latest attack in Europe using a vehicle. \n In an attack last month claimed by the Islamic State group, a man drove into a crowd on London's Westminster Bridge, killing three people and injuring many others before stabbing a policeman to death. He was shot and killed by police. A fourth person, a woman thrown into the Thames by the force of the car attack, died Thursday. \n The IS group also claimed responsibility for a truck attack that killed 86 people in Nice, France, in July 2016 during a Bastille Day festival, as well as another truck attack that killed 12 people at a Christmas market in Berlin. \n Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf cut short a visit to Brazil to return home and sent the royal family's condolences to the families of the truck attack victims. \n Lofven said his Social Democratic Party was still planning to hold its annual convention this weekend in Goteborg, Sweden's second-largest city. \n Condolences poured into Sweden. In neighboring Finland, President Sauli Niinisto said he was shocked by the \"maniac act of terror,\" adding \"every terror attack is to be equally condemned. But it touches us deeply when such an attack takes place in our Nordic neighborhood.\" \n Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen called the attack a cowardly attempt \"to subdue us and the peaceful way we live in Scandinavia.\" \n Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the Eiffel Tower's lights will be turned off from midnight in homage. She expressed her \"strong emotion\" over \"this new terrorist attack of immense cowardice.\" \n EU Council President Donald Tusk said in a tweet that \"my heart is in Stockholm this afternoon. My thoughts are with the victims and their families and friends of today's terrible attack.\" \n European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said \"one of Europe's most vibrant and colorful cities appears to have been struck by those wishing it \u2014 and our very way of life \u2014 harm.\" \n Juncker also said \"an attack on any of our (EU) member states is an attack on us all\" and that Sweden can count on EU help. \n In February, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Sweden could be the next European country to suffer the kind of extremist attacks that have devastated France, Belgium and Germany. Two days after his remarks, a riot broke out in predominantly immigrant suburb of Stockholm where police opened fire on rioters, a surprise to many Swedes who aren't used to officers using guns. \n Today's truck crash was near the site of a December 2010 attack in Stockholm in which Taimour Abdulwahab, a Swedish citizen who lived in Britain, detonated a suicide bomb, killing himself and injuring two others. \n Abdulwahab had rigged a car with explosives in the hope the blast would drive people to Drottninggatan \u2014 the street hit \u2014 where he would set off devices strapped to his chest and back.

{"date": "April 7, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This Oct. 25, 2016 photo provided by Sunday Swett shows Erica Wachs on the Yale University campus in New Haven, Conn. Colleges across the United States are seeing a boom in demand for courses on creative writing, to accommodate interest that has been attributed to the rise of social media and a flourishing culture of self-expression. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This April 5, 2017, self-made photo provided by Gil Moreno shows Moreno in Summit, N.J. Colleges across the United States are seeing a boom in demand for courses on creative writing, to accommodate interest that has been attributed to the rise of social media and a flourishing culture of self-expression. \n NEW HAVEN, Conn. >> Some credit the rise of social media. Others attribute it to a flourishing culture of self-expression. Whatever the reason, colleges across the United States are seeing a boom in demand for courses on creative writing. \n Colleges are adding writing programs to accommodate interest in what has become the rarest of fields in the humanities \u2014 a sector that is growing, rather than losing students to science and technology. \n The number of schools offering bachelor's degrees in creative writing has risen from three in 1975 to 733 today, according to the Association of Writers & Writing Programs, an industry group based at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. \n So what will these students do after graduating? \n \"Most of them are aware that this probably is not going to be their career. At least, I hope they're aware,\" said David Galef, director of the creative writing program at Montclair State University in New Jersey. \"They're interested in doing something they feel is creative.\" \n While some will become professional writers, others will find work in fields such as public relations, advertising or something completely unrelated. Instructors say some students see their focus on writing as a way to understand themselves, make use of a liberal education and enrich their lives. \n One Montclair State undergraduate, Gil Moreno, 46, enrolled years after completing another bachelor's degree, in business management, and dreams of becoming a writer. Even if he can't do it professionally, he'll keep it up on the side. \n \"I'm looking to get away from the business world,\" he said. \"I'm kind of looking to live in my own separate world.\" \n The number of creative writing bachelor's programs has grown steadily, but spiked from 161 in 2008 to 592 in 2013, according to the AWP . English departments elsewhere have offered new concentrations or minors in writing, and still more major programs are planned, including one beginning next fall at the University of Chicago. \n In some English departments, the boom has created tension between creative writing and those who emphasize instruction of literature. \n At Yale University's English department, which is reviewing admissions procedures for the writing concentration amid a surge in applications, professors say their writing program is unusual in requiring that all courses include reading in contemporary work of the chosen genre. \n \"All over the country students are more interested in writing about themselves than they are in reading other people,\" said English professor Leslie Brisman, who has taught at Yale since 1969. \"We are in favor of creativity. We are not in favor of ignorance.\" \n The number of course offerings in creative writing has roughly doubled over the last five years at Yale, where the creative writing director, Richard Deming, suspects the interest can be credited, at least partly, to social media. \n \"This act of expressing one's voice in a public way \u2014 some people feel that they want to add craft, they want to hone those skills and take it to a place of more intensity,\" he said. \"It just builds from there.\" \n Another explanation for the boom, according to David Fenza, director of the AWP, is a cultural disconnect between longstanding staples of English departments and college students who come from increasingly diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. \n \"They want to see literature about their diaspora, not the diaspora of others,\" he said. \"They want literature about them and their families and their ancestors and not the ancestors of white, European, English-speaking peoples.\" \n Erica Wachs, a Yale junior specializing in creative writing, arrived at the Ivy League school thinking she would study either English or global affairs. Her first writing classes included some of the most exciting moments of her freshman year, including sessions with writers discussing their craft. She now is planning a career writing for the entertainment industry. \n \"I hope writing is what I will spend the rest of my life doing,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Demand booming on college campuses for creative writing"}
