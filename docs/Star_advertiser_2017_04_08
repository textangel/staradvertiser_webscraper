{"date": "April 8, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People cleaned up debris after an explosion hit Saint Mark's Cathedral in the coastal city of Alexandria, the historic seat of Christendom in Egypt, Sunday, killing several people, just after Pope Tawadros II finished services. \n TANTA, Egypt >> Bombs exploded at two Coptic churches in different cities in northern Egypt as worshippers were celebrating Palm Sunday, killing at least 43 people and wounding about 100 in an assault claimed by the Islamic State group. \n The blasts came at the start of Holy Week leading up to Easter, and just weeks before Pope Francis is due to visit the Arab world's most populous country, which has been beset by extremist violence against its minority Christians. \n In the first attack, a bomb went off inside St. George's Church in the Nile Delta city of Tanta, killing at least 27 people and wounding 78, officials said. \n A few hours later, a suicide bomber rushed toward St. Mark's Cathedral in the coastal city of Alexandria, the historic seat of Christendom in Egypt, killing at least 16 people and wounding 41, the Interior Ministry said. \n CCTV images broadcast on Egyptian channels showed a man in a blue pullover approach the main gate to St. Mark's but being turned away and directed toward a metal detector. The man then passes a female police officer chatting to another woman, and enters a metal detector before an explosion engulfs the area. \n Pope Tawadros II had held Palm Sunday services at the cathedral, but his aides said he had escaped unharmed. The timing of the attack raised the question of whether the bomber had sought to assassinate the pope, leader of one of the world's oldest Christian communities. \n IS claimed the attacks via its Aamaq news agency, after having recently warned that it would step up violence against Egypt's Christians. \n CBC TV showed footage from inside the church in Tanta, where people gathered around what appeared to be lifeless, bloody bodies covered with papers. \n \"After the explosion, everything became dark from the smoke,\" said Edmond Edward, attending services with his brother, Emil, who was wounded and leaned on him for support at a nearby hospital, his head covered in bandages. \n \"There was a clear lapse in security, which must be tightened from now on to save lives,\" he said. He added that the blast appeared to be centered near the altar and that the priest leading the service, Father Daniel, was wounded. \n Susan Mikhail, whose apartment balcony across the street has a clear view of the church and its front yard, said the explosion violently shook her building. \n \"Deacons were the first to run out of the church. Many of them had blood on their white robes,\" she told The Associated Press. Later, the more seriously wounded were carried out by other survivors and taken to hospitals in private cars, she said. \n Hundreds of residents gathered in the area, and church members blocked people \u2014 including journalists \u2014 from entering the church as police cordoned off the area. \n Regional police chief Brig. Gen. Hossam Elddin Khalifa was fired over the incident, with Maj. Gen. Tarek Hassouna replacing him, state-run newspaper al-Ahram reported. \n Pope Francis, marking Palm Sunday in St. Peter's Square, decried the bombings, expressing \"deep condolences to my brother, Pope Tawadros II, the Coptic church and all of the dear Egyptian nation.\" \n He is due to visit Egypt April 28-29. \n President Donald Trump tweeted that he is \"so sad to hear of the terrorist attack\" against the U.S. ally but added that he has \"great confidence\" that Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, \"will handle the situation properly.\" The two leaders met at the White House on April 3. \n Grand Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, head of Egypt's Al-Azhar \u2014 the leading center of learning in Sunni Islam \u2014 also condemned the attacks, calling them a \"despicable terrorist bombing that targeted the lives of innocents.\" \n Both Israel and the Islamic Hamas movement ruling neighboring Gaza condemned the bombings as well. \n The bombings added to fears that Islamic extremists who have long been battling security forces in the Sinai Peninsula are shifting their focus to civilians. \n An Islamic State affiliate claimed a December suicide bombing at a Cairo church that killed about 30 people, mostly women, as well as a string of killings in the northern Sinai that caused hundreds of Christians to flee to safer areas of the country. \n The militants recently released a video vowing to step up attacks against Christians, whom they regard as \"infidels\" empowering the West against Muslims. \n Egypt has struggled to combat a wave of Islamic militancy since the 2013 military overthrow of an elected Islamist president. \n The Sinai-based IS affiliate has mainly attacked police and soldiers, but has also claimed bombings that killed civilians, including the downing of a Russian passenger jetliner in the Sinai in 2015, which killed all 224 people aboard and devastated Egypt's tourism industry. \n Egypt's Copts are one of the oldest Christian communities in the Middle East. They have long complained of discrimination and that the government does not do enough to protect them. \n Egyptian media had previously reported that the church in Tanta had been targeted before, with a bomb defused there in late March. \n The Copts were largely supportive of the military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, and incurred the wrath of many of his followers, who attacked churches and other Christian institutions. \n While the Copts have stood steadfast alongside the government, repeating the mantra that Egyptians were all being targeted by terrorists, an increase in attacks on Christians has tested that support. \n Outside the Tanta hospital, 27-year-old carpenter Maged Saleh flew into a rage as blood streamed from his arm after he and his mother escaped the explosion. \n \"Where is the government?\" he screamed at onlookers. \"There is no government!\" \n Associated Press writers Maamoun Youssef, Maggie Michael, Menna Zaki and Brian Rohan in Cairo and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Palm Sunday church bombings in Egypt kill 43, wound dozens"}

The country is expected to put on a major parade on April 15, and North Korea watchers are on the lookout to see if it will display its new long-range ballistic missile. \n But for many a devoted marathoner, running in Pyongyang is more about bucket lists than politics. \n This year, more than 1,100 foreigners took part in the full road race, the half marathon or the 10-kilometer (6-mile) run. \n The course took them past such Pyongyang landmarks as Kim Il Sung Square and the recently completed Scientists' Street high-rise district. All runners finished in Kim Il Sung Stadium before tens of thousands of cheering North Koreans. While the runners were off on the streets, the crowd in the stadium was kept entertained by a soccer match. \n \"I don't know if you would say it was on my bucket list, but it was certainly something out of the ordinary,\" said Philippe Sacher, a 38-year-old from Munich, Germany, who ran the half marathon. \"I want to see for myself.\" \n Curious Pyongyang residents lined the streets to look at the colorfully clad foreign throngs. \n Many yelled \"Hurry! Hurry!\" as the runners passed by. \n \"I think many of them only know what they have seen in their media and have a mistaken image,\" said Pyongyang retiree Choe Yong Su. \"But seeing is believing.\" \n The marathon also includes a race for elite runners recognized as a bronze label competition by the International Amateur Athletics Federation. \n Just a handful of elite runners joined this year, mostly from Africa, and North Koreans won the men's and women's marathon golds. \n To the delighted roar of the crowd, the first runner to enter Kim Il Sung Stadium was Pak Chol, who finished in 2 hours, 14 minutes, 56 seconds. Jo Un Ok, who took the bronze in last year's Beijing Marathon, won the women's race in 2:29:23. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Foreigners crowd Pyongyang streets for marathon"}

{"date": "April 8, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Iran's long-exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi spoke during an interview at the Associated Press bureau in Washington on Thursday. \n DUBAI, United Arab Emirates >> Iran's exiled crown prince wants a revolution. \n Reza Pahlavi, the son of the last shah to rule before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, has seen his profile rise in recent months following the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, who promises a harder line against the Shiite power. \n Pahlavi's calls for replacing clerical rule with a parliamentary monarchy, enshrining human rights and modernizing its state-run economy could prove palatable to both the West and Iran's Sunni Gulf neighbors, who remain suspicious of Iran's intentions amid its involvement in the wars in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. \n But the Mideast is replete with cautionary tales about Western governments putting their faith in exiles long estranged from their homelands. Whether Pahlavi can galvanize nostalgia for the age of the Peacock Throne remains unseen. \n \"This regime is simply irreformable because the nature of it, its DNA, is such that it cannot,\" Pahlavi told the Associated Press. \"People have given up with the idea of reform and they think there has to be fundamental change. Now, how this change can occur is the big question.\" \n Pahlavi left Iran at age 17 for military flight school in the U.S., just before his cancer-stricken father Mohammad Reza Pahlavi abandoned the throne for exile. The revolution followed, with the creation of the Islamic Republic, the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and the sweeping away of the last vestiges of the American-backed monarchy. \n Yet the Pahlavis and the age of the monarchy have retained their mystique in Iran, even as the majority of its 80 million people weren't alive to experience it. Television period pieces have focused on their rule, including the recent state TV series \"The Enigma of the Shah,\" the most expensive series ever produced to air in the country. While incorporating romances or mobsters into the tales, all uniformly criticize the royal court. \n But Pahlavi, 56, insists young Iranians increasingly look toward Iran's past. He pointed to recent demonstrations at the tomb of the pre-Islamic King Cyrus the Great, which have been claimed by a variety of anti-government forces as a sign of unrest. Under his father's secular and pro-Western rule, Iran experienced a rapid modernization program financed by oil revenues. \n \"If you look at the legacy that was left behind by both my father and my grandfather \u2026 it contrasts with this archaic, sort of backward, religiously rooted radical system that has been extremely repressive,\" Pahlavi said. \n Since the U.S. election, Pahlavi has given a growing number of media interviews, including with Breitbart, the far-right website once run by Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Pahlavi also has sent letters to the Trump administration. \n Gauging national sentiment toward restoring the monarchy in Iran is impossible, especially after the crackdown that followed the country's disputed 2009 election. Iranian state media routinely refer to the Pahlavi monarchy as \"despotic,\" but there has been some reassessing of history in other quarters. \n A book published last year, \"The Fall of Heaven: The Pahlavis and the Last Days of Imperial Iran,\" offered a revisionist view of the shah. While acknowledging the abuses of his feared SAVAK intelligence service and the corruption surrounding his rule, the book portrays him as a fatalist in an era of disappearing Mideast monarchies. \n \"The regime has repressed discussion of the Pahlavis for so long that it has had the opposite effect of making young Iranians inside the country curious about what they don't know,\" said historian Andrew Scott Cooper, the book's author. \"There's an interesting generational divide going on here to where young Iranians are saying to their parents and grandparents, the same people who marched against the shah and Pahlavis, 'Why did you get rid of that system and put this one in place?'\" \n He added: \"The family name still retains a lot of magic, more than ever today among Iranians. How that translates practically into support for Reza as a credible alternative leader, I just don't know.\" \n Asked how his envisioned peaceful revolution could play out in Iran, Pahlavi said it would need to begin with labor unions starting a nationwide strike. He said members of the hard-line Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary organization established to protect the clerical system, would be assured they wouldn't be \"all hung and shot.\" \n Most importantly, he said Western governments need to keep their distance and not threaten military action. \n That's an exceedingly optimistic vision, especially considering the amount of power the Guard and other hard-liners wield in Iran's economy. It also largely ignores the concerns many in Iran have about Western meddling. Pahlavi's father took power following a 1953 coup engineered by Britain and the U.S. \n Pahlavi, who still resides in the U.S., said he hasn't had any \"side occupation\" since 1979, and has received financial support from his family and \"many Iranians who have supported the cause.\" \n \"My focus right now is on liberating Iran, and I will find any means that I can, without compromising the national interests and independence, with anyone who is willing to give us a hand, whether it is the U.S. or the Saudis or the Israelis or whomever it is,\" he said. \n Pahlavi said he had yet to meet with the Trump administration despite his letters. Another Iranian exile group, the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, previously paid a member of Trump's Cabinet $50,000 for giving a speech . However, the MEK's siding with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and its killing of Americans before the revolution, which the group now denies, makes it an unsuitable partner, Pahlavi said. \n \"It's pretty much a cult-type structure,\" he said. \n For now, Pahlavi said he looks forward to meeting with Trump and his administration. But he pins his hopes on Iran's sense of history, something Cooper also acknowledged. \n \"For many Iranians, the revolution is unfinished business,\" the author said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Iran's long-exiled prince wants a revolution in age of Trump"}

{"date": "April 8, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / March 21 \n The Senate confirmed Neil Gorsuch to become the newest associate justice on the Supreme Court Friday. \n WASHINGTON >> Somewhere between the Republican caricature of the next justice of the Supreme Court as a folksy family guy and the Democrats' demonization of him as a cold-hearted automaton, stands Neil Gorsuch. \n Largely unknown six months ago, Gorsuch has seen his life story, personality and professional career explored in excruciating detail since he was nominated by President Donald Trump 10 weeks ago. \n The portrait that emerges is more nuanced than the extremes drawn by his supporters and critics. \n Gorsuch is widely regarded as a warm and collegial family man, boss and jurist, loyal to his employees and kind to those of differing viewpoints. He also has been shown to be a judge who takes such a \"rigidly neutral\" approach to the law that it can lead to dispassionate rulings with sometimes brutal results. \n Four times during his confirmation hearings, Gorsuch invoked a \"breakfast table\" analogy, telling senators that good judges set aside what they have to eat \u2014 and their personal views \u2014 before they leave the house in the morning to apply the law and nothing else to the facts of the cases at hand. It was all part of Gorsuch's artful effort to reveal as little as possible of his own opinions. \n \"We're all human beings,\" Gorsuch told senators, \"but the judge's job is to put that stuff aside and approach the law as you find it.\" \n That ability to compartmentalize, combined with Gorsuch's studious refusal to signal his thinking on contentious issues, left Democrats frustrated. For all his many visits with senators and his hours in the witness seat, Gorsuch had not revealed his core beliefs and may have, according to Democrats, a bias favoring powerful interests over ordinary people. \n Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, spoke for many in her party when, nearing the end of two days of testimony, she told Gorsuch: \"It remains to be seen whether you will be a justice for all or a justice for some.\" \n The question for Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., was \"whether there's a beating heart and an independent streak\" behind Gorsuch's silver hair and smooth delivery. \n Republicans saw Gorsuch's disciplined and detached approach as evidence of the fair and independent mindset that the U.S. needs on its highest court. \n Preparing to take the oath of office Monday after a rancorous 54-45 vote in the Senate, Gorsuch soon will largely recede into the cloistered halls of the Supreme Court. He won't vanish entirely; other justices have written books, done speaking tours and interviews. \n But Gorsuch won't again face this kind of grilling, into everything from his views on abortion to the avid outdoorsman's favorite fishing holes. (He largely pleaded the Fifth on both.) \n The 49-year-old judge was happy to reminisce about his years as a student and lawyer before becoming a federal appellate judge in Denver 10 years ago. He relied on self-deprecating humor and a goodness-gosh-golly demeanor in outsize doses as he deflected the questions he didn't want to answer. \n \"I might be a little corny,\" he said at one point to the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n \"Oh, now we're talking,\" Gorsuch enthused when the talk turned to fly fishing. \"You can't focus on the worries of the world when you're only worried about a trout.\" \n Gorsuch's impressive scholarly and legal credentials were on full display: Columbia, Harvard and Oxford, the latter with scenes that Gorsuch recalled were straight out of a Harry Potter movie. \n But Gorsuch, known for the clarity of his legal writings, traced the roots of his success back to an even earlier source, Sister Mary Rose Margaret, the nun of whom he says: \"She taught me how to read and she taught me how to diagram a sentence.\" \n Gorsuch, whose mother was a state legislator and then director of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan, tried to play down the political elements in his background. Gorsuch stressed that when issues such as torture arose during his time in President George W. Bush's Justice Department, he acted not as a policymaker but as a \"speechwriter\" or \"a lawyer for a client.\" \n He did acknowledge, though, that an email he sent criticizing lawyers at big firms for representing detainees being held by the U.S. military at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba was \"not my finest hour.\" \n Perhaps no ruling got more attention over the past 10 weeks than a case in which Gorsuch came down against a truck driver who was fired for leaving his trailer of meat on the side of an Illinois road after breaking down on a frigid night in 2009 and fearing he would freeze to death. Asked whether the man's firing wasn't absurd, Gorsuch said simply: \"My heart goes out to him. It's just not my job.\" \n For all that he shared, Gorsuch did his best not to telegraph where he might land on a range of topics that he could confront early in his time as a justice, even though both sides think they have a pretty good idea how he would rule. \n Cases about voting rights, gun control, religious rights, housing discrimination and immigration are pending before the court. The dispute over Trump's proposed ban on visitors from six majority Muslim countries could be on the way as well. \n Gorsuch was careful not to offer any hints on these issues in his exchanges with committee Democrats and Republicans. \n Questioned about his views on the Roe v. Wade decision that established a woman's right to have an abortion, Gorsuch would go no further than to voice his respect for legal precedent and say \"no one is looking to return us to horse and buggy days.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Joining high court, the real Neil Gorsuch set to stand up"}

{"date": "April 8, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Demonstrators threw stones towards Venezuelan Bolivarian National Police officers during a protest in Caracas, Venezuela. \n CARACAS, Venezuela >> Venezuela's government fired tear gas and rubber bullets at some of the thousands of opponents of President Nicolas Maduro who poured into the streets of Caracas today amid a weeklong protest movement that shows little sign of losing steam. \n The demonstrations in the capital and several other cities came a day after Maduro's government barred top opposition leader Henrique Capriles from running for office for 15 years. \n The ban capped a tumultuous 10 day-crackdown that saw pro-government groups rough up several opposition leaders and another seek refuge in a foreign embassy to escape arrest. \n The protests were triggered by the Supreme Court's decision to gut the opposition-controlled legislature of its last vestiges of power, a move that was later reversed amid widespread international condemnation and even dissent within Maduro's normally disciplined socialist leadership. \n \"Nobody can disqualify the Venezuelan people,\" an emotional Capriles said from a stage today as he called on protesters to march to the ombudsman's office downtown. \n As the sea of protesters approached the headquarters of state-run PDVSA oil company, they were met by rubber bullets and a curtain of eye-scorching tear gas, some of it a never-before-seen red color. Mayhem ensued, with riot police racing down windy streets, dodging objects thrown from tall apartment buildings as they deployed to squash the unrest. \n Later, a small group of youths unsuccessfully tried to set fire to a Supreme Court office building. \n The violence was condemned by the opposition leadership, who nonetheless blame Maduro's obstinacy for fueling the unrest. \n They called for another protest Monday. But with Caracas shutting down for the Easter holiday \u2014 which Maduro extended by decree for three extra days \u2014 they appeared to be saving their strength for a major demonstration called for April 19. \n At least 17 people were treated for injuries, according to Ramon Muchacho, a Caracas-area mayor where the demonstration took place. \n Around most of Caracas, checkpoints were set up to search cars and frisk bus passengers even miles away from the clashes. As night fell, many streets still reeked of tear gas and a small group of youth burned trash and tore down street signs at busy intersections in eastern Caracas. \n As the most dominant figure in the opposition over the past decade, Capriles has been at the forefront of the protests, the most combative since a wave of anti-government unrest in 2014 in which dozens of people were killed, many at the hands of security forces. \n The almost-daily churn of events in what the opposition calls an \"ongoing coup\" by the government has energized and united the normally fractious opposition. \n While opposition leaders have insisted on peaceful protest, frustration built up over 17 years of polarizing socialist rule in Venezuela is running high on both sides. \n As today's march began, protesters snatched a camera from crew members working for pro-government state broadcaster VTV, chasing them away from the crowd with kicks and insults. Police, meanwhile, made social media posts of mugshots of protesters taken undercover and asked for information on the unidentified \"generators of violence.\" \n Leaders in the ruling socialist party have accused the opposition of trying to provoke a bloodbath and its own coup. \n The protesters today included 26-year-old Victoria Paez, who sported a baseball cap bearing the slogan \"There's a Way!\" from Capriles' 2012 presidential run against the late Hugo Chavez. \n \"Every day, the government gives us more reasons to leave our homes and protest,\" said Paez, who earns less than $20 a month as a chemical engineer. She said she's thinking about joining a sister and scores of college friends who have left the South American country seeking a better future. \n While she said she was hopeful the world is beginning to see there are injustices in Venezuela, her father, Carlos Paez, was more pessimistic. \n \"Unfortunately, if there has to be bloodshed for the government to change, it won't be the first time in history,\" he said. \n The protest movement's immediate goal apparently is to force Maduro to call elections. Authorities last year cancelled an opposition campaign to hold a recall referendum on Maduro and no date has yet been set for gubernatorial elections that were supposed to take place last year. \n The government earlier jailed another major opposition figure, hardliner Leopoldo Lopez. With both seemingly out of the running, the government may be trying to manipulate the electoral playing field to leave the opposition with less viable options should the government bow to pressure and call elections before they're scheduled in 2018, analysts said. \n \"However, it is a risky strategy that will probably backfire,\" Eurasia Group said in a report Friday. \"The opposition is clearly fired up and this will further their cause.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Venezuelans pour into streets in anti-Maduro protest"}

{"date": "April 8, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A man placed a candle at a fence near the Ahlens department store today. \n STOCKHOLM >> One brutal attack by a man who drove a stolen truck into shoppers in Stockholm has brought Sweden's open-door immigration policies under increased scrutiny \u2014 and raised the question if Swedish society, considered democratic and egalitarian, has failed to integrate its newcomers. \n The suspect in Friday's attack, a 39-year-old native of Uzbekistan who has been arrested by police, had been on authorities' radar previously but they dismissed him as a \"marginal character.\" It was unclear whether he was also a Swedish citizen or resident or even how long he'd been in the country. \n The attack killed four people and wounded 15. In response, hundreds gathered today at the site of the crash in the Swedish capital, building a heartbreaking wall of flowers on the aluminum fence put up to keep them away from the site's broken glass and twisted metal. Some hugged police officers nearby. \n \"We have been too liberal to take in people who perhaps we thought would have good minds. But we are too good-hearted,\" said Stockholm resident Ulov Ekdahl, a 67-year-old commercial broker who went to the memorial. \n Joachim Kemiri, who was born in Sweden to a Tunisian father and a Swedish mother, says migrants and refugees had been arriving in too large numbers. \n \"Too many of them have been coming in too fast,\" the 29-year-old railway worker said. \"It's too much.\" \n Sweden has long been known for its open-door policy toward migrants and refugees. But after the Scandinavian country of 10 million took in a record 163,000 refugees in 2015 \u2014 the highest per-capita rate in Europe \u2014 Prime Minister Stefan Lofven conceded it could no longer cope with the influx. \n At a press conference in late 2015, deputy prime minister of the small Greens Party \u2014 a junior government partner \u2014 Asa Romson, broke into tears as she announced measures to deter asylum-seekers in a reversal of Sweden's welcoming policy toward people fleeing war and persecution. She described it as \"a terrible decision,\" admitting the proposals would make life even more precarious for refugees. \n Today, Lofven laid flowers at the truck crash site, declaring Monday a national day of mourning, with a minute of silence at noon. He urged citizens to \"get through this\" and strolled through the streets of the capital to chat with them. \n No one has claimed responsibility for Friday's attack but Sweden's police chief said Saturday that authorities were confident they had detained the man who carried it out. \n Uzbekistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics have long been a fertile recruiting ground for Islamic militant groups, notably the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which formed in 1998. Originally allied with al-Qaeda, many of the group's fighters have switched to Islamic State group affiliation. \n Russian officials say the suicide bomber who attacked the St. Petersburg subway on April 3 was a native of Kyrgyzstan. \n Sweden's police chief Dan Eliason said officers found something in the stolen beer truck that \"could be a bomb\" or an incendiary device, but said they were still investigating. \n Although it was not clear how long the suspect had been in Sweden, the Scandinavian country prides itself on welcoming newcomers. Still, its open-door immigration policy and comparatively heterogeneous culture has led to frictions, sometimes urban unrest, especially in areas where many long-time immigrants feel disempowered. \n The populist, right-wing Sweden Democrats have tapped into a growing anti-immigrant sentiment. Mattias Karlsson, the party's parliamentary group leader, said Saturday that he feels \"anger and sorrow but not shock\" over Friday's attack. \n \"Unfortunately, there have been clear signs that it was just a question of time before the next attack would hit Sweden,\" he said. \"It will have far-reaching implications for society and politics.\" \n Steve Eklund, an office worker a few blocks away from where the accident occurred, said Sweden's immigration policy had gone wrong. \n \"Sweden has made some mistakes, and something needs to be done to assimilate the immigrants better,\" Eklund said. \"But it takes two to tango \u2014 the immigrants living here need to reach out to ethnic Swedes too.\" \n Not everyone agreed.

He was killed by police. \n The IS also claimed responsibility for a truck attack that killed 86 people in Nice, France, in July 2016 during a Bastille Day festival, as well as another truck attack that killed 12 people at a Christmas market last year in Berlin. \n Friday's truck attack on Stockholm's pedestrian shopping street of Drottninggatan was also near the site of a December 2010 attack in which Taimour Abdulwahab, a Swedish citizen, detonated a suicide bomb, killing himself and injuring two others. \n The prime minister made a point today of walking around Stockholm, including along Drottninggatan, chatting with people having coffee outside a cafe. He said the aim of terrorism is to undermine democracy. \n \"But such a goal will never be achieved in Sweden,\" Lofven said. \n Others feared the deadly attacks could continue. \n \"Things like this will always happen in an open society.

{"date": "April 8, 2017", "text": "NORTH DAKOTA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE VIA AP \n Industrial hemp growing in a field in North Dakota's LaMoure County. \n BISMARCK, N.D. >> Real-world research in more than a dozen states in recent years is giving farmers new understanding of how to grow industrial hemp and showing that it has promise to be a viable commercial crop in the U.S. \n The 2014 federal farm bill allowed for university and state-sponsored research programs of the plant whose fiber can be used in products from paper to clothing and whose oil can be an ingredient in food and health products. Programs have now been launched in 15 states, with two more states coming online, according to the hemp advocacy nonprofit Vote Hemp. \n \"These last several years, those (programs) have been a big first step,\" Hemp Industries Association Executive Director Colleen Keahey said. \"It's just really important that we get the government agencies \u2026 all working to have a definition for industrial hemp that is equal to that definition in the farm bill.\" \n Federal drug law doesn't distinguish between hemp and its cannabis cousin, marijuana, even though hemp doesn't contain enough THC to get a person high. A bill in Congress that would have changed that failed to get a vote last year, but advocates will try again this year, Keahey said. Her association also is fighting DEA hemp restrictions in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in 2004 that the federal government can't regulate hemp food products as controlled substances. \n As those battles continue, farmers are learning more about the plant and what it takes to grow it profitably. Other states with hemp research programs are Colorado, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia, according to Vote Hemp. Pennsylvania and North Carolina are developing programs. \n North Dakota farmer and crop consultant Clarence Laub, who is taking part in the state's hemp research program for a second year, said the biggest thing he learned last year was the most effective way to seed hemp. \n \"We'll never be done researching, but as far as getting a baseline, based off last year I think it grows very well in the state,\" said Laub, who has launched a side business selling hemp oil for food and skin care and hemp protein powder as a health food. \"It's very exciting. There's a lot of opportunity in the state for different businesses to arise out of this.\" \n The first year of North Dakota's program provided valuable information on hemp varieties, growing conditions, planting dates and planting costs, according to state Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring. \n \"This is really building a strong case,\" he said. \"Right now, it kind of looks like we could support hemp production across the state.\" \n Hemp profits ranged from about $500 per acre to more than $850 per acre, when many commercial commodities were providing zero returns. \n \"When net revenues came in, it caught a lot of attention,\" Goehring said. \n The program, for which participating producers pay all the costs, has grown from three producers and 70 acres last year to 35 producers and 3,064 acres this year. The research program in Kentucky, where hemp once flourished before the federal government outlawed its production in the 1930s, has seen similar growth, going from 33 acres in 2014 to 12,800 acres this year. \n \"There are a lot of farmers that have decreased revenue right now \u2014 all farm commodities are down \u2014 they're looking for options,\" said Doris Hamilton, who manages the program for the Kentucky Department of Agriculture. \"There's also a new segment (of producers) interested in it for the novelty.\" \n Despite the rich history of hemp production in Kentucky, much research needs to be done, as crop genetics and farm equipment have changed. However, \"we know there are varieties that will work well here,\" Hamilton said. \n The research there is yielding information on everything from varieties to fertilizer rates to soil types, though there remain many unknowns and obstacles. There are no approved pesticides or herbicides for hemp, making weeds a big problem, and the economics of the crop will change in the future as more acres are grown affecting supply and demand, according to Hamilton. \n \"We have a lot of challenges to overcome, but we have made great strides,\" she said. \n Should the research remain promising and the regulation issues be resolved, \"we could be growing mass quantities of industrial hemp in the United States and be able to add that to the supply chain for those who are buying hemp already from other countries,\" Keahey said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "On-the-farm research making the case for industrial hemp"}

{"date": "April 8, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n An image captured on April 7 of the northwest side of the Shayrat air base in Syria, following U.S. Tomahawk Land Attack Missile strikes on Friday, April 7, 2017 from the USS Ross and USS Porter. The United States blasted the air base with a barrage of cruise missiles on Friday, April 7, 2017 in fiery retaliation for this week's gruesome chemical weapons attack against civilians. \n PALM BEACH, Fla. >> The United States is vowing to keep up the pressure on Syria after the intense nighttime wave of missile strikes from U.S. ships, despite the prospect of escalating Russian ill will that could further inflame one of the world's most vexing conflicts. \n Standing firm, the Trump administration on Friday signaled new sanctions would soon follow the missile attack, and the Pentagon was even probing whether Russia itself was involved in the chemical weapons assault that compelled President Donald Trump to action. The attack against a Syrian air base was the first U.S. assault against the government of President Bashar Assad. \n Much of the international community rallied behind Trump's decision to fire the cruise missiles in reaction to this week's chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of men, women and children in Syria. But a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the strikes dealt \"a significant blow\" to relations between Moscow and Washington. \n A key test of whether the relationship can be salvaged comes next week when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson becomes the first Trump Cabinet member to visit Russia. \n Tillerson said he sees no reason for retaliation from Russia for the U.S. missile strikes. Russia maintains a close political and military alliance with the Assad government and has been implicated in many of the attacks against Syrians opposed to Assad's rule, though Moscow adamantly denies such claims. \n In an interview to air Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Tillerson said Russians were not targeted by the strikes. He also said the top U.S. priority in the region hasn't changed and remained the defeat of Islamic State militants. \n British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson also had planned to visit Russia this coming week, but decided Saturday to cancel the trip because of the fast moving events in Syria. Johnson, who condemned Moscow's continued defense of Assad, said Tillerson will be able to give a \"clear and coordinated message to the Russians.\" \n At the United Nations on Friday, Russia's deputy ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, strongly criticized what he called the U.S. \"flagrant violation of international law and an act of aggression\" whose \"consequences for regional and international security could be extremely serious.\" He called the Assad government a main force against terrorism and said it deserved the presumption of innocence in the chemical weapons attack. \n The U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, said the world is waiting for the Russian government \"to act responsibly in Syria\" and \"to reconsider its misplaced alliance with Bashar Assad.\" \n Trump spoke by telephone Friday with Saudi Arabia's King Salman, who reaffirmed strong support for the military strike and thanked the U.S. president for his \"courageous\" action, according to statements issued Saturday by the White House and the official Saudi Press Agency. \n Saudi Arabia, one of the most vehement opponents of Assad, said the missile barrage was the right response to \"the crimes of this regime to its people in light of the failure of the international community to stop it.\" \n The Turkish foreign minister, whose country is a strong backer of the Syrian opposition, said the U.S. missile strikes were not enough. Mevlut Cavusoglu said Saturday that the U.S. intervention was only \"cosmetic\" unless it removes Assad from power. He said the most ideal process would be a political solution that leads to a transitional government. \n In Florida with the president, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said additional economic sanctions on Syria were being prepared. \n Thursday night's strikes \u2014 some 60 cruise missiles fired from two ships in the Mediterranean \u2014 were the culmination of a rapid, three-day transformation for Trump, who has long opposed deeper U.S. involvement in Syria's civil war. Advisers said he was outraged by heartbreaking images of young children who were among the dozens killed in the chemical attack. \n The decision undercut another campaign promise for Trump: his pledge to try to warm relations with Moscow. After months of allegations of ties between his election campaign and the Kremlin \u2014 the subject of current congressional and FBI investigations \u2014 Trump has found himself clashing with Putin. \n On Friday, senior U.S. military officials were looking more closely at possible Russian involvement in the poison attack. Officials said a drone belonging to either Russia or Syria was seen hovering over the site after the assault earlier this week. The drone returned late in the day as citizens were going to a nearby hospital for treatment. Shortly afterward, officials say the hospital was targeted. \n The officials, who insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the sensitive matter, said they believe the hospital attack may have been an effort to cover up evidence of the earlier assault. \n White House officials caution that Trump is not preparing to plunge the U.S. deeper into Syria. Spokesman Sean Spicer said the missile attack sent a clear message to Assad, but he avoided explicitly calling for the Syrian to leave office. \n In a letter to Congress on Saturday, Trump said he \"acted in the vital national security and foreign policy interests of the United States, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations\" and as commander in chief and chief executive. \n He said the U.S. \"will take additional action, as necessary and appropriate, to further its important national interests.\" \n Trump, who is spending the weekend at his Florida resort, tweeted a brief explanation Saturday of why the military didn't strike the runways in its bombardment of the Syrian air field, writing, \"they are easy and inexpensive to quickly fix (fill in and top)!\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. vows to keep up pressure on Syria after missile strikes"}

Robert Bentley will face impeachment hearings beginning Monday after the state Supreme Court gave lawmakers the greenlight to move ahead with an effort to oust the governor, who is fighting to stay in office amid fallout from an affair with a top aide. \n The Alabama Supreme Court on Saturday reversed a short-lived victory for Bentley when a judge on Friday blocked impeachment proceedings. After the high court's ruling, the House Judiciary Committee quickly announced plans to proceed with hearings on Monday. \n Bentley, a 74-year-old dermatologist and former Baptist deacon, has been engulfed in a sex scandal since recordings surfaced in 2016 of him making suggestive remarks to a female aide before he and his wife of 50 years got divorced. \n Bentley has vowed to stay in office despite growing calls for his resignation. He stood on the marble steps of the state Capitol on Friday and somberly acknowledged making personal mistakes but maintained he did nothing to merit his removal from office. \n \"I do not plan to resign. I have done nothing illegal. If the people want to know if I misused state resources, the answer is simply no. I have not,\" Bentley said. He criticized unnamed people he said were delighting in exposing the embarrassing details of his personal life. \n The governor's legal team has argued that the proposed hearings are fundamentally unfair and do not give the governor the adequate opportunity to respond to accusations. The Supreme Court justices asked for briefs on the matter to be filed by Monday. \n \"It's disappointing to hear the committee will plow forward while the Supreme Court is considering the case. We have no idea what the committee has planned for Monday or who its witnesses will be,\" Bentley lawyer Ross Garber said. \n Special Counsel Jack Sharman said the committee's position was that it is free to proceed with the hearings. \n The development was the latest in a wild week in Alabama politics as the Republican governor battled the Republican-controlled Alabama Legislature over his possible impeachment. The Alabama Ethics Commission on Wednesday found probable cause that Bentley broke ethics and campaign law and referred the matter for possible prosecution. \n Sharman on publicly released his report to the House Judiciary Committee on Friday. The report made similar accusations and said the aide, Rebekah Caldwell Mason, wielded great influence over Bentley. Sharman wrote that Bentley encouraged an \"an atmosphere of intimidation\" in his administration to keep his romantic relationship secret and sent two state law enforcement officers to try to track down and retrieve a recording of a sexually-charged phone call he made to a woman presumed to be Mason. \n \"Gov. Bentley directed law enforcement to advance his personal interests and, in a process characterized by increasing obsession and paranoia, subjected career law enforcement officers to tasks intended to protect his reputation,\" the report said. \n The recording was made by his then-wife, Dianne Bentley, who left her iPhone recording as she went for a walk on the beach in 2014. Dianne Bentley's chief of staff told Sharman that Bentley threatened her because he believed she had something to do with the recording. \n The report also included text messages Dianne Bentley gave the committee. She was able to read text messages that her husband sent to Mason because they also appeared on his state-issued iPad, which she had possession of. \n \"I'm so in love with you.

Survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March in the Philippines are marking the anniversary in San Francisco with speeches and a 21-gun battery salute for the thousands who died during the march. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> Ramon Regalado was starving and sick with malaria when he slipped away from his Japanese captors during the infamous 1942 Bataan Death March in the Philippines, escaping a brutal trudge through steamy jungle that killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of Filipinos who fought for the U.S. during World War II. \n On Saturday, the former wartime machine-gun operator joined a dwindling band of veterans of the war in San Francisco's Presidio to honor the soldiers who died on the march and those who made it to a prisoner of war camp only to die there. \n They commemorated the mostly Filipino soldiers who held off Japanese forces in the Philippines for three months without supplies of food or ammunition before a U.S. army major surrendered 75,000 troops to Japan on April 9, 1942. \n Few Americans are aware of the Filipinos who were starving as they relentlessly fended off the more powerful and well-supplied Japanese forces, said Cecilia Gaerlan, executive director of the Berkeley, California-based Bataan Legacy Historical Society organizing the event at the former military fort. \n \"Despite fighting without any air support and without any reinforcement, they disrupted the timetable of the Imperial Japanese army,\" she said. \"That was their major role, to perform a delaying action. And they did that beyond expectations.\" \n More than 250,000 Filipino soldiers served in World War II, when the Philippines were a U.S. territory. But after the war ended, President Harry Truman signed laws that stripped away promises of benefits and citizenship for Filipino veterans. \n Only recently have they won back some concessions and acknowledgment, including the nation's highest civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal. The veterans also received lump-sum payments as part of the 2009 stimulus law. \n An estimated 18,000 Filipino veterans of World War II are still alive and living in the U.S. \n Tens of thousands of Filipino and U.S. troops were forced on the 65-mile (105-kilometer) march and Gaerlan said as many as 650 Americans and 10,000 Filipinos died in stifling heat and at the hands of Japanese soldiers who shot, bayoneted or beat soldiers who fell or stopped for water. \n More than 80 percent of those forced on the march were Filipino. \n After they arrived at a prison camp set up at Camp O'Donnell, she said, an additional 1,600 Americans and 20,000 Filipinos died from dysentery, starvation and disease. \n Gaerlan grew up knowing that her father, Luis Gaerlan, Jr., had been in a wartime march in which a lot of people had died. But he rarely spoke about it or he would re-enact it with rat-a-tat-tat sound effects for the guns that made her laugh. \n She started researching the march in 2011 and tried to elicit more details from her father. He broke down crying telling her that some men were so desperate that they killed themselves. Others wrote goodbye letters to their relatives during the march. \n \"And he said he was starting to write his farewell letter, because a lot of men did that, and I asked him, 'Well, were you going to take your own life?\" she said. \"And he didn't answer.\" \n Gaerlan's father died in 2014 at age 94. \n She successfully lobbied California last year to mandate teaching details of the battle and march in high schools. \n She also collects march veterans' stories before they die, including the memories of 99-year-old Regalado, who lives in the San Francisco suburb of El Cerrito. \n When the war broke out, Regalado was a member of the Philippine Scouts, a military branch of the U.S. Army for Filipino soldiers. \n He and two other soldiers were assigned to feed horses during the march and slipped away when guards were not watching them, Regalado said. \n A farmer took in the three, even though the penalty for doing so was death. All were sick with malaria. Only Regalado survived. \n He went on to join a guerrilla resistance movement against the Japanese and moved in 1950 to the San Francisco Bay Area to work for the U.S. military. \n Regalado credits his survival and long life to his high morale. \n While being cared for by the farmer, he recalls telling himself: \"I'm not going to die.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Filipino Bataan Death March survivors mark 75th anniversary"}

Commemoration ceremonies will take place on Sunday at the memorial to honor Canadian soldiers who were killed or wounded during the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April 1917. \n VIMY, France >> An ocean away from home, spilling their blood on a remote ridge in the muddied battlefields of northern France a century ago, many would argue that Canadians earned the right to become a nation here. \n Vimy Ridge has become much more than a speck on a French map, even much more than a famous World War I battle. In a fledgling nation looking for a sense of self, trying to set it apart from British rule, the battle provided everything it needed \u2014 the vision of an underdog beating the odds, a show of courage, resolve and unity. \n \"It made the Canadian Corps think it could do anything. It made the soldiers believe that they were really good soldiers, better than anybody else. They had done something that the British and French were not able to do,\" said Professor Jack Granatstein, a Canadian military historian. \n On Sunday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau plans to visit the fertile countryside of France, where any hill with a view was fought over with a blind determination costing thousands of lives in World War I. He will be joined by other dignitaries, including Princes Charles, William and Harry. \n British and French forces had tried for a long time but failed to take Vimy Ridge. The Canadians succeeded on April 9, 1917, battling through snow and sleet to push out the Germans, who had long held the strategic post. \n The Canadians came and succeeded, yet at the price of 3,600 dead and over 7,000 injured. \n In the grand scheme of the war, it amounted to little. \n \"It did not win the war. It did not change the course of the war. It moved the Germans back several kilometers, but that was it,\" Granatstein said. \n For Canada though, it meant everything. \n \"In one day \u2014 in fact in one morning \u2014 these civilian volunteers from a small country with no military tradition were expected to do what the British and French had failed to do in two years,\" Pierre Berton wrote in his 1985 book, \"Vimy.\" \n It would take more than a year to finally budge the front line and start pushing the Germans back. The Canadians, ever more emboldened after Vimy, played their part and even were among the signatories to the Versailles Treaty. \n Among the string of war monuments reaching from the North Sea to Switzerland, Vimy stands out as perhaps the finest. \n With its surging pale columns reaching skyward, it stirs the soul. Yet statues of the Weeping Woman and two mourners, and the list of 11,285 soldiers posted \"missing, presumed dead,\" makes it a solemn pilgrimage site. \n The Vimy memorial, a revered national symbol, is on the back of Canada's $20 bill to this day. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trudeau to mark 100 years of Vimy battle that defined Canada"}

{"date": "April 8, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., talks to reporters before the vote to confirm President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, on Capitol Hill in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Neil Gorsuch's ascension to the Supreme Court was vindication for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, whose risky bet more than a year ago paid off big time for President Donald Trump and the Kentucky senator himself. \n When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, McConnell decided immediately that the Senate would not fill the seat until the next president was elected. McConnell never wavered. He ignored Democratic griping, misgivings from fellow Republicans, and ultimately erroneous predictions that GOP Senate candidates would pay a political price. \n Now McConnell can take credit for allowing Trump to put a young conservative on the court for life, even though it took changing Senate rules to do it. \n \"No. 1, it's courageous. No. 2, it's genius, in that order, because he knew how much criticism he would get,\" said Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. \n Democrats and some Republicans predicted dire fallout from McConnell's divisive Senate rules change that removed the 60-vote filibuster barrier for Supreme Court picks, and they warned of a more polarized Senate and court over time. But most in the GOP were full of praise for their wily leader. \n \"Mitch did what he thought was the right thing at the time, and I think the American people agreed with it, as was evidenced by the outcome of the election,\" said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. \"And now we have a great justice on the Supreme Court.\" \n Frustrated Democrats grudgingly acknowledged that McConnell got what he wanted and delivered for his party, even as they insisted that the damage done to the Senate in the process would not quickly be forgotten. \n The next time Democrats control the White House and the Senate, they could be the ones to benefit from the rules change enacted under McConnell. That's because the change will apply to all future Supreme Court nominees, too, eliminating any need for input from the minority party in making confirmations to the high court. \n \"The Republicans engaged in historic obstructionism that made it possible for this confirmation process to be conducted,\" said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass. \"We now have a radical right-wing justice on the Supreme Court. And I think that was their goal all along. So it is successful.\" \n Some Republicans say the vacancy was an important factor in Trump's victory in November because the prospect of putting a conservative on the court helped evangelicals and other voters overcome their misgivings about Trump. In exit polls 21 percent of voters called Supreme Court appointments \"the most important factor\" in their vote, and among those people 56 percent voted for Trump. \n McConnell told reporters Friday that \"the most consequential decision I've ever been involved in was the decision to let the president being elected last year pick the Supreme Court nominee.\" \n It was a gamble. McConnell said after the election that he didn't think Trump had a chance of winning or Republicans of holding their Senate majority. \n McConnell and other senators also expressed the hope that after the bitter fight over Gorsuch, the Senate can get back on a more bipartisan course. That will be necessary to pass spending bills to keep the lights on in government by an April 28 midnight deadline. \n McConnell pledged to preserve the 60-vote filibuster threshold on regular legislation, as opposed to nominations, which will continue to act as a tool forcing bipartisan outcomes and ensuring participation from the minority party. \n As for Gorsuch, 49, he will be sworn in Monday and jump into cases of consequence, including one involving separation of church and state that the justices will take up in less than two weeks. Gorsuch is a veteran of Denver's 10th U.S. Circuit of Appeals with a history of conservative rulings that make him an intellectual heir to Scalia. \n \"As a deep believer in the rule of law, Judge Gorsuch will serve the American people with distinction,\" Trump said in a statement. \n The judge won support Friday from 51 of the chamber's Republicans as well as three moderate Democrats up for re-election in states Trump won last fall: Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia, who has been recovering from back surgery, did not vote. \n Gorsuch is expected to join a conservative-leaning voting bloc of justices, making five on the nine-member court. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Gorsuch's ascension to high court vindicates McConnell plan"}

Jon Heighten's parents are helping lead a 29-acre housing development and community for autistic adults that will break ground in the coming months. \n DALLAS >> Masha Gregory was nervous to move out of her parents' home and into her own place, where the 26-year-old Pennsylvania woman worried about making friends and being away from her parents. But after living in her own apartment at a complex that focuses on adults with autism, she's made new friends and found she loves her independence. \n \"It was great to move out because I have my own life now,\" said Gregory, who lives in a Pittsburgh-area development where half of the 42 units are for those diagnosed with autism. \"I want to be able to come and go as I please,\" said Gregory, who likes to draw and take photographs. \n The complex, called the Dave Wright Apartments, opened in December and is among innovative housing developments popping up across the U.S. to serve those who were diagnosed with autism as children amid increased awareness about the disorder and changes in how it's defined. The developments are often spearheaded by parents who see their adult children's desire for independence and wonder who will care for them in the future. \n According to the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute, 87 percent of adults with autism live with their parents at some point between high school and their early 20s \u2014 a far higher percentage than the general population. \n \"They want to live independently and they want to work. They want to be involved. Right now there are just not enough opportunities for them to do those things,\" said Debra Caudy, who is working with her husband on a housing development near Dallas inspired by their 19-year-old autistic son, Jon. \n Gregory's mother, Connie, said her daughter is \"thriving\" in her new home. \n \"I think she realizes that she fits in,\" Gregory said. \"I don't know that she would feel as secure anywhere else.\" \n Masha Gregory describes herself as having a \"little bit of autism,\" along with auditory processing disorder, meaning her ears and brain don't function well together. \n Autism impairs one's ability to communicate and interact with others, but there can be a wide range to the symptoms and severity of the disorder. Symptoms could include not speaking, repeating certain behaviors and not wanting change in daily activities. Some people with autism have signs of lower than normal intelligence, but others have normal to high intelligence. \n The new crop of developments to accommodate autistic adults is varied. Some are in big cities, others in small towns. Some are like the complex where Gregory has an apartment to herself. Others have homes with shared living areas and private bedrooms and bathrooms. Some just have a person on staff who can offer guidance to residents, while others offer an array of supportive services. \n \"What works for one person doesn't necessarily work for the other,\" said Carolyn Klebanoff, a co-founder of Sweetwater Spectrum, a development featuring four shared homes in Sonoma, California. \"Having a whole variety of options out there is critical.\" \n Sweetwater, which opened in 2013, is within walking distance of the town square. It has a community center, farm, greenhouse and pool. The homes have noise-dampening ceilings and quiet heating and air conditioning systems for residents who are hypersensitive to loud sounds. Residents include those like Klebanoff's 23-year-old daughter who aren't conversational, as well people with high-functioning autism. \n \"It's more like just a place to live,\" said 24-year-old Sweetwater resident Gwen Fisher, while adding that she appreciates its focus on people with autism. \n Fisher said she participates in activities offered at Sweetwater but also gets out into the community, including working as a dog walker and volunteering at a food bank and animal shelter. \n Desiree Kameka, director of community engagement and the housing network at Madison House Autism Foundation in Maryland, said such developments can provide more freedom than group homes, where housing is typically tied to a specific provider of support services. \n \"It gives the people that live there the most flexibility and control,\" she said, adding that sometimes group home residents end up being required to all do the same outside activities. \n Many people with autism don't qualify for government services once they leave school, she noted, and these developments may help bridge the gap, providing enough support that they can live on their own. \n \"Some of these communities could give people opportunities that they otherwise wouldn't have: They'd be forced to live with family,\" she said. \n Elliot Frank, president of the nonprofit Autism Housing Development Corporation of Pittsburgh, which was behind the Dave Wright Apartments where Masha Gregory lives, has watched as a community has formed there. Frank said he came up with the concept after hearing a businessman talk about employing autistic adults and wondering where they would live. \n \"The whole concept of what we call disability housing, it's not what we used to think about,\" Frank said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Housing options help autistic adults find independence"}

{"date": "April 8, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Then-National Security Council Spokesman Tommy Vietor walks along the West Wing Colonnade at the White House in Washington. Former Obama administration officials are pushing back against criticism against the former president, saying they proposed similar airstrikes to the ones President Donald Trump ordered this week, but were stymied by a Republican-controlled Congress reluctant to go along with then-President Barack Obama's plan to strike in Syria. \n WASHINGTON >> Former Obama administration officials are pushing back against criticism of the former president, saying they proposed similar airstrikes in Syria to the ones President Donald Trump ordered this week, but were stymied by a Republican-controlled Congress reluctant to go along with the Democratic president's plan. \n This comes after Trump ordered the missile strikes against Syria without getting congressional approval, determined to punish the Syrian government for the use of chemical weapons against civilians. \n Trump laid part of the blame for the chemical attack on former President Barack Obama, saying the deaths were a \"consequence of the past administration's weakness and irresolution.\" \n Republicans, however, who controlled Congress then as they do now, were adamant that Obama should not act without their approval, Obama aides said. Trump also had called for Obama to get congressional approval before any attack on Syria. \n \"Once you put it in Congress's hand, it became clear at that time that they were not ready to assume responsibility,\" said Dennis Ross, a former Obama administration adviser on the Middle East. \"But the problem wasn't that Congress wasn't seen as lacking in responsibility, it was that the president was seen as having drawn a 'red line' and when it came time to act on it, he didn't and that had an impact on the way the U.S. was seen in the aftermath.\" \n Obama aides took to Twitter and the airwaves this week to point out what they called the hypocrisy from Republicans and from Trump himself. \n \"Times change. In 13, Speaker asks Obama how: 'justification comports with exclusive authority of Cong authorization'\" tweeted Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser under Obama. \n Tommy Vietor, former spokesman for the Obama National Security Council, sent out Trump's tweet demanding Obama get congressional approval. \"What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict? Obama needs Congressional approval,\" the businessman tweeted in 2013. \n Now president, Trump ordered the missile strikes on Thursday without seeking approval from Congress. This followed Tuesday's chemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun, which killed 87 people, including 31 children. U.S. officials said they feel confident Syrian President Bashar Assad's government was responsible. \n The U.S. strikes hit the government-controlled Shayrat air base in central Syria, where U.S. officials say the Syrian military planes that dropped the chemicals had taken off. \n In a statement issued the day of the chemical weapons attack, Trump said, \"President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a 'red line' against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing.\" \n Obama had threatened Assad with military action after an earlier chemical weapons attack killed hundreds outside Damascus. Obama had declared the use of such weapons a \"red line.\" At the time, several American ships in the Mediterranean were poised to launch missiles, only for Obama to abruptly pull back after key U.S. ally Britain and the U.S. Congress balked at his plan. \n He opted instead for a Russian-backed plan that was supposed to lead to the removal and elimination of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles. \n \"We had been reckoning with this for five years and there aren't easy answers. And just to simply say, you know, 'the president put up a red line and then didn't act\" is really insufficient in terms of making policy,\" Richard Stengel, former undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \n No matter how the United States got to its first assault against the Assad government, what Trump does next is key, said Frederic C. Hof, director of the Atlantic Council's Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East. He served as special adviser for transition in Syria in the Obama administration and was the special coordinator for regional affairs in the State Department's Office of the Special Envoy for Middle East Peace. \n Assad \"may think he has the same option he took in September 2013: set the chemicals to the side and return to barrel bombs, gravity bombs, artillery shells, missiles, and mortar rounds against civilians in their homes, hospitals, marketplaces, and schools,\" Hof said in a post on the Atlantic Council's website. \"If this is what he does and if he does it unopposed the military strikes of April 6, 2017 will go down in history as a useless, empty gesture.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Obama aides push back against criticism of inaction on Syria"}

{"date": "April 8, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump speaks at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., Thursday, April 6, 2017, after the U.S. fired a barrage of cruise missiles into Syria Thursday night in retaliation for this week's gruesome chemical weapons attack against civilians. \n PALM BEACH, Fla. >> In the aftermath of President Donald Trump's surprise strikes on Syria, his allies and adversaries have searched for some broader meaning in his decision. \n Is Trump now a humanitarian interventionist, willing to wield American military power when foreign governments threaten their own citizens? Is he a commander in chief who once warned against intervention in Syria but is now prepared to plunge the United States deeper into the conflict? Is he turning on Russia, one of Syria's most important patrons, after months of flirting with closer U.S. ties with Moscow? \n Trump would say he's simply flexible, an emerging foreign policy doctrine that leaves room for evolution and uncertainty. \n \"I don't have to have one specific way, and if the world changes, I go the same way, I don't change,\" Trump said Wednesday, a day after the chemical weapons attack in Syria that compelled him to order airstrikes against a government air base. \"Well, I do change and I am flexible, and I'm proud of that flexibility.\" \n Allies in the Middle East and Europe who panned Trump's efforts to ban Syrian refugees from the United States cheered his decision to strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad's military after viewing images of young children killed in the chemical attacks. Yet they did so without any clear guidance from Washington on the next steps in Syria. \n Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said the United States was willing to take more action against Assad, while White House officials cautioned that the strikes did not signal a broader shift in U.S. policy. \n Mark Feierstein, who served in the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, said it's difficult to glean a direction for U.S. policy from Trump's actions in Syria because Trump \"is not moored to any coherent ideology or set of ideas.\" \n But for some of Trump's supporters, ideological elasticity is a virtue for a president who took office with no practical foreign policy experience. They say it gives the former real estate mogul breathing room to learn on the job and accept advice from more seasoned advisers. \n \"I think as time goes on, every day that has passed, he more and more has understood the gravity of U.S. leadership,\" said GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \n Trump ran for office as a Republican but has few ties to the party's traditionally conservative philosophy. He often has relied on his flexibility as a way to reassure Americans that some of his more unconventional and controversial proposals were merely suggestions. \n Yet on some issues, he has shown a willingness to follow through. He has ordered construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and signed executive orders banning entry to the U.S. for people from some majority Muslim countries, including Syria. Those travel orders have so far been blocked by the courts. \n The angry reaction to the Syria strikes from some of his strongest campaign supporters showed that they expected him to fulfill promises to stay out of Syria. \n \"Those who wanted us meddling in the Middle East voted for other candidates,\" Ann Coulter, the conservative commentator, wrote on Twitter. \n As a candidate and private citizen, Trump cast Syria's civil war as a quagmire from which the United States should steer clear. Until the chemical weapons attack, Trump mainly saw Syria as a hotbed for terrorists seeking to attack the U.S. He rarely spoke of the hundreds of thousands killed and the millions displaced during the six years of clashes between the Assad government, backed by Russia and Iran, and opposition groups. \n \"He seems to put great score in unpredictability, and that's not such a bad thing in foreign relations if it has some kind of framework around it,\" said Peter Romero, a top State Department official in the Clinton administration. But Romero said that if Trump is \"being erratic, then it'll have very little impact.\" \n Trump is hardly the first president to change his approach to America's role in the world. In 2011, President Barack Obama justified intervention in Libya by citing specific criteria, including the imminent slaughter of civilians. When most of the same guidelines appeared applicable in Syria, particularly after a deadly 2013 chemical weapons attack, Obama backed away from planned military strikes. \n \"There's always a transformation that takes place from a person who wins the presidency, and then once he assumes office he necessarily sees the world from a different perspective,\" said Edward Djerejian, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria and Israel who now directs Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. \"Trump suddenly realizes he's responsible for much of the world.\" \n Another consequence of Trump's shift on Syria has been a strikingly tougher tone from his administration on Russia. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, whose close ties to Russia raised questions during his confirmation hearings, slammed Moscow for either being \"complicit\" in the chemical weapons attack or \"incompetent.\" \n Corker was among those who welcomed that shift. \"The beginning thinking of the administration around Russia was somewhat unsettling, but you've seen that evolve,\" he said. \n But Trump's flexibility means there are no guarantees that he's prepared to fully abandon his efforts to forge a partnership with Russia on counterterrorism, nuclear proliferation and other issues. \n Skeptics noted that a confrontation with Russia over Syria was well-timed for a president whose campaign is under investigation by the FBI and congressional committees for possible coordination with Moscow during the 2016 election. Also, Trump himself has yet to match the harsh criticism of Moscow that some of his advisers have levied. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "After Syria strike, Trump's emerging doctrine is flexibility"}

{"date": "April 8, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The FBI has been reviewing the handling of thousands of terror-related tips and leads received over the last three years to make sure they were properly investigated and that no obvious red flags were missed, The Associated Press has learned. \n WASHINGTON >> The FBI has been reviewing the handling of thousands of terrorism-related tips and leads from the past three years to make sure they were properly investigated and no obvious red flags were missed, The Associated Press has learned. \n The review follows attacks by people who were once on the FBI's radar but who have been accused in the past 12 months of massacring innocents in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub, injuring people on the streets of New York City, and gunning down travelers in a Florida airport. In each case, the suspects had been determined not to warrant continued law enforcement scrutiny months and sometimes years before the attacks. \n The internal audit, which has not been previously reported, began this year and is being conducted in FBI field offices across the country. A senior federal law enforcement official described the review as an effort to \"err on the side of caution.\" \n The audit is essentially a review of records to ensure proper FBI procedures were followed. It's an acknowledgment of the challenge the FBI has faced, particularly in recent years, in predicting which of the tens of thousands of tips the bureau receives annually might materialize one day into a viable threat. \n Investigations that go dormant because of a lack of evidence can resurface instantly when a subject once under scrutiny commits violence or displays fresh signs of radicalization. FBI Director James Comey has said it's like finding a needle in a haystack and determining which piece of hay may become a needle. \n Though there's no indication of significant flaws in how terrorism inquiries are opened and closed, the review is a way for the FBI to \"refine and adapt to the threat, and part of that is always making sure you cover your bases,\" said the law enforcement official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name. \n The pace of the FBI's counterterrorism work accelerated with the rise of the Islamic State group, which in 2014 declared the creation of its so-called caliphate in Syria and Iraq and has used sophisticated propaganda to lure disaffected Westerners to its cause. By the summer of 2015, Comey has said, the FBI was \"strapped\" in keeping tabs on the group's American sympathizers and identifying those most inclined to commit violence. \n Social media outreach by IS has appealed to people not previously known to the FBI but also enticed some who once had been under scrutiny to get \"back in the game,\" said Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington University's Program on Extremism. \n \"The fact that there was a physical location and a caliphate announced, it helped kind of drive folks back in when they might have drifted away,\" Hughes said. \n The review covers inquiries the FBI internally classifies as \"assessments\" \u2014 the lowest level, least intrusive and most elementary stage of a terror-related inquiry \u2014 and is examining ones from the past three years to make sure all appropriate investigative avenues were followed, according to a former federal law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the process. \n Assessments are routinely opened upon a tip \u2014 whether from someone concerned about things such as activity in a neighbor's garage, a co-worker's comments or expressions of support for IS propaganda \u2014 and are catalogued by the FBI. The bureau receives tens of thousands of tips a year, and averages more than 10,000 assessments annually. \n FBI guidelines meant to balance national security with civil liberties protections impose restrictions on the steps agents may take during the assessment phase. \n Agents, for instance, may analyze information from government databases and open-source internet searches, and can conduct interviews. But they cannot turn to more intrusive techniques, such as requesting a wiretap or internet communications, without higher levels of approval and a more solid basis to suspect a crime or national security threat. The guidelines explicitly discourage open-ended inquiries and say assessments are designed to be \"relatively short,\" with a supervisor signing off on extension requests. \n Many assessments are closed within days or weeks when the FBI concludes there's no criminal or national security threat, or basis for continued scrutiny. \n The system is meant to ensure that a person who has not broken the law does not remain under perpetual scrutiny on a mere hunch that a crime could eventually be committed. But on occasion, and within the past year, it's also meant that people the FBI once looked at but did not find reason to arrest later went on to commit violence. \n In the case of Omar Mateen, that scrutiny was extensive, detailed and lengthy. \n Mateen, who shot and killed 49 people at an Orlando nightclub in June, was investigated for 10 months in 2013 and interviewed twice after a co-worker reported that Mateen had claimed connections to al-Qaida. \n As part of a preliminary investigation, agents recorded Mateen's conversations and introduced him to confidential sources before closing the matter. That kind of investigation is more intensive than an assessment and permits a broader menu of tactics, but it also requires a stronger basis for suspicion. Mateen was questioned again in 2014 in a separate investigation into a suicide bomber acquaintance. Comey has said he has personally reviewed that inquiry's handling and has concluded it was done well. \n The FBI in 2014 also opened an assessment on Ahmad Khan Rahimi, who last September was charged in bombings in Manhattan and New Jersey, after his father expressed concerns about his internet use and his associations. The FBI said it closed the review after checking databases and travel and finding nothing that merited continued investigation. \n Esteban Santiago, the man accused in the January shooting at the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, airport that killed five people, had also been looked at by the FBI. He had walked into the bureau's office in Anchorage, Alaska, two months earlier and claimed his mind was being controlled by U.S. intelligence officials. In that case, too, the FBI closed its assessment after interviewing family members and checking databases. \n Each act of violence has raised questions about whether the FBI missed signs or should have been more aggressive in its investigation. With thousands of assessments pouring in, those decisions aren't easy. \n \"If you're looking at all the cases, if everything's blinking red, you have to make a judgment call every time,\" Hughes said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "FBI reviews handling of terrorism-related tips"}
