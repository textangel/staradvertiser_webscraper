{"date": "April 9, 2017", "text": "When FBI agents recently raided an office on the U.S. island of Saipan, they unlocked a cabinet full of Chinese passports belonging to construction laborers without work credentials. The agency, which made at least one arrest, said it was acting on reports of \"systematic human smuggling.\" \n The documents were pulled from a contracting company hired to build a lush gambling resort on this remote patch of U.S. territory \u2014 an ambitious expansion of Best Sunshine Live, a little storefront casino where billions of dollars are wagered each month. \n The contractor's operation isn't alone in drawing federal government scrutiny: The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the activities of the casino itself, operated by Imperial Pacific International Holdings Ltd., including possible violations of anti-money-laundering rules, people familiar with the situation said this month. Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment. \n Since the March 30 search of the contractor, prompted by an undocumented worker's death at the construction site, work has slowed on the new gold-leaf flecked gaming complex, several residents said. \n It's the latest setback for Imperial Pacific. The Hong Kong-listed casino operator, which won the exclusive right to operate casinos on Saipan, counts former directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Central Intelligence Agency among its high-profile board members and advisers. Best Sunshine Live has generated per-table VIP revenues that are far higher than those at the largest resorts in Macau and Las Vegas. The high turnover has already drawn the attention of the U.S. Treasury, people familiar with the situation said last year. \n Spotlight on Contractor \n Imperial Pacific has said it complies with all relevant local and federal anti-money laundering and other regulations. When asked about an investigation by the Justice Department, it said it reserves the right to take appropriate legal action against false news reporting. The company also referred to previous statements it made about the FBI raid, in which it said that the U.S. search and arrests were targeted at contractors and subcontractors, that it hasn't received any \"notice of investigation\" from the FBI and that none of its employees have been arrested. It said it will \"continue to implement measures and consider additional measures to ensure compliance of federal and local laws.\" \n The FBI search threw a separate spotlight onto contractor MCC International Saipan Ltd. \u2014 which, according to corporate filings, is part of one of China's biggest state-run construction and minerals companies. \n Scores of laborers on the island were unlawfully employed by construction executives to build the casino, according to criminal complaints filed after the search by the U.S. in a federal court on the Northern Mariana Islands. Two MCC International Saipan staff members are accused of harboring aliens. \n Bird's Nest \n The Saipan contractor is a far-flung link in a chain of companies that report to Beijing. MCC International Saipan is part of Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd., according to exchange filings. MCC, as it's known, is the Hong Kong and Shanghai-listed arm of China Metallurgical Group Corp., one of China's biggest state-run construction enterprises and a builder of Beijing's iconic Bird's Nest stadium. That group, in turn, is a unit of state-run metals trading giant China Minmetals Corp. \n A China Minmetals spokesman referred questions related to the FBI investigation to China Metallurgical Group and its listed company, MCC. A China Metallurgical Group representative referred questions to MCC. China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, which oversees the companies, didn't respond to a request for comment. \n In an April 5 interview, MCC President Zhang Mengxing said company managers flew to Saipan after the FBI search and arrests to \"deal with the issue\" together with Imperial Pacific. \n Imperial Pacific and MCC International both occupy the second floor of an office building near the resort's construction site. Imperial Pacific rents about 4,800 square feet of space on the floor, according to a current lease agreement reviewed by Bloomberg. \n \"This is an issue both Imperial Pacific and MCC need to handle together,\" Zhang said. \"MCC takes this issue very seriously because it has never happened to our overseas projects before.\" \n When asked to comment on Zhang's remarks, Imperial Pacific referred back to its April 2 statement that the FBI investigation into the construction accident wasn't related to the group or its employees. \n Idle Workers \n It's unclear when the casino and hotel complex in Garapan, a town on Saipan's west coast, will be fully operational. Imperial Pacific had initially said its lavish facility, called Imperial Pacific Resort and eventually boasting 193 gaming tables, would open in time for Chinese New Year celebrations, which were in late January. In a March 31 statement, it said the resort had \"opened for visiting.\" An operator who answered the Best Sunshine casino phone line in Saipan late last week said the new resort wasn't open. \n Nearby at the starter casino, a shopfront by a laundromat in a duty-free mall, turnover has been brisk. Best Sunshine Live's VIP tables handled just under $3 billion in bets in March, the company said on April 2, up from $1.67 billion a month earlier. \n Imperial Pacific, controlled by Chinese entrepreneur Cui Lijie, has assembled a team of high-powered U.S. political figures to assist with its Saipan ambitions. Its chairman is Mark Brown, a former executive with Donald Trump's Atlantic City casinos. Former CIA director James Woolsey and Eugene Sullivan, formerly a senior military judge, sit on its board. Former Louisiana Governor Haley Barbour, former FBI director Louis Freeh and former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell serve as advisers, the company said in a March 28 presentation. \n Rendell has since stepped down, Philly.com reported on April 7. The casino operation is too far away for Rendell to monitor effectively, the site quoted him as saying. Neither Rendell nor Imperial Pacific responded to requests for comment on the report. \n Deadly Fall \n The FBI has said its recent search was prompted by the death of a 43-year-old worker, Chinese citizen Hu Yuanyou, on the casino construction site in late March. \n Hu, whom local media said was killed in a fall from scaffolding, arrived in Saipan as a tourist earlier in the month, the FBI said in court documents. Saipan allows Chinese nationals to arrive without applying first for visas, unlike the U.S. mainland. Those short visa-free stays have made the territory a popular destination for tourists from the world's second-largest economy. \n Zhang, the MCC executive, said Hu didn't work for MCC, but instead for another firm working with Imperial Pacific. He declined to identify that company. \n Two MCC International Saipan employees \u2014 a project manager named Zhao Yuqing, and Ruan Pei, a government liaison responsible for filing employee documents \u2014 were charged with bringing in and harboring unauthorized workers. Also charged were Lu Hui, described as the president and director of Beilida Overseas (CNMI) Ltd., a subsidiary of a Nanjing-based engineering company, and Ma Hongwei, described as an employee of Marianas Enterprises Ltd. who worked in the Beilida office. \n Behind Ma's desk, the FBI said it found a spreadsheet with personnel details for Beilida workers. The list designated more than 150 individuals as \"hei gong,\" Chinese for undocumented worker, the FBI said. Agents spot-checked some of those names against those on a U.S. customs list of people who were visiting without permission to work, and found they matched. \n Stopped at Airport \n Ruan declined to comment when reached on her mobile phone. The others identified in the complaints, and representatives for the companies, didn't respond to requests for comment or couldn't be reached. \n On April 5, the U.S. filed criminal complaints against two further Chinese nationals, bringing the number charged to six. It said they led Beilida work crews on Saipan that employed undocumented workers. By one construction worker's account, the U.S. said, more than half of Beilida's 500 workers were undocumented. \n U.S. officials stopped the pair at Saipan's airport earlier on April 5 as they prepared to board a flight together to China, according to the complaints. \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "Human smuggling, money laundering probes surround Saipan casino"}

He didn't specify North Korea, but the context was clear enough. \n \"If you violate international agreements, if you fail to live up to commitments, if you become a threat to others, at some point a response is likely to be undertaken,\" Tillerson told ABC's \"This Week.\" \n There was little doubt the missile strikes would be seen in Pyongyang as a message. The North has long claimed that the U.S. is preparing some kind of assault against it and justifies its nuclear weapons as defensive in nature. \n U.S. Navy ships are a common presence in the Korean Peninsula region and serve in part as a show of force. On Saturday night, the Pentagon said a Navy carrier strike group was moving toward the western Pacific Ocean to provide more of a physical presence in the region. \n President Donald Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, described the decision to send the carrier group as \"prudent.\" He said Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping had agreed that North Korea's pattern of \"provocative behavior\" was unacceptable and the U.S. was acting accordingly. \n \"This is a rogue regime that is now a nuclear-capable regime. \u2026So the president has asked us to be prepared to give him a full range of options to remove that threat to the American people and our allies and partners in that region,\" McMaster said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \n North Korea has pledged to bolster its defenses to protect against airstrikes. The North called the U.S. action in Syria \"absolutely unpardonable\" and said it proves that its nuclear weapons are justified to protect the country against Washington's \"evermore reckless moves for a war.\" \n The comments were made by a Foreign Ministry official and carried by North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency on Sunday. The report did not name the official, which is common in KCNA reports. \n In appearances on the Sunday news shows, Tillerson said advances in North Korea's ballistic missile program concerned the U.S. the most. Asked on ABC if development of an intercontinental missile was a \"red line\" for Trump, Tillerson said: \"If we judge that they have perfected that type of delivery system, then that becomes a very serious stage of their further development.\" \n The missile strikes against Syria's Assad-led government took place Thursday night as President Donald Trump hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping for dinner at Trump's Florida estate. Among the topics of discussion was the vexing problem of North Korea. \n \"I think there's a shared view and no disagreement as to how dangerous the situation has become,\" Tillerson said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\". \"And I think even China is beginning to recognize that this presents a threat \u2026 to China's interests as well.\" \n Trump and South Korea's leader, acting President Hwang Kyo-Ahn, spoke by phone on Friday, according to the White House, which said they agreed to stay in close contact about North Korea and other issues. \n Trump has said China, with its ties to North Korea, should deal with its neighbor, but that the U.S. was prepared to act on its own if necessary. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tillerson says missile strikes carry a message for others"}

The man behind such classics as \"Johnny B. Goode,\" \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" and \"Roll Over Beethoven\" died on March 18 at the age of 90. \n ST. LOUIS >> Family, friends and fans paid their final respects to the rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry today, celebrating the life and career of a man who inspired countless guitarists and bands. \n The celebration began with a public viewing at The Pageant, a music club in Berry's hometown of St. Louis where he often played. Hundreds of fans filed past Berry, whose beloved cherry-red Gibson guitar was bolted to the inside of his coffin's lid. \n \"I am here because Chuck Berry meant a lot to anybody who grew up on rock n' roll,\" said Wendy Mason, who drove in from Kansas City, Kansas, for the visitation. \"The music will live on forever.\" \n Another fan, Nick Hair, brought his guitar with him from Nashville, Tennessee, so he could play Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode\" while waiting in line outside. \n After the public viewing, family and friends packed the club for a private funeral service and celebration of Berry, who inspired generations of musicians, from humble garage bands up to The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. The service was expected to include live music, and the Rev. Alex I. Peterson told the gathering they would be celebrating Berry's life in rock 'n roll style. \n Former President Bill Clinton sent a letter that was read at the funeral by U.S. Rep. Lacy Clay because Berry played at both of Clinton's presidential inaugurations. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Clinton called Berry \"one of America's greatest rock and roll pioneers.\" \n \"He captivated audiences around the world,\" Bill Clinton wrote. \"His music spoke to the hopes and dreams we all had in common. Me and Hillary grew up listening to him.\" \n Gene Simmons of the rock band Kiss wasn't scheduled to speak but someone urged him to take the podium. Simmons said Berry had a tremendous influence on him as a musician, and he worked to break down racial barriers through his music. \n When Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards spoke about Berry at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's 1986 induction ceremony \u2014 Berry was the first person inducted from that inaugural class \u2014 he said Berry was the one who started it all. \n That sentiment was echoed today by David Letterman's former band leader, Paul Shaffer, who spoke to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch outside the club. \n \"Anyone who plays rock 'n' roll was inspired by him,\" Shaffer said. \n Berry's standard repertoire included about three-dozen songs, including \"Johnny B. Goode,\" \"Sweet Little Sixteen\" and \"Roll Over Beethoven.\" His songs have been covered by country, pop and rock artists such as AC/DC and Buck Owens, and his riffs live on in countless songs. \n The head of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Greg Harris, said \"anybody who's picked up a guitar has been influenced by him.\" \n Well before the rise of Bob Dylan, Berry wedded social commentary to the beat and rush of popular music. \n \"He was singing good lyrics, and intelligent lyrics, in the '50s when people were singing, \"Oh, baby, I love you so,'\" John Lennon once observed. \n \"Everything I wrote about wasn't about me, but about the people listening,\" Berry once said. \n Videojournalist George Wise in St. Louis and Associated Press writer Jim Suhr in Kansas City, Mo., contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Music legend Chuck Berry remembered in rock 'n' roll style"}

{"date": "April 9, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Swedish national flags placed between flowers in a fence near the department store Ahlens following a suspected terror attack in central Stockholm, Sweden, Saturday. \n STOCKHOLM >> Swedes questioned their country's welcoming immigration policies with pride and pain today after learning that an asylum-seeker from Uzbekistan was allegedly behind the truck rampage that killed four people, Stockholm's deadliest extremist attack in years. \n The Swedish capital was slowly, but resolutely, regaining its normal rhythm as details about the 39-year-old suspect in the attack emerged. Police said he had been ordered to leave Sweden in December because his request for a residence permit was rejected six months earlier. \n Instead, he allegedly went underground, eluding authorities' attempts to track down and deport him until a hijacked beer truck raced down a pedestrian street and rammed into an upscale department store on Friday. \n \"It makes me frustrated,\" Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told Swedish news agency TT today. \n The suspect, who has been detained on suspicion of terrorist offenses, was known known for having \"been sympathetic to extremist organizations,\" Jonas Hysing of Sweden's national police said. \n A second person was arrested on the same potential charge today, and four others were being held by police. None of them have been identified. \n Security officials in neighboring Norway, where a 17-year-old asylum-seeker from Russia was detained early today in connection with an explosive device found near a busy subway station, spoke of the alarming potential for a copycat effect. \n Norwegian's security agency said it wasn't clear if the teen planned to carry out an attack with the primitive homemade device police defused without any injuries. Agency head Benedicte Bjornland said it was likely the youth had been inspired by recent attacks in Stockholm, France, Germany, Britain and Russia. \n \"The attacks demonstrate how easy such attacks can be carried out, and prove to others that it is possible to make something similar,\" Bjornland said. \n Sweden has long been known for its open-door policy toward migrants and refugees. But after the Scandinavian country of 10 million took in a record 163,000 refugees in 2015 \u2014 the highest per-capita rate in Europe \u2014 the government has tried to be more selective about which newcomers it allows to stay. \n Swedish police said today they had received roughly 12,500 referrals from the Swedish Migration Board of people who, like the suspect in the truck attack, had overstayed their welcome. \n The suspect eluded authorities by giving police a wrong address after his residency request was rejected in June 2016, said Hysing, the operative head of the attack investigation. \n \"The efforts to locate (these people) is both time-consuming and resource-intensive,\" he said. \n National Coordinator Against Violent Extremism Anna Carlstedt, who used to lead the Red Cross in Sweden, said Friday's attack and the background of the suspect posed \"difficult questions.\" \n \"Do we somehow need a more repressive policy?\" Carlstedt said. \"I think it is very important now not to rush into something, to see how we can safeguard this open society and still be able to protect ourselves.\" \n The range of mixed emotions \u2014 fear and fraternity, anger and openness, \u2014 also surfaced at memorial services and rallies held in Stockholm today to honor the attack victims. \n Lars Holm, a 73-year-old Stockholm resident was visibly upset, after attending a service at Stockholm Cathedral. \n \"If people who are here seeking asylum and treat us like this, it is not good,\" Holm said. \"So now we have to have more security in our society, but still we don't like to live in bunkers.\" \n Addressing tens of thousands of people rallying in bright sunshine on the downtown Sergelstorg square, organizer Rickard Sjoberg noted that many in the crowd probably were from out of town. \n \"But today, were all Stockholmers,\" he said to huge applause. \n The four victims killed included a British man, a Belgian woman and two Swedes, authorities in those countries said. Their identities were not released by Swedish officials. \n The British government named the Briton as Chris Bevington, an executive at Swedish music-streaming service Spotify. In Brussels, the Belga news agency said the Belgian woman had been reported missing before she was identified by her identity papers and later by DNA testing. \n As of today, 10 of the 15 people wounded remained hospitalized, including one child. \n Stockholm county spokesman Patrik Soderberg said four of the 10 were considered \"seriously\" injured and the remaining six, including the child, were slightly injured. \n One of the wounded, an 83-year-old Romanian woman who was begging on the city's pedestrian Drottninggatan shopping street when the attack took place, said she was \"surprised\" that passers-by helped her. \n \"I thought everyone would run past me and save themselves,\" Papusa Ciuraru, whose foot was crushed by a boulder displaced by the speeding truck, told the Expressen daily. \n The lion-shaped boulders on Drottninggatan are meant as roadblocks and have been put up in several European capitals after a truck attack last year killed 12 people at a Christmas market in Berlin. \n Police and Sweden's intelligence have questioned some 500 people as part of the investigation, a senior police officer said. Sweden's SAPO security police said it was working to find \"any abettor or network involved in the attack.\" \n The department store that was rammed by the truck apologized today for an announcement that it would reopen two days after the deadly attack to sell damaged goods at a \"reduced price.\" \n The Ahlens store described it as \"a bad decision\" on its Facebook page, saying its motivation \"was born out of the idea of standing up for transparency and not allowing evil forces take control of our lives.\" \n The store said it would reopen Monday \"without any damaged goods.\" \n Hakan Kaplan and Pietro DeCristofaro in Stockholm also contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Suspect's status as failed asylum-seeker saddens Stockholm"}

Smith and Taylor paid more than $20,000 in Hawaii for a fertility procedure when they decided to have a child using a surrogate mother. \n Sean Smith and his husband paid more than $20,000 for a fertility procedure when they decided to have a child using a surrogate mother. They did not know at the time that if they were a heterosexual couple, they might have saved that money. \n Now, Smith and other members of Hawaii's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community are lobbying for equal access to the financial help married, heterosexual couples enjoy under state law. \n They are pushing legislation that would require insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization for more couples, including making Hawaii the first state to require the coverage for surrogates, which would help male same-sex couples who must use a surrogate. \n \"Now that marriage equality is the law of the land and is accepted, now let's turn to family building, and let's figure out how we fix all these inequities that exist,\" said Barbara Collura, president and CEO of Resolve, a national organization that advocates for access to fertility treatments. \n Hawaii is one of eight states that require insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization, a costly procedure where a doctor retrieves eggs from a woman, combines them with sperm from a man and then implants an embryo into a woman's uterus. \n But Hawaii's mandate applies only to married heterosexual couples because it covers the medical intervention only if a woman uses sperm from her spouse, leaving the LGBT community and single women behind. \n \"At the end of the visit, I would be going into the office and pulling out my credit card, and other people are probably just walking out and insurance is picking up the tab,\" Smith said. \"We had to borrow money, refinance a second mortgage, and I'm sure there are people who don't even explore the option because the expenses are too great.\" \n The measure pending in the Hawaii Legislature removes requirements that the egg and sperm come from a married couple and includes surrogates among the people to be covered. \n No other state has included surrogates in their laws, Collura said. \n \"It is definitely groundbreaking,\" Collura said. \"And it's an often-overlooked way that people choose to build their family, and it should not be left out. It's great to see that Hawaii is taking the lead.\" \n Kaiser Permanente Hawaii opposed the measure, saying the medical provider and insurer does not perform in vitro fertilization with donor eggs or surrogates because of complex legal issues and medical risks. The company asked lawmakers to remove egg donors and surrogates from the bill, saying requiring coverage of additional procedures would raise costs for the company and its customers. \n A similar measure in Hawaii failed in previous legislative sessions. But aside from Kaiser, the bill has seen little opposition this year. \n A broad coalition including the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii, the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission and the Democratic Party of Hawaii are working with LGBT groups to push for change. The proposal passed the state Senate and is up for a vote in the House this week. \n Maryland had a law that also excluded same-sex couples until about a year ago, when the Legislature changed the provision so it no longer required using a husband's sperm. That helped lesbian couples, but gay men were still left out because the law didn't cover surrogates, Collura said. \n Most state mandates limit insurance reimbursement to a certain number of in vitro fertilization trials or allow coverage only after years of infertility. Some states also allow religious or small employers to get out of the requirement. \n \"We need to change these laws,\" Collura said. \"We need to update them and make them so that they are no longer discriminatory.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hawaii LGBT couples seek equal access to fertility treatment"}

{"date": "April 9, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n SANA, Syrian President Bashar Assad spoke, Feb. 10, during an interview with Yahoo News in Damascus, Syria. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster listened, Feb. 20, as President Donald Trump made the announcement at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., that McMaster will be the new national security adviser. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump's national security adviser today left open the possibility of additional U.S. military action against Syria following last week's missile strike but indicated that the United States was not seeking to act unilaterally to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad.  \n In his first televised interview, H.R. McMaster pointed to dual U.S. goals of defeating the Islamic State group and removing Assad. But he suggested that Trump was seeking a global political response for regime change from U.S. allies as well as Russia, which he said needed to reevaluate its support of Syria. \n \"It's very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation of the Assad regime,\" McMaster said. \"Now, we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to effect that change. What we are saying is, other countries have to ask themselves some hard questions. Russia should ask themselves, \u2026Why are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population?\" \n After last Tuesday's chemical attack in Syria, Trump said his attitude toward Assad \"has changed very much\" and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said \"steps are underway\" to organize a coalition to remove him from power. \n But as lawmakers called on Trump to consult with Congress on any future military strikes and a longer-term strategy on Syria, Trump administration officials sent mixed signals on the scope of U.S. involvement. While Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, described regime change in Syria as a U.S. priority and inevitable, Tillerson suggested that last week's American airstrikes in retaliation for the chemical attack hadn't really changed U.S. priorities toward ousting Assad. \n Pressed to clarify, McMaster said the goals of fighting IS and ousting Syria's president were somewhat \"simultaneous\" and that the objective of the missile strike was to send a \"strong political message to Assad.\" He did not rule out additional strikes if Assad continued to engage in atrocities against rebel forces with either chemical or conventional weapons. \n \"We are prepared to do more,\" he said. \"The president will make whatever decision he thinks is in the best interest of the American people.\" \n Reluctant to put significant troops on the ground in Syria, the U.S. for years has struggled to prevent Assad from strengthening his hold on power. \n U.S.-backed rebels groups have long pleaded for more U.S. intervention and complained that Washington has only fought the Islamic State group. So Trump's decision to launch the strikes \u2014 which President Barack Obama declined to do after a 2013 chemical attack \u2014 has raised optimism among rebels that Trump will more directly confront Assad. \n Several lawmakers said today that decision shouldn't entirely be up to Trump. \n Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the no. 2 Republican in the Senate, praised Trump's initial missile strike for sending a message to Assad, Russia, Iran and North Korea that \"there's a new administration in charge.\" But he said Trump now needed to work with Congress to set a future course. \n \"Congress needs to work with the president to try and deal with this long-term strategy, lack of strategy, really, in Syria,\" he said. \"We haven't had one for six years during the Obama administration, and 400,000 civilians have died and millions of people have been displaced internally and externally in Europe and elsewhere.\" \n Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, agreed. \"What we saw was a reaction to the use of chemical weapons, something I think many of us supported,\" he said. \"But what we did not see is a coherent policy on how we're going to deal with the civil war and also deal with ISIS.\" \n Still, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he believed that Trump didn't need to consult with Congress. \n \"I think the president has authorization to use force,\" he said. \"Assad signed the chemical weapons treaty ban. There's an agreement with him not to use chemical weapons.\" \n Their comments came as Tillerson was making the Trump administration's first official trip this week to Russia, a staunch Assad ally. In interviews broadcast today, Tillerson said defeating the Islamic State group remains the top focus. Once that threat \"has been reduced or eliminated, I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilizing the situation in Syria,\" he said. \n \"We're hopeful that we can prevent a continuation of the civil war and that we can bring the parties to the table to begin the process of political discussions\" between the Assad government and various rebel groups. \n The hope, he said, is that \"we can navigate a political outcome in which the Syrian people, in fact, will determine Bashar al-Assad's fate and his legitimacy.\" \n Haley said \"getting Assad out is not the only priority\" and that countering Iran's influence in Syria was another. Still, Haley said the U.S. didn't see a peaceful future Syria with Assad in power. \n McMaster, Cornyn and Cardin spoke on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Tillerson appeared on ABC's \"This Week\" and CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Haley and Graham were on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and Haley also appeared on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \n Associated Press writer Josh Lederman contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump advisers: U.S. seeks to fight IS and oust Syria's Assad"}

{"date": "April 9, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Shoppers Roman Lugo, seated, left, Siuris Rodriguez, center, and Chelsea Lugo, right, sat on the pavement after being evacuated from the Shops at Merrick Park after a shooting, Saturday, in Coral Gables, Fla. \n The gunman who shot and killed two managers at a Florida gym before turning the gun on himself had just been fired from the fitness center for workplace violence, police said Sunday. \n The Miami-Dade Police Department said in a statement Sunday that 33-year-old Abeku Wilson of Miami was let go from his job as a fitness trainer at the Equinox gym in Coral Gables on Saturday \"due to work place violence and was escorted off the premises.\" \n Shortly after his dismissal, Wilson returned to the gym armed with a handgun and fired multiple shots at both managers before shooting himself to death. Police said the managers were deliberately targeted and that the shooting was not random. \n Equinox issued an email statement Sunday saying that it is \"deeply saddened\" by the deaths of the two employees, 35-year-old Janine Ackerman of Miami and 42-year-old Marios Hortis of Miami Beach. Ackerman was general manager of the gym; Hortis was fitness manager. \n \"Our love, prayers and condolences are with both families during this terrible time. The collective Equinox community will always keep Janine and Marios in our hearts,\" the statement said. \n Marc Sarnoff, who previously trained with Wilson for two years, saw him at the gym before Saturday's shooting and noticed something was wrong. \n Wilson typically was \"very buttoned up, very proper, very appropriate,\" Sarnoff said in a phone interview. But on Saturday, Wilson physically bumped into Sarnoff and his current trainer. The usually adept Wilson seemed noticeably off-kilter. \n \"He wasn't clean-shaven \u2026 and he seemed to be slurring his words,\" said Sarnoff. \"He said, 'I'm sorry I'm just off balance this morning'.\" \n The shooting happened about 1 p.m. at the upscale Shops at Merrick Park. Shoppers, diners at mall restaurants and people in workout gear ran to safety or took cover after reports of gunfire. \n \"Five gunshots,\" Ovi Viera, who was washing his hands in the men's locker room, told The Miami Herald. \"It was too loud for it to have been a weight dropping. Within two seconds, people just started running out.\" \n The mall is within a couple miles of the University of Miami campus. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police say Florida gunman had just been fired from fitness center"}
