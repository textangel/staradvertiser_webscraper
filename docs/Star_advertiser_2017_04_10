Deliberations are set to resume Tuesday. \n Attorney Ronald Sullivan Jr., a black Harvard law professor, said the judge's choice of a white woman as forewoman ensured she would remain on the jury instead of being dismissed as an alternate. He said each juror of color should have had the same opportunity to remain on the jury and serve as the foreman or forewoman. \n Judge Jeffrey Locke, referring to an objection the defense first made last week, said he found it \"astounding\" that Sullivan would make that claim. \n \"Accusing any court of being racist is not only offensive to the individual judge, but to the tribunal and the integrity of the tribunal,\" Locke said after the jury was sent out of the room to deliberate. \n Locke, who's white, said the woman he chose was attentive during the trial. The judge also said it is his practice to select a foreman or forewoman before alternate jurors are eliminated by lottery. Twelve jurors are deliberating in the case. \n Sullivan said the judge's choice is troubling because the racial makeup of the jury is predominantly minorities. \n Hernandez, a former tight end for the New England Patriots, is charged with killing Safiro Furtado and Daniel de Abreu in a 2012 drive-by shooting in Boston. Prosecutors say Hernandez felt disrespected after one of the men accidentally spilled his drink at a nightclub. Hernandez's lawyers say Hernandez's former friend, Alexander Bradley, shot the men over a drug deal. \n The victims were Cape Verdean. Hernandez's father was Hispanic, and his mother is Italian. \n Hernandez, 27, is already serving life in prison in a 2013 killing. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hernandez lawyer objects to judge's pick of white forewoman"}

Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Myles also \"may have been targeted for one reason or another.\" \n \"The offender shot him numerous times,\" Guglielmi said. \n No arrests have been made in the shootings that happened around 5 a.m. on Chicago's South Side.

Commissioners in Palm Beach County are so tired of spending money on President Donald Trump's frequent visits to his Mar-a-Lago resort, some are suggesting a special tax be levied against the property. Trump's visits have cost Palm Beach County taxpayers about $2 million. \n WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. >> Commissioners in a Florida county are so tired of spending money on President Donald Trump's frequent visits to his Mar-a-Lago resort that some are suggesting a special tax be levied against the property if the federal government doesn't reimburse its costs. \n Palm Beach County spends more than $60,000 a day when the president visits, mostly for law enforcement overtime \u2014 almost $2 million since January. Sheriff Ric Bradshaw says the county was expected to spend $250,000 during Trump's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, the president's sixth trip to his Winter White House in the 12 weeks since his inauguration. \n County Commissioner Dave Kerner has suggested turning Mar-a-Lago into a special taxing district and imposing a levy on the resort to pay the president's security costs. Because Mar-a-Lago is incorporated as a club, it pays lower property taxes than hotels. It also gets a tax break because Trump surrendered development rights after he purchased the property from the estate of cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post for $10 million in 1985. \n The 500 members pay $14,000 annually in dues. The initiation fee was recently doubled to $200,000. Forbes Magazine estimates the club is now worth $150 million. \n \"We're very honored to have the president here, but at the same time, his travel here is such high frequency he's not visiting Palm Beach County \u2014 he's governing from it,\" Kerner told Money magazine recently. \"Whatever our priorities are, the taxpayers didn't pay this money to us to protect the president.\" \n Kerner did not return numerous calls from The Associated Press to his office. \n The sheriff believes the federal government will eventually reimburse the county, but can't be certain. \n \"I had a personal conversation with the president in February and he understands,\" Bradshaw said. \"There is a system in place and, unfortunately, that involves Congress \u2026 and that is not an easy thing to navigate through. I am sure they will get around to it.\" \n Local governments aren't the only ones complaining. No solution has been found for the 28 business owners at Lantana Airport, a small field for propeller planes about 6 miles from Mar-a-Lago. The Secret Service shutters it every time Trump visits Mar-a-Lago because agents believe the 350 flights it handles daily pose a security risk. \n Marian Smith, who owns a flight school, says she has lost almost $100,000 because of the closures. A banner-towing company that operates from the airport says it has lost over $40,000 in contracts. \n Jonathan Miller, the contractor who operates the county-owned airport, said this week that he believes a compromise will be worked out with the Secret Service, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies that would allow the airport to operate with restrictions during presidential visits. \n \"The FAA has a strong incentive to work with us and help get some funding that will put a system in place that will appease the Secret Service,\" Miller said. \n The cost of Trump's visits divides local residents, with the schism often falling along political lines. Trump's supporters say any money spent by the county is recouped through added visitors lured by the frequent exposure and his visits show he cares about the area. \n \"The fact that he comes down here, the fact he is involved in the community to this extent even though he is the president, I think that's great,\" said Julian Detwiler, who operates produce stands at local farmers markets. \"There are costs associated with everything. It doesn't cost the country or the community more for him to (visit) than lots of other things we do. It keeps the economy going.\" \n The president's critics say the visits illustrate his hypocrisy as he frequently slammed President Barack Obama's trips, even though they were less frequent and didn't burden any single community. \n \"Trump is costing this area so much money, a hell of a lot of money, and he doesn't seem to give a damn,\" said Bob Brink, a novelist and retired local journalist. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "County considers special tax for Trump's Mar-a-Lago visits"}

{"date": "April 10, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Donald Trump, Jr., and Ivanka Trump arrive on Capitol Hill in Washington on Jan. 20 for the presidential Inauguration of their father, Donald Trump. Trump Jr. is saying he will not be a candidate for governor of New York next year, but is not ruling out a possible run for office in the future. \n NEW YORK >> Donald Trump Jr., rumored to be eyeing a move to follow his father's footsteps into politics, will not be a candidate for governor of New York next year but is not ruling out a possible run for office in the future. \n The younger Trump, in an interview today with The Associated Press, categorically denied any speculation that he might challenge incumbent Gov. Andrew Cuomo. \n \"I am not running in 2018,\" Trump said in his first public comments about a possible candidacy next year. \n But he acknowledged having been bitten by the politics bug and said that he could consider a run down the road. \n \"Maybe someday,\" Trump said. \"It's not something I'm doing now. But you never know, it's fascinating stuff.\" \n The political future of Donald Trump Jr., who along with his brother Eric have taken the helm of the Trump Organization since their father took office, has been the subject of repeated speculation since he played a very active role as a campaign surrogate for much of the last two years. His well-received speech at last summer's Republican National Convention electrified conservative circles and sparked talk that he might run for mayor of New York City. \n But the Republican nominee squashed that talk almost immediately, as did Trump Jr. again today. \n \"People keep asking me: when are you running for mayor?\" he said. \"Well, I'm not. If I was, New York City mayor is much less interesting to me than perhaps other things like governor of a state. That's not saying I'm running. It's just saying that, hey, if I ever did something, I'd probably be more interested in something like that.\" \n But Trump Jr. has long been comfortable in conservative circles and is scheduling a few high-profile appearances at Republican events including a fundraiser in Texas last month and one in Indiana next month. Speculation about his political future picked up again in recent days after The New York Post's Page Six reported that he told members of a Long Island club that he'd be interested in running for office. While making clear that he is not ruling out a future run, Trump Jr. also revealed that he shares his father's distrust of much of the media. \n \"If I say no, (the media) says 'He's never going to do it' and if I change my mind, they try to kill you with it,\" Trump Jr. said. \"You always leave your options open.\" \n Ed Cox, head of the New York State Republican Party called the younger Trump \"a very capable individual who would do very well at anything he wanted to do, including politics.\" But Cox also indicated that being patient might be the right approach. \n \"The first duty of a member of the First Family is to help the president be the best president he can be,\" said Cox, who is a son-in-law of former President Richard Nixon. \"The fact that he is not looking beyond that would be probably be the right decision on his part.\" \n Trump Jr., a father of five, said that he has respected a \"firewall\" between the workings of the White House and the Trump Organization. Though he says he has spoken to his father more frequently in recent weeks, the two men do not discuss the details of the family business or the policies of the West Wing, he said. \n But the younger Trump closely watches the doings in Washington and believes that any of the White House's early stumbles are \"understandable\" due to the team's governing inexperience and said that his father would soon be considered a \"phenomenal\" president. He singled out the decision to launch missile strikes on Syria in the aftermath of a chemical attack as a moment of strength. \n \"I think it's important that we show that America has its resolve back,\" he said. \"I've seen more in the last two months than I've seen in the last two administrations in terms of fulfilling promises.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump Jr. nixes 2018 N.Y. bid, but could run for office someday"}

{"date": "April 10, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n An election official checks a voter's photo identification at an early voting polling site in Austin, Texas in 2014. A judge has ruled for a second time that Texas' strict voter ID law was intentionally crafted to discriminate against minorities. \n AUSTIN, Texas >> A judge today again ruled that Republican lawmakers deliberately designed a strict voter ID law to disadvantage minorities and effectively dampen their growing electoral power. \n It amounted to the second finding of intentional discrimination in Texas election laws in as many months \u2014 a separate court in March ruled that Republicans racially gerrymandered several congressional districts when drawing voting maps in 2011, the same year the voter ID rules were passed. \n Neither ruling has any immediate impact. But the decisions are significant because it raises the possibility of Texas being stripped of the right to unilaterally change its election laws without federal approval. Forcing Texas to once again seek federal permission \u2014 known as \"preclearance\" \u2014 has been a goal of Democrats and minority rights groups since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the requirement in 2013. \n The latest voter ID ruling by U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi comes more than two years after she likened the ballot-box rules in Texas, known as SB 14, to a \"poll tax\" meant to suppress minority voters. Today, she reaffirmed that conclusion after an appeals court asked her to go back and re-examine her findings. \n The Texas law requires voters to show one of seven forms of identification at the ballot box. That list includes concealed handgun licenses \u2014 but not college student IDs \u2014 and Texas was forced under court order last year to weaken the law for the November elections. \n \"Proponents touted SB 14 as a remedy for voter fraud, consistent with efforts of other states. As previously demonstrated, the evidence shows a tenuous relationship between those rationales and the actual terms of the bill,\" Gonzales Ramos wrote. \n The state could once again appeal, which is what one of the top deputies of Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton appeared to suggest would happen while testifying to lawmakers just as the ruling came down. Brantley Starr, a deputy first assistant attorney general, acknowledged that Texas could be dragged back under preclearance but noted there was little precedent. \n \"It's possible. It's our belief that you'd have to have multiple instances of discriminatory purpose,\" he said. \n Later today, Paxton spokesman Marc Rylander remarked, \"We're disappointed and will seek review of this ruling at the appropriate time.\" \n The Texas law was softened in August to allow people without a driver's license or other photo ID to sign an affidavit declaring that they have an impediment to obtaining required identification. Republican lawmakers, who have denied they adopted voting laws in 2011 with discriminatory purpose, are now trying to make that flexibility permanent under legislation that Gov. Greg Abbott could sign later this year. \n Texas election officials, however, have acknowledged that hundreds of people were allowed to bypass the state's toughest-in-the-nation voter ID law and improperly cast ballots in the November presidential election by signing a sworn statement instead of showing a photo ID. A recent Associated Press analysis of roughly 13,500 affidavits submitted in Texas' largest counties found at least 500 instances in which voters were allowed to get around the law by signing an affidavit and never showing a photo ID \u2014 despite indicating that they possessed one. \n In February, President Donald Trump's administration reversed the federal government's position on the Texas voter ID law, announcing that it would no longer continue challenging the rules as the U.S. Justice Department did under President Barack Obama. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Judge again finds discrimination in Texas' voter ID law"}

I don't know what to tell her,\" Barajas said as the two held each other and sobbed after the ordeal that sent police flooding onto the campus of San Bernardino's North Park School. \n As Marissa and about 600 other students were shepherded to safety, Barajas and hundreds of other parents raced to the school. There they would endure an agonizing four-hour wait before learning that all but two of their children were physically if not emotionally unharmed. \n \"She just said she was scared.

They believe he arrived at the school intending to kill his estranged wife, North Park teacher Elaine Smith, and accidentally shot the two children. \n Many of the parents of the school's 600 students were at home when the blaring sounds of emergency vehicle sirens shattered the morning quiet of their neighborhood. \n Amberly Raffle, who had left her son with his pre-kindergarten class earlier that morning, said she wasn't sure what the sirens were about until her sister-in-law ran to her house to tell her there was a problem at the school. \n \"Policemen were everywhere and ambulances, firetrucks, helicopters,\" she said of the scene she saw. \"I got really scared then.\" \n It was \"every parent's worst nightmare,\" said Holly Penalber as she wiped tears from her face while waiting to hear the fate of her 9-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter. \n Penalber, a Riverside County sheriff's deputy, was on a training assignment when she began getting frantic texts from her husband and mother, saying something bad had happened at the school. \n Then she waited hours outside a nearby high school where parents were eventually reunited with their children.

{"date": "April 10, 2017", "text": "WASHINGTON >> U.S. authorities announced today they are working to dismantle a global computer network that sent hundreds of millions of spam emails worldwide each year. The Russian man alleged to be at the head of the scheme was arrested Friday in Spain. \n The U.S. Justice Department said it was working to take down the sprawling Kelihos botnet, which at times was made up of more than 100,000 compromised computers that sent phony emails advertising counterfeit drugs and work-at-home scams, harvested users' logins and installed malware that intercepted their bank account passwords. \n Controlling the vast network since 2010 was Pyotr Levashov, a 36-year-old described in U.S. court documents made public today as \"one of the world's most notorious criminal spammers.\" \n Levashov's arrest in Barcelona on Friday, following a joint U.S.-Spanish operation, set cybersecurity circles abuzz after his wife told Russia's RT broadcaster that he was being linked to America's 2016 election hacking. Justice Department officials said today there was no such connection but declined to elaborate. Details of a pending criminal case against Levashov in the United States remain sealed. \n Authorities and cybercrime watchers say Levashov also went by the name Peter Severa, who had long been mentioned in relation to the Kelihos botnet. Court documents filed today paint Levashov as a longtime spam kingpin who has been indicted more than once stemming from his sending of unwanted emails to promote various scams. In 2009, he was charged in the U.S. with operating the \"Storm\" botnet that was Kelihos' predecessor, the documents say. \n He is a fixture on the World's Ten Worst Spammers list, currently coming in at No. 6, according to Spamhaus, an anti-spam organization. \n With the Kelihos botnet, authorities say Levashov's cluster of infected computers targeted Microsoft Windows users and operated undetected. The malware would search files known to contain usernames and passwords and send those back to the network's mastermind, and would intercept real-time communications. \n Authorities said they were able to derail the botnet in part because an infected computer secretly sends requests for further instructions back to the network's operator. The FBI said it essentially rerouted those requests to an FBI-controlled substitute server and blocked the botnet's efforts to regain control of the infected computers. \n Investigators were able to disrupt the network because of new changes to federal rules that allow a judge to issue one warrant for computers or devices in multiple districts at once. Lawmakers late last year were concerned the rule change would make it too easy for the government to hack into computers during investigations. The Kelihos investigation was similar to past takedowns of botnets and investigators sought such a warrant as a precaution, a Justice Department official said today, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the ongoing case. \n The work in the Kelihos case was a \"disruption technique\" and not a way for investigators to search the hard drives of personal computers, the official said, adding that investigators' efforts are showing early signs of success in disrupting the botnet. \n Levashov himself couldn't immediately be reached for comment, and officials did not say whether he had a lawyer. \n Vasily Nioradze, a spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Madrid, confirmed the arrest, but wouldn't say whether Levashov was a programmer. Nioradze wouldn't comment on reports of a U.S. extradition order. \"As it is routine in these cases, we offer consular support to our citizen,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. says global spam scheme targeted after mastermind nabbed"}

{"date": "April 10, 2017", "text": "Associated Press \n This photo provided by Montgomery County Sheriff's office shows a booking mugshot of Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley today. Jail records show Bentley has been booked on two misdemeanor charges that arose from the investigation of an alleged affair with a top aide. \n MONTGOMERY, Ala. >> Gov. Robert Bentley resigned today rather than face impeachment and pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor campaign violations that arose during an investigation of his alleged affair with a top aide. \n In a remarkable fall, the mild-mannered 74-year-old Republican and one-time Baptist deacon stepped down as the sex-tinged scandal gathered force over the past few days. Legislators turned up the pressure by opening impeachment hearings Monday. Last week, the Alabama Ethics Commission cited evidence that Bentley broke state ethics and campaign laws and referred the matter to prosecutors. \n \"There've been times that I let you and our people down, and I'm sorry for that,\" Bentley said in the old House chamber of Alabama's Capitol after he pleaded guilty. \n The violations were discovered during the investigation of his affair but were not directly related to it. \n In court, Bentley appeared sullen and looked down at the floor. One misdemeanor charge against Bentley stemmed from a $50,000 loan he made to his campaign in November that investigators said he failed to report until January. State law says major contributions should be reported within a few days. The other charge stemmed from his use of campaign funds to pay nearly $9,000 in legal bills for Mason last year. \n The plea agreement specified that Bentley must surrender campaign funds totaling nearly $37,000 within a week and perform 100 hours of community service as a physician. The dermatologist also cannot seek public office again. \n Bentley's successor is Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey, who becomes Alabama's second female governor. The first was Lurleen Wallace, wife of segregationist and four-term Gov. George C. Wallace. She ran as a surrogate for her still-powerful husband in 1966 when he couldn't seek re-election because of term limits. She won, but died in office in 1968. \n Bentley said in his statement that he no longer wanted to subject his family and staff \"to the consequences that my past actions have brought upon them.\" His staff gave him a standing ovation as he entered and exited the old House chamber. \n Bentley's resignation follows the ouster of former House Speaker Mike Hubbard, who left office in 2016 after being convicted on ethics charges, and former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who was suspended from his post last year over an order opposing same-sex marriage. \n Bentley, a staunch family-values conservative who won two terms partly because of his reputation for moral rectitude, was first engulfed in scandal last year after recordings surfaced of him making sexually charged comments to 45-year-old political adviser Rebekah Caldwell Mason. \n An investigative report prepared for the House Judiciary Committee and released last week said Bentley encouraged an \"atmosphere of intimidation\" to keep the story under wraps and directed law enforcement officers to track down and seize the recordings. The report portrayed the governor as paranoid and obsessed with trying to keep the relationship secret. \n Today, the committee started what was expected to be days of hearings. \n Bentley lawyer Ross Garber had argued that impeachment should be reserved for only the \"most grave misconduct,\" noting that only two U.S. governors have been impeached since 1929, and both were indicted for serious felonies. \n \"It is not unusual for elected officials to have ethics and campaign finance issues. In fact, many governors face these things. It is very rare, though, for legislators to try to leverage those issues to impeach a governor. In fact, it is simply not done,\" Garber told The Associated Press in an email. \n Garber also represented former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina and Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut during impeachment proceedings. \n The last U.S. governor to be impeached was Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in 2009. He was removed from office, and is now serving a prison sentence, for conspiring to sell an appointment to President Barack Obama's vacant U.S. Senate seat. \n The investigative report contained text messages that the governor sent to Mason. They were intercepted by Bentley's then-wife, Dianne Bentley, who was able to read the messages because they also showed up on the governor's state-issued iPad, which he had given her. \n \"I sure miss you. I need you. I want you. You are the only one,\" one message read. \n Dianne Bentley divorced her husband in 2015 after 50 years of marriage. \n At one point, according to the investigative report, the governor sent the head of his security detail to fetch the recording from his son, Paul Bentley, who responded: \"You ain't getting it.\" Dianne Bentley secretly recorded her husband by leaving her phone on while she went for a walk. \n The former first lady's chief of staff also charged that Bentley threatened her job because he believed she had helped his wife make the recordings. \n On Friday, the governor made a somber plea for forgiveness from the steps of the Alabama Capitol, acknowledging that he had let people down but promising that he had done nothing illegal or anything to merit his removal from office. \n He has denied having a physical relationship with his former aide, though in some of the recordings he talked about the pleasure he got from fondling her breasts. \n GOP leaders in the House and Senate have called on Bentley to resign, as has the Alabama Republican Party's steering committee. \n Two of Bentley's predecessors in the past three decades have been convicted of crimes: Republican Guy Hunt in the 1990s, for misusing funds, and Democrat Don Siegelman, who was convicted of bribery in 2006. \n ", "author": "Kim Chandler Associated Press", "title": "Ala. governor resigns, pleads guilty to misdemeanors in scandal's wake"}

{"date": "April 10, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo spoke, Feb. 28, during a cabinet meeting in the Red Room at the Capitol in Albany, N.Y. New York will be the first state to make tuition at public colleges and universities free for middle-class students under a state budget approved by lawmakers Sunday, April 9. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Brooklyn College students walked between classes on campus in New York on Feb. 1. The New York state Legislature approved a budget on April 9 that includes funding for Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo's plan to offer free tuition for middle-class students at state universities. \n ALBANY, N.Y. >> There's a big string attached to New York's free middle-class college tuition initiative: Students must stay in the state after graduation or else pay back the benefit. \n Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo said today that the requirement was added to protect the state's investment in a student's education by ensuring they don't take advantage of free tuition and then leave New York. \n The tuition initiative, which Cuomo said is a national model, covers state college or university tuition for in-state students from families earning $125,000 or less. Students must remain in New York for as many years as they received the benefit. They must repay the money as a loan if they take a job in another state. \n \"Why should New Yorkers pay for your college education and then you pick up and you move to California?\" Cuomo said during a call with state editorial writers. \"The concept of investing in you and your education is that you're going to stay here and be an asset to the state. If you don't want to stay here, then go to California now, let them pay for your college education.\" \n Students at University at Albany, part of the state university system, aren't so sure. \n \"I don't know how much I like feeling confined, even to staying in the state for four more years,\" said Bobby Rickard, an 18-year-old freshman from Brewster who has not yet decided his major. \"I don't know what life will have for me.\" \n Cumorah Reed, a 19-year-old English major, said certain technology jobs are concentrated on the West Coast and many of her classmates will be surprised to learn they will not be able to apply for those positions immediately after graduation. \n \"I think it's going to be harder than people think,\" Reed said. \n Ashley Mendez, 18, a journalism and communications major, said the proposal is a fair compromise because many residents will stay anyway. \n \"I'm a New Yorker. I wouldn't leave the state for anything,\" Mendez said. \n Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher education at Temple University, said the requirement undercuts the promise of free tuition and could deliver a nasty shock to students who fail to read the fine print, or who take the money believing they will stay in New York, only to find better job opportunities elsewhere. \n \"It's absolutely bait and switch,\" she said. \"You entice people with something they really, really need and then you penalize them if they can't find a decent job and have to leave.\" \n Republican lawmakers pushed for the requirement during closed-door state budget negotiations. \n \"We took the governor's original plan and made it better, by requiring students to maintain a certain GPA and to live and work in New York after they graduate,\" said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate's Republican leadership. \n Students who receive free tuition and then leave the state for an advanced degree won't have to pay the money back assuming they return to New York once they complete their graduate studies. State officials also plan to make accommodations for graduates who leave the state for military service. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "N.Y. makes tuition free, with one catch"}

Ron Maass told reporters.  \n The gunman was identified as 53-year-old Cedric Anderson, of Riverside, who shot his wife, Elaine Smith, also 53. She was a teacher in the special-needs classroom for students in first through fourth grades. \n Anderson said nothing as he began firing a large-caliber revolver, according to police. Both of the children who were hit were standing behind Smith. An 8-year-old later died. The other student was hospitalized in stable condition. \n The gunman had a history of weapons, domestic violence and possible drug charges that predated the marriage, which lasted only a few months, authorities said. \n The boy who died was identified as Jonathan Martinez. Authorities did not name the other boy who was wounded. \n The 600 other students at the school were bused to safety at California State University's San Bernardino campus, several miles away. Television news footage showed students, escorted by police officers, walking off campus hand-in-hand. \n As word of the shooting spread, panicked parents raced to the school, some in tears, some praying as they anxiously sought information about their children. They were told to go to a nearby high school where they would be reunited. \n Four hours later, the children began to arrive at the high school, getting hugs from emotional parents. As the students got off the buses, many of them carrying glow sticks they had been given to pass the time with, police officers applauded and high-fived them. \n When the buses first pulled away, some parents ran alongside, waving and trying to recognize their children inside. Many said their children were too young to have cellphones. Others said the phones rang unanswered. \n Among those waiting anxiously at the high school for her 9-year-old granddaughter's return was Alberta Terrell, who said she cried with relief when she was told that a family friend saw the girl getting safely onto a bus. \n \"I was really elated. But I won't be truly happy until I see her and can give her a big hug,\" Terrell said as she sat in the bleachers near Cajon High School's baseball diamond. \n \"It's frustrating for us as parents but also understandable,\" Holly Penalber said of the long wait, which most parents seemed resigned to. \n Penalber's 9-year-old son and 7-year-old daughter attend the school. She called today's shootings \"every parent's worst nightmare.\" \n San Bernardino, a city of 216,000 people about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, was the site of a December 2015 terror attack that killed 14 people and wounded 22 others at a meeting of San Bernardino County employees. Husband-and-wife shooters Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik were later killed in a gunbattle with authorities. \n Today's shooting was the latest tragedy for a city that has struggled in recent years with more than its share of them. Once a major rail hub and citrus producer, San Bernardino filed for bankruptcy in 2012 after struggling to pay its employees despite steep cuts to the budget. \n An outlying suburb of Los Angeles, it was hit hard when the Great Recession sent housing prices tumbling. As the city struggled with economic problems that forced layoffs of police and other government workers, violent crimes, particularly homicide, began to rise. \n In the past year, however, the city seemed to be making a recovery. Police Chief Jarrod Burguan, who won national praise for the way his department responded to the 2015 shootings, announced last year he was hiring additional officers. \n ___ \n Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo, Brian Melley and John Rogers contributed to this story. \n ", "author": "By Christopher Weber Associated Press", "title": "Teacher, boy die when husband opens fire in California class"}

Holding the bible is Gorsuch's wife Marie Louise Gorsuch. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Chief Justice John Roberts, Jr., and fellow justices watched as Neil Gorsuch signed the Constitutional Oath in the Justices' after Roberts administered the Constitutional Oath in a private ceremony, today, in the Justices' Conference Room at the Supreme Court in Washington. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., administered the Constitutional Oath to the Neil Gorsuch in a private ceremony attended by the Justices of the Supreme Court and members of the Gorsuch family, including wife Louise Gorsuch, today, in the Justices' Conference Room at the Supreme Court in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump praised new Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during a White House swearing-in ceremony today as a jurist who will rule \"not on his personal preferences but based on a fair and objective reading of the law.\" \n In the Rose Garden ceremony, Trump said Americans would see in Gorsuch \"a man who is deeply faithful to the Constitution of the United States\" and predicted greatness for the 49-year-old former appeals court judge from Colorado. \n \"I have no doubt you will go down as one of the truly great justices in the history of the U.S.,\" Trump said. The president noted that the successful nomination came during his first 100 days in office and added: \"You think that's easy?\" \n Gorsuch, who restores the court's conservative majority, was sworn in during the ceremony by Justice Anthony Kennedy, for whom he once served as a law clerk. It was the second of two oaths \u2014 the first was conducted privately in the Justices' Conference Room by Chief Justice John Roberts. \n In remarks in the Rose Garden, Gorsuch said he was humbled by his ascendance to the nation's high court and thanked his former law clerks, saying of his former law clerks, \"your names are etched in my heart forever.\" \n Gorsuch promised to be a \"faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great nation.\" \n He fills the nearly 14-month-old vacancy created after the death of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who anchored the court's conservative wing for nearly three decades before he died unexpectedly in February 2016. In nominating Gorsuch, Trump said he fulfilled a campaign pledge to pick someone in the mold of Scalia. \n During 11 years on the federal appeals court in Denver, Gorsuch mirrored Scalia's originalist approach to the law, interpreting the Constitution according to the meaning understood by those who drafted it. Like Scalia, Gorsuch is a gifted writer with a flair for turning legal jargon into plain language people can understand. \n Gorsuch will be seated just in time to hear one of the biggest cases of the term: a religious rights dispute over a Missouri law that bars churches from receiving public funds for general aid programs. \n His 66-day confirmation process was swift, but bitterly divisive. It saw Senate Republicans trigger the \"nuclear option\" to eliminate the 60-vote filibuster threshold for Gorsuch and all future high court nominees. The change allowed the Senate to hold a final vote to approve Gorsuch with a simple majority. \n Most Democrats refused to support Gorsuch because they were still seething over the Republican blockade last year of President Barack Obama's pick for the same seat, Merrick Garland. Senate Republicans refused to even hold a hearing for Garland, saying a high court replacement should be up to the next president. \n The White House swearing-in ceremony was a departure from recent history. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were both sworn in publicly at the Supreme Court. Former Justice John Paul Stevens has argued that holding the public ceremony at the court helps drive home the justice's independence from the White House. \n Some interesting facts about Gorsuch and the court: \n \u2014He is the youngest nominee since Clarence Thomas, who was 43 when confirmed in 1991. \n \u2014The Colorado native went to high school in Washington while his mother served as EPA administrator in the Reagan administration. \n \u2014He's the sixth member of the court who attended Harvard Law School; the other three got their law degrees from Yale. \n \u2014Gorsuch credits a nun with teaching him how to write. He and his family attend an Episcopal church in Boulder, though he was raised Catholic and attended Catholic schools as a child. He joins a court that has five Catholics and three Jews. \n \u2014As an associate justice, Gorsuch will earn $251,800 a year \u2014 over 15 percent above his $217,600 salary as an appellate judge. \n \u2014Gorsuch joins the ranks of justices who are millionaires. He reported financial assets in 2015 worth at least $3.2 million, according to his latest financial disclosure report. \n Associated Press writers Mark Sherman and Ken Thomas contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Gorsuch sworn into Supreme Court, vows to serve Constitution"}
