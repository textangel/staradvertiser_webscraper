The terse ruling by a three-judge panel says her bid for court intervention wasn't timely, noting she had been subject to a final order of removal since 2014. \n Immigration officials have contended Trujillo Diaz entered the United States illegally in 2002 and had exhausted her appeals. \n \"We're obviously disappointed with the court's ruling, but we still encourage ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to do the right thing and not separate this mom from her kids,\" attorney Emily Brown said. \n She said the woman was being moved today from Ohio to an immigration detention center in Louisiana in preparation for her removal. \n The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati has called for mercy, saying she has made positive contributions to her church and community in Butler County, just north of Cincinnati.

The four people killed in the attack included two Swedes, a British man and a Belgian woman. \n STOCKHOLM >> A 39-year-old old Uzbek man has pleaded guilty to a terrorist crime after ramming a truck into a crowd in Stockholm, killing four people and wounding 15, his lawyer said Tuesday. \n The Stockholm District Court ruled Tuesday that police may detain Rakhmat Akilov for a month. After the court hearing, defense lawyer Johan Eriksson said Akilov is \"pleading guilty\" to Friday's attack and that his client could remain jailed as long as it takes to resolve the case. \n It was not immediately clear when Akilov made his plea. The Stockholm court earlier turned down Akilov's request for a new defense attorney \u2014 a Sunni lawyer \u2014 to replace Eriksson. \n Police detained Akilov on Friday after he drove the stolen beer truck into a crowd outside an upscale department store in central Stockholm in the afternoon. He was formally arrested early Saturday. \n Police have not given a motive for the attack and no extremist group has claimed responsibility, but police chief Dan Eliasson said that after questioning him they have become increasingly \"convinced that we have the right suspect.\" \n \"This detention order simply reinforces what we already know,\" Eliasson said. \n Police said Akilov was known to have been sympathetic to extremist organizations but that there was nothing to indicate he might plan an attack. His Swedish residency application was rejected last year. \n The four people killed were two Swedes, a Belgian woman and a British man. The British government has identified the Briton as Chris Bevington, an executive at Swedish music-streaming service Spotify.

{"date": "April 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, speaks at a news conference in December at RIA Novosti news agency in Moscow, Russia. \n WASHINGTON >> The FBI obtained a secret court order last summer to monitor the communications of Carter Page, an adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump, because the government had reason to believe Page was acting as a Russian agent, The Washington Post reported Tuesday. \n Page is among the Trump associates under scrutiny as the FBI and congressional committees investigate whether his presidential campaign had ties to Russia's meddling in the 2016 election. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, but the investigations could shadow his presidency for months or even years. \n The Post, citing unnamed law enforcement and other U.S. officials, said the government surveillance application laid out the basis for believing that Page had knowingly engaged in intelligence activities on Russia's behalf. The newspaper said the application includes contacts Page had with a Russian intelligence operative in 2013. \n Those contacts are detailed in a 2015 court filing involving a case against three men charged in connection with a Cold War-style Russian spying ring. According to the filing, Page provided one of the men documents about the energy industry. He was not charged as part of that case. \n An FBI spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment from The Associated Press. \n Page, who has denied having improper ties to Russia, told the AP Tuesday he was \"happy\" that the court order had been revealed and blamed the Obama administration for trying to \"suppress dissidents who did not fully support their failed foreign policy.\" \n \"It will be interesting to see what comes out when the unjustified basis for those FISA requests are more fully disclosed over time,\" said Page, using an acronym to refer to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \n The FISA court and its orders are highly secretive. Judges grant permission for surveillance if they agree there's probable cause that the target is an agent of a foreign power. Though the standard is a high bar to meet, applications are hardly ever denied. \n The Post reported that a 90-day warrant was issued for Page and has been renewed more than once by the FISA court. \n Page was a little-known investment banker when Trump announced him as a member of his foreign policy advisory team early last year. Trump aides insist the president has no relationship with Page and did not have any dealings with him during the campaign. \n Page's relationship with Russia began to draw scrutiny during the campaign after he visited Moscow in July 2016 for a speech at the New Economic School. While Page said he was traveling in a personal capacity, the school cited his role in the Trump campaign in advertising the speech. \n Page was sharply critical of the U.S. in his remarks, saying Washington has a \"hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.\" \n Days later, Page talked with Russia's ambassador to the U.S. at an event on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention. Attorney General Jeff Sessions spoke with the Russian envoy at the same event, a conversation he failed to reveal when asked about contacts with Russians during his Senate confirmation hearings. \n The campaign began distancing itself from Page after his trip to Russia, saying he was only an informal adviser. By the fall, he appeared to have cut ties to the Republican campaign. \n It's unclear how Page got connected with the Trump campaign. One campaign official said Page was recruited by Sam Clovis, an Iowa Republican operative who ran the Trump campaign's policy shop and is now a senior adviser at the Agriculture Department. Those who served on the campaign's foreign policy advisory committee also said they had limited contact with Page. \n But in a letter Page sent to the Senate intelligence committee last month, he cast himself as a regular presence in Trump Tower, where the campaign was headquartered. \n \"I have frequently dined in Trump Grill, had lunch in Trump Caf\u00e9, had coffee meetings in the Starbucks at Trump Tower, attended events and spent many hours in campaign headquarters on the fifth floor last year,\" Page wrote. He also noted that his office building in New York \"is literally connected to the Trump Tower building by an atrium.\" \n Page, a former Merrill Lynch investment banker who worked out of its Moscow office for three years, now runs Global Energy Capital, a firm focused on energy sectors in emerging markets. According to the company's website, he has advised on transactions for Gazprom and RAO UES, a pair of Russian entities. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Report: U.S. sought to monitor Trump adviser last summer"}

Toyota Motor Corp.'s Welwalk WW-1000 system is made up of a motorized mechanical frame that fits on a person's leg from the knee down. \n TOKYO >> Toyota is introducing a wearable robotic leg brace designed to help partially paralyzed people walk. \n The Welwalk WW-1000 system is made up of a motorized mechanical frame that fits on a person's leg from the knee down. The patients can practice walking wearing the robotic device on a special treadmill that can support their weight. \n Toyota Motor Corp. demonstrated the equipment for reporters at its Tokyo headquarters on Wednesday. \n One hundred such systems will be rented to medical facilities in Japan later this year, Toyota said. The service entails a one-time initial charge of 1 million yen ($9,000) and a 350,000 yen ($3,200) monthly fee. \n The gadget is designed to be worn on one leg at a time for patients severely paralyzed on one side of the body due to a stroke or other ailments. \n The gadget is designed to be worn on one leg at a time for patients severely paralyzed on one side of the body due to a stroke or other ailments, Eiichi Saito, a medical doctor and executive vice president at Fujita Health University, explained. \n The university joined with Toyota in developing the device. \n A person demonstrating it strapped the brace to her thigh, knee, ankle and foot and then showed how it is used to practice walking on the treadmill. Her body was supported from above by a harness and the motor helped to bend and straighten her knee. Sensors in the device monitor the walking and adjust quickly to help out. Medical staff control the system through a touch panel screen. \n Japanese automakers have been developing robotics both for manufacturing and other uses. Honda Motor Co.'s Asimo humanoid can run and dance, pour a drink and carry on simple conversations, while WelWalk is more of a system that uses robotics than a stand-alone robot. \n Given how common paralysis due to strokes is in fast-aging Japan, Toyota's device could be very helpful, Saito said. He said patients using it can recover more quickly as the sensitive robotic sensor in Welwalk fine-tunes the level of support better than a human therapist can. \n \"This helps just barely enough,\" said Saito, explaining that helping too much can slow progress in rehabilitation. \n The field of robotic aids for walking and rehabilitation is growing quickly. A battery-powered wearable exoskeleton made by Israeli manufacturer ReWalk Robotics enables people relying on a wheelchair to stand upright and walk. \n Such systems also can aid therapists in monitoring a patient's progress, Luke Hares, chief technology officer at Cambridge Medical Robotics in Britain, said in a phone interview. \n \"They can be so much more precise,\" he said. \n Previously, Toyota has shown robots that play the violin and trumpet. It plans to start sales in Japan of a tiny boy-like robot for conversational companionship. It is also investing in artificial intelligence and developing self-driving vehicles. \n Toshiyuki Isobe, Toyota's chief officer for research, said Welwalk reflects the company's desire to apply robotics in medicine and other social welfare areas, not just entertainment. The company also has an R2-D2-like machine, called the Human Support Robot, whose mechanical arm can help bed-ridden people pick things up. \n \"Our vision is about trying to deliver mobility for everybody,\" said Isobe. \"We have been developing industrial robotics for auto manufacturing, and we are trying to figure out how we can use that technology  \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Toyota shows robotic leg brace to help paralyzed people walk"}

But budget director Mick Mulvaney says many jobs will remain unfilled as the White House embarks on a government-wide effort to overhaul the executive branch and significantly reduce its work force. \n Mulvaney told reporters Tuesday at a White House briefing that the move was part of the president's campaign pledge to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington and save taxpayers money. \n \"It does not mean that the agencies will be free to hire willy-nilly,\" he said. \"What we're doing tomorrow is replacing the across-the-board hiring freeze that we put into place on Day One in office and replacing it with a smarter plan, a more strategic plan, a more surgical plan.\" \n The president signed a memorandum in January freezing large portions of federal government hiring, barring the military and positions deemed necessary for national security and public safety. As part of the memorandum, Trump gave the Office of Management and Budget 90 days to come up with a long-term plan to reduce the federal government's size. \n While the guidance to be issued Wednesday does not contain agency-specific hiring goals or limits, Mulvaney said that agencies targeted with significant budget cuts in Trump's first budget proposal, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, would be expected to make significant cuts to their workforces. Agencies that Trump wants to spend more on, like the Department of Veterans Affairs, would be expected to see their payrolls rise. \n Trump's budget blueprint calls for a 6 percent increase in VA funding, mostly to pay for rising health costs to treat veterans. The VA is one of three agencies slated for more money amid big-time cuts to other domestic programs. \n Mulvaney declined to say how many jobs, overall, the administration intends to eliminate, but said: \"I think it probably goes without saying that net, we think we could run the government more efficiently than the previously administration.\" \n Under the guidance, agencies will also have until June to submit drafts for overhauling their workforces and coming up with ideas for streamlining operations as part of a larger effort to restructure the federal government. The administration is surveying the public, academics, lawmakers and others for ideas such as potentially moving the National Nuclear Security Administration to the Department of Defense from the Department of Energy, where it currently resides. \n \"The president of the United States has asked all of in the executive branch to start from scratch,\" Mulvaney said.

Estes defeated civil rights lawyer James Thompson by seven percentage points, suggesting some backlash against Republicans since November. \n \"Republicans nationally should be very worried,\" said Bob Beatty, a Washburn University political scientist. \"It's remarkable that Thompson got this close.\" \n The Kansas election was the first of four special elections to fill seats in the House of Representatives \u2014 where Republicans now hold a 237-193 majority\u2014 to replace Republicans who took top jobs in the Trump administration. Others are in Georgia, Montana and South Carolina. \n Both parties will now turn their attention to Georgia and the extremely competitive April 18 contest to replace Tom Price, who resigned to serve as Trump's Health and Human Services secretary. \n Democratic hopes rest with Jon Ossoff, 30, a former congressional staffer turned investigative filmmaker who has raised more than $8 million, an extraordinary amount for a special election. Ossoff is counting on opposition to Trump to propel him to a decisive victory. \n The Kansas result also reflected blowback against the state's unpopular Republican governor Sam Brownback. \n Thompson tapped into voter frustration after Brownback made Kansas a laboratory for sweeping tax cuts that left the state short of revenue and facing a budget crisis. Brownback also refused to expand the Medicaid health program for the poor. \n Lucy Jones-Phillips, a 31-year-old insurance representative and Democrat, acknowledged she doesn't vote in every election, but said she voted for Thompson because she wanted to register her disappointment in Brownback, especially his veto of an expansion of Medicaid. \n \"I can't stand Brownback,\" she said as she left her polling site in Belle Plaine. \n In a sign of nervousness in the waning days of the campaign, Republicans poured money into the race to bolster Estes. Republicans pulled in U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas to campaign in Wichita for Estes, and both Vice President Mike Pence and Trump recorded robo calls for him. \n Those GOP calls prompted Charlene Health, a 52-year-old homemaker and Republican in Belle Plaine, to cast a ballot for Estes. \n \"I wasn't even going to vote,\" she said as she left her polling site this morning. \"I finally did. I realized this was important.\" \n Republicans have represented the south-central Kansas district since 1994. The district has been hurt by the downturn in the agricultural economy and the loss of hundreds of well-paying, blue-collar jobs in aircraft manufacturing plants. The 17-county congressional district includes the state's largest city of Wichita, home to Koch Industries, the company led by conservative billionaire political donors Charles and David Koch. \n Estes handily won the district's rural counties. But Thompson won in Sedgwick County, which includes Wichita. Trump had carried Sedgwick county by more than 18 percentage points. \n Estes said in his victory speech tonight that his campaign showed political pundits and national media that they were wrong in suggesting he could lose the race. \n Thompson, 46, a political newcomer backed by a group aligned with Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, said late today that he will run for the seat again in 2018. \n \"We came a lot closer than everyone thought we were going to be at the beginning of the race, because from the very beginning people wrote us off as having absolutely no shot,\" Thompson's spokesman Chris Pumpelly said. \n Libertarian Chris Rockhold trailed a distant third in the race. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Republicans survive election scare, win Kansas House seat"}

A 9-year-old boy also was shot but was in stable condition and in good spirits, watching cartoons in his hospital bed today, police said. \n Anderson and Smith had married in late January but separated in mid-March after Anderson accused her of infidelity, leading Smith to move out, Burguan said. \n Just weeks before the shooting, Anderson had professed his love to Smith in a series of social media posts, including one that called her an \"angel.\" \n Smith's mother, Irma Sykes, said her daughter had been friends with Anderson for about four years before they got married. \n \"She thought she had a wonderful husband, but she found out he was not wonderful at all,\" Sykes told the Los Angeles Times. \n \"She left him and that's where the trouble began,\" Sykes said. \"She broke up with him and he came out with a different personality. She decided she needed to leave him.\" \n Anderson, a self-proclaimed pastor whose Facebook profile is filled with Bible quotes and religious references, had been unemployed but previously held jobs as a maintenance worker, police said. \n He had joined the Navy in 1982 and re-enlisted as a reservist from 1987 until 2003, working as a builder, according to military records. \n Anderson had been arrested four times since 1982, though none resulted in convictions, Burguan said. Those arrests included one in August 2012 on suspicion of spousal battery and another in May 2013 on suspicion of brandishing a knife, Torrance police Sgt. Ronald Harris said. \n Investigators who searched Anderson's home after the shooting found a note that made reference to the relationship, feeling dishonored and \"moving forward with no regrets,\" Burguan said. But outside the context of the shooting, nothing about the note would have been alarming, he said. \n The slain teacher was remembered today by one school parent as \"nothing but good\" with the patience and understanding to handle special-needs students. \n \"She was an excellent teacher,\" said Marie Cabreras, who has two young children at North Park and also has an older daughter who was Smith's student for two years at a nearby high school. \n \"She loved on kids. Her whole life was surrounded around kids and helping them, and helping them build a future,\" Cabreras said. \n Teachers hugged one another and wiped away tears as they returned to the school today to retrieve their belongings. It was to remain closed for the remainder of the week. \n Ruben Gutierrez, whose 7-year-old grandson Jeffrey Imbriani was friends with Martinez, said the shooting was \"just beyond words.\" Gutierrez brought his grandson back to the school to show him how community members were coming together after the shooting and to reinforce that the school is safe. \n \"You know, it's not a scary place to be, and just kind of help him process more and re-experience what happened to hopefully make this as healthy and experience as can be given the circumstances,\" Gutierrez said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Veteran kills wife at school after failing to win her back"}

{"date": "April 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People visit the Charging Bull and Fearless Girl statues last week in New York. \n NEW YORK >> The sculptor of Wall Street's \"Charging Bull\" statue is accusing New York City of violating his legal rights by allowing the \"Fearless Girl\" statue to be installed facing the bronze beast, without his permission. \n Attorney Norman Siegel told The Associated Press that Arturo Di Modica will explain at a news conference Wednesday exactly how he's challenging city officials who issued a permit for the bronze girl to stay until February. Siegel said he's demanding that the city release documents showing what procedures were followed. \n Artist Kristen Visbal's figure was first placed on a traffic island near Wall Street on March 7, on the eve of International Women's Day, to make a point: There's a dearth of women on the boards of the largest U.S. corporations. \n The 4-foot girl staring down the 11-foot bull with hands planted on her hips quickly became a tourist magnet, drawing global attention on social media while awakening the imaginations of live visitors who posed for pictures. In response to petitions with tens of thousands of signatures for the statue to stay longer, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city permit was extended for nearly one year. \n Di Modica calls the statue an \"advertising trick\" created by two corporate giants \u2014 State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based investment giant, and McCann, its New York advertising firm. \n The Italian-born sculptor says the presence of \"Fearless Girl\" infringes on his own artistic copyright to the \"Charging Bull,\" by changing the creative dynamic to include the other bold presence. \n A spokeswoman for the mayor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n There was a time when \"Charging Bull\" was in a position similar to the \"Fearless Girl\" \u2014 waiting for the city to allow the piece to stay. \n Di Modica had installed the massive bronze in front of the New York Stock Exchange after the 1987 stock market crash, without a permit in the middle of the night \u2014 as a symbol of America's financial resilience. The city eventually responded to the public clamoring for the artwork to be allowed to remain in the Financial District, steps from Wall Street. \n The sculptor came to him about 10 days ago, said Siegel, the former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union handling the case with attorney Steven Hyman. \n A lawsuit has not been filed, said Siegel, who declined to say whether or when that might happen. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'Charging Bull' sculptor accuses NYC of violating his rights"}

The letter asks for a response by April 24. \n Twenty-one U.S. senators signed the letter. \n \"I'm demanding answers from United CEO,\" Schatz said in a tweet. \"Crowdsourcing questions for next letter.\" \n In addition to the letter signed by Schatz and Hirono, four senators wrote letters today that said United's explanation \"has been unsatisfactory, and appears to underestimate the public anger about this incident.\" The letters were addressed to United CEO Oscar Munoz and Ginger Evans, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Aviation. \n \"The last thing a paying airline passenger should expect is a physical altercation with law enforcement personnel after boarding, especially one that could likely have been avoided,\" they said. \n The senators directed most of their questions at Munoz, including queries about the airline's policy for bumping passengers off oversold flights, and whether it makes a difference that passengers have already boarded the plane, as happened on the United Express plane in Chicago. \n The senators said the incident could have been prevented with better communication or \"additional incentives\" \u2014 an apparent suggestion that United didn't offer passengers enough compensation to voluntarily give up their seats. \n The letters was signed by the four top-ranking members of the Senate commerce committee \u2014 the Republican chairman, John Thune, the Republican aviation subcommittee chairman, Roy Blunt, and the two senior Democrats, Bill Nelson of Florida and Maria Cantwell of Washington. \n \u2014\u2014\u2014 \n New Jersey Gov.

Videotape of the confrontation spread across social media. \n Spicer says he's sure Trump has seen the video but that any comment from the president could influence a potential outcome of the investigations. \n Spicer adds that he thinks everyone who has seen the video can agree that the situation could have been handled better. \n ", "author": "By Star-Advertiser staff and Associated Press", "title": "Hawaii senators want answers from United"}

{"date": "April 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz in June waits to be interviewed, in New York, during a presentation of the carrier's new Polaris service, a business class product on trans-Atlantic flights. \n CHICAGO >> After people were horrified by video of a passenger getting dragged off a full United Express flight by airport police, the head of United's parent company said the airline was reaching out to the man to \"resolve this situation.\" \n Hours later on Monday, his tone turned defensive. He described the man as \"disruptive and belligerent.\" \n By this afternoon, almost two days after the Sunday evening confrontation in Chicago, CEO Oscar Munoz issued his most contrite apology yet as details emerged about the man seen on cellphone videos recorded by other passengers at O'Hare Airport. \n \"No one should ever be mistreated this way,\" Munoz said. \n The passenger was identified as physician David Dao, 69, of Elizabethtown, Kentucky, who was convicted more than a decade ago of felony charges involving his prescribing of drugs and spent years trying to regain his medical license. \n But while Dao's history quickly became a focus of attention, there's no indication that his past influenced how he was treated or that the airline or police were aware of his background or would have known anything about him other than basic information such as his name and address, if that. \n Screaming can be heard on the videos, but nowhere is Dao seen attacking the officers. In fact, he appears relatively passive both when he was dragged down the aisle of the jet and when he is seen standing in the aisle later saying quietly, \"I want to go home, I want to go home.\" \n Munoz's latest statement described the removal as \"truly horrific.\" He said the company would review policies for seeking volunteers to give up their seats, for handling oversold situations and for partnering with airport authorities and local law enforcement. \n An attorney who represents Dao said his client was being treated at a Chicago hospital for injuries he sustained on the plane and that the family would not comment. \n According to records from the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure, Dao went to medical school at the University of Medicine of Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, graduating in 1974. He was licensed in Kentucky with a specialty in pulmonary disease. \n His legal troubles started in 2003, when his medical license was suspended after an undercover sting operation at a Louisville motel for allegedly writing fraudulent prescriptions. \n According to the documents, the licensing board had learned that Dao had become sexually interested in a patient and hired the patient as his office manager. That man later said he quit his job because Dao \"pursued him aggressively\" and arranged to provide him with prescription drugs in exchange for sex. \n Dao was ultimately convicted in late 2004 of several counts of obtaining drugs by fraud or deceit and was placed on five years of supervised probation and surrendered his medical license. \n His longtime effort to get his license back finally succeeded in 2015, when the licensing board allowed him to practice medicine again. \n Airport officials have said little about Sunday's events and nothing about Dao's behavior before he was pulled from the jet that was bound for Louisville, Kentucky. Likewise, the Chicago Aviation Department has said only that one of its employees who removed Dao did not follow proper procedures and has been placed on leave. \n No passengers on the plane have mentioned that Dao did anything but refuse to leave the plane when he was ordered to do so. \n Also today, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the way Dao was treated \"completely unacceptable\" and praised Aviation Commissioner Ginger Evans for taking \"swift action.\" He promised that a city investigation would \"ensure nothing like this ever happens again.\" \n The event stemmed from a common air travel issue \u2014 a full flight. United was trying to make room for four employees of a partner airline, meaning four people had to get off. \n At first, the airline asked for volunteers, offering $400 and then when that did not work, $800 per passenger to relinquish a seat. When no one voluntarily came forward, United selected four passengers at random. \n Three people got off the flight, but the fourth said he was a doctor and needed to get home to treat patients on Monday. He refused to leave. \n Three Aviation Department police officers got on the plane. Two officers tried to reason with the man before a third came aboard and pointed at the man \"basically saying, 'Sir, you have to get off the plane,'\" said Tyler Bridges, a passenger whose wife, Audra D. Bridges, posted a video on Facebook. \n One of the officers could be seen grabbing the screaming man from his window seat, across the armrest and dragging him down the aisle by his arms. \n Other passengers on Flight 3411 are heard saying, \"Please, my God,\" \"What are you doing?\" \"This is wrong,\" \"Look at what you did to him\" and \"Busted his lip.\" \n The U.S. Department of Transportation announced today that it is reviewing Sunday's events to see if United violated rules on overselling flights. \n Dao's relatives are focused only on his medical care, attorney Stephen L. Golan said. The family \"wants the world to know that they are very appreciative of the outpouring of prayers, concern and support they have received.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "CEO issues new apology as details of passenger's past emerge"}

{"date": "April 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Travelers check in at the United Airlines ticket counter in 2013 at Terminal 1 in O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. \n United is getting pummeled on late-night TV. Online, jokers are proposing new corporate slogans such as \"We'll drag you all over the world\" and \"We have red eye and black eye flights available.\" On Wall Street, the airline briefly lost nearly $1 billion in market value before its stock regained much of the loss. \n >>CEO issues new apology as details of passenger's past emerge \n Cellphone videos of airport police yanking a 69-year-old passenger out of his seat and dragging him down the aisle have become a public-relations nightmare for United. Travel and PR experts say the airline fumbled the situation from the start and made matters worse with a tone-deaf apology from the CEO. \n It's too soon to know whether Sunday night's incident at Chicago's O'Hare Airport will cause lasting harm. United frequent flyers won't easily give up their miles. Many travelers aren't attached to a particular airline and just take the cheapest fare. \n Then again, there are those videos. \n \"That is the craziest act I've ever seen. Who drags a ticketed passenger off an airplane?\" said Bruce Rubin, a longtime practitioner of crisis public relations in Miami. \"Because it's so visual and it's so unnecessary, it's the kind of thing that can hurt United long-term.\" \n Lawyers for the passenger in the videos, David Dao, a doctor from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, said today that he was being treated in a Chicago hospital. They gave no further details on his injuries. \n Just two weeks ago, United was at the center of another PR furor after a gate agent in Denver barred two girls from boarding a flight because they were wearing leggings. \n United CEO Oscar Munoz apologized on Monday for the latest incident but also blamed the passenger for not obeying when airline employees asked him to leave. Munoz called the man \"disruptive and belligerent.\" \n Today, Munoz offered a stronger mea culpa for the \"truly horrific event,\" saying, \"No one should ever be mistreated this way.\" He promised a review of airline policies by April 30 and vowed to \"fix what's broken so this never happens again.\" \n Jim Corridore, an airline analyst for CFRA Research, said after \"poorly handling a PR disaster,\" United's CEO \"is finally saying the right things.\" \n Dao and three other passengers had been told to give up their seats so that four employees of the company operating the flight for United could board. Dao was the only one to refuse. \n To make room on the plane, United had tried to entice volunteers with travel vouchers worth $800 and a hotel room. When there were no takers, a United manager went on board and announced that four people would be removed. \n Big mistake, say the crisis-management experts. Everyone wondered why United didn't simply sweeten the offer until four passengers agreed to get off. \n \"A few dollars could have solved this problem,\" said Allen Adamson, founder of Brand Simple Consulting in New York. \"Instead, the damage of the brand will be millions of dollars.\" \n United said passengers were already seated when the four employees of Republic Airline showed up at the gate and insisted on boarding the plane to Louisville, Kentucky, so that they could operate a flight the next morning. \n United is \"within their rights to take someone off the plane, but this problem is totally the creation of United,\" said Charles Leocha, a passenger-rights advocate in Washington. \"For them to wait after the (passengers) boarded before they say, 'Sorry, you have to get off'\" is inexcusable. \n The online storm began immediately after the first video was posted online. Memes mocking United sprouted like flight delays during a thunderstorm. Some jokers created images of a bat-wielding villain from \"The Walking Dead\" patrolling the aisle on a United plane. \n Munoz, who just last month was named PR Week's \"Communicator of the Year,\" was vilified. \n On ABC, comedian Jimmy Kimmel launched his show with a five-minute takedown of United, mocking Munoz for saying the airline had to \"re-accommodate\" customers \u2014 industry jargon for putting people on later flights. Kimmel showed the dragging video and likened the man's \"re-accommodation\" to the capture and extradition of Mexican drug lord El Chapo. \n \"That is such sanitized, say-nothing, take-no-responsibility, corporate BS speak,\" Kimmel said. \n Munoz is a former railroad CEO who took the top job at United in September 2015 but was sidelined for months by a heart attack and transplant. After returning, Munoz set out to improve an airline that had lagged behind its rivals financially and disappointed passengers with computer outages and canceled flights. \n United has made progress at repairing labor relations and is rebuilding its route network. Still, United ranked eighth out of the 12 biggest U.S. airlines \u2014 behind Delta, JetBlue and Southwest among others \u2014 in 2016 on-time performance, customer complaints and other measures. \n The stock of parent United Continental Holdings Inc. plunged 4.4 percent this morning but recovered and closed down 81 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $70.71. \n Richard Levick, a crisis-PR consultant in Washington, said Munoz and his airline responded poorly once the story dominated social media, just as they seemed to do during the leggings incident. \n \"It doesn't matter if United Airlines followed their rules,\" Levick said. \"They are really beginning to become the brand that people think we should not fly.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "United faces public-relations fiasco over dragged passenger"}

He didn't specify North Korea, but the context was clear enough. \n \"If you violate international agreements, if you fail to live up to commitments, if you become a threat to others, at some point a response is likely to be undertaken,\" Tillerson told ABC's \"This Week.\" \n Pyongyang is always extremely sensitive to the annual U.S.-South Korea war games, which it sees as an invasion rehearsal, and justifies its nuclear weapons as defensive in nature. It has significantly turned up the volume of its rhetoric that war could be on the horizon if it sees any signs of aggression from south of the Demilitarized Zone. \n \"This goes to prove that the U.S. reckless moves for invading the DPRK have reached a serious phase of its scenario,\" the North's statement said, referring to the country by its formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. \"If the U.S. dares opt for a military action, crying out for 'pre-emptive attack' \u2026 the DPRK is ready to react to any mode of war desired by the U.S.\" \n In Washington, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump has been very clear that it's \"not tolerable\" for North Korea to have nuclear-armed missiles. \n \"The last thing we want to see is a nuclear North Korea that threatens the coast of the United States, or, for that matter, any other country, or any other set of human beings,\" Spicer said at the news briefing today. \n Trump spoke last week with China's President Xi Jinping about the \"shared national interest\" in stopping its close ally, North Korea, from having nuclear capabilities, Spicer said, adding that it would be helpful if China was more outspoken on the matter. \n \"He would welcome President Xi weighing in on this a little bit more,\" Spicer said. \n Earlier today, Trump also said that he tried to persuade Xi to put pressure on North Korea in exchange for a good trade deal with the U.S. \n \"I explained to the President of China that a trade deal with the U.S. will be far better for them if they solve the North Korean problem!\" Trump tweeted. \n In a second tweet he wrote: \"North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them!

Initial reports from state media said the meeting went through domestic issues, with Premier Pak Pong Ju making a speech about the latest five-year economic plan, which was announced last year. Another closely watched category on the official agenda is organizational issues, which can mean new appointments to senior positions. \n Like other attendees, Kim Jong Un was shown on the North Korean news late today holding up his assembly membership card to vote on state business. \n This year's meeting kicks off what are expected to be major celebrations, including a large-scale military parade and fireworks, to mark the 105th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's first leader and \"eternal president,\" and Kim Jong Un's late grandfather. \n Though the details of the April 15 anniversary \u2014 known as the \"Day of the Sun\" \u2014 have not been officially confirmed, Pyongyang residents have been out every day diligently practicing in the city's squares and parks for the mass event. \n The North Korean parliament is often dismissed as rubberstamp because it tends to approve, rather than formulate, policies and laws, but its role is a bit more complex than the facade and spectacle presented to the nation by state-run media. \n For one thing, the regularity of its meetings \u2014 it usually meets once or twice a year \u2014 is, in itself, a sign of stability. \n \"The SPA gatherings completely undercut any analysis or prognostications that the country is going to collapse.

{"date": "April 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer talked to the media during the daily press briefing at the White House in Washington today. Spicer discussed Syria, Trump's 2016 tax returns, the Easter Egg Roll and other topics. \n WASHINGTON >> White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer apologized today for making an \"inappropriate and insensitive\" comparison to the Holocaust in earlier comments about Syrian President Bashar Assad's use of chemical weapons \u2014 remarks that drew instant rebuke from Jewish groups and critics. \n Spicer said in an interview with CNN that he was trying to make a point about Assad's use of chemical weapons and gas against his people but \"mistakenly made an inappropriate and insensitive reference to the Holocaust, for which there is no comparison. And for that I apologize. It was a mistake to do that.\" \n During the daily White House briefing, Spicer told reporters that Adolf Hitler \"didn't even sink to using chemical weapons.\" Critics noted the remark ignored Hitler's use of gas chambers to exterminate Jews during the Holocaust. \n It was the second day in a row in which Spicer, President Donald Trump's main spokesman, appeared to struggle to articulate the president's foreign policy at a critical time. The White House generated criticism at the start of the year when a statement on international Holocaust Remembrance Day did not make any reference to Jews. \n In the CNN interview, Spicer said his comments did not reflect Trump's views. \"My comments today did not reflect the president's, were a distraction from him and frankly were misstated, insensitive and wrong.\" He added, \"Obviously it was my blunder.\" \n The interview capped several attempts by the White House to clarify Spicer's statement. \n During the briefing, Spicer was asked about his initial statement but delivered a garbled defense of his remarks in which he tried to differentiate between Hitler's actions and the gas attack on Syrian civilians last week. The attack in northern Syria left nearly 90 people dead, and Turkey's health minister said tests show sarin gas was used. \n \"I think when you come to sarin gas, there was no, he (Hitler) was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing,\" Spicer said. \"There was clearly \u2026 I understand your point, thank you. There was not \u2026 He brought them into the Holocaust center I understand that.\" \n \"I appreciate the clarification. That was not the intent,\" he said. \n The comparison to World War II appeared to be part of a message the administration was trying to deliver as it explains its tactics in Syria. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis noted in a separate briefing that \"the intent was to stop the cycle of violence into an area that even in World War II chemical weapons were not used on battlefields.\" \n After the briefing, Spicer emailed a statement to reporters: \"In no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust. I was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers. Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable.\" \n Democrats and Jewish organizations condemned the comments. \n Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said on Twitter he found \"nothing funny about the Press Secretary bungling holocaust history. Because I'm not sure they should get the benefit of the doubt.\" \n House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California said in a statement that Spicer was \"downplaying the horror of the Holocaust\" and should be fired. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said on Twitter, \"Someone get @PressSec a refresher history course on Hitler stat (hashtag)#Icantbelievehereallysaidthat.\" \n The New York-based Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect called on Trump to fire Spicer, saying he denied that Hitler gassed Jews during the Holocaust. \n Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican from New York, said in a statement that \"as far as comments being made and comparisons of various tactics and methods between now and World War II, you can make the comparison a little differently and it would be accurate, but it's important to clear up that Hitler did in fact use chemical warfare to murder innocent people.\" \n Spicer's comments came on the first day of Passover and a day after the White House held a Seder dinner marking the emancipation of the Jewish people, a tradition started during the Obama administration. \n According to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Nazis experimented with poison gas in late 1939 with the killing of mental patients, which was termed \"euthanasia.\" Both mobile and stationary gas chambers were later used, with up to 6,000 Jews gassed each day at Auschwitz alone. \n On Monday, the White House clarified remarks Spicer made from the podium that the use of barrel bombs by Assad's government might lead to further military action by the United States. \n In an exchange with reporters, Spicer appeared to draw a new red line for the Trump administration when he told reporters that if a country gases a baby or it puts \"a barrel bomb into innocent people, I think you will see a response from this president.\" \n Until Monday the administration had maintained that last week's airstrikes were in response to the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons against its own citizens. A White House spokesman said later that \"nothing has changed in our posture\" and the president retains the option to act if it's in the national interest. \n ", "author": "By Ken Thomas & Jill Colvin Associated Press", "title": "Spicer apologizes after saying Hitler didn't use chemical weapons"}

Joe Wilson, R-S.C. stood on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Sept. 9, 2009, as President Barack Obama delivered a speech on healthcare to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington. \n GRANITEVILLE, S.C. >> The South Carolina representative who shouted \"You lie!\" at President Barack Obama during a joint session of Congress was on the receiving end of the same words in his district this week. \n U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson heard plenty of boos and chants of \"You lie!\" during a town hall Monday in Graniteville. \n Wilson drew yells from the crowd of about 200 people when he spoke about health care and violence against women. He said he supports local prosecutors in domestic violence cases, but he voted against extending the Violence Against Women Act in 2013. \n Wilson said after the town hall that he always learns a lot from a back-and-forth with constituents.

Turkey's health minister, Recep Akdag said today that test results conducted on victims of the chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun confirm that sarin gas was used. \n BEIRUT >> Turkey's health minister said today that test results confirm sarin gas was used in an attack on a northern Syrian town earlier this month and the Russian military said the Syrian government is willing to let international experts examine its military base for signs of chemical weapons. \n Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoy of the Russian General Staff said in televised remarks that Russia will provide security for international inspectors seeking to examine Syrian bases, and that Damascus has agreed to allow the inspections. His comments came shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow will appeal to the United Nations to investigate the attack on Khan Sheikhoun. \n The April 4 chemical weapons attack on the rebel-held town in Idlib province left nearly 90 people dead. The United States blamed President Bashar Assad's government and launched nearly 60 cruise missiles on Friday at the Shayrat air base in the central province of Homs, where it claims the attack originated. \n Moscow, which is a strong backer of the Syrian government, has dismissed suggestions that the Damascus could be behind the attack. The Syrian government also denied the allegation, saying its air force bombed a rebel arsenal that had chemical weapons stored inside. \n Putin told reporters today that Russia would appeal to a U.N. agency in the Hague, urging it to launch an official probe. The Russian president also said Moscow has received intelligence about planned \"provocations\" using chemical weapons that would be used to pin the blame on the Syrian government. \n The Russian statements came as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in Moscow where he will meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday. \n In Turkey, a main backer of the Syrian opposition, Health Minister Recep Akdag said test results conducted on victims of the Khan Sheikhoun attack confirm that sarin gas was used. Akdag said that blood and urine samples taken from the victims confirmed that they were subjected to the nerve agent. His comments were reported by the state-run Anadolu news agency. \n Turkey last week conducted autopsies on three victims of the gas attack who were brought from Syria. Officials from the World Health Organization and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons participated in the autopsies. \n In Damascus, a Syrian official said Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem will visit Russia on Thursday where he will meet officials in Moscow. \n The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said today that there might be a three-way meeting later this week in Moscow between officials from Russia, Syria and Iran. \n Syrian government forces battling insurgents in Daraa have dropped several barrel bombs on the southern city, opposition activists said today, a day after the White House suggested that the use of the crude explosive devices could bring a U.S. response. \n Russia's Defense Ministry meanwhile said two of its army officers were killed and a third seriously wounded in a mortar attack in Syria, without specifying when or where it took place. Russia has been waging an air campaign in support of Syrian forces since 2015. \n The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the fighting in Daraa erupted Monday when rebels attacked a government-held area in the city center. It said 16 pro-government fighters, including an army colonel, have been killed. \n Both the Observatory and Daraa-based activist Ahmad al-Masalmeh said warplanes carried out raids on Daraa while helicopter gunships dropped at least 14 barrels loaded with explosives. \n White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Monday that the use of barrel bombs, which government forces have repeatedly employed throughout the six-year-old conflict, might prompt a U.S. retaliation. \n A Syrian official, meanwhile, said residents will begin evacuating two besieged areas in northwestern Syria on Wednesday, in the latest population transfer arranged by the warring sides. \n Hakim Baghdadi said authorities have prepared 100 buses to move 5,000 people out of the Shiite villages of Foua and Kfarya. Baghdadi, a member of the relief committee for the two villages, said they will be bused first to the nearby city of Aleppo, then on to other destinations. \n The predominantly Shiite villages have remained loyal to the Syrian government while the rest of the surrounding Idlib Province has fallen under the rule of hard-line Sunni rebels. \n The rebel commander in charge of two opposition-held towns in western Syria says evacuations will also begin from his districts tomorrow. The commander, who goes by the name Abu Adnan al-Zabadani, said residents and fighters electing to leave will be bused out of Madaya and Zabadani on Wednesday, before the towns are returned to government control. \n An arrangement between the government and rebels has linked the fate of the four besieged towns since 2015. The U.N. has decried the arrangement, saying it has served to obstruct the provision of badly needed assistance. \n Associated Press writers Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow, Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey and Albert Aji in Damascus, Syria contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Turkey: Autopsies show sarin gas used against Syrian town"}

It's in the upper atmosphere and much cooler than the hot surroundings, thus the name Great Cold Spot. And unlike the giant planet's familiar Great Red Spot, this newly discovered weather system is continually changing in shape and size.

{"date": "April 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived for the meeting of Foreign Ministers of the G7 countries in Lucca, Italy, Monday. \n MOSCOW >> U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in Moscow today with an ultimatum for Russia: Side with the U.S. and likeminded countries on Syria, or embrace Iran, militant group Hezbollah and embattled Syrian leader Bashar Assad. \n It wasn't clear what the punishment would be for a Russian government that has used its military might to help Assad and his array of allies score a series of battlefield successes in their six-year war with Syrian opposition groups. \n Russian President Vladimir Putin immediately showed that he wouldn't back down, saying Russia knew about planned \"provocations\" to blame Syria's government for using chemical weapons. He said the U.N. should first investigate the attack. \n \"It reminds me of the events in 2003 when U.S. envoys to the Security Council were demonstrating what they said were chemical weapons found in Iraq,\" Putin told reporters today. \"We have seen it all already.\" \n Tillerson is in Moscow to meet with Russian officials about the Syria civil war. It is the first official trip to Russia by a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet. It's unclear if Putin and Tillerson will meet. \n Before heading to Russia, Tillerson told reporters that Moscow had either failed to take seriously its obligation to rid Syria of chemical weapons, or had been incompetent. But, he said, the distinction \"doesn't much matter to the dead.\" \n His trip follows Monday's claim by a senior U.S. official that Washington has concluded Russia knew in advance of Syria's chemical weapons attack. The official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters and demanded anonymity, didn't offer concrete proof and others in the Trump administration cautioned that no final determination of Russia's foreknowledge had been made. \n \"We cannot let this happen again,\" Tillerson said of the chemical attack. \n \"We want to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people. Russia can be a part of that future and play an important role,\" Tillerson added in remarks to reporters. \"Or Russia can maintain its alliance\" with Syria and Iran. \n Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement that it hoped for \"productive talks.\" It said the outcome of the discussions is important not only for the U.S.-Russian relationship, but \"for the overall atmosphere on the world stage.\" \n The trade of accusations followed a long-set pattern for Syria's civil war. Under President Barack Obama, the United States accused Russia of supporting Assad in war crimes against civilians and of employing a sophisticated disinformation campaign to protect its ally. Assad and Russia have accused the U.S. of supporting terrorist groups, who've staged atrocities to gain international sympathy for their cause. \n There was one key difference: After the recent launch of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles on a Syrian air base, President Donald Trump can now offer each a credible threat that the U.S. will use force in Syria if the stalemate persists. \n The Trump administration, however, has offered mixed messages about whether Assad must surrender power \u2014 and when. Tillerson said it was clear the U.S. saw no role for Assad in Syria's future, given that he had lost legitimacy. \n \"It is clear to all of us that the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end,\" he said. \"But the question of how that ends and the transition itself could be very important in our view to the durability, the stability inside of a unified Syria.\" \n Such clarity on Assad's future isn't shared by Russia, which insists that Syria's leadership cannot be a matter for outside powers. \n Tillerson said Russian-sponsored cease-fire talks could generate momentum toward broader talks about a political transition \u2014 if they create a durable cease-fire. The idea is for political talks to follow, but Tillerson acknowledged the lack of progress so far. \n Tillerson spoke after a meeting of the \"likeminded\" countries was hastily arranged on the sidelines of the summit of the Group of Seven industrialized economies in Italy. \n A key focus since the chemical attack has been on increasing pressure on Russia, Assad's strongest ally, which has used its own military to keep Assad in power. The U.S. and others have said that Russia bears responsibility for the deaths of civilians at the hands of Assad given Moscow's role in guaranteeing the 2013 deal in which Assad was supposed to have given up his chemical weapons arsenal. \n That accusation will hang over Tillerson's visit to Moscow, where he plans with meet with Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and possibly with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin declined to say if Putin would meet Tillerson. \n The United States has sought to minimize expectations for the trip or the likelihood that the U.S. will leave with any Russian concessions on Syria. Instead, the U.S. is hoping to use the visit \u2014 the first by a Trump Cabinet official to Russia \u2014 to convey expectations to Moscow and allow Russians time to respond. \n Though intended to punish Assad for a chemical weapons attack, the U.S. strikes last week also served to refocus the world's attention on the bloody war in Syria. In Italy, diplomats spoke of possible new sanctions on Syria's and Russia's militaries, and additional U.S. military action if Assad's forces continue attacking civilians. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S., Russia jab over Syria before diplomatic talks in Moscow"}

{"date": "April 11, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Feb. 27, 2017, photo an F-15E Strike Eagle from Seymour Johnson AFB in North Carolina flies out of the nicknamed Star Wars Canyon turning toward the Panamint range over Death Valley National Park, Calif. \n DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. >> Silence and stillness settled over the deep, sunbaked gorge as a pair of photographers sat on a cliff, waiting. \n Then the rumbling started. As it grew louder, they scrambled into position. \n Within seconds, a thunderous roar reverberated from the steep, narrow canyon as an F-18 fighter jet streaked through it, passing beneath their feet. It came so close they could see the pilots' expressions. \n This deafening show that was over in a flash is a fairly common sight at Death Valley National Park, 260 miles (415 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, where U.S. and foreign militaries train pilots and test jets in the gorge nicknamed Star Wars Canyon. \n Photographers \u2014 some capturing images for work, others for fun \u2014 along with aviation enthusiasts and others have been traipsing to the remote 4,688-square-mile (12,142-square-kilometer) park in growing numbers to see the jets soaring below the rim of what's officially called Rainbow Canyon, near the park's western entrance. \n It earned its nickname because its mineral-rich soil and rocky walls in shades of red, gray and pink draw to mind a landscape in a galaxy far, far away \u2014 Tatooine, the home planet of \"Star Wars\" character Luke Skywalker. \n The unusually close-up view of military planes zooming through the craggy gorge has become so popular the National Park Service is considering making it an attraction, with informational signs about the training that dates back to World War II. \n Park Service officials recently discussed erecting signs and possibly paving a spot for cars because so many people are driving to the canyon to see the training, park spokeswoman Abby Wines said. \n Wines understands the rush people get from seeing the jets up close. Once she was doing technical canyoneering, hanging from a rope on a 180-foot vertical, when a jet roared over her head but below the canyon rim. \n \"It's the loudest thing I have ever heard in my life,\" she said. \"It was a scary experience since I was holding onto the rope and not anything else.\" She also felt a sense of awe. \n But on days when one jet passes after another, the noise gets to her. \n Elsewhere in the park, the jets also have made it tough when performing the living history show at Scotty's Castle, a Spanish mission-style villa reflecting early California architecture. The villa recently closed until further notice because of flood damage. But when it was open, it was \"disruptive to act like it is 1939 while two military jets are circling, pretending to be in a dogfight above your head,\" Wines said. \n On a February day, planes careened through Star Wars Canyon 18 times. One pilot performed barrel rolls over the pass. \n Jets zip through the gorge at 200 to 300 mph (322 to 483 kph) and can fly as low as 200 feet from the canyon floor. But the canyon's walls are so steep, the aircraft are still several hundred feet below the rim. \n Training at the canyon doesn't happen every day, so the photographers who make the trek to see them sometimes sit in folding chairs, waiting in the heat, and spy no jets at all. \n Jason Watson, who works in information technology at Stanford University's law school and does freelance photography, recently made his seventh trip to the gorge. \n He's seen as many as 30 photographers spread out across the mile-long rim at different vantage points. \n \"You can meet anyone from anywhere in the world there,\" Watson said. \n The photographers develop a comradery as they share in the thrill of standing above the speedy jets. \n The aviators interact with them too, giving a thumbs-up or even flashing a \"Hi Mom\" sign as they whiz by. \n \"They know the photographers are there,\" Watson said. \"They're aware of the following.\" \n ___ \n Watson reported from San Diego. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Jets zip through narrow Star Wars Canyon, drawing visitors"}
