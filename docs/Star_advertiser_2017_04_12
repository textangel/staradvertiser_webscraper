{"date": "April 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Obama issued a pair of memorandums last year requiring that the government's Federal Student Aid office do more to help borrowers manage, or even discharge, their debt. But in a memorandum to the department's student aid office, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos formally withdrew the Obama memos. \n Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Tuesday rolled back an Obama administration attempt to reform how student loan servicers collect debt. \n Obama issued a pair of memorandums last year requiring that the government's Federal Student Aid office, which services $1.1 trillion in government-owned student loans, do more to help borrowers manage, or even discharge, their debt. But in a memorandum to the department's student aid office, DeVos formally withdrew the Obama memos. \n The previous administration's approach, DeVos said, was inconsistent and full of shortcomings. She didn't detail how the moves fell short, and her spokesmen, Jim Bradshaw and Matthew Frendewey, didn't respond to requests for comment. \n DeVos's move comes a week after one of the student loan industry's main lobbies asked for Congress's help in delaying or substantially changing the Education Department's loan servicing plans. In a pair of April 4 letters to leaders of the House and Senate appropriations committees, the National Council of Higher Education Resources said there were too many unanswered questions, including whether the Obama administration's approach would be unnecessarily expensive. \n A recent epidemic of student loan defaults and what authorities describe as systematic mistreatment of borrowers prompted the Obama administration, in its waning days, to force the FSA office to emphasize how debtors are treated, rather than maximize the amount of cash they can stump up to meet their obligations. \n Obama's team also sought to reduce the possibility that new contracts would be given to companies that mislead or otherwise harm debtors. The current round of contracts will terminate in 2019, and among three finalists for a new contract is Navient Corp. In January, state attorneys general in Illinois and Washington, along with the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, sued Navient over allegations the company abused borrowers by taking shortcuts to boost its own bottom line. Navient has denied the allegations. \n The withdrawal of the Obama administration guidelines could make Navient a more likely contender for that contract, government officials said. Navient shares moved higher after the government released DeVos's decision around 11:30 a.m. New York time. Navient stock ended up almost 2 percent. \n The Obama administration vision for how federal loans would be serviced almost certainly meant the feds would have to increase how much they pay loan contractors to collect monthly payments from borrowers and counsel them on repayment options. Already, the government annually spends around $800 million to collect on almost $1.1 trillion of debt. DeVos, however, made clear that her department would focus on curbing costs. \n \"We must create a student loan servicing environment that provides the highest quality customer service and increases accountability and transparency for all borrowers, while also limiting the cost to taxpayers,\" DeVos said. \n With her memo, DeVos has taken control of the complex and widely derided system in which the federal government collects monthly payments from tens of millions of Americans with government-owned student loans. The CFPB said in 2015 that the manner in which student loans are collected has been marred by \"widespread failures.\" \n DeVos's move \"will certainly increase the likelihood of default,\" said David Bergeron, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank with close ties to Democrats. Bergeron worked under Democratic and Republican administrations over more than 30 years at the Education Department. He retired as the head of postsecondary education. \n During Obama's eight years in office, some 8.7 million Americans defaulted on their student loans, for a rate of one default roughly every 29 seconds. \n Former Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin worked on student loan policy during the latter years of the Obama administration, in part over concern that borrowers' struggles were affecting the management of U.S. debt. DeVos's decision to reverse some of her work \"with no coherent explanation or substitute\" effectively means that the Trump administration is placing the welfare of loan contractors above those of student debtors, she said. \n In a statement Tuesday, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, who is suing Navient, agreed: \"The Department of Education has decided it does not need to protect student loan borrowers.\" \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "DeVos undoes Obama student loan protections"}

{"date": "April 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Mary Beth Nerone, a former middle-school teacher from Rochester, N.Y., shows materials from her online store, in New York. After losing her job as a language arts teacher to budget cuts three years ago, Nerone began stocking the store with writing, poetry and other curricula exercises she created for other teachers to purchase. \n Miss Kindergarten is in the million-dollar club. So are Lovin Lit, the Moffatt Girls and about a dozen other teacher-entrepreneurs who are spinning reading, math, science and social studies into gold by selling their lesson plans online to fellow teachers around the world. \n Despite worries from some educators, such online marketplaces are booming, driven by rising standards and the willingness of teachers to pay out of their own pockets for classroom-tested materials. \n \"I am so thankful and blessed that it came into my life and that my passion and career can kind of mesh into one,\" says Miss Kindergarten, aka 32-year-old Hadar Hartstein, of Lake Forest, California, who says she has earned more than $1 million in sales over the past six years, enough to take this year and maybe the next few off from her teaching job to be with her newborn daughter. \n Her more than 300 offerings on the popular Teachers Pay Teachers site range from free alphabet flash cards and a $1.50 Popsicle party counting activity to a $120 full-year unit on math and literacy, all of them widely promoted on her blog and social media accounts. \n \"You definitely have to look at it as another full-time job,\" she says. \"You have to put a lot of effort into it.\" \n Teachers Pay Teachers contends that it hit a milestone last year, when its 80,000 contributors earned more than $100 million, and that at least a dozen have become millionaires since the site launched a decade ago. Other major sites including Teachwise and Teacher's Notebook, and recently such corporate players as Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and Amazon, have launched sites of their own. \n But some educators worry the increasing monetizing of lessons will stifle the longstanding practice of teachers freely sharing their ideas. And legal experts question whether teachers actually have ownership of the lessons they are selling. \n For teachers buying the materials, however, it's a major time saver, allowing them to reclaim the nights and weekends otherwise spent starting lessons from scratch, often for no more than the price of their morning coffee. \n Ann Arbor, Michigan, middle school teacher Samantha Cucu said that when she first started teaching three years ago, she created her own materials but was swayed by colleagues who made a compelling argument: \"Why are you reinventing the wheel?\" \n She has since bought about 120 resources and gotten 132 others from Teachers Pay Teachers' free offerings. \n \"Sometimes they're super-easy small purchases, like $1.20 here, $2.50 there, and sometimes they're larger. I try not to spend over $15,\" says Cucu who estimated that her prep time for school plummets from 20 to 30 hours a week to two hours if she can find what she needs online. \n \"It's huge,\" says Cucu, who has a year-old baby. \n At Teachers Pay Teachers, teachers set their own prices for 2.5 million resources and give a commission to the site. With a $59.95 premium membership, the commission is 15 percent. With a free basic membership, it's 40 percent. \n \"My first sale was 80 cents. It was the best 80 cents I've made in my entire life!\" says Mary Beth Nerone, who has been stocking her online store, Brain Waves Instruction, on the site with writing, poetry and other exercises for three years after budget cuts eliminated her job as a middle-school language arts teacher near Rochester, New York. \n \"Some people are psyched and say I get Starbucks money each week \u2026 some people get to a space where they can meet or surpass their teaching income,\" Nerone says. \"And some people get to a space beyond their wildest dreams of income.\" \n Teachers trust and support other teachers, says Hanna Hudson, editorial director of the We Are Teachers online bulletin board, and accessing individual resources from the web is less expensive and easier than going to the district for new textbooks or resources. \n \"Honestly, it's going after the money that teachers are spending out of their own pockets on their classroom,\" Hudson says. \n But Bob Farrace, spokesman for the National Association of Secondary School Principals, says taking \"proprietary rights over ideas and lessons\" could disrupt the traditional collaborative atmosphere of schools. \"You want teachers to collaborate and share ideas freely.\" \n In fact, some school districts have language in their teaching contracts that bar teachers from selling their lesson plans. \n Some legal experts argue that the resources teachers produce while working for a school district may actually be the property of the school district. \n Mark Bartholomew, who teaches copyright law at the University at Buffalo, says that without explicit contract language, the law looks at factors such as whether products were created within the scope of employment or on a person's own time. \n A federal court in New York sided with the Cherry Valley-Springfield school district in 2004 after a suspended teacher tried to claim ownership of tests, quizzes and homework problems left behind in his classroom that he said were prepared outside normal hours. The U.S. Court of Appeals agreed the district owned the materials because the teacher made them for his job. \n \"I never created anything that I was selling while in the classroom,\" says \"Miss Kindergarten\" Hartstein. \"As a kindergarten teacher, I rarely even had time to sit down and take a breath.\" \n Hartstein says she never looked at selling lessons as a path to riches but as a way for others to learn and benefit from her experience. \n \"If a teacher is already making a resource for her students and it's super successful in her classroom, then why not post it for other students to use? And if you make something off of it, awesome.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Million-dollar teachers: Cashing in by selling their lessons"}

{"date": "April 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump returns a salute as he steps off Marine One helicopter during his arrival on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Sunday. \n WASHINGTON >> Nearly three months into office, President Donald Trump has dropped much of his unorthodox campaign rhetoric on foreign policy and embraced a much more establishment view that in many ways doesn't differ much from his Democratic predecessor. \n At a news conference on Wednesday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose country he had once called an \"economic enemy.\" He blasted Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time after he'd long been accused of being too friendly with him. He labeled Syrian President Bashar Assad a \"butcher,\" a week after ordering a military strike that he once criticized Barack Obama for contemplating. \n And he said he was 100 percent behind NATO, the military alliance created in 1949 that he has previously called \"obsolete.\" \n After his news conference with the NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at the White House, even one-time critics couldn't help notice the change. \n \"What we may be seeing is a re-centering of this administration,\" Nicholas Burns, a former ambassador to NATO and undersecretary of state, said on MSNBC. \n Perhaps most surprising was Trump's complete reversal regarding China, which he once accused of \"raping\" the United States and made the villain of much of his tough talk on trade during the campaign. He promised to heavily tax Chinese goods coming into the country. Less than two weeks ago, he called them the \"world champions\" of currency manipulation. Just last week, Trump braced for what he called \"a difficult\" meeting with Xi. \n But on Wednesday, Trump had little but praise for China and its leader. He said that he and Xi \"had a very good bonding\" during their two days of meetings last week at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, and he praised China for abstaining during a U.N. vote earlier in the day on a resolution on Syria that Russia vetoed. \n \"I think it's wonderful that they abstained,\" Trump said. \n In a separate interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump also withdrew his pledge to label China a currency manipulator, a campaign promise that he said he would fulfill on his first day in office. \n \"They're not currency manipulators,\" Trump said, according to the Journal account. \n Trump said he changed his mind for two reasons: because China had not manipulated its yuan for months and slapping the label on China could hurt negotiations with Xi on how to curb the nuclear threat from North Korea. \n \"President Xi wants to do the right thing,\" Trump said at his news conference. \"I think we had a very good chemistry together.\" \n Trump said he spoke with Xi Tuesday night ahead of the U.N. vote and suggested that Xi told him then that China would abstain on the Security Council resolution, which would have put the body on record as condemning last week's chemical attack had Russia not vetoed it. \n \"As you know, very few people expected that. And, no, I was not surprised that China did abstain,\" Trump said. \n A senior administration official with knowledge of Xi's Florida visit agreed that Trump and Xi's talks last week had gone a long way toward smoothing U.S.-China relations. The official said Xi had a chance to meet Trump's extended family, including his grandchildren, which had \"a big effect on their relationship.\" \n Trump, who four years ago tweeted \"We should stay the hell out of Syria,\" said his \"attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much\" since the chemical weapons attack on Khan Sheikhoun, a Syrian town were at least 86 people died from what U.S. officials say was an attack with Sarin gas. After what White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer called a \"72-hour evolution,\" Trump ordered U.S. forces to fire a barrage of 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase in retaliation for the attack. \n The cruise missile barrage came just days after both Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley signaled that the Trump administration was open to Assad staying in power. In the days since, Trump administration commentary on Syria sounded much like that of the Obama administration, which called for Assad to step down and for Russia to drop its support. \n In Moscow Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov slammed the Trump administration's foreign policy as \"ambiguous and contradictory\" while NATO's Stoltenberg praised it. \"The very strong and clear message from President Trump has been very helpful,\" Stoltenberg said. \n Trump also changed his tune on NATO after rattling members of the 28-member military alliance by calling it \"obsolete,\" and threatening to tell countries that don't spend at least 2 percent of their economic output on defense \"Congratulations, you'll be defending yourself.\" \n On Wednesday, the president was back to the usual lines of his predecessors, reaffirming his commitment to the alliance and \"the enduring values that we proudly share.\" \n Trump praised the \"very productive discussion\" with Stoltenberg about what NATO can do in the fight against terrorism. \n \"I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete,\" he said about the alliance. \n Even through allegations of Russian cyberhacking and election manipulation, until recently Trump steadfastly advocated for warmer relations with Russia and expressed admiration for Putin's leadership. \n \"Great move on delay (by Putin) \u2014 I always knew he was very smart!\" he tweeted in December, after the Russian president decided not to expel U.S. diplomats in response to Obama's sanctions after alleged cyberattacks. \n \"Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only 'stupid' people, or fools, would think that it is bad!\" he tweeted a few weeks before his inauguration. \"When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!\" \n By Wednesday, U.S.-Russia relations seemed to be in a deep freeze. \n \"One could say that the level of trust on a working level, especially on the military level, has not improved but has rather deteriorated,\" Putin said in an interview on Russian television on Wednesday. \n Trump agreed. \n \"Right now we're not getting along with Russia at all,\" he said at Wednesday's news conference, echoing remarks made by Tillerson in Moscow. \"We may be at an all-time low in terms of relationship with Russia.\" \n ", "author": "McClatchy Washington Bureau", "title": "Trump warms to China and NATO as his foreign policy campaign pledges fall"}

{"date": "April 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Congressman Mike Coffman, R-Colo., makes a point during a debate with his opponent for Colorado's 6th Congressional District seat, Democrat Morgan Carroll, at a Spanish language television station in October in Denver. \n DENVER >> It was one of the most exclusive tickets in town: Only 800 were made available, and those lucky enough to score one had to show photo ID at the gate, where they were issued a wristband and a number. No signs bigger than a sheet of notebook paper were allowed, so as not to obscure anyone's view. \n The rules weren't for a rock concert but for a town hall meeting this evening between Republican Rep. Mike Coffman and his suburban Denver constituents. \n Town halls have become a risky proposition for GOP members of Congress since President Donald Trump's election. Liberal groups and constituents angry about the Trump agenda have flooded public meetings, asking their representatives tough questions, chanting, heckling them and even shouting them down in skirmishes that have made for embarrassing online video. \n On Monday, for example, South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson, who became infamous for yelling \"You lie!\" at President Barack Obama during a speech to Congress in 2009, was himself confronted at a town hall by constituents chanting, \"You lie!\" \n As a result, some Republicans aren't holding town halls. And some of those who are going ahead with such events are taking steps to keep things from getting out of control. \n In Texas, Rep. John Culberson barred signs and noisemakers from a March 24 town hall, required those attending to prove they were constituents by showing utility bills or other documents, and insisted that questions be submitted in advance. He was still shouted down repeatedly by a crowd angry about the GOP push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \n In Arkansas, Rep. French Hill will hold his first town hall of the year on Monday \u2014 but in the middle of the afternoon, and with the state's Republican junior senator, Tom Cotton, at his side. Nevada's Dean Heller, one of the more vulnerable GOP senators in 2018, will also hold his first town hall of 2017 on Monday, in the morning. And he, too, is apparently seeking safety in numbers by including Republican Rep. Mark Amodei. \n Democrats, for their part, have felt the heat from anti-Trump constituents at town halls and are also taking precautions. Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California, for example, is banning signs at her town hall in Los Angeles next week. \n Coffman is a politician perennially in the hot seat. His swing district has slightly more Democrats than Republicans, and he is always a top target in elections. For years, he has avoided town halls, instead holding private, one-on-one meetings with constituents during \"office hours\" at libraries in his district. \n In January, one of those events was flooded by hundreds of constituents and activists who filled the library lobby, sang, chanted and demanded Coffman emerge from his private conversations to address them. The congressman ended up slipping out the back. \n One of the rules for his town hall today was no standing in the aisles or blocking entrances and exits. \n The contentious town hall was moderated by a local radio host Steffan Tubbs who voted for Coffman and urged hecklers to \"respect the guidelines.\" Coffman earned some cheers when he spoke of his support for rights for gays and immigrants. \n But he also got a fair amount of scorn from those who contended he was not standing up enough to Trump. \n \"When I disagree with the president, I will speak out,\" Coffman said in response to a pointed question about his support for Trump-backed legislation. \"But I'm not going to do it every day\u2026. Those of you on the extreme left will never be satisfied until Trump\" leaves office. \n Smadar Belkind Gerson, an activist in Coffman's district who was helping to organize protests outside the town hall, said that she was glad Coffman moved to a more open format but that he has a long way to go. The event, she noted, was scheduled to last only an hour \u2014 though Coffman stayed for nearly a second hour \u2014 and Coffman's staff planned to draw numbers to determine which constituent could ask questions. \n \"Yes, people are upset,\" Gerson said. \"But the more you do this and the more you restrict people, the more they will be upset.\" \n She noted that a Democratic state lawmaker who may challenge Coffman in 2018 planned to hold a town hall on the same campus this evening with no restrictions on attendance or questions. \n Coffman held two town halls via telephone before today's in-person event. Those appearances are far more controlled, with questions submitted in advance and an operator cutting off the questioner so the politician can respond. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lawmakers try to keep town halls from getting out of control"}

{"date": "April 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n From left, White House Senior Counselor for Economic Initiatives Dina Powell, President Donald Trump's White House Senior Adviser Steve Bannon, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, and President Donald Trump's Chief of Staff Reince Priebus attend a news conference with President Donald Trump and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the East Room at the White House today. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump has declared: \"I am my own strategist.\" That would seem to bode poorly for his actual strategist, Steve Bannon. \n And Trump now appears to be publicly distancing himself. \n In an interview with The New York Post, the president said \"I like Steve\" and called his adviser \"a good guy\" \u2014 but one who wasn't really all that involved with his winning election campaign. He said his warring senior officials, including Bannon, must \"straighten it out or I will.\" In a second interview with The Wall Street Journal, he dismissively called Bannon \"a guy who works for me.\" \n The unusual public, lukewarm support from the boss has Bannon's friends and advisers worried he will soon be out of a job. But shedding Bannon would be no simple staff shake-up. More than any other member of Trump's orbit, the former media executive and radio host, known as a bare-knuckle political fighter, has a following all his own. He is viewed by many in the conservative core as the ideological backbone in a White House run by a president who boasts of his flexibility. \n \"I think it's important to recognize the value of the base. It's important to recognize the base sees their advocate in Steve Bannon,\" said Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign adviser who has known the president for decades. \n Bannon is not the only Trump official to find himself in the hot seat in a White House divided. Press Secretary Sean Spicer has also come under fire for comments he made about the Holocaust on Tuesday. Spicer has apologized repeatedly, including today, and the White House hopes that controversy will pass. \n As for Bannon, before joining the campaign last summer as its chief executive officer, he was informally advising Trump. And as leader of the conservative Breitbart News he spent the better part of a year connecting Trump with the populist, nationalist voters who would propel him to victory over 16 Republican opponents and Democrat Hillary Clinton. \n In more than half a dozen interviews during the campaign with Bannon on Breitbart's radio show, Trump laid out his vision for leading the country, with Bannon sometimes playing the role of coach. \n Bannon, more than any other White House aide, speaks the language of Trump's populist base. He spoke in February of \"our sovereignty\" as a country and about the new administration's aim for \"deconstruction of the administrative state.\" He also helped write many of Trump's hardest-line speeches. \n \"It would be a terrible signal if Trump were to either force Bannon out or let him go because he is the face of the national populism that inspired a lot of voter to vote for Trump,\" said Ned Ryun, founder of the conservative group American Majority and a longtime friend of Bannon's. \n \"And what makes it even worse right now,\" Ryun added, \"is that people have deep concerns about liberal New York Democrats associated with Goldman Sachs coming in and making strong moves at the White House.\" \n That view cuts to the core of why Bannon might be on the outs at the White House. \n He's feuded with Trump's son-in-law-turned-senior-adviser, Jared Kushner, and with economic chief Gary Cohn. Both are New Yorkers who have voted for Democrats. Cohn, the former No. 2 at Goldman Sachs, and fellow Goldman executive Dina Powell, one of Trump's top national security advisers, have been gaining favor with the president. \n Last week, Trump removed Bannon from the National Security Council, while Powell appears to be ascendant. \n The president's irritation with Bannon could have roots in the adviser's high profile in the early days of the administration. Democrats waged a campaign to brand him as \"President Bannon.\" He appeared on Time magazine's cover and was portrayed on \"Saturday Night Live\" as the Grim Reaper pulling the president's strings. \n Recently, the president has undercut Bannon in front of other senior staffers, including questioning the need for his presence in certain White House meetings. \n Bannon is seen as increasingly isolated within the White House, particularly after the health care debacle.

Attorneys for Rolling Stone and Nicole Eramo announced this week that they reached a confidential settlement over the 2014 story \"A Rape on Campus,\" putting an end to the lengthy case stemming from the now-debunked claims. \n RICHMOND, Va. >> Rolling Stone magazine settled a University of Virginia administrator's lawsuit over its discredited story about a rape on campus, but its legal fights over the botched article aren't over. \n Attorneys for Rolling Stone and Nicole Eramo announced this week that they reached a confidential settlement over the 2014 story \"A Rape on Campus,\" putting an end to the lengthy case stemming from the now-debunked claims of a woman identified only as \"Jackie.\" \n \"We are delighted that this dispute is now behind us, as it allows Nicole to move on and focus on doing what she does best, which is supporting victims of sexual assault,\" Libby Locke, an attorney for Eramo, said in a statement. \n Rolling Stone called it an \"amicable resolution.\" \n The magazine still faces a more than $25 million lawsuit filed by the University of Virginia chapter of the fraternity where Jackie claimed she had been raped, which is scheduled to go to trial in October. A separate lawsuit from three former fraternity members was dismissed last year. \n The settlement in Eramo's case came after Rolling Stone challenged a jury's November verdict awarding the former associate dean of students $3 million. Rolling Stone asked the judge in December to overturn the jury's decision, arguing that there is no evidence reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely acted with actual malice. \n Media organizations, including The Associated Press, also urged the judge to overrule the jury's finding that Rolling Stone \"republished\" the false claims when it attached an editor's note highlighting problems with the story to an online version. Jurors said the magazine and its publisher didn't act with actual malice when the story was originally published but did when it was \"republished.\" \n The media groups said punishing Rolling Stone for trying to alert the public to problems with the story could discourage organizations from correcting errors. \n Rolling Stone and Eramo settled before the judge could rule on the issue, so the jury's verdict stands and won't be examined by an appeals court. \n \"That's the troubling thing about the settlement, is that it doesn't give an appellate court a chance to wipe out that precedent,\" said George Freeman, executive director of the Media Law Resource Center and a former attorney for The New York Times. \n Freeman said Eramo's case shows Rolling Stone has \"a propensity to settle,\" but he said it's hard to predict how the magazine's attorneys will proceed in the other matter. \n In documents recently filed in that case, Rolling Stone suggested that the fraternity is partially at fault for the article because, it claims, the fraternity was aware of problems with Jackie's account and didn't say anything before the story went to print. \n \"For had they done so, the article never would have been published,\" Rolling Stone's attorneys said. \n Attorneys for the fraternity did not immediately respond to messages. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Rolling Stone settles, but fight over rape story isn't over"}

The post ends with the punchline: \"Fly the friendly skies\u2026 this time for real.\" \n The world's biggest long-haul airline has taken a swipe at U.S. rivals before, most notably in a 2015 ad campaign that showed Jennifer Aniston being offered peanuts and a hand towel by American-accented flight attendants, before waking to find herself cosseted in the flat-bed seat of an Emirates superjumbo. \n Unfair competition \n United Continental Holdings Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and American Airlines Group have accused Emirates, Etihad Airways PJSC and Qatar of competing unfairly in global markets with the help of more than $40 billion in illegal government subsidies, something the Gulf carriers deny. \n The U.S. operators recently urged President Donald Trump to curb flying rights for their rivals. Tensions have ratcheted up further with an attempted ban on citizens of six Muslim-majority countries entering America, together with a bar on passengers carrying large electronic devices aboard U.S.-bound flights from airports in the Middle East and North Africa, including the bases of Emirates, Turkish Air, Qatar Air and Royal Jordanian. \n United's Munoz on Tuesday issued a second apology for Sunday's incident in Chicago, in which the ejected passenger, David Dao, was left bloodied and dazed, saying that \"no one should ever be mistreated this way,\" and promising a review of his airline's procedures to be completed by April 30. \n The CEO had earlier apologized only for having to re-accommodate customers, labeling Dao, who received hospital treatment, \"disruptive\" and \"belligerent.\" \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "We're Now the Friendly Skies, Emirates Tells a Red-Faced United"}

{"date": "April 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n People with Asian community organizations from Chicago hold signs to protest after Sunday's confrontation where David Dao, 69, of Elizabethtown, Ky., was removed from a United Airlines airplane by Chicago airport police at O'Hare International Airport, during rally near United's counter at the airport's Terminal 1 in Chicago on Tuesday. \n CHICAGO >> Airport police officers called to remove a passenger who refused to leave a United Express flight essentially walked into what law enforcement experts say was a no-win situation: enforcing a business decision by a private company. \n But if the passenger posed no threat and was not being disruptive, officers almost certainly could have tried an approach other than dragging him out of his seat and down the aisle, including simply telling the airline to resolve the situation itself, experts said. \n Cellphone video of the bloodied passenger, 69-year-old David Dao of Elizabethtown, Kentucky, has become a public-relations nightmare for United and led to the suspension of three police officers who worked for the Chicago Department of Aviation. \n The video also underscores a growing dilemma: From airlines to schools, police are called to deal with situations that in the past might have been handled without them, sometimes leading officers to respond with force far beyond the provocation. \n \"Police have an innate bias for action, but there are times that it's not in their best interest or that of their agency to get involved in an issue that requires you to use a high level of force,\" said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, a Washington D.C.-based research group, and former police chief in Redlands, California. \"You have to ask whether \u2026 you really needed to use force when doing the airline's bidding.\" \n In an interview with ABC's \"Good Morning America\" aired today, the chief executive of United Airlines said the carrier will no longer ask police to remove passengers from full flights. \n After passengers were already seated on the full flight, United announced that four people needed to get off to make room for employees of a partner airline. When nobody accepted the airline's offer of $800 to relinquish a seat, the airline chose four passengers at random. All but Dao agreed to leave. \n It's unclear what police were told by the airline about the situation. Screaming can be heard on the videos as Dao is dragged from his window seat and across the armrest, but he is not seen fighting with the officers. He appears relatively passive while being dragged. Later he's seen standing in the aisle saying quietly, \"I want to go home, I want to go home.\" \n But once police were aboard the plane, it would have been difficult to walk away, especially if they did not know why the passenger was asked to leave, said Kevin Murphy, executive director of the Airport Law Enforcement Agencies Network. \n \"Once you're there, it becomes tough to disengage. You have an obligation,\" Murphy said. \"If someone is saying they're staying no matter what the property owner says, you have to wonder why they want to try so hard,\" to stay \u2026 \"Is there something else going on?\" \n But police officers should try to find out what they are going into and to defuse the situation, if possible, experts said. \n Officers with the Los Angeles Airport Police do not get involved in civil matters such as business disputes between airlines and passengers. They have sometimes refused airlines' requests to board planes, said spokesman and police officer Rob Pedregon. \n \"We don't just fly into action when someone calls us,\" he said. Officers will \"basically find out the whole situation, why we're here, get the background and then decide if it's within our legal authority. We wouldn't get (someone) off just because the airline wants them off. If a law is broken, then we will take action.\" \n The Chicago Department of Aviation swiftly put the officer who removed Dao on leave, saying he had violated standard procedures and that the agency would not \"tolerate that kind of action.\" Two more officers were suspended today. Officials have refused to say what procedures should have been followed. \n The agency also said that its officers, who are not part of the Chicago Police Department, have \"limited authority to make an arrest.\" \n Officers could have asked themselves whether the airline had an option to reconsider its actions, said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a group that has called for greater restraint from police officers. But the bottom line, he said, is that the airline put the police officers in a difficult situation by expecting them \"to solve an issue that they had created.\" \n \"It was within their decision-making power to try someone else,\" Wexler said. \"The real question is, at what point did the airline think this is no longer their problem and turns this over to the police? He could not solve this issue the way the airline could.\" \n At the same time, police frequently overreact when someone defies an order, Bueermann said. \n \"They take the bait \u2026 and you dig yourself in a deeper hole,\" Bueermann said, comparing the United situation to that of a South Carolina police officer seen on cellphone video in 2015 flipping a high school student backward in her desk-chair then dragging her across the classroom after she refused to leave. \n \"Everybody reaches a limit \u2026 but police officers are paid in part to use their common sense to resolve a situation.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Experts say police who dragged passenger had other options"}

{"date": "April 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, right, listened to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, back to a camera, during their meeting in Moscow, Russia today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump listened during a news conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the East Room of the White House in Washington today. \n WASHINGTON >> With tensions rising over Syria and other issues, President Donald Trump said today that U.S. relations with Russia \"may be at an all-time low\" as he moved ever further away from his campaign promises to establish better ties with Moscow. \n \"Right now we're not getting along with Russia at all,\" Trump said flatly during a White House news conference with NATO Secretary-General Jens Soltenberg. \n It was a grim assessment that echoed the words of Trump's top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who left an almost two-hour meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow declaring the countries had reached a \"low point\" in relations. \n Trump said Tillerson had completed a successful meeting with Putin, where \"things went pretty well.\" But he said it was an open question where relations go from here. He said \"it would be a fantastic thing\" if the two nations got along better but cautioned that \"it may be just the opposite.\" \n Could Syria have launched the chemical weapons attack with Russia's advance knowledge? Trump said it was \"certainly possible\" though \"probably unlikely.\" \n The less-than-positive assessments of relations by both Trump and Tillerson reflected the former Cold War foes' inability to forge greater cooperation, as Trump until recently has advocated. \n More than 80 people were killed in what the U.S. has described as a nerve gas attack that Assad's forces undoubtedly carried out. Russia says rebels were responsible for whatever chemical agent was found, which the Trump administration calls a disinformation campaign. \n The Moscow news conference came after Putin met Tillerson for the first time since Trump took office. The diplomats know each other well from Tillerson's days as Exxon Mobil CEO. Putin had even honored Tillerson with a friendship award. \n Beyond Syria, Russia's alleged meddling in the U.S. presidential election also hovered over what was the first face-to-face encounter between Putin and any Trump administration Cabinet member. \n Lavrov blasted U.S. claims that it has \"irrefutable evidence\" of election interference. \n \"We have not seen a single fact, or even a hint of facts,\" he said. \"I do not know who saw them. No one showed us anything, no one said anything, although we repeatedly asked to produce the details on which these unfounded accusations lie.\" \n He also rejected American claims of incontrovertible evidence that Assad ordered the chemical attack. \n Still, Tillerson sought to stress the positives from his meetings. He said working groups would be established to improve U.S.-Russian ties and identify problems. He said the two sides would also discuss disagreements on Syria and how to end the country's six-year civil war. \n But such hopes appeared optimistic as the diplomats outlined their sharply diverging views on Syria. Until the chemical attack, the Trump administration had sought to step back from the U.S. position that Assad should leave power. But Tillerson repeated the administration's new belief that \"the reign of the Assad family is coming to an end.\" \n Tillerson said Syria's government had committed more than 50 attacks using chlorine or other chemical weapons over the duration of the conflict. And he suggested that possible war crimes charges could be levied against the Syrian leader. Russia has never publicly acknowledged any such attacks by Assad's forces and has tried for the past 18 months to help him expand his authority in Syria. \n The civil war is separate from the U.S.-led effort against the Islamic State group in the north of the country. \n While the most immediate U.S.-Russian dispute concerned culpability for the chemical weapons, broader disagreements over everything from Ukraine to Russia's support for once-fringe candidates in European elections were among other sore points. \n Steeped in geopolitical intrigue, the meeting between Putin and Tillerson wasn't formally confirmed until the last minute, following days of speculation about whether the Russian would refuse to grant the former oil executive an audience. Putin's decision to host Tillerson signaled Moscow's intent to maintain communication with the U.S. even as the countries bash each other publicly in louder and louder tones. \n Tillerson was greeted frostily in the Russian capital as Lavrov began their meeting today by demanding to know America's \"real intentions.\" \n \"We have seen very alarming actions recently with an unlawful attack against Syria,\" Lavrov said, referring to the 59 Tomahawk missiles Trump launched at a Syrian air base to punish Assad for using chemical weapons. \"We consider it of utmost importance to prevent the risks of replay of similar action in the future.\" \n Trump and others have indeed threatened similar action. But in a Fox Business Network interview, the U.S. president said he wouldn't intervene militarily against Assad unless the Syrian leader resorts to using weapons of mass destruction again. \"Are we going to get involved with Syria? No,\" Trump said. But, he added, \"I see them using gas \u2026 we have to do something.\" \n Only weeks ago, it appeared that Trump, who praised Putin throughout the U.S. election campaign, was poised for a potentially historic rapprochement with Russia. Any expectations of an easy rapport have crashed into reality amid the nasty back-and-forth over Syria and ongoing U.S. investigations into Russia's activity connected to the U.S. presidential election. \n Allegations of collusion between Russian officials and Trump campaign associates also have weakened Trump's ability to sweeten any offer for greater cooperation, such as by easing economic sanctions on Moscow related to its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump: U.S.-Russia relations may be at 'all-time low'"}

{"date": "April 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Then- Donald Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort talked to reporters, July 17, on the floor of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort will register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for lobbying work he did on behalf of political interests in Ukraine, led at the time by a pro-Russian political party, his spokesman said today. \n Manafort is the second Trump campaign adviser to have to register as a foreign agent since the election. The confirmation that he intends to register comes as the Trump administration has been facing heavy scrutiny over the foreign ties of former campaign advisers and other Trump associates. \n Manafort began discussions with the government about his lobbying activities after Trump hired him in March 2016, Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said, although it was unclear whether those conversations occurred before or after Trump forced Manafort to resign in August. Manafort had recently been given guidance by federal authorities related to whether he should register as a foreign agent, Maloni said. Asked by The Associated Press whether Manafort intends to register as a foreign agent, Maloni said: \"Yes, he is registering.\" \n Manafort's resignation from the campaign came immediately after the AP had reported that Manafort's consulting firm between 2012 and 2014 orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraine's ruling political party without disclosing that it was working as a foreign agent as required under federal law. \n Manafort's decision to register as a foreign agent comes about one month after former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn registered with the Justice Department for work he did that could have benefited the Turkish government. The filing came after Trump fired Flynn in February, saying that Flynn had misled administration top officials about his contacts with Russia. \n Also this week, the White House has faced questions about the influence of Carter Page, who advised the campaign on foreign policy. The Washington Post reported late Tuesday that the government obtained a secret warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act last summer to monitor Page's communications. \n The White House did not immediately respond to questions about whether Trump was aware that Manafort needed to register as a foreign agent. \n Earlier today, one of the Washington lobbying firms that worked on the influence campaign under the direction of Manafort and his former deputy, Rick Gates, itself registered after the fact with the Justice Department as a foreign agent. It acknowledged its work could have principally benefited Ukraine's government. The other firm involved, Mercury LLC, later said it also would register soon as a foreign agent for its work. \n Federal prosecutors have been looking into Manafort's work for years as part of an effort to recover Ukrainian assets stolen after the 2014 ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia. No charges have been filed as part of the investigation. Separately, Manafort is also under scrutiny as part of congressional and FBI investigations into possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia's government under President Vladimir Putin during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. \n Manafort has said: \"I have never been involved with anything to do with the Russian government or the Putin administration or any other issues under investigation,\" and his spokesman, Maloni, has said there was nothing improper about his political consulting in Ukraine, including how he was paid. \n Gates, who has been seen inside the White House on a number of occasions, helped plan Trump's inauguration and until last month was involved in a nonprofit organization, America First Policies, to back the White House agenda. Gates did not respond to text messages left by the AP today. His voicemail box was full. \n The Podesta Group disclosed details of the lobbying it did from 2012 through 2014 on behalf of a Brussels-based nonprofit, the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine. The lobbying firm, run by the brother of Hillary Clinton presidential campaign chairman John Podesta, reported in its filing that it was paid more than $1.2 million for its efforts. It cited unspecified \"information brought to light in recent months\" and conversations with Justice Department employees as the reason for its decision. \n Mercury LLC told the AP just hours later that it also intends to file with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agent Registration Act. \n In an August interview, Mercury partner Vin Weber told the AP that his firm had never taken guidance from or coordinated with Manafort or Gates about the work. Emails obtained by the AP contradicted that and showed that Gates directly oversaw and guided the lobbying work Mercury conducted. \n Asked why Mercury did not consider registering with the Justice Department earlier, Mercury partner Michael McKeon declined to say what had changed. \n \"I'm not going to get into that,\" he told the AP. \"We relied on our counsel.\" \n The U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act requires people working on behalf of foreign political leaders to disclose their efforts to the Justice Department. Willfully failing to register is a felony, though the department rarely files criminal charges in such cases. It routinely works with lobbying firms to help them get back in compliance by registering and disclosing their work. \n The Podesta Group and Mercury had previously disclosed their lobbying work to Congress under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, but neither firm had registered with the Justice Department. A foreign agent registration requires lobbying firms to disclose more details about their work than is required under the congressional registration, including the details of the lobbying contract, individual contacts with American officials and any attempts to influence U.S. public opinion. \n In a statement to the AP, Kimberley Fritts, CEO of the Podesta Group, said that the Justice Department's Foreign Agent Registration unit worked with the firm to make sure it was complying with federal law. \n \"We have, and will continue to have, no hesitation doing so to underscore our commitment to transparency,\" Fritts said. \n Fritts said that the European Center for a Modern Ukraine had certified to the Podesta Group that it was not a vehicle of a foreign government or political party, which is why the lobbying firm only previously registered with Congress. Fritts did not say what information had been brought to light to change that determination. \n The Podesta Group has previously acknowledged to AP that Manafort's firm, DMP International, had provided guidance about the lobbying effort. It said officials there did not understand that Manafort and Gates were simultaneously being paid by the Party of Regions. \n A the AP reported in August, the lobbying effort included not only traditional outreach to politicians in Washington but attempts to influence American public opinion and gather political intelligence on competing lobbying efforts in the U.S. The details of the lobbying effort were detailed in emails obtained by the AP last year. \n The new paperwork identified Obama administration officials, legislators, reporters and editorial writers whose offices the lobbyists contacted. They included congressional leaders from both parties, emailing and calling staffers for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., both strong supporters at the time for of sanctions against Yanukovych's government. \n By October 2013, as relations deteriorated between the Obama administration and Yanukovych, the lobbying effort appeared to intensify. Three times that month, for example, Podesta lobbyists contacted staffers for Rep. Elliott Engle, D-N.Y., who had sponsored sanctions legislation. \n One of them was Dan Harsha, now associate director of communications at Harvard University's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation. Harsha said he did not recall specific lobbying conversations but said congressional staffers were aware that the European Center was a pro-Yanukovych entity. \n \"How many obscure European think tanks were able to hire sophisticated A-list lobbyists?\" he said. \"It was widely assumed the think tank was a conduit for Yanukovych and it was treated as such on the Hill.\" \n The European Centre did not immediately respond to phone messages and emails from the AP. \n Associated Press writer Stephen Braun contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Former Trump campaign chairman to register as foreign agent"}

{"date": "April 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke to moderator Greta Van Susteren at the Newseum in Washington, today, during \"The President and the Press: The First Amendment in the First 100 Days\" forum. \n WASHINGTON >> White House press secretary Sean Spicer said today that his attempt to compare the Holocaust and Syrian President Bashar Assad's use of chemical weapons was \"inexcusable and reprehensible\" and was made all the worse by this being a holy week for Christians and Jews. \n He said the comment, made Tuesday at the White House briefing, was personally and professionally disappointing, and he asked for \"folks' forgiveness.\" \n \"To make a gaffe and a mistake like this is inexcusable and reprehensible,\" Spicer said during a previously scheduled appearance at a forum on the presidency and the press sponsored by the Newseum. Christians are preparing for Easter on Sunday, and Jews are celebrating Passover. \n \"It really is painful to myself to know that I did something like that,\" Spicer said. \"That obviously was not my intention. To know when you screw up that you possibly offended a lot of people \u2026 I would ask obviously for folks' forgiveness to understand that I should not have tried to make a comparison.\" \n It was Spicer's second apology in as many days, following an initial mea culpa Tuesday during an interview with CNN. \n Earlier Tuesday during the daily White House briefing, Spicer told reporters that Adolf Hitler \"didn't even sink to using chemical weapons.\" The comment drew an instant rebuke from critics, who noted the remark ignored Hitler's use of gas chambers to exterminate Jews during the Holocaust. \n Reaction to Spicer's initial comment continued today, with Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial inviting him to visit its website. \n In the CNN interview, Spicer said his comments did not reflect Trump's views but \"were a distraction from him and frankly were misstated, insensitive and wrong.\" He added, \"Obviously it was my blunder.\" Spicer reiterated that sentiment at today's forum. \n After making the initial comment, Spicer was asked about it again during the briefing but offered a garbled defense in which he tried to differentiate between Hitler's actions and the gas attack on Syrian civilians last week. The attack in northern Syria left nearly 90 people dead. Turkey said sarin gas was used. \n \"I think when you come to sarin gas, there was no, he (Hitler) was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing,\" Spicer said. \"There was clearly \u2026 I understand your point, thank you. There was not \u2026 He brought them into the Holocaust center I understand that.\" \n After the briefing, Spicer emailed reporters a statement that said: \"In no way was I trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust. I was trying to draw a distinction of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on population centers. Any attack on innocent people is reprehensible and inexcusable.\" \n Reaction from around the world continued today. A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said comparing Nazi war crimes to present-day situations \"leads to nothing good.\" \n Robert Rozett, director of libraries at Yad Vashem, said Spicer's comment implied a \"profound lack of knowledge of the events of the second World War, including the Holocaust\" and \"are liable to strengthen the hands of those who seek to destroy history.\" \n In the U.S., Democrats and Jewish organizations condemned the comments. \n House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California said in a statement that Spicer was \"downplaying the horror of the Holocaust\" and should be fired. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said on Twitter, \"Someone get PressSec a refresher history course on Hitler stat (hashtag)#Icantbelievehereallysaidthat.\" \n The New York-based Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect also called on Trump to fire Spicer, saying he denied that Hitler gassed Jews during the Holocaust. \n Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican from New York, said in a statement that the comparison could be made \"a little differently and it would be accurate, but it's important to clear up that Hitler did in fact use chemical warfare to murder innocent people.\" \n But Matt Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition, said that while \"using the issue of the Holocaust or Hitler is problematic on many levels,\" he believed Spicer had \"genuinely and sincerely apologized.\" \n Spicer's comments came on the first day of Passover and a day after the White House held a Seder dinner marking the emancipation of the Jewish people, a tradition started during the Obama administration. Earlier in the year, the White House generated criticism by issuing a statement on international Holocaust Remembrance Day that did not mention Jews. \n Tuesday was the second consecutive day in which Trump's principal spokesman appeared to struggle to articulate Trump's foreign policy at a critical time. \n On Monday, the White House clarified remarks Spicer made from the podium that the use of barrel bombs by Assad's government might lead to further military action by the United States. Until Monday the administration had maintained that last week's missile strikes were in response to the Syrian government's use of chemical weapons against its citizens. \n A White House spokesman said later that \"nothing has changed in our posture\" and the president retains the option to act if it's in the national interest. \n Associated Press writers Ian Deitch in Jerusalem and Julie Bykowicz and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Spicer says Hitler comment 'inexcusable and reprehensible'"}

{"date": "April 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Sailors conducted flight operations on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) flight deck on April 8. The Trump administration deployed an aircraft carrier to the region this week in a show of force that also could expose American weakness. \n WASHINGTON >> The Trump administration's decision to send an aircraft carrier to waters off the Korean Peninsula is meant as a show of force, but it also could expose American weakness. \n If North Korea goes ahead with a ballistic missile or nuclear test and the U.S. does nothing in response, America's deterrence will appear diminished. \n The USS Carl Vinson is on the move as anticipation mounts that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will stage a weapons test around the anniversary of the birth of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the nation's founder, on Saturday. Another potential date: An April 25 celebration of its armed forces. \n The North sees U.S.-South Korea war games as preparations for an invasion. The U.S. and its allies have expressed alarm about the North's recent ballistic missile launches, including a four-rocket salvo last month it described as a practice to strike U.S. bases in Japan. \n Washington's ultimate concern is the North's developing ability to mount a nuclear warhead on an intercontinental missile, which it should be able to master in the next few years. \n President Donald Trump told the Fox News Channel in an interview broadcast today that the U.S. was sending \"an armada\" of vessels, including submarines, but he declined to discuss military plans. At the Pentagon on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said sending the Vinson was \"prudent.\" \n Army Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, decided not to come to Washington for congressional hearings this month, his office said Tuesday, suggesting he had to stay for a potentially hazardous situation under his command. U.S. defense officials said that didn't mean military action was imminent. A similar decision was made amid tensions in 2013. \n But the Vinson's presence near North Korea points to the larger challenge for the U.S. of deterrence, which has to be backed by the real threat of force. \n No one has spoken of shooting down a North Korean missile unless it directly threatens the U.S. or its allies in East Asia. Kim is likely to be undeterred to conduct tests because he has made nuclear weapons development a national priority, seeing them as a guarantee against U.S.-backed efforts that have toppled authoritarian governments in Iraq, Libya and elsewhere. \n Trump's policy toward the North Korean threat is still taking shape. The emphasis has been on pressing China to use its economic leverage to rein in its wayward ally. In the Fox interview, Trump said he told Chinese leader Xi Jinping when they met in Florida last week that \"you have a tremendous power because of trade.\" \n They spoke again by phone on Tuesday night. Trump tweeted it was a \"very good call\" about \"the menace of North Korea.\" China's foreign ministry said Xi insisted on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and advocated resolving the problem \"through peaceful means.\" \n The United States periodically sends aircraft carrier strike groups to waters near the Korean Peninsula to retain a naval presence and project power in the Asia-Pacific region. The Carl Vinson took part last month in the U.S.-South Korea war games. \n President Barack Obama ordered an aircraft carrier to the Korean Peninsula in a show of force in November 2010 after North Korea launched a deadly artillery barrage on the South. Then, the fear was a conflagration at the heavily militarized border. \n Washington views the threat as one against the U.S. itself too, as North Korea's nuclear and missile programs approach the capacity to reach the U.S. mainland. That has raised the question of whether the U.S. would be prepared to shoot down a North Korean missile. Doing so would be a real-world test of America's uncertain missile defense capabilities. \n The Carl Vinson is accompanied by a destroyer ship with an Aegis combat system to track and intercept missiles. \n John Park, director of the Korea Working Group at the Harvard Kennedy School, said if North Korea went ahead with a missile test to mark this weekend's anniversary, there would be questions if the U.S. was in the region but did not try to stop it. If it uses the Aegis system, a failure would hurt the system's credibility. \n That would also alarm allies Japan and South Korea, which also have the Aegis. \n In a statement Tuesday, North Korea's Foreign Ministry said the aircraft carrier deployment \"goes to prove that the U.S. reckless moves for invading \u2026 have reached a serious phase.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. show of force to N.Korea could show U.S. weakness"}

{"date": "April 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Lovely Harasme 26, sat in front of her mother's house in Port-au-Prince, Haiti in Aug. 2016. She says she was one of several women who worked as prostitutes for Sri Lankan peacekeepers with the U.N. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Aug. 11, 2016 photo, Martine Gestime 32, wipes her tears during an interview in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Gestime said she was raped by a Brazilian peacekeeper in 2008 and became pregnant with her son, Ashford. \n PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti >> In the ruins of a tropical hideaway where jetsetters once sipped rum under the Caribbean sun, the abandoned children tried to make a life for themselves. They begged and scavenged for food, but they never could scrape together enough to beat back the hunger, until the U.N. peacekeepers moved in a few blocks away. \n The men who came from a far-away place and spoke a strange language offered the Haitian children cookies and other snacks. Sometimes they gave them a few dollars. But the price was high: The Sri Lankan peacekeepers wanted sex from girls and boys as young as 12. \n \"I did not even have breasts,\" said a girl, known as V01 \u2014 Victim No. 1. She told U.N. investigators that over the next three years, from ages 12 to 15, she had sex with nearly 50 peacekeepers, including a \"Commandant\" who gave her 75 cents. Sometimes she slept in U.N. trucks on the base next to the decaying resort, whose once-glamorous buildings were being overtaken by jungle. \n Justice for victims like V01 is rare. An Associated Press investigation of U.N. missions during the past 12 years found nearly 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeepers and other personnel around the world \u2014 signaling the crisis is much larger than previously known. More than 300 of the allegations involved children, the AP found, but only a fraction of the alleged perpetrators served jail time. \n Legally, the U.N. is in a bind. It has no jurisdiction over peacekeepers, leaving punishment to the countries that contribute the troops. \n The AP interviewed alleged victims, current and former U.N. officials and investigators and sought answers from 23 countries on the number of peacekeepers who faced such allegations and, what if anything, was done to investigate. With rare exceptions, few nations responded to repeated requests, while the names of those found guilty are kept confidential, making accountability impossible to determine. \n Without agreement for widespread reform and accountability from the U.N.'s member states, solutions remain elusive. \n Here in Haiti, at least 134 Sri Lankan peacekeepers exploited nine children in a sex ring from 2004 to 2007, according to an internal U.N. report obtained by the AP. In the wake of the report, 114 peacekeepers were sent home. None was ever imprisoned. \n In March, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced new measures to tackle sexual abuse and exploitation by U.N. peacekeepers and other personnel. \n \"Let us declare in one voice: We will not tolerate anyone committing or condoning sexual exploitation and abuse. We will not let anyone cover up these crimes with the U.N. flag,\" Guterres said. \n But the proclamation had a depressingly familiar ring: More than a decade ago, the United Nations commissioned a report that promised to do much the same thing, yet most of the reforms never materialized. \n For a full two years after those promises were made, the children in Haiti were passed around from soldier to soldier. And in the years since, peacekeepers have been accused of sexual abuse the world over. \n In one particularly grim case in Haiti, a teenage boy said he was gang-raped in 2011 by Uruguayan peacekeepers who filmed the alleged assault on a cellphone. Dozens of Haitian women also say they were raped, and dozens more had what is euphemistically called \"survival sex\" in a country where most people live on less than $2.50 a day, the AP found. \n Haitian lawyer Mario Joseph has been trying to get compensation for victims of a deadly cholera strain linked to Nepalese peacekeepers that killed an estimated 10,000 people. Now, he is also trying to get child support for about a dozen Haitian women left pregnant by peacekeepers. \n \"Imagine if the U.N. was going to the United States and raping children and bringing cholera,\" Joseph said in Port-au-Prince. \"Human rights aren't just for rich white people.\" \n U.S. Sen. Bob Corker agrees. The Tennessee Republican, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been calling for reforms in the United Nations. He may well get them under President Donald Trump, whose administration has proposed a 31 percent reduction to the U.S. foreign aid and diplomacy budget. Corker and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley want a review of all missions. \n Corker recalled his disgust at hearing of the U.N. sexual abuse cases uncovered last year in Central African Republic. \n \"If I heard that a U.N. peacekeeping mission was coming near my home in Chattanooga,\" he told AP, \"I'd be on the first plane out of here to go back and protect my family.\" \n THE Habitation Leclerc resort was once well known throughout Port-au-Prince as a lush refuge amid the capital's grimy alleyways. During its heyday in the 1980s, celebrities like Mick Jagger and Jackie Onassis would perch by the pool or stroll past the property's Voodoo temple. \n By 2004, the resort was a decrepit clutch of buildings, and several children, either orphaned or abandoned by their parents, were living in its ruins. \n It was there that V01 met other victims, two girls referred to in the U.N. report as \"V02\" and \"V03\" and a young boy, \"V08.\" The boy initially supported them by occasionally bringing food from his aunt, but they were often hungry. \n The peacekeepers had arrived that year as part of a new mission to help stabilize Haiti in the wake of President Jean-Bertrande Aristide's ouster. The Sri Lankans, numbering about 900 troops, landed in a historically unstable country in the grip of scattered violence and kidnappings \u2014 and a broken government ill-suited to confront the chaos. \n Some of the peacekeepers in the Sri Lankan contingent were based near the former resort. \n In August 2007, the U.N. received complaints of \"suspicious interactions\" between Sri Lankan soldiers and Haitian children. U.N. investigators then interviewed nine victims, as well as witnesses, while the sex ring was still active. \n V02, who was 16 when the U.N. team interviewed her, told them she had sex with a Sri Lankan commander at least three times, describing him as overweight with a moustache and a gold ring on his middle finger. She said he often showed her a picture of his wife. The peacekeepers also taught her some Sinhalese so she could understand and express sexual innuendo; the children even talked to one another in Sinhalese when U.N. investigators were interviewing them. \n V03 identified 11 Sri Lankan troops through photographs, one of whom she said was a corporal with a \"distinctive\" bullet scar between his armpit and waist. V04, who was 14, said she had sex with the soldiers every day in exchange for money, cookies or juice. \n During her interview with investigators, another young victim, V07, received a phone call from a Sri Lankan peacekeeper. She explained that the soldiers would pass along her number to incoming contingent members, who would then call her for sex. \n The boy, V08, said he had sex with more than 20 Sri Lankans. Most would remove their name tags before taking him to U.N. military trucks, where he gave them oral sex or was sodomized by them. \n Another boy, V09, was 15 when his encounters began. Over the course of three years, he said he had sex with more than 100 Sri Lankan peacekeepers, averaging about four a day, investigators said. \n Under Haitian law, having sex with someone under 18 is statutory rape. U.N. codes of conduct also prohibit exploitation. \n \"The sexual acts described by the nine victims are simply too many to be presented exhaustively in this report, especially since each claimed multiple sexual partners at various locations where the Sri Lankan contingents were deployed throughout Haiti over several years,\" the report said. \n Investigators showed the children more than 1,000 photographs that included pictures of Sri Lankan troops and locations of where the children had sex with the soldiers. \n \"The evidence shows that from late 2004 to mid-October 2007, at least 134 military members of the current and previous Sri Lankan contingents sexually exploited and abused at least nine Haitian children,\" the report said. \n After the report was filed, 114 Sri Lanka peacekeepers were sent home, putting an end to the sex ring. \n But the sexual exploitation visited upon Haiti's people didn't stop there. \n JANILA JEAN said she was a 16-year-old virgin when a Brazilian peacekeeper lured her to a U.N. compound three years ago with a smear of peanut butter on bread, raped her at gunpoint and left her pregnant. She finds herself constantly in tears. \n \"Some days, I imagine strangling my daughter to death,\" she said in an interview under the shadow of banana palms near the former Jacmel base. \n With her were three other women who said they also were raped by peacekeepers. One of them sat on her heels, scraping coconut from its shell and into a large cauldron of water and corn, the barest of meals for the women and their small children. \n Adm. Ademir Sobrinho of Brazil's armed forces said at a conference in London that his force had no such cases of rape, sexual abuse or sexual exploitation. \n But like many, Jean didn't report the rape. Nearly a dozen women interviewed by the AP said they were too scared to report the crimes out of fear they would be blamed \u2014 or worse, would meet their victimizers again. \n The AP found that some 150 allegations of abuse and exploitation by U.N. peacekeepers and other personnel were reported in Haiti alone between 2004 and 2016, out of the worldwide total of nearly 2,000. Aside from the Sri Lankan sex ring in Haiti, some perpetrators were jailed for other cases. \n Alleged abusers came from Bangladesh, Brazil, Jordan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uruguay and Sri Lanka, according to U.N. data and interviews. More countries may have been involved, but the United Nations only started disclosing alleged perpetrators' nationalities after 2015. \n The litany of abuses is long. \n In July 2011, four Uruguayan peacekeepers and their commanding officer allegedly gang-raped a Haitian teenager. The men also filmed the alleged attack on their phones, which went viral on the internet. The men never faced trial in Haiti; four of the five were convicted in Uruguay of \"private violence,\" a lesser charge. Uruguayan officials said at the time that it was a prank gone wrong and that no rape occurred. \n The following year, three Pakistanis attached to the U.N.'s police units in Haiti were allegedly involved in the rape of a mentally disabled 13-year-old in the northern city of Gonaives. \n U.N. officials went to Haiti to investigate, but the Pakistanis abducted the boy to keep him from detailing the abuse that had gone on for more than a year, according to Peter Gallo, a former U.N. investigator familiar with the case. \n Finally, the men were tried in a Pakistani military tribunal, and eventually sent back to Pakistan. In theory, the tribunal could have allowed for better access to witnesses, but it's unclear whether any were called. The Pakistani authorities also refused to allow the U.N. to observe the proceedings. In the end, one man was sent to prison for a year, according to Ariane Quentier, a spokeswoman for the Haiti mission. \n \"It's an indictment of how the whole U.N. system works,\" Gallo told the AP. \n Pakistan's military has refused several requests for comment on the case. \n U.N. data during the 12-year period reviewed by AP is incomplete and varies in levels of detail, particularly for cases before 2010. Hundreds of other cases were closed with little to no explanation. In its review, the AP analyzed data from annual reports as well as information from the Office of Internal Oversight Services. \n In the wake of the child sex ring investigation, a team of Sri Lankans spent two weeks in Haiti in October 2007. They interviewed only 25 soldiers out of more than 900 in the country and concluded that just two Sri Lankan corporals and one private had sex with two \"young\" victims. Three soldiers denied sexual encounters but were suspected of lying, according to the U.N. investigation report. \n For six months, the Sri Lankan army and the government declined to respond to AP's questions about the 2007 case. Instead, officials first dodged repeated queries, then gave vague assurances that the scandal represented an isolated incident. Last month, the Sri Lankan government acknowledged its military had conducted inquiries into just 18 soldiers it said were implicated, and that \"the U.N. Secretariat has acknowledged in writing, action taken by the Government, and informed that the Secretariat, as of 29 September 2014, considers the matter closed.\" \n Some of the peacekeepers involved in the ring were still in the Sri Lankan military as of last year, Sri Lankan military officials say. The United Nations, meanwhile, continued to send Sri Lankan peacekeepers to Haiti and elsewhere despite corroborating the child sex ring. \n Sri Lankan Defense Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi defended the troops, saying, \"People are quite happy and comfortable with the peacekeepers.\" \n ABOVE a rusty bench at an abandoned bus stop in the village of Leogane hangs a sign that reads, \"Constructed by the 16th Sri Lanka Peacekeeping Battalion.\" It's one of the few physical reminders of the battalion's mission \u2014 along with children fathered by U.N. personnel. \n Marie-Ange Haitis says she met a Sri Lankan commander in December 2006 and he soon began making night-time visits to her house in Leogane. \n \"By January, we had had sex,\" she said. \"It wasn't rape, but it wasn't exactly consensual, either. I felt like I didn't have a choice.\" \n She said when she first realized that she was pregnant, the Haitian translator assigned to the Sri Lankans told her to have an abortion. Then, she said, U.N. officials accused her of lying. As she spoke, her daughter Samantha sat on her lap wearing an oversized pair of sunglasses with a missing lens. \n When she was interviewed in August, Haitis said she had been waiting nearly a decade for the U.N. to consider her paternity claim to help support her daughter. \n Finally, early this year, Sri Lankan and U.N. officials told AP that a onetime payment of $45,243 had been made for Haitis' daughter. The United Nations said Sri Lanka accepted the paternity claim without proof of DNA and the commander was dismissed from service. \n But such payments are rare. \n U.N. officials said they were unable to find any members of the mission in Haiti who might have dealt with the victims in the sex-ring case and did not know what happened to the children. An Italian non-governmental organization, AVSI, said it helped the children by trying to find homes for them, providing them with counseling and helping reintegrate them into schools, but it also lost track of the children shortly after the country's devastating 2010 earthquake. \n Atul Khare, the U.N.'s head of field support which oversees the conduct and discipline of peacekeepers, acknowledged the scope of the problem and said the global agency must do more to help victims, including gathering accurate information and following up with troop-contributing countries. \n An AP review of reports into conduct on U.N. field missions showed haphazard record-keeping. In a 2008 report, for example, 19 allegations were reported in Haiti, but the U.N. recorded only two incidents worldwide involving minors \u2014 a seeming contradiction to the U.N.'s own investigation report in late 2007 that detailed the child sex ring with at least nine child victims. \n Some Haitians wonder whether the U.N. has done more harm than good in a country that has endured tragedy after tragedy since it became the first black republic in 1804. \n U.N. personnel say they have contributed to the stability in the Caribbean nation over the years, saved lives during the 2010 earthquake's aftermath and prevented violence during periods of unrest. The mission, which currently has nearly 5,000 personnel and is expected to scale down by October, has also been credited with training police, providing security during elections and support to the judiciary. \n \"I would not say we have achieved everything we set out to do, but we are engaged in a process of continuous improvement that any harmful effect on the local populations could be minimized, if not completely eradicated,\" Khare said. \n Many here are not convinced. \n \"I'd like to see my attacker face to face and tell him how he has destroyed my life,\" said 21-year-old Melida Joseph, who said she was raped by one peacekeeper and narrowly escaped being gang-raped in Cite-Soleil, a seaside slum. Like others, she never reported the crime. \n \"They'll look at this as one big joke,\" she said. \"As far as the U.N. goes, they came here to protect us, but all they've brought is destruction.\" \n Contributors to the report were Katy Daigle in Colombo, Sri Lanka; Krista Larson in Dakar, Senegal; Kathy Gannon in Islamabad, Pakistan; Saleh Mwanamilongo in Kinshasa, Congo; Francis Kokutse in Accra, Ghana; Brahima Ouedraogo in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso; and Sylivester Domasa in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.N. peacekeepers' child sex ring left victims, but no arrests"}

{"date": "April 12, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Then-Donald Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort talked to reporters, July 17, on the floor of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. \n WASHINGTON >> Last August, a handwritten ledger surfaced in Ukraine with dollar amounts and dates next to the name of Paul Manafort, who was then Donald Trump's campaign chairman. \n Ukrainian investigators called it evidence of off-the-books payments from a pro-Russian political party \u2014 and part of a larger pattern of corruption under the country's former president. Manafort, who worked for the party as an international political consultant, has publicly questioned the ledger's authenticity. \n Now, financial records newly obtained by The Associated Press confirm that at least $1.2 million in payments listed in the ledger next to Manafort's name were actually received by his consulting firm in the United States. They include payments in 2007 and 2009, providing the first evidence that Manafort's firm received at least some money listed in the so-called Black Ledger. \n The two payments came years before Manafort became involved in Trump's campaign, but for the first time bolster the credibility of the ledger. They also put the ledger in a new light, as federal prosecutors in the U.S. have been investigating Manafort's work in Eastern Europe as part of a larger anti-corruption probe. \n Separately, Manafort is also under scrutiny as part of congressional and FBI investigations into possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia's government under President Vladimir Putin during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The payments detailed in the ledger and confirmed by the documents obtained by the AP are unrelated to the 2016 presidential campaign and came years before Manafort worked as Trump's unpaid campaign chairman. \n In a statement to the AP, Manafort did not deny that his firm received the money but said \"any wire transactions received by my company are legitimate payments for political consulting work that was provided. I invoiced my clients and they paid via wire transfer, which I received through a U.S. bank.\" \n Manafort noted that he agreed to be paid according to his \"clients' preferred financial institutions and instructions.\" \n Previously, Manafort and his spokesman, Jason Maloni, have maintained the ledger was fabricated and said no public evidence existed that Manafort or others received payments recorded in it. \n The AP, however, identified in the records two payments received by Manafort that aligned with the ledger: one for $750,000 that a Ukrainian lawmaker said last month was part of a money-laundering effort that should be investigated by U.S. authorities. The other was $455,249 and also matched a ledger entry. \n The newly obtained records also expand the global scope of Manafort's financial activities related to his Ukrainian political consulting, because both payments came from companies once registered in the Central American country of Belize. Last month, the AP reported that the U.S. government has examined Manafort's financial transactions in the Mediterranean country of Cyprus as part of its probe. \n Federal prosecutors have been looking into Manafort's work for years as part of an effort to recover Ukrainian assets stolen after the 2014 ouster of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia. No charges have been filed as part of the investigation. \n Manafort, a longtime Republican political operative, led the presidential campaign from March until August last year when Trump asked him to resign. The resignation came after a tumultuous week in which The New York Times revealed that Manafort's name appeared in the Ukraine ledger \u2014 although the newspaper said at the time that officials were unsure whether Manafort actually received the money \u2014 and after the AP separately reported that he had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation until 2014 on behalf of Ukraine's pro-Russian Party of Regions. \n Officials with the Ukrainian National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which is investigating corruption under Yanukovych, have said they believe the ledger is genuine. But they have previously noted that they have no way of knowing whether Manafort received the money listed next to his name. The bureau said it is not investigating Manafort because he is not a Ukrainian citizen. \n Still, Manafort's work continues to draw attention in Ukrainian politics. \n Last month, Ukrainian lawmaker Serhiy Leshchenko revealed an invoice bearing the letterhead of Manafort's namesake company, Davis Manafort, that Leshchenko said was crafted to conceal a payment to Manafort as a purchase of 501 computers. \n The AP provided to Manafort the amounts of the payments, dates and number of the bank account where they were received. Manafort told the AP that he was unable to review his own banking records showing receipt of the payments because his bank destroyed the records after a standard 7-year retention period. He said Tuesday the \"computer sales contract is a fraud.\" \n \"The signature is not mine, and I didn't sell computers,\" he said in a statement. \"What is clear, however, is individuals with political motivations are taking disparate pieces of information and distorting their significance through a campaign of smear and innuendo.\" \n Leshchenko said last month the 2009 invoice was one of about 50 pages of documents, including private paperwork and copies of employee-issued debit cards, that were found in Manafort's former Kiev office by a new tenant. \n The amount of the invoice \u2014 $750,000\u2014 and the payment date of Oct. 14, 2009, matches one entry on the ledger indicating payments to Manafort from the Party of Regions. The invoice was addressed to Neocom Systems Ltd., a company formerly registered in Belize, and included the account and routing numbers and postal address for Manafort's account at a branch of Wachovia National Bank in Alexandria, Virginia. \n The AP had previously been unable to independently verify the $750,000 payment went to a Manafort company, but the newly obtained financial records reflect Manafort's receipt of that payment. The records show that Davis Manafort received the amount from Neocom Systems the day after the date of the invoice. \n Leshchenko contended to AP that Yanukovych, as Ukraine's leader, paid Manafort money that came from his government's budget and was \"stolen from Ukrainian citizens.\" He said: \"Money received by Manafort has to be returned to the Ukrainian people.\" \n Leshchenko said U.S. authorities should investigate what he described as corrupt deals between Manafort and Yanukovych. \"It's about a U.S. citizen and money was transferred to a U.S. bank account,\" he said. \n A $455,249 payment in November 2007 also matches the amount in the ledger. It came from Graten Alliance Ltd., a company that had also been registered in Belize. It is now inactive. \n The AP reported last month that federal prosecutors are looking into Manafort's financial transactions in Cyprus, an island nation once known as a favored locale for money laundering. \n Among those transactions was a $1 million payment in October 2009 routed through the Bank of Cyprus. The money was deposited into an account controlled by a Manafort-linked company, then left the account on the same day, broken into two disbursements of $500,000, according to documents obtained by the AP. \n The records of Manafort's Cypriot transactions were requested by the U.S. Treasury Department Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which works internationally with agencies to track money laundering and the movement of illicit funds around the globe. \n Dozens of Ukrainian political figures mentioned in the Black Ledger are under investigation in Ukraine. The anti-corruption bureau, which has been looking into the Black Ledger, publicly confirmed the authenticity of the signature of one top official mentioned there. In December, the bureau accused Mykhaylo Okhendovsky of receiving more than $160,000 from Party of Regions officials in 2012, when he was Ukraine's main election official. \n The bureau said it would identify more suspects in the coming months. \n Associated Press writers Nataliya Vasilyeva contributed reporting from Kiev and Moscow, and Lynn Berry from Washington. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Manafort firm received Ukraine ledger payout"}
