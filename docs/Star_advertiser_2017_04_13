{"date": "April 13, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n CIA Director Mike Pompeo speaks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington today. Pompeo denounced WikiLeaks, calling the anti-secrecy group a \"hostile intelligence agency.\" \n WASHINGTON >> CIA Director Mike Pompeo denounced the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks today as a \"hostile intelligence service\" and a threat to U.S. national security, a condemnation that differed sharply from President Donald Trump's past praise of the organization. \n In his first public speech since becoming America's spy master, the former Republican congressman escalated the agency's hostility to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, accusing them of making common cause with dictators. While \"Assange and his ilk\" claim they act in the name of liberty and privacy, Pompeo said that in reality, their mission is \"personal self-aggrandizement through the destruction of Western values.\" \n \"WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service,\" Pompeo said. \n Pompeo's tone was notably different from that of his boss. \n Before the election, Trump said he was happy to see WikiLeaks publish private, politically damaging emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta. The White House defended the president, saying there was a big difference between WikiLeaks publishing stolen, personal emails of a political figure and publishing files about national security tools used by the CIA. \n WikiLeaks last month released nearly 8,000 documents that it says reveal secrets about the CIA's cyberespionage tools for breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and even smart TVs. It previously published 250,000 State Department cables and embarrassed the U.S. military with hundreds of thousands of logs from Iraq and Afghanistan. \n Pompeo said there was no \"quick fix\" for solving the threat posed by Assange and others determined to publicize U.S. secrets. \n The U.S. and the CIA can shame Assange publicly and fortify information systems, he said. They can build trust with the public, however hard that may be for an agency defined by its secrecy. Pompeo also suggested denying \"Assange and his colleagues the latitude to use free speech values against us.\" He did not say how that could be done, but said Assange is not protected by the U.S. Constitution because he's not an American. \n Pompeo noted that in January, U.S. intelligence officials determined Russian military intelligence had used WikiLeaks to release data obtained through cyber operations against the Democratic National Committee. He said American intelligence also found that Russian state-owned television network RT actively collaborated with WikiLeaks. \n He also criticized Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked documents revealing widespread government surveillance programs. Snowden currently lives in Russia. Assange, an Australian, has resided the last four years in Ecuador's embassy in London. He received political asylum after skipping bail to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted over a rape allegation. \n \"While we do our best to quietly collect information on those who possess very real threats to our country, individuals like Julian Assange and Edward Snowden seek to use that information to make a name for themselves,\" Pompeo said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. \"As long as they make a splash, they care nothing about the lives they put at risk or the damage they cause to national security.\" \n In an opinion piece published Wednesday in The Washington Post, Assange defended his disclosures, which he depicted as \"truths regarding overreaches and abuses conducted in secret by the powerful.\" \n \"Our most recent disclosures describe the CIA's multibillion-dollar cyberwarfare program in which the agency created dangerous cyber weapons, targeted private companies' consumer products and then lost control of its cyber arsenal,\" Assange wrote. \n Pompeo did not confirm the cyberespionage tools released by WikiLeaks belonged to the agency. Since the disclosure, the U.S. government has all but publicly accepted the embarrassing claim. Trump said in an interview: \"I just want people to know the CIA was hacked, and a lot of things taken.\" \n On Monday, a California-based computer security company said the tools disclosed by WikiLeaks have been linked to 40 spying operations in 16 countries. Symantec Corp. linked them to electronic infiltration of international, financial, energy and aerospace organizations across the world. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "CIA director calls WikiLeaks 'hostile intelligence service'"}

The GEO Group, a private prison company, announced it has won a $110-million federal contract to build in Texas the first new immigrant detention center under the Trump administration. \n AUSTIN, Texas >> A private prison company announced today it has won a $110-million federal contract to build in Texas the first new immigrant detention center under the Trump administration. \n The GEO Group said that its 1,000-bed detention facility will be in Conroe, north of Houston, and will open by the end of next year. The facility coincides with President Donald Trump's promised expansion of immigration detention, part of a larger crackdown on immigrants in the country illegally that includes detaining people seeking asylum while they go through immigration proceedings. \n U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement already has a record of more than 41,000 detainees. \n The agency has also identified an additional 21,000 unused beds that it plans to use for detention, according to a memo reported Wednesday by the Washington Post. That memo notes that \"ICE will be unable to secure additional detention capacity until funding has been identified.\" \n GEO, ICE's second-largest private prison contractor, has approximately 3,000 empty beds nationwide, according to a February investor call. \n Faced with a lack of funds and potentially thousands of empty beds, ICE's move to secure a new contract with GEO surprised immigrant rights advocates. \n \"This is totally unprecedented,\" said Silky Shaw, Co-Director of Detention Watch Network, a Washington-based non-profit fighting to end immigrant detention. \"Even the most recent expansion we've seen has been county jails and repurposing facilities that have been shuttered.\" \n Trump has instructed ICE to detain all individuals suspected of violating immigration laws. \n \"Aliens who illegally enter the United States without inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public safety,\" the president said in a Jan. 25 executive order asking ICE to \"allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.\" \n Still, Carl Takei, Staff Attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project, said the contract was a \"sign that the Trump administration's plans are a huge boondoggle for the private prison industry,\" which already operates about 75 percent of immigrant detention facilities. \n Takei said the new facility's location was also striking, given that GEO already operates the 1,517-bed Joe Corley immigrant detention center in the same small town. \n \"Frankly this surprises me \u2026 This raises the question both of how much ICE is actually planning to expand its already enormous detention system and where they're going to get the money for all this,\" Takei said. \"ICE has a pretty limited amount of money and they can't fund expanding detention in 2017 unless Congress passes supplemental appropriations.\" \n GEO referred all questions to ICE, which did not return requests for comment. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Texas getting first immigrant center built under Trump"}

{"date": "April 13, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n North Korea's Vice Minister Han Song Ryol warned the U.S. against provoking North Korea militarily. \"We will go to war if they choose,\" he said. \n PYONGYANG, North Korea >> President Donald Trump's tweets are adding fuel to a \"vicious cycle\" of tensions on the Korean Peninsula, North Korea's vice foreign minister told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview today. The official added that if the U.S. shows any sign of \"reckless\" military aggression, Pyongyang is ready to launch a pre-emptive strike of its own. \n Vice Minister Han Song Ryol said Pyongyang has determined the Trump administration is \"more vicious and more aggressive\" than that of Barack Obama. He added that North Korea will keep building up its nuclear arsenal in \"quality and quantity\" and said Pyongyang is ready to go to war if that's what Trump wants. \n North Korea is looking for trouble. If China decides to help, that would be great. If not, we will solve the problem without them!  U.S.A. \n I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so, the U.S., with its allies, will! U.S.A. \n Tensions between Pyongyang and Washington go back to President Harry Truman and the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. But the heat has been rising rapidly since Trump took office in January. \n This year's joint war games between the U.S. and South Korean militaries are the biggest so far. The USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier has been diverted back to the waters off Korea after heading for Australia, and U.S. satellite imagery suggests the North could conduct another underground nuclear test at any time. Pyongyang recently tested a ballistic missile and claims it is close to perfecting an intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear warhead that could attack the U.S. mainland. \n Many experts believe that at its current pace of testing, North Korea could reach that potentially game-changing milestone within a few years \u2014 under Trump's watch as president. Despite reports that Washington is considering military action if the North goes ahead with another nuclear test, Han did not rule out the possibility of a test in the near future. \n \"That is something that our headquarters decides,\" he said during the 40-minute interview in Pyongyang, which is now gearing up for a major holiday \u2014 and possibly a big military parade \u2014 on Saturday. \"At a time and at a place where the headquarters deems necessary, it will take place.\" \n The North conducted two such tests last year alone. The first was of what it claims to have been a hydrogen bomb and the second was its most powerful ever. Expectations are high the North may put its newest missiles on display during Saturday's parade. \n The annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises have consistently infuriated the North, which views them as rehearsals for an invasion. Washington and Seoul deny that, but reports that exercises have included \"decapitation strikes\" aimed at the North's leadership have fanned Pyongyang's anger. \n Han said Trump's tweets have also added fuel to the flames. \n Trump posted a tweet Tuesday in which he said the North is \"looking for trouble\" and reiterated his call for more pressure from Beijing, North Korea's economic lifeline, to clamp down on trade and strengthen its enforcement of U.N. sanctions to persuade Pyongyang to denuclearize. \n Trump has threatened that if Beijing isn't willing to do more to squeeze the North, the U.S. might take the matter into its own hands. \n \"Trump is always making provocations with his aggressive words,\" Han said. \"It's not the DPRK but the U.S. and Trump that makes trouble.\" North Korea's official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. \n He added: \"We will go to war if they choose.\" \n A U.S. State Department official said later Friday the U.S. was aligning \"all elements of national power\" to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs. \n The official, who wasn't authorized to be quoted by name and demanded anonymity, lamented Pyongyang's \"far too common and far too dangerous\" provocations, and said Washington would work with international partners to cut the North's government off \"from the rest of the world.\" \n The U.S. seeks nothing more than a \"stable and economically prosperous Korean peninsula,\" not military conflict, the official said. But the U.S. will respond to North Korea's threats accordingly and won't engage Pyongyang until it \"chooses a more peaceful way forward.\" \n Han said U.S. sanctions efforts are misguided and cited the opening ceremony of a sprawling new high-rise residential area in Pyongyang on Thursday as evidence that sanctions have failed to ruin the country's economy. Leader Kim Jong Un presided over the ceremony before about 100,000 residents and a large contingent of foreign journalists who have been allowed in to cover the holiday. \n Han dismissed the suggestion Trump made last year during his presidential campaign that he was willing to meet Kim Jong Un, possibly over hamburgers. \n \"I think that was nothing more than lip service during the campaign to make himself more popular,\" Han said. \"Now we are comparing Trump's policy toward the DPRK with the former administration's and we have concluded that it's becoming more vicious and more aggressive.\" \n Han said North Korea changed its military strategy two years ago, when the reports of \"decapitation strike\" training began to really get attention, to stress pre-emptive actions. \n \"We've got a powerful nuclear deterrent already in our hands, and we certainly will not keep our arms crossed in the face of a U.S. pre-emptive strike,\" he said. \"Whatever comes from the U.S., we will cope with it. We are fully prepared to handle it.\" \n How much such comments are bluster, or how realistic they are, is hard to gauge. \n Also on Friday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said all sides must stop provoking and threatening and start taking a flexible approach to resuming dialogue. He said China is willing to support any such effort. \n \"Once a war really happens, the result will be nothing but multiple-loss. No one can become a winner,\" Wang said. \"No matter who it is, if it wants to make war or trouble on the Korean Peninsula, it must take the historical responsibility and pay the due price.\" \n South Korea's Foreign Ministry said Han's remarks on the North's readiness to conduct a nuclear test and even go to war reveal the \"true colors of North Korea's government that is bellicose and a breaker of regulations.\" \n The ministry issued a statement saying North Korea will face strong punishment it will find hard to withstand if it makes a significant provocation, such as another nuclear test or an ICBM launch. \n Military experts generally agree a shooting war with North Korea would likely be far more costly than something along the lines of the recent targeted strike Trump ordered against a Syrian air base believed to be linked to a chemical weapons attack by the regime of Bashar Assad. That attack alarmed the North and was condemned as \"unpardonable\" by Pyongyang, which counts Syria as an ally. \n Even without nuclear weapons, the North could cause severe damage with its conventional artillery batteries aimed at the South Korean capital of Seoul. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "N.

{"date": "April 13, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2011 \n According to an AP investigation, some 150 allegations of abuse and exploitation were reported in Haiti between 2004 and 2016. The allegations involved U.N. peacekeepers and other personnel. Alleged victimizers came from Bangladesh, Brazil, Jordan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uruguay and Sri Lanka, according to U.N. data and interviews. \n UNITED NATIONS >> U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley today urged all countries that provide troops for U.N. peacekeeping missions to hold soldiers accountable for sexual abuse and exploitation, an appeal that came after she cited an Associated Press investigation into a child sex ring in Haiti involving Sri Lankan peacekeepers. \n She also warned that \"countries that refuse to hold their soldiers accountable must recognize that this either stops or their troops will go home and their financial compensation will end.\" \n Haley was speaking after the Security Council voted unanimously to end the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti in mid-October, sending a strong signal that the international community believes the impoverished Caribbean nation is stabilizing after successful elections. \n But the peacekeepers will leave with a tarnished legacy. U.N. troops from Nepal are widely blamed for introducing cholera that has killed at least 9,500 people in Haiti since 2010 and some troops have been implicated in sexual abuse. \n \"What do we say to these kids? Did these peacekeepers keep them safe?\" Haley asked, citing the AP's investigation detailing how at least 134 Sri Lankan peacekeepers sexually abused and exploited nine Haitian children between 2004 and 2007. \n Sri Lanka never jailed any soldiers implicated in the abuse yet the country was allowed to send troops to other U.N. missions. \n Haley said after the vote that while the departure of the peacekeepers \"is seen as a success, unfortunately it's a nightmare for many in Haiti who will never be able to forget and live with brutal scars.\" \n Nine children in the Haiti sex ring \u2014 some as young as 12 \u2014 told U.N. investigators how Sri Lankan peacekeepers offered them snacks or money for sex. One boy said he slept with as many as 100 soldiers, averaging about four per day. \n The details of the sex ring were part of a larger AP investigation of U.N. missions during the past 12 years that found an estimated 2,000 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by peacekeepers and U.N. personnel around the world. \n In Haiti, the 2,370 military personnel will gradually leave over the next six months. A new peacekeeping mission will follow for an initial period of six months, comprised of just 1,275 police to continue training the national police force and assist in developing the rule of law and promoting human rights in Haiti. \n Haley said the United States and the international community are committed to Haiti's \"democratic development, independence and economic growth.\" \n \"We will, however, continue to push for accountability of those troops in Haiti as well as all troop contributing countries involved in peacekeeping efforts,\" she said. \n \"We owe it to the vulnerable in these countries who desperately need peace and security,\" she told Security Council members. \"I ask that you join me in this effort.\" \n Former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recommended that peacekeepers accused of sexual abuse and exploitation be court martialed in the countries where the alleged incidents take place and said the U.N. would withhold payments to peacekeepers facing credible allegations. \n Responding to the AP report, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric had said Wednesday: \"We need to address the problem, first, for the victims, but also to ensure that the perception of peacekeeping is not a wrong one.\" \n He stressed it is dangerous work done honorably by \"the vast majority\" of peacekeepers. \n Mark Schuller, an academic studying what happens when international organizations leave countries like Haiti, said for Haitians, the U.N. has garnered a \"love-hate\" relationship, but the real issue is lack of accountability. \n \"The U.N. is not accountable to the Haitian government or people. That creates a culture of implied immunity,\" said Schuller, a professor at N. Illinois University's Department of Ethnology who spends part of his time in Haiti. \n Jacqueline Nono said she was 17 when she started having sex with a Sri Lankan peacekeeper for money or gifts. She said the sex was consensual but she needed the money to pay for her two children. \n \"I've heard the stories about Sri Lankans abusing Haitians, but I was treated well,\" said the 24-year-old in Port-au-Prince. \n For Jean-Marie Pascal, there is no love lost for the United Nations. \n She said a U.N. peacekeeper sexually assaulted her shortly after troops arrived in 2004 to quell instability following President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's ouster. After the 2010 earthquake struck, her two cousins died from a strain of cholera linked to U.N. peacekeepers from Nepal. \n \"Haiti has been a playground for the United Nations,\" the 43-year-old shop assistant told the AP as part of its investigation. \n The United Nations also suffered in Haiti, losing nearly 100 peacekeepers and personnel in the 2010 earthquake that killed as many as 300,000 people. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. says countries must punish U.N. troops for sex abuse"}

U.S voters in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada voted last year to approve the use of recreational marijuana, joining Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska. \n The South American nation of Uruguay is the only nation to legalize recreational pot. \n The proposed law allows four plants to be grown at home. Those under 18 found with less than five grams of marijuana would not face criminal charges but those who sell it or give to youth could face up to 14 years in jail. \n \"It's too easy for our kids to get marijuana. We're going to change that,\" Trudeau said. \n Officials said Canadians should be able to smoke marijuana legally by July 1, 2018. The legislation must still be approved by Parliament but with Trudeau's Liberal party holding a majority its passage in considered assured. \n The federal government set the age at 18, but is allowing each of Canada's provinces to determine if it should be higher. The provinces will also decide how the drug will be distributed and sold. The law also defines the amount of THC in a driver's blood, as detected by a roadside saliva test, that would be illegal. Marijuana taxes will be announced at a later date. \n The Canadian government closely followed the advice of a marijuana task force headed by former Liberal Health Minister Anne McLellan. That panel's report noted public health experts tend to favor a minimum age of 21 as the brain continues to develop to about 25, but said setting the minimum age too high would preserve the illicit market. \n Canadian youth have higher rates of cannabis use than their peers worldwide. \n \"If your objective is to protect public health and safety and keep cannabis out of the hands of minors, and stop the flow of profits to organized crime, then the law as it stands today has been an abject failure,\" Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told a news conference. \"Police forces spend between $2 billion and $3 billion every year trying to deal with cannabis, and yet Canadian teenagers are among the heaviest users in the western world \u2026 We simply have to do better.\" \n Goodale said they've been close touch with the U.S. government on the proposed law and noted exporting and importing marijuana will continue to be illegal. \n \"The regime we are setting up in Canada will protect our kids better and stop the flow of illegal dollars to organized crime. Our system will actually be the better one,\" Goodale said. \n But Christina Grant, a professor of pediatrics at McMaster University in Ontario, worries the government is conveying the message that marijuana is not harmful. She fears usage will go up because concerns about its safety will dissipate. \n \"One in seven youths who have used cannabis will develop an addiction to cannabis and that impacts your life, schooling, job prospects, social and emotional relationships,\" she said. \"And there is the risk of developing psychosis if you start using cannabis as a teenager. The more you use and the younger you start, you have up to four times the risk of developing some kind of psychotic illness.\" \n Former Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair, who is the parliamentary secretary to the justice minister, said officials learned from the experiences from other jurisdictions like Colorado and Washington state. \n While the government moves to legalize marijuana, retail outlets selling pot for recreational use have already been set up. Trudeau has emphasized current laws should be respected. Police in Toronto, Vancouver and other cities raided stores earlier last month and made arrests. \n The news that Canada was soon going to announce the law was noticed online last month by Snoop Dogg , who tweeted \"Oh Canada!\" Canadian folk singer Pat Robitaille released a \"Weed song\" to coincide with the government's announcement. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Canada introduces legislation to legalize marijuana"}

The IRS is giving you a reprieve until Tuesday. \n The usual April 15 deadline falls on Saturday this year. That would normally push the deadline to Monday. However, Monday is a holiday in the District of Columbia, so by law, the filing deadline is extended until Tuesday. \n Monday is Emancipation Day in the District of Columbia. It marks the day in 1862 in which 3,100 slaves living in Washington were freed. \n All the states that usually have an April 15 deadline have delayed their filing date as well. A handful of states have later deadlines. \n The IRS has already processed 101 million individual returns and has issued $229 billion in refunds. The average refund is $2,851. \n The tax agency said Thursday that nearly 40 million taxpayers have yet to file their returns. Taxpayers can request an automatic six-month extension. \n But there is no extension for paying your tax bill. If you owe additional taxes, they are still due Tuesday. \n \"With the tax deadline approaching, taxpayers shouldn't panic. The IRS has many options available to help people as they finalize their tax returns or if they need to get extra time to file,\" said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. \n As last-minute filers rush to finish their taxes, their chances of getting audited have rarely been lower. \n The number of people audited by the IRS in 2016 dropped for the sixth straight year, to just over 1 million. The last time so few people were audited was 2004. Since then, the U.S. has added about 30 million people. \n The IRS blames budget cuts as money for the agency shrunk from $12.2 billion in 2010 to $11.2 billion last year. Over that period, the agency has lost more than 17,000 employees, including nearly 7,000 enforcement agents. About 80,000 people work at the IRS. \n In 2016, the number of people audited by the IRS dropped by 16 percent from the year before. Just 0.7 percent of individuals were audited, either in person or by mail. That's the lowest audit rate since 2003. \n The higher your income, the more likely you are to be audited. The IRS audited 1.7 percent of returns that reported more than $200,000 in income. Agents audited 5.8 percent of returns that reported more than $1 million in income. \n Both audit rates were steep declines from the year before. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tax deadline pushed to Tuesday"}

The stunning declaration led a judge to set bail in the case, drawing a gasp from the packed courtroom and sending the defendant's wife to her knees. \n Tony Sanborn, who was convicted of killing his girlfriend, 16-year-old Jessica Briggs, dropped his head into his hands in apparent disbelief after Hope Cady testified that as a 13-year-old she was pressured by police and prosecutors into identifying Sanborn as the killer. \n \"They basically told me what to say,\" Cady said. \n Justice Joyce Wheeler said she'll have further proceedings before deciding whether to grant a motion to set aside the conviction and order a new trial. She set bail at $25,000, which Sanborn's family and friends posted later today to get him released. \n \"Quite frankly, I wouldn't want to go forward on a case based on her testimony,\" Justice Joyce Wheeler told the courtroom before setting bail. \"It has been conceded that she is, and was a material witness in this case. She's the only eyewitness in this case.\" \n Cady said she had juvenile charges against her at the time, and authorities threatened to send her away for years. She said her vision wasn't even good enough to have been able to make out what happened: It was later tested at 20/200, poor enough to be considered legally blind. Information about her vision was never provided to Sanborn's defense team. \n Cady's stunning admission came in a standing-room-only courtroom packed with Sanborn's supporters, including family members and friends. \n Sanborn's wife, Michelle, sank to her knees and wept after the ruling as others huddled with her. \n \"I just want to thank Justice Wheeler for being a woman of compassion and for doing the right thing, and giving me faith in our system,\" she said afterward. \n Tony Sanborn, now 44, had insisted over the years that he didn't kill Briggs, and supporters say he somehow managed to avoid becoming bitter despite being convicted as an adult and sentenced to prison for 70 years. In prison, his conduct was exemplary, and he taught classes to fellow inmates. He wed Michelle about five years ago, and he had plenty of support today. \n He entered the courtroom with tears in his eyes as the packed courtroom erupted in an ovation. His family and friends posted bail for him late this afternoon. \n Griggs' family left the courthouse without speaking to the media. \n The defense had asked for the hearing because of new evidence in the gruesome killing. \n Briggs' throat was slit and she was stabbed repeatedly before being thrown in Portland Harbor. Officials zeroed in on street kids, including Briggs' then-16-year-old boyfriend, Sanborn. \n Cady, who was the only witness, testified at trial in 1992 that she saw a group of boys surround the victim and then saw Sanborn stab her. She claimed she'd watched the event unfold from a nearby pier. \n Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber asked the judge to defer on setting bail until she could hear from the detectives and the prosecutor. He also said he'd have to recuse himself because Cady's statements conflicted with his direct knowledge of the case. \n The hearing will continue later this month. \n A criminal profiler hired by the defense said the crime was so brutal that it pointed toward a serial killer as opposed to a crime of passion involving a teenager. \n The area where the crime took place was frequented by shipyard workers, sailors and fishermen, in addition to street kids and others. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Maine man jailed for 27 years is released after witness recants"}

Alaska's Cook Inlet is home to endangered beluga whales, a significant slice of the state's wild salmon population, and along the sea floor, a spider web of petroleum pipelines. \n ANCHORAGE, Alaska >> An underwater pipeline that sprung a leak in Alaska's Cook Inlet, an area known for diverse marine life, probably dumped less than three gallons of crude oil into the ocean, the pipeline's owner said Monday. \n The spill between two production platforms owned by Hilcorp Alaska LLC was spotted Saturday. Cook Inlet stretches 180 miles from the Gulf of Alaska to Anchorage and is home to an endangered population of beluga whales. \n Hilcorp by Sunday had removed all oil from the 8-inch diameter pipeline. \n Cook Inlet is also habitat for humpback whales, the western population of Steller sea lions and northern sea otters. Harbor seals, killer whales and porpoise use the inlet. \n The Kenai Peninsula makes up the eastern side of the inlet and draws thousands of anglers every summer seeking halibut in the inlet or salmon in ocean water and streams. \n The spill volume was estimated from the size of sheens that were seen, said company spokeswoman Lori Nelson in an emailed response to questions. The sheens dissipated, Nelson said. \n In three flyovers Sunday and a final one Monday morning, no additional sheens were spotted from the air. \n Hilcorp, the Coast Guard and state environmental authorities over the weekend formed a unified command in response to the spill that was suspended Monday, said Candice Bressler, spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. \n The leak's cause was unknown. \n The leak is the second in Cook Inlet this year for Hilcorp Alaska, a subsidiary of Houston-based Hilcorp. \n In an unrelated incident, processed natural gas continues to spew into the inlet from an underwater pipeline that supplies four other production platforms. \n The platforms burn natural gas for power. That leak was discovered in February and company officials estimate it has been leaking since mid-December. \n Hilcorp says the gas leak will be repaired after floating ice no longer poses a threat to divers who would perform repairs. \n The oil leak was discovered Saturday when workers on the Anna Platform \"felt an impact,\" according to the DEC. They spotted an oil sheen and bubbling in the water near one of the platform's legs. \n The suspected leaking line connects Anna Platform with Bruce Platform in 75 feet of water. \n The 1.6-mile line has a capacity of 19,362 gallons and was full. Hilcorp Alaska shut down the platform and lowered pressure in the pipeline to zero. \n Overflights spotted six sheens. The largest was 10-by-12 feet. \n Bressler said Hilcorp used a polyurethane \"pig,\" a device inserted into the pipe, to push remaining crude oil toward the Bruce Platform. It was processed and moved to a tank farm. \n Hilcorp has detected no harm to wildlife, Nelson said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pipeline owner says Alaska spill was less than 3 gallons"}

Prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty in exchange for Rams waiving his right to a jury trial. \n Misfortune has befallen those close to Rams. His ex-girlfriend was shot and killed in 2003. His mother died in 2008, her passing ruled a suicide. And his 1-year-old son, Prince McLeod Rams, died in his father's care on a court-ordered visitation. \n \"Either he's the most unlucky bastard on this planet, or he's a killer,\" Prince's mother, Hera McLeod, said in 2012. She fled the relationship with her one-time fiance about two weeks after Prince was born. \n Prosecutors don't buy the bad luck theory and now believe Rams is responsible for all three deaths. They said Rams killed his son in an effort to collect more than $500,000 in life insurance he had taken out on the boy. \n Rams, who has been jailed awaiting trial since 2013, has maintained his innocence. He says Prince died after suffering a fever-induced seizure during just the fourth visit without supervision that Rams had been permitted. \n Prosecutors said Prince was either drowned or suffocated and that the kind of seizures Prince suffered are not fatal. \n Rams was on trial only for the death of his son. Prosecutors were barred from presenting evidence about the death of his ex-girlfriend, Shawn Mason, and his mother, Alma Collins. \n In all three deaths, life insurance was involved. Rams collected more than $150,000 in insurance on his mother's death, and prosecutors say he tried to collect on a policy connected to Mason's death. \n Prosecutors suggested at trial that Rams hatched the plan to kill his son about the time he was running out of money from the payout on his mother's policy. \n Rams took out three separate policies on his son, totaling more than $500,000. Defense lawyers presented testimony from an insurance agent who said he persuaded Rams to take out the largest of the three policies as a way to save for his son's college education. \n Defense lawyers also raised questions about whether Prince died of natural causes. The medical examiner who conducted the autopsy concluded that Prince drowned. But her boss at the time, Virginia chief medical examiner William Gormley, overturned the finding for the first time in his career and changed the cause of death to \"undetermined.\" He said that although Prince's death was suspicious, he could not rule out the possibility that Prince died of natural causes. \n Other medical experts testified that the fluid in Prince's lungs and intestines was not evidence of drowning but instead the remnants of the hour-long life-support effort to revive the boy, which included administering large amounts of fluids. \n Medical experts for prosecutors said fever-induced seizures are common in boys Prince's age and are not fatal. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Father convicted of murdering infant son for life insurance in Virginia"}

The Pentagon said U.S. forces in Afghanistan dropped the military's largest non-nuclear bomb on an Islamic State target in Afghanistan. \n WASHINGTON >> U.S. forces in Afghanistan on Thursday struck an Islamic State tunnel complex in eastern Afghanistan with \"the mother of all bombs,\" the largest non-nuclear weapon ever used in combat by the U.S. military, Pentagon officials said. \n The bomb, known officially as a GBU-43B, or massive ordnance air blast weapon, unleashes 11 tons of explosives. When it was developed in the early 2000s, the Pentagon did a formal review of legal justification for its combat use. \n The Pentagon said it had no early estimate of deaths or damage caused by its attack, which President Donald Trump called a \"very, very successful mission.\" \n The U.S. military headquarters in Kabul said in a statement that the bomb was dropped at 7:32 p.m. local time Thursday on a tunnel complex in Achin district of Nangarhar province, where the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State group has been operating. The target was close to the Pakistani border. \n The U.S. estimates 600 to 800 IS fighters are present in Afghanistan, mostly in Nangarhar. The U.S. has concentrated heavily on combatting them while also supporting Afghan forces battling the Taliban. Just last week a U.S. Army Special Forces soldier, Staff Sgt. Mark R. De Alencar, 37, of Edgewood, Maryland, was killed in action in Nangarhar. \n The MOAB is a custom-made Air Force weapon that has been in the arsenal for more than a decade but never used on the battlefield, although it was available throughout the Iraq war. It is designed to hit softer targets such as surface facilities, tunnel entrances and troop concentrations. It is pushed out the rear of the launching aircraft, guided to its target by GPS and slowed by a parachute. \n A separate non-nuclear weapon known as the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or MOP, which is larger in its physical dimensions but carries a smaller load of conventional explosives, is designed to take out deeply buried targets like reinforced bunkers. The MOP has never been used in combat. \n In its 2003 review of the legality of using the MOAB, the Pentagon concluded that it could not be called an indiscriminate killer under the Law of Armed Conflict. \n \"Although the MOAB weapon leaves a large footprint, it is discriminate and requires a deliberate launching toward the target,\" the review said. It added: \"It is expected that the weapon will have a substantial psychological effect on those who witness its use.\" \n Adam Stump, a Pentagon spokesman, said the bomb was dropped from a U.S. MC-130 special operations transport. He said the bomb had been brought to Afghanistan \"some time ago\" for potential use. \n Army Gen. John W. Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said in a written statement that the strike was designed to minimize the risk to Afghan and U.S. forces conducting clearing operations in the Achin area \"while maximizing the destruction\" of IS fighters and facilities. He said IS has been using improvised explosive devices, bunkers and tunnels to strengthen its defenses. \n \"This is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive against ISIS-K,\" he added, using the U.S. military's acronym for the IS affiliate. \n Ismail Shinwari, the governor of Achin district, said the U.S. attack was carried out in a remote mountainous area with no civilian homes nearby and that there had been no reports of injured civilians. He said there has been heavy fighting in the area in recent weeks between Afghan forces and IS militants. \n White House spokesman Sean Spicer said IS fighters had used the tunnels and caves in Achin to maneuver freely. \n \"The United States takes the fight against ISIS very seriously and in order to defeat the group we must deny them operational space, which we did,\" Spicer said. \n Government: 36 Islamic State fighters killed by massive bomb \n KABUL, Afghanistan >> Afghanistan officials say the U.S. attack on a tunnel complex in eastern Afghanistan with the largest non-nuclear weapon ever used in combat by the U.S. military has left 36 Islamic State group fighters dead. \n There were no civilian casualties, according to the Ministry of Defense statement, which also said that several IS caves and ammunition caches were destroyed. \n Hakim Khan, 50, a resident of Achin district where the attack took place, welcomed the attack on ISIS, saying: \"I want 100 times more bombings on this group.\" \n The bomb, known officially as a GBU-43B, or massive ordnance air blast weapon, unleashes 11 tons of explosives. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. drops 'mother of all bombs' on IS tunnel"}

Dao was not there. \n The 69-year-old physician from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, was forcibly removed by police from a plane Sunday at Chicago's O'Hare Airport after refusing to give up his seat on the full flight to make room for four airline employees. \n Cellphone video of him being pulled down the aisle by his arms and footage of his bloody face have created a public-relations nightmare for United. \n One of Dao's five children, Crystal Pepper, said the family was \"horrified, shocked and sickened\" by what happened. She said it was made worse by the fact that it was caught on video. \n Demetrio, who indicated Dao is going to sue, said the industry has long \"bullied\" passengers by overbooking flights and then bumping people, and \"it took something like this to get a conversation going.\" \n \"I hope he becomes a poster child for all of us. Someone's got to,\" the lawyer said. \n Early on, United CEO Oscar Munoz added to the furor when he apologized for the incident but accused Dao of being belligerent. Later, Munoz offered a more emphatic mea culpa, saying, \"No one should ever be mistreated this way.\" \n He promised to review the airline's policies to make sure something like that never happens again, and said United will no longer use police to remove bumped passengers. The airline also said all passengers on the flight would get a refund. \n In a statement issued immediately after Thursday's news conference, United insisted that Munoz and the airline called Dao numerous times to apologize. Munoz himself said on Wednesday that he had left a message for Dao. \n But Demetrio said neither Dao nor his family had heard from United. \n Demetrio said that his client accepts United's apology, but that the airline seemed to have issued it because it was taking a PR \"beating.\" \n The attorney was unable to say precisely how Dao was injured.

{"date": "April 13, 2017", "text": "BEIRUT >> A misdirected airstrike by the U.S.-led coalition earlier this week killed 18 allied fighters battling the Islamic State group in northern Syria, the U.S. military said today. \n U.S. Central Command said coalition aircraft were given the wrong coordinates by their partner forces, the predominantly-Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, for a strike intended to target IS militants south of their Tabqa stronghold, near the extremists' de facto capital, Raqqa. \n The strike hit an SDF position instead, killing 18. Central Command said the strike was launched Tuesday. \n Several nations have lent their air power to the U.S.-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State group. It was not clear which air force was behind the strike. \n The SDF acknowledged the strike today, saying a number of its fighters were killed and wounded. \n The SDF-linked Hawar News Agency reported the group was holding funerals for 17 of its fighters in the border town of Tal al-Abyad, though it did not link them to the strike. An activist-run group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, says three days of mourning have been declared for the town. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 25 SDF fighters were killed in the last two days of battle. \n The SDF meanwhile announced the launch of a fourth phase of their campaign to capture Raqqa, a Euphrates River city that is home to 300,000 people. \n The SDF, with U.S.-led air and ground support, has surrounded Tabqa, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Raqqa. They say they are working to clear Islamic State militants out of Jalab Valley, north of Raqqa. \n The SDF says it wants to isolate Raqqa before attacking it. Their closest position is less than 8 kilometers (5 miles) northeast of the city. But the countryside south of Raqqa is still under IS control. It is unclear how many stages are planned for the campaign. \n In a separate development, the international chemical weapons watchdog is testing samples from a suspected nerve gas attack that killed at least 87 people in Syria last week and could produce a report on the matter within three weeks, the British delegation to the commission said today. \n The report comes one day after Russia vetoed a Western-backed U.N. Security Council resolution demanding a speedy probe into the April 4 attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun, which has been widely blamed on government forces. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said the veto left Moscow, a key ally of the Syrian government, with \"a lot to prove.\" \n The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has a standing fact-finding mission on Syria to investigate alleged chemical weapons attacks, but does not apportion blame. The OPCW's executive council held a session of its executive council today to address the attack on Khan Sheikhoun, in the northern rebel-held province of Idlib. \n Britain's delegation to the OPCW tweeted from the executive session that the \"Fact Finding Mission is working to gather evidence\" and has already started testing samples in a lab. \n The U.S. blamed the Syrian government for the attack and fired 59 missiles at an air base in central Syria in response, killing nine people. \n Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he expected the OPCW to conduct an extensive probe into the attack, and insisted the organization visit both Khan Sheikhoun and the air base struck by U.S. missiles. \n Russia has said chemicals were released in Khan Sheikhoun when a Syrian airstrike hit an insurgent arms factory that contained chemical weapons. Syria has denied ever using chemical weapons. \n The Syrian army said hundreds of Islamic State fighters as well as civilians were killed when a U.S.-led coalition airstrike hit a militant position in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour. \n It said white smoke billowing from the area of the strike turned yellow, \"most likely because of the explosion of a large warehouse containing large quantities of toxic substances.\" It said that the airstrike showed that militants have chemical weapons in their possession. \n Opposition activist Omar Abu Laila, who is from Deir el-Zour and currently lives in Europe, denied that report. Abu Laila is with Deir Ezzor 24, an activist group that has reporters throughout the eastern province. \n Associated Press writers Sylvia Hui in London and Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report.  \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Misdirected U.S. strike killed 18 allied fighters in Syria"}

Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking at a parliamentary panel on national security and diplomacy, warned Thursday that North Korea may be capable of firing a missile loaded with sarin nerve gas toward Japan. \n TOKYO >> Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned Thursday that North Korea may be capable of firing a missile loaded with sarin nerve gas toward Japan, as international concern mounted that a missile or nuclear test by the authoritarian state could be imminent. \n \"There is a possibility that North Korea is already capable of shooting missiles with sarin as warheads,\" Abe told a parliamentary panel on national security and diplomacy. \n Abe was responding to a question about Japan's readiness at a time of increased regional tension. A U.S. navy aircraft carrier is heading toward the Korean Peninsula as Pyongyang prepares for the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founder Kim Il Sung this weekend. \n Citing Syria where dozens of people died recently in an alleged sarin nerve gas attack, Abe said Japan should take the example seriously, stressing the need to strengthen its deterrence against the North. \n North Korea, which is not a signatory to the international Chemical Weapons Convention, has been producing chemical weapons since the 1980s and is now estimated to have as many as 5,000 tons, according to a South Korean defense white paper. Its stockpile reportedly has 25 types of agents, including sarin. \n Experts say if North Korea were to attack South Korea, it would likely target Seoul's defenses with chemical and biological weapons dropped from aircraft or delivered via missiles, artillery and grenades. \n Japan, under its postwar constitution, has limited the role of its military to self-defense only and relied on the U.S. for offensive and nuclear capability. But recently, Abe's ruling party has proposed that Japan should bolster its missile defense, including upgrading the capability to shoot down an enemy missile and acquiring the capacity to attack the base it was fired from. \n With President Donald Trump's administration not ruling out a military option to dealing with North Korea, \"tension is certainly rising,\" Abe said Wednesday to a group of lawmakers from his ruling party who sought increased safety measures for Japanese nationals in case of an emergency. \n ___ \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "North Korea may be capable of sarin-loaded missiles"}
