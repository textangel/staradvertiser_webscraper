{"date": "April 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Mexico's former Veracruz state Gov. Javier Duarte, left, was escorted by an agent of the local Interpol office inside a police car as they arrive in Guatemala City. \n GUATEMALA CITY >> A former governor who had become a symbol of government corruption in Mexico was transferred to a Guatemalan military prison today hours after being captured in a hotel following six months on the lam.  \n Ex-Veracruz state Gov. Javier Duarte looked pale and visibly tired as he was brought to the military base in Guatemala's capital guarded by two dozen police officers. Prosecutors in Mexico directed the Foreign Relations Department to request his extradition to his homeland, where he is wanted on suspicion of money laundering and organized crime. \n Duarte, 43, captured Saturday in Panajachel, a picturesque tourist town on Lake Atitlan in Guatemala's highlands, with the cooperation of that country's police and Interpol office, a statement from Mexico's federal Attorney General's Office said. \n \"I have no comment, thank you,\" the former Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, governor said to a question from the Associated Press as he entered the prison. \n Duarte is accused of running a corruption ring that allegedly pilfered millions of dollars from Veracruz's coffers. State officials say schools, hospitals and other public institutions were stripped of resources under Duarte's government and that of his predecessor. \n Manuel Noriega, deputy director of Interpol in Guatemala, said Duarte would be presented before a judge to consider his possible extradition. \n Political analyst Alejandro Hope said it is difficult to judge whether Duarte's capture \u2014 the second in a week of a high-profile, fugitive former PRI governor \u2014 will boost PRI President Enrique Pena Nieto's image in fighting corruption. \n \"In the best case it will give him a small boost in the short term but it also draws attention to the corruption of the governors,\" said Hope. And \"he knows a lot of things about a lot of people.\" \n Duarte was governor of Veracruz from 2010 until he left office Oct. 12, 2016, two months before the scheduled end of his term, saying he was doing so in order to face the allegations against him. \n At the time he denied having links to phantom businesses that allegedly won state contracts, and said he had not stolen a single peso of state money or diverted government funds overseas. \n \"I don't have foreign accounts,\" he said last year. \"I don't have properties anywhere.\" \n Duarte promptly disappeared and had been sought by Mexican authorities ever since. Earlier this year, Interpol issued a notice for his capture. \n The Mexican government has found millions of dollars purportedly linked to Duarte, frozen more than 100 bank accounts and also seized property and businesses tied to the former governor. A reward of 15 million pesos ($730,000) had been offered for his capture. \n While on the lam, Duarte was supported by a network of Mexicans who helped him evade justice, Omar Garcia Harfuch, head of the Criminal Investigation Agency in Mexico's Attorney General's Office, told a press conference Sunday. \n Garcia Harfuch said investigators \"identified many homes, telephone numbers and vehicles related to people who supported Javier Duarte from Mexico City in the logistics of his stay and movement in Guatemala.\" \n \"During the investigation, it came to light that various private airlines offering services to the region were charged with transporting (Duarte) to different points in Guatemala,\" he said. \n Authorities were tipped off to his presence in Guatemala by the Nov. 10, 2016 detention of a person at the airport in the border city of Tapachula. The person was carrying two passports with photographs of the ex-governor and his wife but with different names. \n Garcia Harfuch did not provide the names of the people helping Duarte from Mexico City. But authorities in Mexico vowed to recover the money Duarte allegedly stole and bring to justice his accomplices. \n \"Justice will be done,\" said new Veracruz Gov. Miguel Angel Yunes, a bitter critic of Duarte. \"Let there be no mercy for those who were merciless to the people of Veracruz. There will be no pardon.\" \n The detention comes a week after Tomas Yarrington, the former governor of Mexico's Tamaulipas state, was arrested in Italy, also on allegations of organized crime and money laundering. \n Another ex-governor, Cesar Duarte of Chihuahua state, is also wanted on suspicion of corruption and is said to have fled to El Paso, Texas. He is not related to Javier Duarte. \n All three ex-governors were members of Pena Nieto's ruling PRI. \n The party, which expelled Javier Duarte on Oct. 25, 2016, and has sought to distance itself from him, applauded the arrest. \n \"The PRI calls for all the relevant investigations to be carried out and, respecting due process, for the ex-governor of Veracruz to be punished in an exemplary fashion, as well as anyone who is confirmed to have taken part in his criminal ring,\" the party said in a statement. \n Duarte became a powerful symbol of alleged corruption during midterm elections last year in which the PRI lost several governorships, including Veracruz, that it had held uninterrupted since its founding in 1929. \n Duarte also has been widely criticized for rampant violence in the state during his administration, as drug cartels warred for territory and thousands of people were killed or disappeared into clandestine graves in cases that mostly remain unsolved. The dead include at least 16 journalists slain in Veracruz during his six years in office. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fugitive Mexican ex-governor moved to Guatemalan prison"}

The U.S. moves an immense warship to the waters off the peninsula in a display of military might. President Donald Trump warns he's ready to \"solve North Korea,\" while North Korea's deputy foreign minister says his country will conduct its next nuclear test whenever it sees fit. \n And in Pyongyang, where war would mean untold horrors, where neighborhoods could be reduced to rubble and tens of thousands of civilians could be killed, few people seem to care much at all. \n Today, the city's zoo was crowded, playgrounds were full of children and families strolled along downtown sidewalks speckled with the falling blossoms of apricot trees. At the city's annual Kimilsungia flower show \u2014 held to celebrate Saturday's 105th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's founding ruler, Kim Il Sung, and the purple orchid named for him \u2014 thousands crowded around the displays, many using cellphones to take photos of friends and family. \n In a country where the propaganda is all-encompassing, and where the same family has held power for three generations, every display mixed bright flowers with reminders of Kim Il Sung or the nation that his grandson, Kim Jong Un, now rules. So there were dioramas of Kim Il Sung's birthplace, photos of him meeting foreign leaders, paintings of new housing developments \u2014 and models of missiles. \n And there was Chong Ok An, a retiree pushing her way through the crowds with her family. \n \"We're not afraid,\" she said. \"As long as we have Marshall Kim Jong Un we can win any fight.\" \n Her response reflected the phrasing of North Korean propaganda, as well as the reality that every person here has heard talk of war for decades. The Kim family has entrenched its rule by portraying the country as being relentlessly under siege, leaving its people unable to distinguish between daily hyperbole and the reality of an increasingly tense situation. \n The same unending hyperbole has affected South Koreans as well. They have heard North Korean warnings of their destruction for so long that the threats barely even register. \n While interest in North Korea spikes immediately after a missile launch, within hours internet search traffic is again dominated by TV comedy shows, taxes and real estate. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tension spikes over N.

On Sunday he recalled \"all those forced to leave their homelands as a result of armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, famine and oppressive regimes.\" \n The church's first pontiff from Latin America voiced concern over the \"political and social tensions\" in the world as well as the \"scourge of corruption\" on his home continent. Francis also mentioned hostilities and famine plaguing parts of Africa. \n Speaking of Europe's problems, Francis cited the continued conflict and bloodshed in Ukraine and prayed for hope for those struggling with high unemployment, especially young people. \n Traditionally, the pope gives no homily during the late-morning Easter Mass, saving his reflections for the \"Urbi et Orbi\" message at noon. \n But Francis broke with that tradition, giving an off-the-cuff homily during Mass about what he described as a nagging question for many faithful: Why are there so many tragedies and wars if Jesus has risen from the dead, a belief that Christians celebrate each Easter? \n \"The Church never ceases to say, faced with our defeats, our closed and fearful hearts, 'stop, the Lord is risen.' But if the Lord is risen, how come these things happen?\" Francis asked. \n He gestured toward the potted hyacinths, tulips and daffodils, which came from the Netherlands, and which were arranged in neat rows on the steps leading to the church. \n Easter \"isn't a party with lots of flowers. This is pretty, but it's not this, it's more than this,\" Francis said. \n He said having faith on Easter gives sense in the middle of \"so many calamities: the sense of looking beyond, the sense of saying, look, there isn't a wall, there's a horizon, there's life, there's joy.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pope decries 'vile' attack on Syrians in Easter address"}

The 26-year-old Waikiki man has been charged with second-degree murder. \n Read more \n \u00a0 \n Yu Wei Gong was charged Sunday after police arrested him following his release from the hospital. A judge confirmed his bail at $2 million and set his preliminary hearing for Wednesday. \n Detectives recovered the human remains at the Waikiki apartment Gong shared with his mother. \n According to a court document, police identified through fingerprints the human remains to be that of Gong's mother, Liu Yun Gong. A deputy medical examiner determined Gong died of blunt force injuries to her head. The manner of death was classified as a homicide. \n On the morning of April 11, Gong called 911 and told a dispatcher he was suicidal and that he killed his mother in September. He said \"it was an accident and he didn't mean to do it,\" according to a court document. \n Police arrived at his apartment at 414 Launiu St. where Gong told an officer his mother was in the freezer in the kitchen. \n Police found several plastic trash bags inside.

He was also registered at Honolulu Community College in 2014. \n Julie Kim, owner of Spa Royal Hawaiian in Waikiki, said Gong's mother started working at her establishment as a licensed massage therapist in February 2016. \n The last time Kim spoke to Gong was eight months ago. \n She last saw Gong on the night of Aug. 20 after they finished work. Gong told her \"see you tomorrow\" as she headed home after work. \n When Gong didn't show up at work the following day, Kim repeatedly called her cell phone but she didn't answer. \"Usually she responds very quick,\" Kim said of Gong who worked on-call at the spa. \n Kim later received a call from Gong's son who told her his mother went to a neighbor island and that she left her phone at home. He told her his mother was expected to be there for a couple of months. \n Gong previously had her own massage therapy business, Liu Yun China Massage, at the Century Center. \n ", "author": "By Rosemarie Bernardo rbernardo@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Human remains in Waikiki apartment confirmed to be suspect's mom"}

Cleveland police say they are searching for Stephens, a homicide suspect who broadcast the fatal shooting of another man live on Facebook on Sunday, April 16, 2017. \n CLEVELAND >> In a rambling video, Steve Stephens said, \"I snapped, I just snapped.\" But as the manhunt dragged on today for the man accused of posting Facebook footage of himself killing a Cleveland retiree, police were unable to explain what set him off. \n \"Only Steve knows that,\" Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said as authorities posted a $50,000 reward for Stephens' capture in the shooting of Robert Godwin Sr., a 74-year-old former foundry worker. \n In the video, Stephens blamed a former girlfriend he had lived with, saying he woke up last week and \"couldn't take it anymore.\" But in a statement today, the woman shed little light on what might have gone wrong and said Stephens was good to her and her children. \n As for the shooting victim, Godwin appeared to have been selected at random, gunned down while picking up aluminum cans Sunday afternoon after spending Easter with some of his children. \n A manhunt that started in Cleveland's gritty east side expanded rapidly into a nationwide search for Stephens, a 37-year-old job counselor who worked with teens and young adults, police said. \n \"He could be nearby. He could be far away or anywhere in between,\" FBI agent Stephen Anthony said. \n Law enforcement officials said his cellphone signal was last detected on Sunday afternoon in Erie, Pennsylvania, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Cleveland. \n Police reported getting dozens and dozens of tips, and nine schools in Philadelphia were locked down today while authorities investigated possible sightings of Stephens. But they said there was no sign he was actually there. \n Some of those who know Stephens described him as pleasant and kind, while some said he had a gambling problem. He filed for bankruptcy two years ago. \n \"He got along with everybody, so it's just unbelievable what happened,\" said Alexis Lee, a friend who saw Stephens last week. \n The police chief said: \"We are not going to pinpoint a specific thing and say this is what triggered this, because we don't know.\" \n Godwin's daughter said he was killed while collecting cans in a plastic shopping bag. \n \"Not because he needed the money, it was just something he did,\" said 52-year-old Debbie Godwin. \"That's all he was doing. He wasn't harming anyone.\" \n She said her father, who had 10 children, was a gentle man with nothing mean about him. \n In the shooting video, Stephens told Godwin a woman's name and said, \"She's the reason that this is about to happen to you.\" The victim did not seem to recognize the woman's name. The gunman then pointed a weapon at Godwin, who shielded his face with the plastic bag. \n The woman Stephens spoke of, Joy Lane, said in a text to CBS that \"we had been in a relationship for several years. I am sorry that all of this has happened.\" She said Stephens was \"a nice guy\" who was generous to everyone. \n The video of the killing was on Facebook for about three hours before it was taken down. \n Investigators said that Godwin was the only victim so far linked to Stephens, despite his claim in a separate video on Facebook that he killed over a dozen people. \n Detectives spoke with Stephens on Sunday by cellphone and tried to persuade him to surrender, police said. \n Stephens worked at Beech Brook, a social service agency in suburban Cleveland that deals with vulnerable young people. He helped them gain job skills and find employment, said Beech Brook spokeswoman Nancy Kortemeyer. \n An extensive background check before he was hired turned up nothing worrisome, she said. \n Stephens filed for bankruptcy in January 2015.

{"date": "April 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Supporters of Justice and Development party wave Turkish flags and hold a poster of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan outside its offices in Istanbul, Sunday, April 16, 2017. \n ISTANBUL >> \n Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared victory in Sunday's referendum that will grant sweeping powers to the presidency, hailing the result as a \"historic decision.\" \n Speaking to reporters in Istanbul, Erdogan said unofficial results showed the \"yes\" side had won by a margin of 1.3 million votes. \n The president struck a conciliatory tone, thanking all voters regardless of how they cast their ballots and describing the referendum as a \"historic decision.\" \n \"April 16 is the victory of all who said yes or no, of the whole 80 million, of the whole of Turkey of 780,000-square kilometers,\" Erdogan said. \n Returns carried by the state-run Anadolu news agency showed that with nearly 99 percent of the vote counted, the \"yes\" vote had about 51.3 percent compared to 48.7 percent for the \"no\" vote. \n Turkey's main opposition party vowed to challenge the results reported by Anadolu agency, saying they were skewed. \n Erdogan has long sought to broaden his powers, but a previous attempt failed after the governing party that he co-founded fell short of enough votes to pass the reforms without holding a referendum. \n Opponents argued the plan concentrate too much power in the hands of a man they allege has shown increasingly autocratic tendencies. \n The outcome is expected to have a huge effect on Turkey's long-term political future and its international relations. Although the result, if officially confirmed, would fall short of the sweeping victory Erdogan had sought, but nevertheless cements his hold on the country's governance. \n Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, whose position will be eliminated under the presidential system of government called for in the referendum, also welcomed the results and extended a hand to the opposition. \n \"We are all equal citizens of the Republic of Turkey,\" he said. \"Both the ones who said 'no' and the ones who said 'yes' are one and are equally valuable.\" \n \"There are no losers of this referendum. Turkey won, the beloved people won,\" Yildirim said, adding that \"a new page has opened in our democratic history with this vote. Be sure that we will use this result for our people's welfare and peace in the best way.\" \n Erdogan supporters gathered outside the AK Party headquarters in Istanbul to celebrate, sending fireworks into the night sky. \n But the main opposition People's Democratic Party, or CHP, cast doubt on the results. CHP vice chairman Erdal Aksunger said they would challenge 37 percent of the ballot boxes. \n \"Our data indicates a manipulation in the range of 3 to 4 percent,\" the party said on its Twitter account. \n The country's pro-Kurdish opposition party, which also opposed the constitutional changes, said it plans to object to two-thirds of the ballots. \n An unprecedented decision by Turkey's Supreme Election board to accept as valid ballot papers that don't have the official stamp also drew the ire of the CHP, with the party's deputy chairman, Bulent Tezcan, saying the decision had left the referendum \"with a serious legitimacy problem.\" \n The board made the announcement after many voters complained about being given ballot papers without the official stamp, saying ballots would be considered invalid only if proven to have been fraudulently cast. \n Sunday's vote approved 18 constitutional changes that will replace Turkey's parliamentary system of government with a presidential one, abolishing the office of the prime minister and granting sweeping executive powers to the president. The changes will come into effect with the next general election, scheduled for 2019. \n The reforms allow the president to appoint ministers, senior government officials and half the members of Turkey's highest judicial body, as well as to issue decrees and declare states of emergency. They set a limit of two five-year terms for presidents and also allow the president to remain at the helm of a political party. \n Erdogan and his supporters had argued the \"Turkish-style\" presidential system would bring stability and prosperity in a country rattled by a failed coup last year that left more than 200 people dead, and a series of devastating attacks by the Islamic State group and Kurdish militants. \n But opponents fear the changes will lead to autocratic one-man rule, ensuring that the 63-year-old Erdogan, who has been accused of repressing rights and freedoms, could govern until 2029 with few checks and balances. \n The ballots themselves did not include the referendum question \u2014 it was assumed to be understood. Voters used an official stamp to select between \"yes\" and \"no.\" \n At one Istanbul polling station, eager voters lined up outside before it opened at 8 a.m. \n \"I don't want to get on a bus with no brake system. A one-man system is like that,\" said Istanbul resident Husnu Yahsi, 61, who said he was voting \"no.\" \n In another Istanbul neighborhood, a \"yes\" voter expressed full support for Erdogan. \n \"Yes, yes, yes! Our leader is the gift of God to us,\" said Mualla Sengul. \"We will always support him. He's governing so well.\" \n Erdogan first came to power in 2003 as prime minister and served in that role until becoming Turkey's first directly elected president in 2014. \n The referendum campaign was divisive and heavily one-sided, with the \"yes\" side dominating the airwaves and billboards across the country. Supporters of the \"no\" vote have complained of intimidation, including beatings, detentions and threats. \n The vote comes as Turkey has been buffeted by problems. Erdogan survived a coup attempt last July, which he has blamed on his former ally and current nemesis Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric living in the United States. Gulen has denied knowledge of the coup attempt. \n Still, a widespread government crackdown has targeted followers of Gulen and other government opponents, branding them terrorists and a state of emergency has been imposed. \n Roughly 100,000 people \u2014 including judges, teachers, academics, doctors, journalists, military officials and police \u2014 have lost their jobs in the government crackdown, and more than 40,000 have been arrested. Hundreds of media outlets and non-governmental organizations have been shut down. \n Turkey has also suffered renewed violence between Kurdish militants and security forces in the country's volatile southeast, as well as a string of bombings, some attributed to the Islamic State group, which is active across the border in Syria. \n The war in Syria has led to some 3 million refugees crossing the border into Turkey. Turkey has sent troops into Syria to help opposition Syrian forces clear a border area from the threat posed by Islamic State militants. \n Meanwhile, Turkey's relations with Europe have been increasingly tense, particularly after Erdogan branded Germany and the Netherlands as Nazis for not allowing Turkish ministers to campaign for the \"yes\" vote among expatriate Turks. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Turkey's Erdogan claims referendum win; critics call fraud"}

{"date": "April 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Assemblyman Evan Low, D-Campbell, addresses lawmakers at the Capitol in Sacramento, Calif. In an effort to increase voter participation by targeting teenagers, Low has authored a measure to lower the voting age to 17. \n SACRAMENTO, Calif. >> Donald Trump's characterization of Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists during his presidential campaign angered Heidi Sainz, whose family is from Mexico and who has close friends who are immigrants. She was also upset that she couldn't do anything about it at the ballot box because she was a year shy of being able to vote. \n Sainz favors a bill in the California Legislature that would lower the voting age to 17, which she thinks would give a voice to more people affected by the outcome of elections. \n \"Looking at all the protests throughout this year throughout all the high schools across the nation, we could see a lot of the minors were protesting because they felt as if they didn't have a voice,\" said Sainz, a senior at Inderkum High School in Sacramento. \n Lawmakers in more than a dozen states are trying to increase voter participation by targeting young people. Their bills are among nearly 500 pieces of legislation introduced around the country this year to make voting easier, according to a March analysis by New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. \n While Republican-leaning states have moved to tighten voting rules \u2014 nearly 90 such bills have been introduced \u2014 those efforts have been outstripped by the number of bills seeking to expand access to the polls. \n \"A lot of young people last year wanted to make their voices heard but were unable to do so because the rules prohibited them,\" said Jonathan Brater, counsel with the nonpartisan Brennan Center Democracy Program. \n \"That has certainly renewed interest in making the system more accessible,\" Brater said. \n Democrats and Republicans have supported efforts to expand access, particularly online registration. But it's mostly Republicans who are pushing restrictions such as requiring photo identification at the polls. \n Roughly 20 states are considering voter ID laws this year that supporters say prevent fraud and boost public confidence in elections. Critics say such laws target minorities and the poor, who might not have driver's licenses and find it difficult to obtain them. \n Recent voting expansion efforts include automatic registration and extending absentee voting opportunities. \n Republicans control the governorship and legislature in 25 states and so far have been relatively successful in pushing through the more restrictive laws. Democrats control just a half-dozen states. \n In California, where Democrats command a supermajority in the Legislature and control the governor's mansion, lawmakers say they want to take the lead in expanding voting access as other states move to restrict it. \n The bill to lower the voting age to 17 proposes an amendment to the state Constitution. Passage would require a two-thirds vote in the Legislature and approval by voters. \n Assemblyman Evan Low, the bill's author, believes now is a good time to lower the voting age. Britain's vote to leave the European Union and the ouster of South Korea's president have shown people the importance of voting and holding public servants accountable, Low said. \n The Silicon Valley Democrat also pointed to the election of Trump, whom Low and his Democratic colleagues routinely criticize. \n \"We've realized that democracy is relatively fragile,\" Low said. \n Lowering the voting age could help foster a sense of civic duty before teens move away from home to attend college or start a job and become less motivated to vote, he added. \n Tyler Christensen, one of Sainz's classmates at Inderkum High School, said he's torn on the issue. \n \"I liked the idea when I was 17,\" said Christensen, who turned 18 in February. \"But now that it doesn't matter for me anymore, I feel like a lot of people are still too immature.\" \n Sen. Joel Anderson, a Republican from the San Diego area, said he supports encouraging young people to vote but opposes some approaches pushed by Democrats. \n He voted against a 2014 bill that legalized preregistration of 16- and 17-year-olds because he worried it would make voter rolls less accurate and lead to voter fraud. He thinks Low's proposed amendment to lower the voting age is simply an effort to get more Democratic votes. \n \"Every poll that I've seen says that young people tend toward voting for Democrats, so I believe that it's self-serving,\" he said. \"It can't just be about gaming elections for your own support.\" \n In Iowa, two Republicans introduced bills this year to expand teen voting. One bill would have allowed 17-year-olds to vote in primaries if they turned 18 by the general election. The other would have allowed Iowans to preregister to vote when they turn 16. Both bills stalled, but the primary voting provision has since been added to a voter ID bill advancing through the Legislature. \n The same reforms were proposed by Democrats in Minnesota, but they have since stalled in the Republican-controlled state Senate. Jack Joa, a high school student who suggested letting 17-year-olds vote in primaries, said he was preregistered but was turned away at his polling place during Minnesota's August primary because he was not yet 18. \n Joa said he spent hours a day for months researching policies in other states and studies on teen voter participation before he took his proposal to lawmakers. Joa is a Democrat but has worked on multiple campaigns for Republicans and Democrats in the state Legislature, as well as the Democratic presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. \n \"I felt that the people that turned 18 by the general but weren't able to vote in the primary would feel disenfranchised,\" he said. \n The Nevada Legislature is also considering letting 17-year-olds preregister to vote. \n \"Early pre-registration is one way of getting youth and teens more engaged in the civics process early on,\" said state Senate Majority Leader Aaron Ford, a Las Vegas Democrat who proposed the bill. \n Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, declined to comment on the measure. \n He has previously vetoed proposals to establish same-day voting registration and automatic registration through the Department of Motor Vehicles. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lawmakers across U.S. move to include young people in voting"}

His comments come as rebel forces appear close to launching an assault to capture the Islamic State group's de facto capital of Raqqa. \n H.R. McMaster spoke to ABC's \"This Week\" from Afghanistan.

But it hasn't been clear about troops. \n Last week, Trump appeared to rule out deeper American military intervention in Syria beyond retaliatory strikes if Syria's president continued to attack civilians with chemical weapons. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "McMaster casts doubt on U.S. sending more troops to Syria"}

{"date": "April 16, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, left, was briefed by U.S. Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of the United Nations Command, U.S. Forces Korea and Combined Forces Command, in the Demilitarized Zone near the border village of Panmunjom, South Korea. \n PANMUNJOM, South Korea >> U.S. Vice President Mike Pence declared Monday the \"era of strategic patience is over\" with North Korea, expressing impatience with the speed and willingness of the regime to move toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. \n Pence told reporters near the Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea that President Donald Trump is hopeful that China will use its \"extraordinary levers\" to pressure the North to abandon its weapons. \n Pence, who has called the North's failed missile test a day earlier \"a provocation,\" said the U.S. and its allies will achieve its objectives through \"peaceable means or ultimately by whatever means are necessary\" to protect South Korea and stabilize the region. \n Pence visited a military base near the DMZ, Camp Bonifas, for a briefing with military leaders and to meet with American troops stationed there. The joint U.S.-South Korean military camp is just outside the 2.5-mile-wide DMZ. \n His visit, full of Cold War symbolism, and his remarks to reporters come amid increasing tensions and heated rhetoric on the Korean Peninsula. While the North did not conduct a nuclear test, the specter of a potential escalated U.S. response trailed Pence as he began a 10-day trip to Asia. \n Pointing to the quarter-century since North Korea first obtained nuclear weapons, the vice president said a period of patience followed. \n \"But the era of strategic patience is over,\" Pence said. \"President Trump has made it clear that the patience of the United States and our allies in this region has run out and we want to see change. We want to see North Korea abandon its reckless path of the development of nuclear weapons, and also its continual use and testing of ballistic missiles is unacceptable.\" \n Trump himself asserted on Sunday that China was working with the United States on \"the North Korea problem.\" His national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said the U.S. would rely on its allies as well as on Chinese leadership to resolve the issues with North Korea. \n McMaster cited Trump's recent decision to order missile strikes in Syria after a chemical attack blamed on the Assad government as a sign that the president \"is clearly comfortable making tough decisions.\" But at the same time, McMaster said on \"This Week\" on ABC, \"it's time for us to undertake all actions we can, short of a military option, to try to resolve this peacefully.\" \n The bottom line, McMaster said, is to stop the North's weapons development and make the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free. \"It's clear that the president is determined not to allow this kind of capability to threaten the United States. And our president will take action that is in the best interest of the American people,\" he said. \n After a two-month policy review, officials settled on a policy dubbed \"maximum pressure and engagement,\" U.S. officials said Friday. The administration's immediate emphasis, the officials said, will be on increasing pressure on Pyongyang with the help of Beijing. \n The officials weren't authorized to speak publicly on the results of the policy review and requested anonymity. \n Pence will be tasked with explaining the policy in meetings with leaders in South Korea and Japan during the trip, which will also include stops in Indonesia and Australia. He will aim to reassure allies in South Korea and Japan that the U.S. will take appropriate steps to defend them against North Korean aggression. \n A North Korean missile exploded during launch on Sunday, U.S. and South Korean officials said. The high-profile failure came as the North tried to showcase its nuclear and missile capabilities around the birth anniversary of the North's late founder and as a U.S. aircraft carrier neared the Korean Peninsula. \n A White House foreign policy adviser traveling with Pence said no U.S. response to the missile launch was expected because there was no need for the U.S. to reinforce the failure. The adviser spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration's initial understanding of the launch. \n Trump, spending the Easter weekend at his Florida resort, reinforced his commitment to the armed forces under his control. \"Our military is building and is rapidly becoming stronger than ever before,\" he tweeted. \n More directly on North Korea, the president returned to a theme of placing much onus on China for reining in the North. Last week, he said he would not declare China a currency manipulator, pulling back from a campaign promise, as he looks for help from Beijing, which is the North's dominant trade partner. \n \"Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem? We will see what happens!\" Trump tweeted on Sunday. \n Deputy national adviser K.T. McFarland briefed the president on the failed missile launch. She advised patience with China on the issue. \n \"North Korea is a liability to everybody and it's a threat not just to the United States, not just to South Korea, not just to Japan, not just to Russia, but it's actually a threat to China as well,\" McFarland said Sunday on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \n Into this tense environment, Pence made his first trip to the region since taking office in January. After arriving in the South Korean capital, he placed a wreath at Seoul National Cemetery and then worshipped with military personnel at an Easter church service at the U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan. \n During a fellowship meal after the services, he said the tensions on the Korean peninsula had put into sharp focus the importance of the joint U.S.-South Korean mission. \n \"This morning's provocation from the North is just the latest reminder of the risks each one of you face every day in the defense of the freedom of the people of South Korea and the defense of America in this part of the world,\" said Pence. \"Your willingness to step forward, to serve, to stand firm without fear, inspires the nation and inspires the world.\" \n Along with the deployment of the U.S. aircraft carrier and other vessels into waters off the Korean Peninsula, thousands of U.S. and South Korean troops, tanks and other weaponry were deployed last month in their biggest joint military exercises. That led North Korea to issue routine threats of attacks on its rivals if they show signs of aggression. \n The White House foreign policy adviser traveling with Pence told reporters that the type of missile that North Korea tried to fire on Sunday was medium-range, and that it exploded about 4 to 5 seconds after it was launched. \n The North regularly launches short-range missiles, but is also developing mid-range and long-range missiles meant to target U.S. troops in Asia and, eventually, the U.S. mainland. \n North Korea has conducted five nuclear tests, including two last year. Recent satellite imagery suggests the country could conduct another underground nuclear test at any time. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pence warns North Korea that 'era of strategic patience is over'"}

Ten years after a mentally ill student fatally shot 32 people at Virginia Tech, survivors and families of the slain are returning to campus to honor the lives that were lost that day. \n BLACKSBURG, Va. >> Ten years after a mentally ill student fatally shot 32 people at Virginia Tech, survivors and families of the slain are returning to campus to honor the lives that were lost that day. \n Virginia Tech is holding a series of events today to mark the anniversary of the deadly campus shooting on April 16, 2007. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine will be among the 10,000 to 20,000 people expected at the Blacksburg campus for the solemn occasion. \n Kaine, who was governor at the time of the shooting, said he still vividly remembers the horrors of that day, but has also grown close to many of the survivors and the victims' families. \n \"We're going with a lot of different emotions, but we wouldn't be anywhere else,\" said Kaine, who is attending the service with his wife, Anne Holton. \n The shooting at Virginia Tech was, at the time, the deadliest mass shooting in recent U.S. history. A massacre that claimed 49 lives at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub surpassed it last year. It forced schools across the country to rethink campus security and reignited the debate over gun control that rages to this day. \n Sunday's events include a wreath-laying ceremony around 9:43 a.m. \u2014 the time when Seung-Hui Cho's rampage in Norris Hall began. It will be followed by a commemoration event featuring remarks from Kaine and a reading of the names and biographies of the 32 slain students and faculty members. \n Later, students, faculty and visitors will gather for a candlelight vigil. At 11:59 p.m., a candle at the April 16 memorial that was lit at midnight will be extinguished and carried into Burruss Hall. The events were planned by current students over the last 18 months, said Mark Owczarski, a Virginia Tech spokesman. \n Leading up the anniversary, the atmosphere on campus has been one of reflection and remembrance, Owczarski said. Most of the current students were in elementary school when the shooting occurred, but understand that the \"tragedy is part of Virginia Tech,\" he said. Counselors have been stationed at commemoration events throughout the weekend to provide support. \n \"It is together \u2013 as a community \u2013 that we endure difficult times,\" Tech President Tim Sands said in a recent email to students and staff. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Virginia Tech marking 10 years after shooting that killed 32"}
