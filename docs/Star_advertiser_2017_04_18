{"date": "April 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2012 \n Smoke rises in this time exposure image from the stacks of the La Cygne Generating Station coal-fired power plant in La Cygne, Kan. The Environmental Protection Agency today asked a federal appeals court in Washington to postpone consideration of 2012 rules requiring energy companies to cut emissions of toxic chemicals. \n WASHINGTON >> The Trump administration is once again seeking to scuttle cuts to pollution from coal-fired power plants. \n The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday asked a federal appeals court in Washington to postpone consideration of 2012 rules requiring energy companies to cut emissions of toxic chemicals. \n The agency said in a court filing it wants to review the restrictions, which are already in effect. Nationally, most utilities are already on pace to comply with the new standards. \n It is the latest in a string of moves by President Donald Trump's appointees to help companies that profit from burning of fossil fuels. \n Last week EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced he would seek to rewrite Obama-era rules limiting water pollution from coal-fired power plants. The agency also sought to roll back tighter restrictions on pollution from coal mines. \n Trump has pledged to reverse decades of decline in a U.S. coal industry under threat from such cleaner sources of energy as natural gas, wind turbines and solar farms. The president has also said he doesn't agree with the consensus of climate scientists that carbon emissions from fossil fuels is the primary cause of global warming. \n Coal burned to generate electricity is also the nation's largest source of mercury pollution, which when inhaled or ingested by pregnant women can harm the development of infant brains. \n Though Congress passed legislation enabling tighter mercury restrictions in 1990, implementing rules to carry out the policy of the law has been stalled for decades by legal wrangling and utility lobbying. \n After EPA finalized the new rules four years ago, the agency was sued by a coalition of conservative states and industry groups. Pruitt, who as Oklahoma's attorney general was tightly aligned with oil and gas companies, was among those who filed suit. \n The Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that the EPA did not adequately consider the costs and benefits of the plan. But the justices let the rule stay in effect and returned it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for further review. \n The appeals court left the rule intact while the EPA considered its costs. The agency issued new findings last year, upholding its prior position that the human health benefits of reducing mercury in the environment far outweighed the costs of installing new filters on power-plant smoke stacks. \n Though the EPA now appears to be reversing course, environmental groups pledged to defend the restrictions in court. \n Graham McCahan, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, said the tighter standards are already saving thousands of lives every year. \n \"Virtually every power plant in America is already in compliance with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards,\" he said. \"Weakening them would be a serious threat to the safety of our food, air and water.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "EPA seeks to scuttle cleanup of coal power plant pollution"}

{"date": "April 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / APRIL 12 \n Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks to the media during a shared press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following their talks in Moscow, Russia. \n WASHINGTON (AP) >> Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declared the Iran nuclear deal a failure today but left open the possibility the Trump administration will uphold it nonetheless. \n The top American diplomat sought to reinforce the notion that the U.S. is aggressively countering Iran's destabilizing behavior throughout the Middle East, even though President Donald Trump so far has not pulled out of the deal. Tillerson spoke a day after certifying to Congress that Iran is complying with its obligations under the 2015 deal, a requirement for Tehran to continue receiving relief from nuclear sanctions. \n \"The JCPOA fails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran,\" Tillerson said, using an acronym for the 2015 nuclear deal. \"It only delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state.\" \n He said the deal, brokered by former President Barack Obama's administration along with other world powers, represented the \"same failed approach\" the U.S. has taken to North Korea. Like with the North, Tillerson said, the Trump administration was unwilling to be patient with Iran, ticking through a list of countries where he said Iran was supporting terrorism and violence. \n Tillerson's hastily arranged statement before cameras at the State Department reflected the competing forces pulling at the Trump administration as it develops its policy toward Iran. On the one hand, Trump wants to show he's being tougher than Obama toward Iran, but on the other hand, he's not yet ready to rip up the deal. \n Trump as a candidate vowed to discard or renegotiate the pact, and shortly after taking office his administration put Tehran \"on notice\" that its troublesome behavior would no longer be tolerated. But neither Iran nor the other world powers that negotiated the agreement have any interest in re-opening the deal, and U.S. companies stand to lose billions if the deal is scuttled. \n Proponents of the deal have long acknowledged it doesn't address concerns about Iran's non-nuclear behavior, such as its ballistic missile program or support for Houthi rebels in Yemen. Obama and others argued it was narrowly tailored to take the most dangerous prospect \u2014 a nuclear-armed Iran \u2014 off the table. \n The deal's critics, though, say it fails to achieve even that goal because key restrictions on Iran's nuclear development sunset after a decade or more. With some of those critics now in office, Tillerson's comments today marked the first time that position has been echoed by the U.S. government. \n Still, since taking office, Trump has stopped promising he'll gut the deal. Tillerson said that decision will be made as part of a governmentwide review of Iran policy currently under way. \n \"The Trump administration has no intention of passing the buck to a future administration on Iran,\" Tillerson said. \n In an ominous warning, Tillerson linked Iran's behavior to that of North Korea and said that with both countries, the U.S. would no longer engage in \"strategic patience.\" The U.S. has been exploring ways to address the threat of North Korea's nuclear program, which is significantly farther along than Iran's. \n \"An unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea \u2014 and to take the world along with it,\" Tillerson said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tillerson declares the Iran nuclear deal a failure"}

{"date": "April 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic candidate for Georgia's Sixth Congressional seat Jon Ossoff talks with supporters at a campaign field office. \n DUNWOODY, Ga. >> A narrow miss by a Democratic newcomer in a conservative Georgia House district has triggered a high-stakes runoff that could test President Donald Trump's influence and the limits of the backlash against him. \n Democrat Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old former congressional aide fueled by a colossal fundraising haul from out-of-state donors, came within two percentage points of an outright victory Tuesday over 17 other candidates in Georgia's traditionally Republican 6th Congressional District. \n Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state, lagged in a distant second, qualifying her for the runoff. Well known to voters, Handel had treated Trump gingerly in a district the president barely carried, but declared Wednesday she'd like to see him campaign for her ahead of the June 20 runoff. \n \"We want everybody who is supportive of Republicans, so absolutely,\" Handel told The Associated Press after taking a congratulatory call from Trump on Wednesday. \"We are going to be united from this point going forward.\" \n Trump, who attacked Ossoff in recent days as a liberal shill and mocked him for living outside of the district, crowed on Twitter about the outcome in Georgia following Democrats' failure to win a different special election in Kansas last week. \n \"Dems failed in Kansas and are now failing in Georgia. Great job Karen Handel! It is now Hollywood vs. Georgia on June 20th,\" Trump wrote, alluding to celebrity donors to Ossoff. \n Still, the close finishes in Georgia as well as conservative Kansas underscored Democrats' potential to capitalize on surging liberal energy following Trump's election, even as they also pointed to the limits of how far Democrats can go in Republican-friendly districts. \n The Kansas and Georgia races also serve notice that GOP candidates may struggle to handle Trump, who alienates many independents and even some Republicans. In fact, Trump arguably gave Ossoff his opening in the first place; Trump barely won the Georgia 6th in November and failed to win a majority, four years after Republican Mitt Romney got more than 60 percent of the presidential vote. \n Both major parties are approaching the runoff in Georgia as an important test ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats have a long-shot chance of taking back control of the House next year and breaking the GOP's monopoly control of Washington. But it will require picking up more than 20 seats and winning over droves of voters like those in the affluent, well-educated 6th District of Georgia. \n Winning such a seat will depend on Ossoff keeping voters like Shari Springle engaged in the race. The 54-year-old organized a Facebook group, \"Liberal Moms of Roswell and Cobb,\" in 2015. She says it proliferated since Trump's victory, with several members acting as precinct captains for Ossoff. \n Springle's take Wednesday was simple: \"Let's get to work.\" \n But she'll run up against Handel backers like 82-year-old Bev Wingate. The Dunwoody retiree and Handel volunteer says Republicans were too cautious in the primary for fear they'd \"step on toes.\" Now, she says, she's free to ask all her friends and neighbors to be \"on our team.\" \n DuBose Porter, chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party, said the district offers the perfect setting for Democrats to prove their momentum heading into 2018. \"If we can get over 50 percent in this district, we know we can do that statewide and around the country,\" Porter said, mocking Republican assertions that Ossoff failed Tuesday by falling short of an outright primary victory. \n \"Only the Republicans could try to define this as a defeat for the Democrats,\" said Porter. \n At the White House, spokesman Sean Spicer tried to do exactly that. \"The reaction has somewhat been, you know, that they almost won. No, they lost!\" Spicer said. \"They spent $8.3 million dollars and threw everything including the kitchen sink at it, and lost.\" \n Spicer did not mention that outside Republican groups also plowed millions into attacking Ossoff and encouraging GOP turnout; a political action committee backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and other House GOP leaders accounted for at least $2.2 million. \n As for whether Trump will campaign with Handel, Spicer said: \"We'll see if we're needed.\" \n Other Republicans saw clear warning signs in Tuesday night's outcome. GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, an ally of House leadership, said congressional Republicans must start showing they can lead after the failure of their health care legislation, or risk voters snatching away their majorities. \n \"The Democratic base is totally engaged, totally fired up, and anybody that thinks that is going to go away I think is whistling past the political graveyard,\" Cole said. \"The only way you fight that is \u2026 fire up the Republican base. And to do that, strangely enough, you have to govern.\" \n For his part, Ossoff said for weeks his goal was to win outright, but he rejected any notion that he lost. \"We have defied the odds \u2026 shattered expectations,\" Ossoff told supporters, adding that they'd \"carry us to victory\" in June. \n The runoff victor will succeed Republican Tom Price, who resigned to join Trump's administration as health secretary. Price won 62 percent of the vote in November, about 14 percentage points ahead of Trump's total. \n More tests await, with special elections approaching in Montana and South Carolina in May and June. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Runoff in Georgia House race could test Trump, opposition"}

{"date": "April 18, 2017", "text": "U.S. NAVY VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS / 2012 \n Lt j.g. Marquette Leveque, left, and Lt. j.g. Kyle McFadden, both of the USS Wyoming, receive their pins to indicate that they're qualified to serve on submarines in a ceremony at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia. With women now serving on submarines, future subs are being built to specifically accommodate gender differences including height, reach and strength. \n PROVIDENCE, R.I. >> Every submarine in the U.S. fleet was designed with the height, reach and strength of men in mind, from the way valves are placed to how display screens are angled. \n That's going to change. \n With women now serving aboard submarines, defense contractor Electric Boat is designing what will be the first Navy subs built specifically to accommodate female crew members. \n The designers are doing the obvious things, such as adding more doors and washrooms to create separate sleeping and bathing areas for men and women and to give them more privacy. But they are also making more subtle modifications that may not have been in everyone's periscope when the Navy admitted women into the Silent Service. \n For example, they are lowering some overhead valves and making them easier to turn, and installing steps in front of the triple-high bunk beds and stacked laundry machines. \n The first vessel built with some of the new features is expected to be delivered to the Navy in 2021, the future USS New Jersey. \n The Navy lifted its ban on women on submarines in 2010, starting with officers. About 80 female officers and roughly 50 enlisted women are now serving on subs, and their numbers are expected to climb into the hundreds over the next few years. \n For now, the Navy is retrofitting existing subs with extra doors and designated washrooms to accommodate women. But Electric Boat in Groton, Connecticut, is at work on a redesign of the Navy's Virginia-class fast-attack subs and is also developing a brand-new class of ballistic-missile submarines, relying on body measurements for both men and women. \n \"We have a clean sheet of paper, so from the ground up, we'll optimize for both men and women,\" said Brian Wilson, Electric Boat director of the new ballistic-missile sub program. \n Electric Boat officials had no immediate estimate of how much the modifications will cost. \n As anyone who watches war movies knows, submariners are always turning valves, whether to operate machinery, redistribute water between tanks or isolate part of a system that has been damaged. \n On the Columbia-class boats, valves will generally be placed lower, Wilson said. Sometimes there will be an extension handle, and some will be easier to turn. Sailors will be able to connect their masks into the emergency air system at the side of passageways, instead of overhead. \n Emergency air masks are being moved on fast-attack submarines, too, but the bulk of the changes on those subs are to ensure privacy. \n Seats in the control room on the ballistic-missile submarines will adjust forward a little more so everyone can touch each display and reach every joystick. Steps will be added so shorter people can climb into the top bunk or see into the washers and dryers, since clothes that get stuck in the machines are a fire hazard. \n The first Columbia-class ballistic-missile sub is scheduled to join the fleet in 2031. \n At 5-foot-6, Lt. Marquette Leveque, one of the first women to serve on a submarine, said that she didn't have any trouble reaching valves and other equipment but that the ergonomic changes will be helpful for shorter crewmates. \n Leveque was assigned to a compartment with two other female officers on the USS Wyoming. They shared a washroom with male officers. A sign on the door could be flipped to show whether a man or woman was using it. \n With so few women on board, the timesharing worked, she said. But with more on the way, the need for separate spaces is greater, she added. \n \"Privacy is important anywhere you are,\" she said. \"We live on this boat, as well as work there.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "U.S. Navy redesigning its subs to accommodate women"}

{"date": "April 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A U.S. flag hangs at the Franco American Heritage Center as a woman enters to attend the local high school's pre-prom fashion show in Lewiston, Maine. \n LEWISTON, Maine >> Richard Rodrigue stood in the back of a banquet hall, watching his blond-haired, blue-eyed daughter mingle among her high school classmates. These teenagers speak dozens of languages, and hail from a dozen African nations. \n They fled brutal civil war, famine, oppressive regimes to find themselves here, at an ordinary high school pre-prom fete in this once-dying New England mill town, revived by an influx of some 7,500 immigrants over the last 16 years. Rodrigue smiled and waved at his daughter, proud she is a part of it: \"It will help her in life,\" he said. \"The world is not all white.\" \n Rodrigue believes the refugees resuscitated his town \u2014 plugging the population drain that had threatened to cripple it, opening shops and restaurants in boarded-up storefronts. But he also agrees with Donald Trump that there should be no more of them, at least not now. America is struggling, he says, and needs to take care of its own before it takes care of anyone else. \n His working-class community, built along the banks of the Androscoggin River in the whitest state in America, is a place that some point to as proof that refugee integration can work. And yet for the first time in 30 years, voters in Androscoggin County chose a Republican for president, endorsing Trump's nativist zeal against the very sort of immigrants who share their streets and their schools. \n Rodrigue knows he was born on the winning end of the American dream. His grandfather fled poverty in Quebec and moved to Maine to toil his whole life in the textile mills. He never learned English, faced hate and discrimination. Two generations later, Rodrigue owns a successful security company, lives in a tidy house in a quiet neighborhood and makes plans to send his daughter to college. \n Immigration worked for him. But it feels different today, as the county of 107,000 people tries to find its footing. The sprawling brick mills that line the river sit mostly shuttered. A quarter of children grow up poor. Taxpayers pick up the welfare tab. So Trump's supporters here tie their embrace of his immigration clampdown to their economic anxieties, and their belief that the newcomers are taking more than they have earned. \n \"There's got to be a point in time when you have to say, 'Whoa, let's get the working people back up. Let's bring the money in. But they keep coming, keep coming,\" Rodrigue said. \n His community has been an experiment in immigration and all that comes with it \u2014 friendships, fear, triumphs, setbacks \u2014 and he knows that Trump's presidency marks another chapter in that struggle for the American soul. \n \"I guess it just boils down to: What's enough? Is that wrong? Am I wrong? Am I bad? That's how I feel.\" \n \u2014 \n No one invited the Somali refugees to Lewiston. \n They fled bullets and warlords to eventually be chosen for resettlement in big American cities, where they were unnerved by the crime and drugs and noise. \n In early 2001, a few refugee families struggling to afford housing in Portland ventured 30 miles north and found a city in retreat. Empty downtown stores were ringed by sagging apartment buildings no longer needed to house workers because so few workers remained. \n The refugees saw possibility in Lewiston's decay. Word spread quickly, and friends and families followed. The town morphed in a matter of months into a laboratory for what happens when culture suddenly shifts. Maine's population is 94 percent white, and its citizens were abruptly confronted with hundreds of black Muslims, traumatized by war and barely able to speak English. \n Ardo Mohamed came to Lewiston in 2001. She fled Mogadishu in the 1990s, when militiamen burst into the home she shared with her parents and nine siblings, and started shooting. She watched her father die, as the rest of the family escaped into the woods. They wound up in overcrowded refugee camps, separated for years, then finally Atlanta, then Lewiston. Now she fries sambusas with her sister at a shop she owns downtown. \n \"We wanted to be safe,\" said the mother of five, \"just like you do.\" \n When the refugees began arriving, Tabitha Beauchesne was a student at Lewiston High School. Her new classmates were poor, but Beauchesne was poor, too. She grew up in a struggling family in housing projects downtown. It felt to her then, and it still feels to her now, that the refugees got more help than her family. \n \"They just seemed to take over,\" she said. She doesn't consider herself racist, though acknowledges that race and religion likely play a role in her sense that the refugees overwhelmed her community. The African Muslims, many of whom wear hijabs, stand out far more than her French-Canadian ancestors did when they arrived generations ago, she said. \n That perception \u2014 one of being inundated by a culture so different from her own \u2014 ingrained in her a sense of injustice so deep it persists to this day. She's now a stay-at-home mother of two, and she left Lewiston to move to another school district in the county because she believes the refugee students monopolize teachers' attention. \n Once a Barack Obama supporter, Beauchesne turned to Trump \u2014 and she cheers his efforts to curb the flow of refugees into the United States. She wants Trump to design a tax system that funnels less of her money to aiding those from other countries. \n \"I just don't like giving money away that's not benefiting me and, not to sound selfish, but then seeing it benefit other people,\" she said. \"As a business owner, my husband wouldn't donate $500 to the Salvation Army if we couldn't afford it. Our country needs to do the same thing.\" \n Taxpayers do help refugee families. Maine offers a welfare program called General Assistance, a combination of state and city funds, which provides impoverished people with vouchers for rent, utilities and food. \n In 2002, at the beginning of the immigrant influx, the city handed out about $343,000 in General Assistance funds, split almost evenly between native-born Mainers and refugees, according to city records. But rumors, largely unfounded, spread that the refugees were given free cars and apartments. Locals began calling City Hall to demand answers. \n Then-Mayor Laurier T. Raymond Jr. penned an open letter to the Somali community, asking that they divert friends and family away from a city he described as \"maxed-out financially, physically and emotionally.\" \n The letter plunged Lewiston overnight into the global political cauldron. A white-supremacist group from out of state planned a rally against the Somali \"invasion.\" Just a few people showed up. But across town 4,000 gathered in a gymnasium to support the Somalis and try to combat the reputation of Lewiston as a racist, xenophobic city that was rocketing around the world. \n And in that moment, the tide seemed to turn, deputy city administrator Phil Nadeau said. Even more immigrants came. Somali refugees gave way to those seeking asylum, from Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, a dozen nations in all. The immigrant population exploded from a handful of families to more than 7,000 people today, according to a tally by the Immigrant Resource Center of Maine. But the anxieties of old rarely seemed to resurface. \n Two years ago, immigrant children led the high school soccer team to win the state championship \u2014 a moment heralded as a triumph of cultural cooperation. Outside news crews still come from time to time, Nadeau said, and \"they're always amazed that there's nothing bad to print.\" \n But around the edges of the city, in the suburbs and small towns that fill out the rest of Androscoggin County, many quietly stewed. It's there that Trump's \"America First\" message took root. \n \u2014 \n Thirty miles up the highway, Joyce Badeau greets customers by name at the hardware store where she works. She lives just outside Livermore Falls, population 3,187 \u2014 3,035 of whom are white. She has little occasion to interact with immigrants, but her political views have been shaped by the idea of them. \n Badeau voted for Obama but backs Trump now, and points to his promise to rein in immigration as one reason why. \n \"We're becoming a poor country because we're overloaded,\" she said. \"We can't fix the system so long as we keep adding more broken pieces.\" \n She has watched the paper mills close and her neighbors lose good-paying jobs. But Badeau isn't naive; she doesn't believe Trump can make the mills roar back to life. That was a bygone era, replaced by email and iPhones. And his arrogance grates on her. But she hopes one day to turn on the news and not hear about crime and homelessness and terrorism \u2014 and she worries that someone who wants to hurt Americans might slip through porous borders. Trump promised to fix it all. If he can't, she's not sure what more America can offer immigrants. \n \"Because they're leaving one country of problems and coming into another country of problems,\" she said. \n David Lovewell used to work at a paper mill just outside of Livermore Falls that has shed hundreds of jobs. Now he runs a logging company with his sons, but he sees a dim future for them. A few months ago, business got so bad he laid off eight employees and fell behind on his $5,500 monthly payments on the machines he uses to cut down trees. \n He looked down at his sneakers, bought for $25 at Walmart. There used to be two shoe factories nearby. He wants Trump to stop his town's slow slip toward irrelevancy. \n Lovewell doesn't like to talk about immigration. He sighs and rubs his head, afraid to seem racist or indifferent to pain and poverty around the world. He went on a cruise to Belize with his wife several years ago, when he still worked at the mill and could afford a vacation. He stopped to buy a carving from an old man whose hands were so worn from years of whittling they looked like leather. He remembers those hands still, and the man's dirt-floor shack with no doors and his skinny, starving dog and the kids riding around on broken bicycles. \n \"I struggled with it, when he did the travel ban,\" Lovewell said of Trump. \"At the same time, I'm seeing \u2026 people losing their jobs. Why are we so worried about immigrants coming into our country when we can't really take care of our own people?\" \n So he's looking to Trump to strike a better balance \u2014 to build an economy where his sons don't have to battle to barely get by, and only after that design an immigration system that keeps America's promise of open arms. \n \"I guess it could sound like bigotry,\" he said. \"But we're hurting. Americans are hurting.\" \n \u2014 \n Politicians have seized on the discontent. \n Last August, candidate Trump stood on a stage in Portland and singled out the Somali community as causing a crime wave. The Lewiston police chief quickly refuted the charge \u2014 crime has decreased dramatically since the refugees arrived \u2014 but it stuck in the minds of many. \n Maine's Republican governor, Paul LePage, has called asylum-seekers \"the biggest problem in our state,\" and suggested they bring danger and disease. \n And in Androscoggin County, Republican leaders hammer the issue of refugee resettlement on their Facebook page, with post after post about the injustice they see in taxpayers helping them with assistance. They've dubbed it \"the refugee racket,\" and complain that the school system is forced to accommodate 34 languages. \n Lewiston School Superintendent Bill Webster acknowledges that does cost money. But he has a statistic he likes to share with the critics. \n Historically, Lewiston has had some of the lowest high school graduation rates in the state. Now, immigrant children are doing better than native-born kids. Some were illiterate in their native language when they set out to learn English. Yet an average of 78.3 percent of immigrant students graduate high school within five years, compared to an average of 73.3 percent of native students. \n Fifteen years ago, the school district had an enrollment of 4,500 students and falling \u2014 a sign of a city on its knees, Webster said. Today, there are 5,400 students, more than one-quarter of them immigrants, and the number is going up. And now the immigrant children who grew up here are going off to college to get degrees, as teachers, doctors, engineers. \n Several years ago, Webster and his wife sold their home in the suburbs and rented an apartment in downtown Lewiston, across the street from a mosque. They can stroll to dinner, past a yoga studio and a shop that sells artisan olive oil. There are also dozens of immigrant-owned businesses, like the Mogadishu Business Center \u2014 with two flags hanging in the window, one American and one Somali. Remaining vacant storefronts have signs in the windows, promising prospective buyers an opportunity to \"be part of Lewiston's great rebirth.\" \n \"We never have the opportunity to redo time under a different set of assumptions,\" Webster said. \"But if the immigrant population hadn't happened, Lewiston would be a community that was contracting, and potentially in a downward death spiral.\" \n Organizations that work with immigrants nevertheless must fight on to combat deep-seated distrust. Catholic Charities publishes a fact sheet called \"The Top Ten Myths about Somalis and Why They Are Wrong.\" It lists untruths like, \"Somalis are draining the welfare coffers,\" \"Somalis get free apartments,\" even \"Somalis keep live chickens in their kitchen cupboards.\" \n Maine's immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa made $136.6 million in income in 2014, and paid $40 million in taxes, according to one report from a bipartisan think-tank. But they largely work in invisible jobs, said Catherine Besteman, a professor of anthropology at Maine's Colby College. They take out trash at hotels, do the laundry at the hospital. People don't see them working, she said, so when they see them driving a car, or shopping for groceries, it becomes easy to assume they got it for free. \n That leaves some here still feeling that the immigrants take more than they deserve. \n Tabitha Beauchesne pulled a bag of bargain-brand cereal out of her kitchen cabinet to demonstrate that point. At the grocery store, she said, she sees immigrant mothers with carts piled high with name-brand food. \n \"I guess I'm jealous of that. I would love to buy my kids the real Fruit Roll-Ups,\" she said. \"But, no, sorry kids, you get the fruit packets from Walmart.\" \n \u2014 \n So Mohamed Ibrahim now knocks on doors. \n \"Hello,\" he says to strangers across Androscoggin County. \"I am a Muslim. I was welcomed by America. I was helped by General Assistance, and that was coming from your pockets and I am grateful. I became a taxpayer. I'm not taking anything. Now I am giving.\" \n He wants his neighbors to know him, to know that he is normal. Trump's election here taught him he has a lot more work to do. \n \"We thought, 'Yay, it's perfect.' But everything was slipping.\" \n Ibrahim came in 2012 from Djibouti, where he risked imprisonment for opposing his government. He is one of the thousands who have flooded into Lewiston in recent years because they are seeking asylum from oppression. \n With them came a spike in the amount of taxpayer assistance going to immigrants. Asylum-seekers, unlike resettled refugees, are barred from getting work permits for at least six months and many, like Ibrahim, must rely on government assistance to get by when they first arrive. The amount paid to immigrants jumped recently to nearly a half-million dollars. \n And there seems to be more tension in town since Trump took office.

{"date": "April 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n The Samsung Galaxy S8, top, and S8 Plus are displayed. The 5.8-inch S8 and the 6.2-inch S8 Plus both have nearly 15 percent more display space than last year's comparable models. \n NEW YORK >> Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning. But its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. \n That's how much extra you'll shell out for the S8, which starts shipping Friday for about $750 \u2014 $100 more than the iPhone 7 and last year's Galaxy S7 when it launched. A larger sibling, the S8 Plus, goes for about $850. \n True, the S8 phones come with several refinements that, totaled up, are indeed worth more than $100. But it's hard to recommend an all-frills phone when many cheaper phones do just fine. The S8 is for those who want elegance \u2014 and are willing to pay for it. \n SCREENS TO THE EDGES \n After spontaneous fires that forced the recall of the Galaxy Note 7 , Samsung is playing it safe on the battery and subjecting the S8 to tighter inspections. \n Instead, it's pushing the boundaries \u2014 so to speak \u2014 on the phone's display. Samsung minimized the phone frame and got rid of a physical home button to free up space for an \"infinity display,\" a screen that seems to flow right into the phone's curved left and right sides. \n The 5.8-inch S8 and the 6.2-inch S8 Plus both have nearly 15 percent more display space than last year's comparable models. But the phones themselves aren't wider. In fact, the phones feel more comfortable thanks to sides that curve around to the back; last year's curved S7 Edge model feels boxy by comparison. \n The bigger screen fits more lines of text, but doesn't necessarily make video more immersive. While video on YouTube and Facebook gets automatically adjusted to fill the space, Netflix and Hulu movies just leave wasted black space on all four sides. You can tinker with that manually \u2014 but for $100, you shouldn't have to. \n ALL ABOUT THE BATTERY \n The S8 and S8 Plus have more physical space inside, but Samsung used it to give the battery more breathing room while keeping its capacity roughly the same as last year. \n Though a larger display drains the battery faster, my tests of streaming video found that the new phones consumed power more slowly than last year's models. And even with constant use \u2014 taking photos, watching video and playing music and podcasts \u2014 the new phones still made it to bedtime with power to spare. Samsung credits software and chip improvements. \n UNLOCKING THE PHONES \n Like the doomed Note 7, the S8 has an iris scanner to let you unlock the phone by looking at it \u2014 at least in theory. But you have to swipe the screen first and position it from your face at just the right distance. \n I'm sure Samsung, a South Korean company, meant no offense, yet I was ticked off when the phone instructed me, an Asian-American, to \"open eyes fully.\" Oh, and the scanner doesn't work if you're wearing glasses. \n The fingerprint scanner was faster and more convenient for unlocking the phone. But you have to be careful not to smudge the adjacent camera lens by mistake now that the scanner has been moved to the back. \n FIRE THE ASSISTANT \n Samsung is introducing a digital assistant called Bixby, but voice features intended to rival Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri aren't ready yet. (Voice dictation does work with a reminder feature, though.) Bixby will also highlight appointments, trending stories and app suggestions, much as existing features on iPhones and other Android phones already offer. \n One promising feature aims to provide translations and product information using the phone's camera. It's like the Firefly feature on Amazon's derided Fire phone , and it makes the same types of dumb mistakes \u2014 it identified a can of Diet Coke as four other sodas instead. And the translation tools were incomplete at grabbing passages and failed to automatically detect the language you're translating from. \n CALCULATING THE VALUE \n Samsung throws in a pair of AKG premium headphones, valued at about $100. My ears weren't good enough to discern a difference, but it's nice to get headphones when many phone makers have stopped including them. The phone also comes with 64 gigabytes of storage, which frequently jacks up the price of other phones by $100. Those curved edges? Those also previously cost an extra $100. \n The S8 seems like a bargain for only $100 over the S7 at launch. \n But do you really need these goodies? The main camera on the S8 is about the same as last year's, so you can still get amazing photos with the S7 . (You can pick one up these days for as little as $576.) \n There's speculation that Apple will come out with a pricier, feature-rich iPhone for its 10th anniversary this year \u2014 but it's expected to update the existing iPhone 7 line as well. Those who can't live with yesterday's technology won't be disappointed with the S8. But for everyone else, Samsung could have also offered a lower-priced alternative with fewer goodies. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Galaxy S8: More screen and elegance, but a hefty price tag"}

But he told the sailors, \"as all of you know, readiness is the key. \n \"The United States of America will always seek peace but under President Trump, the shield stands guard and the sword stands ready,\" Pence told 2,500 sailors dressed in blue fatigues and Naval baseball caps on a sunny, windy morning aboard the carrier at the U.S. Yokosuka naval base in Tokyo Bay. \n \"Those who would challenge our resolve or readiness should know, we will defeat any attack and meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective American response,\" Pence said. \n Pence also said the U.S. would protect freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, the sea lanes vital to global shipping where China has been staking claim to disputed territory. \n From two continents, Pence and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warned that North Korea's latest failed missile launch was a reckless act of provocation and assured allies in Asia that the U.S. was ready to work to achieve a peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. \n Mattis denounced North Korea's attempted missile launch as he began a Middle East tour, telling reporters traveling with him to Saudi Arabia, \"the leader of North Korea again recklessly tried to provoke something by launching a missile,\" he said. The term \"reckless\" is one the North Koreans have used to describe ongoing large-scale U.S. and South Korean military exercises, which the North calls a dress rehearsal for an invasion. \n Mattis did not identify the type of missile but said it was not of intercontinental range, meaning it could not reach U.S. territory. He did not comment on what might have caused the missile to fail. \n Another official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an intelligence matter, said the missile was a Scud variant that the U.S. calls a KN-17. \n Mattis credited China with trying to help get the North Korea situation \"under control\" with the goal of denuclearizing the peninsula. \n Pence's speech on the aircraft carrier followed meetings today in Tokyo with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, where he noted that \"all options are on the table.\" \n Abe said that it was a \"matter of paramount importance for us to seek diplomatic efforts as well peaceable settlements of the issue.\" \n \"But at the same time,\" the prime minister said, \"dialogue for the sake of dialogue is valueless and it is necessary for us to exercise pressure North Korea so that it comes forward and engages in this serious dialogue.\" \n Trump and Pence, who stopped at the Demilitarized Zone dividing North and South Korea on Monday, have signaled this week a forceful U.S. stance on North Korea's recent actions. But it remains unclear what might come next. \n Behind the heated rhetoric, Trump's strategy in the region looks somewhat similar to predecessor Barack Obama's \u2014 albeit with the added unpredictability of a new president who has shown he's willing to use force. \n Pence told reporters Monday that Trump was hopeful China would use its \"extraordinary levers\" to pressure the North to abandon its weapons program. But the vice president expressed impatience with the unwillingness of North Korea to move toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. \n In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters he hopes \"there will be no unilateral actions like those we saw recently in Syria and that the U.S. will follow the line that President Trump repeatedly voiced during the election campaign.\" \n China made a plea for a return to negotiations. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said tensions need to be eased on the Korean Peninsula to bring the escalating dispute to a peaceful resolution. Lu said Beijing wants to resume the multi-party negotiations that ended in stalemate in 2009 and suggested that U.S. plans to deploy a missile defense system in South Korea were damaging its relations with China. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pence tells North Korea: 'The sword stands ready'"}

{"date": "April 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders talks with Kentucky Coffeetree Cafe owner Mary Nishimuta today in Frankfort, Ky. Sanders is in a tour of Republican states in an attempt to energize Democratic voters. \n LOUISVILLE, Ky. >> Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders urged Democrats to reach out to President Donald Trump's supporters to promote a progressive agenda that includes guaranteed health care for all Americans as part of a strategy to rebuild the party. \n Sanders told a boisterous crowd tonight in Louisville that Trump has reneged on his promises to working-class voters. He said Democrats should reach out to disillusioned Trump supporters as the out-of-power party tries to recover from last year's election losses. \n \"You don't stand with the working people of this country by supporting health care legislation that throws 24 million people off of health insurance,\" former presidential candidate Sanders said of the languishing health care overhaul backed by Trump. \n Sanders and Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez took their nationwide tour to Kentucky, where downtrodden Democrats saw their series of election losses mount last November when Republicans claimed the state House. Trump won 118 of Kentucky's 120 counties. \n Democrats who once dominated Kentucky politics have since lost the governor's mansion and majorities in both chambers of the state legislature. Republicans hold both U.S. Senate seats and all but one of the state's U.S. House seats. \n Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, called for a grass-roots resurgence in which progressives run for offices ranging from local school board to Congress. He said the party's strategy should include building a strong base in all 50 states, not just on both coasts. \n \"Real change \u2026 never, ever takes place from the top on down,\" he said. \"It is always from the bottom on up.\" \n Sanders and Perez are seeking to jump-start grass-roots opposition to Trump by focusing on such issues as raising the minimum wage, guaranteeing health insurance coverage for all and making public colleges and universities tuition-free. \n U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth, the state's only Democratic congressman, spoke in favor of a \"single-payer\" health care system, drawing sustained applause from the crowd. \n Yarmuth, who represents a Louisville-area district, said the \"single-player\" plan would loom as the biggest advantage that Democrats would have in next year's election if the national party embraces it. \n Touching on a vital issue to Kentucky's coalfields, Sanders embraced legislation to protect health care and pension benefits for tens of thousands of retired coal miners. \n He ventured into a politically volatile issue in coal-friendly Kentucky by noting that scientists are \"virtually unanimous\" in saying climate change is real and caused by human activity. Sanders endorsed efforts to transform energy policies away from fossil fuels toward sustainable energy sources. \n \"But when we do that, we do not forget about the people who kept the lights on for decades,\" he said. \n Sanders said he supports legislation that would rebuild coal-based communities hurt by the decline of coal. \n Earlier in the day, Sanders met with six Kentuckians at a Frankfort coffee shop. \n Sanders told reporters he did not come to Kentucky \"to convince anybody,\" but said it was \"absurd\" that Kentucky's elected officials, including the Senate Majority Leader McConnell, would push so hard for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. The act has resulted in more than 400,000 people getting health insurance through an expanded Medicaid program in Kentucky. \n \"I suspect that the Democratic Party here in Kentucky has not done the kind of job that it should have done,\" Sanders said. \"It's an investment. If people are getting health care, it's an investment.\" \n Most Kentucky Democrats have tried to distance themselves from the Affordable Care Act, mostly because of its association with former President Barack Obama. The exception has been former Gov. Steve Beshear, who embraced the law and delivered the Democratic response to Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress earlier this year. \n Republican Gov. Matt Bevin said Kentucky can't afford to keep the Affordable Care Act, which will cost taxpayers an extra $257 million in the state's most recent spending plan. \n \"Kentuckians have roundly rejected the ultra-liberal, anti-jobs platform of coastal elites like Sanders and Perez,\" Kentucky Republican Party spokesman Tres Watson said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Sanders urges Democrats to reach out to Trump supporters"}

{"date": "April 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Former state chemist Annie Dookhan sits in Suffolk Superior Court in Boston in Nov. 2013. Dookhan pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and falsifying thousands of tests in criminal drug cases, calling into question evidence used to prosecute the defendants. \n BOSTON >> Prosecutors moved to throw out more than 21,000 drug convictions today, five years after a chemist at the state drug lab was caught tampering with evidence and falsifying tests. \n The state's highest court had ordered district attorneys in seven counties to produce lists by today indicating how many of approximately 24,000 cases involving Annie Dookhan they would be unable or unwilling to prosecute if the defendants were granted new trials. \n The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts said tonight that 21,587 cases had been recommended for dismissal. It said that would be the largest dismissal of criminal convictions in U.S. history. \n The cases would be formally dismissed by court action, expected Thursday, the ACLU said. \n \"Today is a major victory for justice and fairness, and for thousands of people in the commonwealth who were unfairly convicted of drug offenses,\" Matthew Segal, legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, said today in a statement. \n Dookhan pleaded guilty in 2013 to obstruction of justice, perjury and tampering with evidence after being accused of falsifying her work as far back as 2004. She was sentenced to three years in prison and was paroled last year. \n Many of the drug case defendants have already completed their sentences, though some probably remain in prison because of other charges not contaminated by the lab scandal. About 2,000 cases had been resolved before today. \n Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley, whose jurisdiction includes Boston, moved on today to dismiss all but 117 of the approximately 7,500 suspect cases there. The remaining cases, he said, involve people with a history of violent crime and probation violations. \n Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe moved for dismissal of more than 1,000 cases. Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn said his office is seeking to throw out more than 1,500. \n Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said there are nine cases her office would prosecute again if a motion for a new trial were granted. \n Also affected were thousands of cases in Essex, Plymouth and Norfolk counties. \n While it's unknown how many cases Dookhan falsified, her conduct cast a cloud over the many thousands she worked on. As a result, in January, Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court said prosecutors would have to show that they could retry these cases without relying on evidence handled by Dookhan. \n Prosecutors said Dookhan admitted testing only a fraction of a batch of samples, then listing them all as positive for illegal drugs. Her motive, they said, was to boost her productivity and burnish her reputation. \n For those who have completed their sentences, wiping away their convictions will help them in other ways, such as employment, housing or immigration status, said Daniel Marx, an attorney who argued for the dismissals. \n \"Now, a majority of these wrongfully convicted individuals will have the opportunity to clear their records and move on with their lives,\" he said. \n Anthony Benedetti, chief counsel of the Committee for Public Counsel Services, said some of the defendants lost their jobs or homes and some have been deported. \n \"In many respects the damage has been done,\" Benedetti said. \"Justice delayed is justice denied.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Prosecutors move to toss more than 21,000 tainted drug cases after state chemist falsifies work"}

{"date": "April 18, 2017", "text": "CRAIG T. KOJIMA / CKOJIMA@STARADVERTISER.COM \n Hawaii lawmakers want to push a resolution to make Hawaii a sanctuary state, honoring the traditional Hawaiian value \"hookipa,\" which means to welcome visitors and strangers alike with open-hearted hospitality. \n The traditional Hawaiian value \"hookipa\" means to welcome visitors and strangers alike with open-hearted hospitality. \n That value prompted state lawmakers to push a resolution to make Hawaii a sanctuary state, honoring Hawaii's history as a home to a diverse group of immigrants who dramatically shaped the island state's economy and culture. \n The resolution recognizes the hookipa tradition and doesn't specifically use the words \"sanctuary state,\" said Democratic Rep. Joy San Buenaventura, who introduced the resolution. \n The proposal urges law enforcement agencies in Hawaii to not work with federal immigration agencies. It says they should not spend state or county funds to work with federal agencies on deporting people who live in the country without legal permission and have not been convicted of a violent crime. \n \"The idea behind the resolution is to assuage fears that people are just not going to be picked off,\" said San Buenaventura. \n \"We have a labor force that are dependent on immigrants and families that are in fact immigrants,\" she added. \"They shouldn't be scared of their own government.\" \n Lawmakers in about 15 states and the District of Columbia are pushing proposals to support sanctuary policies, while 29 states are considering policies to prohibit them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Oregon was the first to establish statewide sanctuary in 1987, and San Francisco was the first city to adopt a sanctuary policy in 1989. \n Hawaii immigration lawyer John Egan says his office has received calls from people who are afraid to answer the door because they may be in jeopardy of deportation. Many in Hawaii have family members with a mix of different immigration statuses, so \"when one person is feeling the pressure, it spreads throughout the whole family group,\" Egan said. \n Some opponents fear taking such a stance could risk federal funding, which supplies 20 percent of Hawaii's state budget. The proposal is just another way Trump opponents are trying to delegitimize the president, said Republican Rep. Gene Ward, who voted against the resolution. \n \"Hawaii's already marginalized with the Trump administration,\" Ward said. \"Why would we want to do it more? We need their money. We need their good will.\" \n The resolution was introduced in response to President Donald Trump's travel ban which suspends visas from six predominantly-Muslim countries, San Buenaventura said. \n The Senate Judiciary and Labor Committee approved the resolution Wednesday. It goes next to the full Senate for a vote, and then back to the House where it already passed to review Senate amendments. \n \"Something is wrong with a federal policy that can tear a mother away from her young children,\" Kawamoto said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hawaii resolution calls for creating sanctuary state"}

{"date": "April 18, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Democratic candidate for Georgia's Sixth Congressional seat Jon Ossoff greets supporters at a campaign field office today in Marietta. \n DUNWOODY, Ga. >> An upstart Democrat leads a special election in a conservative Georgia congressional district as he bids for a major upset, but his margin is narrowing. \n After today's evening poll closings, votes were being counted in the metro Atlanta race in which Democrat Jon Ossoff sought to parlay opposition to President Donald Trump into a victory that would rebuke the White House and embolden Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. \n With early voting totals and about a third of precincts counted, Ossoff was above the majority threshold required to win an 18-candidate primary. But tens of thousands of votes have yet to be counted in Georgia's 6th Congressional District that stretches across the northern suburbs of Atlanta, and Ossoff's lead had already started to narrow as more precincts reported. \n Republicans nationally and in Georgia acknowledged before polls opened that Ossoff would top the field today. An entire slate\u2014Republicans, Democrats and independents \u2014 appeared on one primary ballot. \n The question was whether Ossoff would command a majority to claim the seat outright. If not, he would face the top Republican vote-getter in a June 20 runoff. The winner will succeed Tom Price, who resigned to become Trump's health secretary. \n Trump took to Twitter urging Republicans to cast ballots late today. He even mocked Ossoff's choice of residence \u2014 outside the district. \n \"Just learned that Jon Ossoff, who is running for Congress in Georgia, doesn't even live in the district. Republicans, get out and vote!\" the president wrote. \n The contest is testing both parties' strategies for the upcoming national election cycle. Democrats are expected to have a better shot at snagging the typically Republican seat than they did in last week's closer-than-expected GOP victory in a Kansas special House election. \n Trump did not perform as well as other Republicans last November in the Georgia district, an affluent, well-educated swath filled with the kind of voters Democrats need if they hope to reclaim a House majority next year. Republicans currently hold a 238-193 advantage in the chamber. \n Ossoff would be a \"disaster\" in Congress, Trump declared earlier today on social media, a day after he blasted the \"super liberal\" Democrat as a champion of criminals, higher taxes and unchecked immigration. \n Despite Trump's Twitter barrage, the White House insisted the race isn't about the president. \"I wouldn't use the word referendum,\" said spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. \"I think he hopes to have a Republican elected.\" \n An investigative filmmaker, Ossoff raised more than $8.3 million, mostly from donors far from the northern suburbs of Atlanta. That sum dwarfs what any Republican candidate has spent on the contest. \n Ossoff has energized liberals and younger voters, while also aiming for disaffected independents and moderate Republicans. \n Cedrick Gulley, a 25-year-old Georgia State University student from the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs, compared Ossoff to former President Barack Obama and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. Gulley said today they all \"make me feel like my generation is being heard.\" \n He added that Democrats were \"a little lazy\" in November, but now \"there's an emergence of people fighting.\" \n Ossoff has pledged to fight Trump when he \"embarrasses\" the country. But he's also said he would \"work with anybody in Washington who respects your tax dollars.\" \n That's a nod to the Republicans and independents he'd need to win \u2014 whether today or in a runoff. \n That still wasn't enough for voters like Matt West, a 45-year-old financial planner from Roswell. \n \"He lives outside the district, he's a Democrat, and I just don't believe that he'd stand up to (House Minority Leader) Nancy Pelosi if the district wanted him to,\" West said. \n West said he voted for Republican Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state who is an establishment favorite and has led the GOP field. \n Republican groups ran a blitz of ads trying to tie Ossoff to Pelosi; a political action committee backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan has spent more than $2 million on those and other attacks. \n As for residency, Ossoff concedes that he lives just south of the district, in Atlanta, so that his girlfriend is close to her work at Emory University's medical complex. \n Among other top Republicans in the race, technology executive Bob Gray and two former state senators, Dan Moody and Judson Hill, are battling Handel in a fight for the No. 2 spot. \n Handel has maintained distance from Trump, rarely discussing him unless asked. Gray has called himself a \"willing partner\" for the president. \n National Republicans say any of the four competitive GOP candidates could defeat Ossoff in a second round. They predict conservative voters would be energized in a Republican vs. Democrat scenario. \n \"Republican voters are not going to sit by and let this district go to a Democrat,\" Handel said at one of her final campaign stops. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Democrat leads early returns in Georgia congressional race"}

Bush has been hospitalized in Houston for four days with a recurrence of a case of pneumonia he had earlier in the year, a family spokesman said today. \n The 92-year-old former president and father of former president George W. Bush has been in Methodist Hospital in Houston since Friday for observation because of a persistent cough, Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said in a brief statement. He said doctors diagnosed a mild case of pneumonia that has been treated and resolved. \n The former president \"is in very good spirits and is being held for further observation while he regains his strength,\" McGrath said. \n Bush, who served as president from 1989 to 1993, had spent 16 days in the hospital for treatment of pneumonia in January. \n He was hospitalized in 2015 in Maine after falling at his summer home and breaking a bone in his neck. He was also hospitalized in Houston the previous December for about a week for shortness of breath. He spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. \n Bush has a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a motorized scooter or a wheelchair for mobility. Despite his loss of mobility, Bush celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump in Kennebunkport, Maine. Last summer, Bush led a group of 40 wounded warriors on a fishing trip at the helm of his speedboat, three days after his 92nd birthday celebration. \n George Herbert Walker Bush, born June 12, 1924, in Milton, Massachusetts, also served as a congressman, CIA director and Ronald Reagan's vice president. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Former President George H.W.

Muhammad was arrested shortly after a shooting rampage outside a Catholic Charities building, in Fresno, Calif. today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Fresno police members walked near a shooting scene, today, in Fresno, Calif. \n FRESNO, Calif. >> A man wanted in the slaying of a security guard set out to kill as many white people as he could on Tuesday, gunning down three men on the streets of downtown Fresno before he was captured and admitted to the shootings, authorities said. \n Further reading \n Kori Ali Muhammad, 39, was arrested shortly after the morning rampage that left three white men dead, police said. Muhammad, who is black, fired 16 rounds in less than two minutes at four places within a block, shooting men who appeared to be going about their day, authorities say. \n During his arrest, Muhammad shouted \"Allahu akbar,\" but Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said the shootings had \"nothing to do with terrorism in spite of the statement he made.\" \n \"This is solely based on race,\" Dyer told reporters. \n Authorities say Muhammad first walked up to a utility truck and shot a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. employee sitting in the passenger seat. The driver of the truck, who is Latino, sped off to the police department for help, but the worker, a 34-year-old white man, died. \n Muhammad then shot at another person and missed, police said. He aimed at a third, killing the 37-year-old on the sidewalk as he walked with a bag of groceries in a neighborhood lined with tall trees, authorities say. The final victim, 58, was gunned down in the parking lot of a charity building. \n Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said Muhammad approached a vehicle in between shootings, but he spared the lives of two women who were in the car with a child. The women were Latina, he said. \n \"These individuals who were chosen today did not do anything to deserve what they got,\" Dyer said. \"These were unprovoked attacks by an individual that was intent on carrying out homicides today. He did that.\" \n Police had put out a news release hours before the shootings Tuesday, saying that Muhammad was armed and dangerous and wanted in the shooting death of a security guard at a Motel 6 last week. The guard, 25-year-old Carl Williams, was white. \n Muhammad told officers at his arrest that he was the guy they were looking for, Dyer said. \n \"I did it. I shot them,\" Dyer said Muhammad told officers. \n Police are searching for the revolver Muhammad said he tossed into a pile of clothing. The gun may have been picked up by someone else, Dyer said. \n Stephen Hughes, 66, said he and his wife rushed home Tuesday after receiving a frantic call from a neighbor. Hughes came home to see a body draped in a blanket on the sidewalk leading to his front door. \n He first thought the shooting was gang-related, but then he noticed the bag of groceries near the body. \"It looks like a guy carrying his groceries home from the store,\" Hughes said. \n On what appeared to be Muhammad's Facebook page, he repeatedly posted \"#LetBlackPeopleGo\" and encouraged \"black warriors\" to \"mount up.\" A flurry of posts emerged in the past day. \n He wrote that his \"kill rate increases tremendously on the other side\" and also posted about \"white devils.\" On several occasions, he wrote updates that included the phrase \"Allahu Akbar,\" meaning \"God is great\" in Arabic. \n Muhammad has a criminal history that includes arrests on weapons, drugs and false imprisonment charges and making terrorist threats. He had been associated with gangs. but he was not a confirmed member, police say. \n Muhammad was charged in 2005 with possessing cocaine with intent to distribute, court records show. Federal prosecutors said at the time that he was also in possession of a 9mm semi-automatic handgun and two rifles after being convicted of a felony. \n He claimed insanity, and his attorney requested a psychiatric examination for his client, saying Muhammad \"appeared eccentric with some bizarre beliefs.\" A psychiatrist who examined Muhammad believed he had psychosis, Muhammad's attorney said in the court filing. \n He also \"suffered auditory hallucinations and had at least two prior mental health hospitalizations,\" according to court documents. His attorney said that Muhammad had \"paranoia\" and thought the justice system and his defense attorney were conspiring against him, court papers said. \n The attorney who represented Muhammad in that case did not return a call for comment Tuesday. \n Public records list Muhammad as Cory Taylor and other aliases with addresses in Fresno and Sacramento. A woman who identified herself as Taylor's grandmother said Tuesday that the family last saw him on Easter Sunday. She hung up the phone before giving her name. \n Authorities spotted Muhammad running and took him into custody. Police are looking for the revolver. \n Police say two of the victims may have been clients of Catholic Charities, which provides a variety of services for refugees, the homeless and those with disabilities. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Police: Man kills 3 on Fresno street, says he 'hates white people'"}

Haerry, one of the last living crew members on the USS Arizona during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, died Sept. 27 in Rhode Island. \n PROVIDENCE, R.I. >> A veteran who survived the attack on Pearl Harbor and died last year at age 94 has been reunited with his fallen shipmates on the sunken USS Arizona. \n Raymond Haerry was interred on the ship in a ceremony that his granddaughter says was solemn and beautiful. \n Haerry was 19 years old when bombs started falling on his battleship on Dec. 7, 1941. He never returned to Pearl Harbor while he lived because the memories were too painful. As he neared the end of his life, he told his family he'd like to be laid to rest there. \n Haerry died Sept. 27 in Rhode Island. Five Arizona survivors remain. \n Haerry's granddaughter, Jessica Marino, traveled from New Jersey to Hawaii with her family for Saturday's ceremony. She handed his urn to divers, who placed it within the ship's sunken hull. Hundreds of sailors and Marines are entombed there. \n \"That was the point at which I kind of lost it,\" Marino said. \"It was really sad, but also really sweet to see. It was amazing.\" \n Only USS Arizona survivors can be interred on the ship. Haerry served for 25 years in the Navy, retiring as a master chief. \n He's the 42nd survivor to rejoin his shipmates, according to the National Park Service. \n Spokesman Jay Blount said these ceremonies help bring closure to the families, allow sailors to return to their shipmates and raise awareness of the sacrifices made 75 years ago. The National Park Service and the Navy conducted the interment. \n Rear Adm. John Fuller talked about Haerry's courage\u2014 not the absence of fear, but a deep abiding belief in something greater than oneself. \n \"I can't help but think about him being reunited into these simple, hallowed spaces. The calm that comes from being again with your crew, and the lessons we can learn from all he taught us,\" said Fuller, commander of Navy Region Hawaii and Naval Surface Group Middle Pacific. \n Marino said she knows her grandfather better now. \n \"I know this part of his life that really did shape him,\" she said. \"To be a part of getting him back to his ship and with his shipmates, it's an honor for me.\" \n Health issues prevented Raymond Haerry Jr. from joining his daughter in Hawaii. It was Haerry Jr. who pieced together the narrative of what happened in Pearl Harbor by asking questions of his father over 50 years. \n Haerry was trying to get ammunition when a large bomb detonated, igniting fuel and powder magazines, Haerry Jr. told The Associated Press in October. Most of the bow was instantly separated and the ship was lifted out of the water. \n Haerry Jr. said his father swam through flaming waters, sweeping his arms in front of him to push the flames away. He shot at Japanese planes from shore. Later, he helped retrieve corpses from the harbor. \n The ship lost 1,177 men, nearly four-fifths of its crew. At first, Haerry's family was surprised by his request to be laid to rest there, but soon they understood. \n \"That brotherhood doesn't go away and as he got closer to the end of life, it resonated with him,\" Marino said. \"He didn't want to see the site or relive that disaster, but he wanted to relive that camaraderie.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "USS Arizona survivor rejoins shipmates, interred aboard ship"}

His language was stronger than in a written statement he issued shortly after the launch, in which he simply said he was aware of the failure. \n \"The leader of North Korea again recklessly tried to provoke something by launching a missile,\" he said. The term \"reckless\" is one the North Koreans have used to describe ongoing large-scale U.S. and South Korean military exercises, which the North calls a dress rehearsal for an invasion. \n Mattis did not identify the type of missile but said it was not of intercontinental range, meaning it could not reach U.S. territory. He did not comment on what might have caused the missile to fail. \n Another official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an intelligence matter, said the missile was a Scud variant that the U.S. calls a KN-17. \n Mattis credited China with trying to help get the North Korea situation \"under control\" with the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. \n President Donald Trump in Washington and Pence at the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea have signaled a forceful U.S. stance on North Korea's recent actions. But no one was predicting what might come next. \n Behind the heated rhetoric, Trump's strategy in the region looks somewhat similar to predecessor Barack Obama's \u2014 albeit with the added unpredictability of a new president who has shown he's willing to use force. \n Pence on Monday had traveled to the tense zone dividing the two Koreas, where he warned North Korea's leaders that after years of testing the U.S. and South Korea with its nuclear ambitions, \"the era of strategic patience is over.\" \n The unannounced visit at the start of Pence's 10-day trip to Asia was a U.S. show of force that allowed him to gaze at North Korean soldiers from afar and stare directly across a border marked by razor wire. As the brown bomber jacket-clad vice president was briefed near the military demarcation line, two North Korean soldiers watched from a short distance away, one taking multiple photographs of the American visitor. \n Pence told reporters Monday that Trump was hopeful China would use its \"extraordinary levers\" to pressure the North to abandon its weapons program. But Pence expressed impatience with the unwillingness of the regime to move toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. \n In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters he hopes \"there will be no unilateral actions like those we saw recently in Syria and that the U.S. will follow the line that President Trump repeatedly voiced during the election campaign.\" \n China made a plea for a return to negotiations. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said tensions need to be eased on the Korean Peninsula to bring the escalating dispute to a peaceful resolution. Lu said Beijing wants to resume the multi-party negotiations that ended in stalemate in 2009 and suggested that U.S. plans to deploy a missile defense system in South Korea were damaging its relations with China. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pence assures Japan: America is with you '100 percent'"}

Harry Harris, who heads the Oahu-based U.S. Pacific Command, initially announced in a news release April 8 that he had directed the Carl Vinson carrier strike group to \"sail north\" from Singapore, adding that the ships were being diverted from planned port visits to Australia. \n The Trump administration cited the deployment of the naval strike force, which includes the carrier and four warships, as a clear warning to North Korea, which was said to be planning a nuclear test last weekend in conjunction with a national holiday. \n \"We are sending an armada, very powerful,\" to the waters off Korea, President Donald Trump told Fox Business News on April 12. \n A day earlier, Defense Secretary James N. Mattis told Pentagon reporters that the aircraft carrier was \"on her way up there.\" \n Some news organizations cited the armada's apparent race northward as a sign of a possible pre-emptive attack on North Korea, spurring global concerns of a possible war. \n While the Pentagon sought to downplay those reports late last week, at no point did it nor the White House suggest the Carl Vinson was not, in fact, nearing Korea to give Trump a more robust military option should he decide he needs one. \n Pundits cited the warships' approach as evidence of Trump's muscular style days after he had ordered a cruise missile strike on Syria in response to a poison gas attack, and the Air Force had dropped the so-called \"mother of all bombs\" on an Islamic State stronghold in Afghanistan. \n But on Saturday, a full week after the initial news release, the Navy posted a photograph showing the Carl Vinson transiting south through the Sunda Strait between the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java \u2014 about 3,500 miles southwest of the Korean Peninsula. \n As Defense News first reported Monday, the strike force has been taking part in exercises with Australian forces in the Indian Ocean over the past week. \n It is now \u2014 really \u2014 steaming northward and is expected to arrive in the Sea of Japan sometime next week, U.S. officials said. \n It wasn't immediately clear if the mix-up was due to a deliberate attempt to psych out North Korea's leaders \u2014 or a false narrative that resulted from miscommunications up the chain of command. \n On Sunday, North Korea attempted to test a ballistic missile, but it exploded seconds after launch. \n ", "author": "By W.J.

The mother was dead,\" said Dr. Napoleon Obana of the Veterans Regional Hospital, where some of the victims were taken. \n TV footage showed a line of rescuers and villagers, some holding on to a rope to climb up on a grassy slope with a victim on a stretcher. A throng of villagers waited in a clearing above them to help pull the victim to safety. \n Cano said a preliminary investigation showed that the bus \"lost its brakes and plunged down the ravine.\" \n Passenger Ralph Raymond Grajo said he saw the driver repeatedly stepping on the malfunctioning brakes as the wayward bus was speeding along a downhill road. The driver attempted to steer the bus to the right, but roadside houses made him veer back in the direction of the ravine as horrified passengers watched, Grajo said. \n \"All the passengers were screaming and somebody in front me told everybody 'Don't panic,' but many were already gripped by panic,\" Grajo told DZMM radio network. \n Grajo apparently fell off the bus as it rolled down the ravine and regained consciousness away from the wreckage with injuries to his feet and arms. He said he was among the first to be rescued and brought to a hospital. \n It wasn't immediately clear if the driver survived. \n The spot along the road is accident-prone. Today's accident was the sixth in the area in recent years, a local village official told DZMM. \n The impact from the plunge ripped the bus, which could no longer be distinguished at the bottom of the ravine, said Nueva Ecija's police chief Antonio Yarra.

Pennsylvania State Police said Stephens, the suspect in the random killing of a Cleveland retiree posted on Facebook, shot and killed himself after a brief pursuit today. \n ERIE, Pa. >> The man who randomly killed a Cleveland retiree and posted a video of the crime on Facebook shot himself to death in his car today during a police chase in Pennsylvania, ending a multistate manhunt less than 48 hours after it began. \n Acting on a tip, Pennsylvania State Police spotted Steve Stephens, 37, leaving a McDonald's in Erie and went after him, bumping his car to try to get it to stop, authorities said. He shot himself in the head as the car spun out of control, police said. \n \"This started with one tragedy and ended with another person taking their own life,\" said Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams. \"We would have liked to have brought Steve in peacefully and really talked to him about why this happened.\" \n Stephens, a job counselor who worked with teenagers and young people, was wanted on murder charges in the shooting of Robert Godwin Sr., a 74-year-old former foundry worker and father of 10 who was picking up aluminum cans on Sunday when he was gunned down. \n The chilling video was on Facebook for three hours before it was taken down, drawing criticism of the social network and renewing questions about how responsibly it polices objectionable material. \n At a Silicon Valley conference today, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg briefly addressed the Cleveland case, saying Facebook has \"a lot of work to do\" and \"we will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this.\" \n Police would not speculate on what was behind the killing, but in the video and other footage he posted, Stephens talked about losing everything he had to gambling and having trouble with his girlfriend. He said he \"just snapped.\" \n One of Godwin's daughters, Debbie Godwin, said she wished Stephens had been captured. \n \"I'm not happy he's dead at all, not at all. If you did it, you have to face your crime,\" she said. \n The break in the case came when police received a tip that Stephens' car was in the McDonald's parking lot in Erie, in the northwestern corner of the state, about 100 miles east of Cleveland, authorities said. The chase lasted 2 miles before Stephens took his own life, police said. \n Law enforcement officials had said on Monday that Stephens' cellphone was last tracked Sunday afternoon near Erie. \n The police chief said today that it wasn't clear whether Stephens had any help while he was on the run or where he had been and that investigators will try to retrace he steps. \n Facebook said it removed the video of the shooting 23 minutes after learning of it.

Within a day, authorities expanded the search nationwide and offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to his capture. \n Associated Press reporters Michael Rubinkam in Pennsylvania, Dake Kang and Delano Massey in Cleveland, Kantele Franko in Columbus, John Seewer in Toledo and Dan Sewell in Cincinnati contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "By Mark Gillispie / Associated Press", "title": "Facebook killer takes his own life as police close in"}
