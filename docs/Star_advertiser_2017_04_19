A federal judge blocked the order in February. \n In March, Trump issued a revised travel ban order that blocks new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries and temporarily halts the U.S. refugee program. \n Watson issued a temporary restraining order against the revised ban after the state of Hawaii filed a lawsuit challenging it. \n Hawaii says the policy discriminates against Muslims and hurts the state's tourist-dependent economy. \n Extending the judge's temporary order until the lawsuit is resolved would ensure the constitutional rights of Muslim citizens across the U.S. are vindicated after \"repeated stops and starts of the last two months,\" the state has said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Father of fallen Muslim-American soldier decries travel ban"}

The ordeal left a goose egg on Seth's temple then later a scar. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Kaydence Stromberg looks down Thursday at the rocks beneath her feet as she reflects on the the 40 minutes her brother Seth spent trapped beneath one in their backyard off Fairway Drive in Gillette, Wyo. on March 28. \n GILLETTE, Wyo. >> It started one evening late March. \n Ken Stromberg doesn't remember the exact time, but he remembers that the sun was descending into the horizon. \n He also doesn't recall exactly how many people \u2014 20, 30, maybe 50 \u2014 were in the backyard at his home in western Gillette trying to rescue his 12-year-old son, Seth, from under a 1-ton boulder. \n What he does remember is thinking that if something went wrong that, \"There's enough people, we're picking this up right now.\" \n His three oldest kids were outside playing in the backyard with their cousins that evening, but only for half an hour, he told them. They had school the next day. \n His youngest child, 1-year-old Jase, had just woken up from a nap. Ken Stromberg was trying to calm him down when he heard his kids screaming. Seth Stromberg was stuck underneath a rock. \n In that moment, Ken Stromberg didn't think much of it. The rock pile had always seemed stable. \n \"I just figured maybe one of the rocks slid down, pinched his leg or something,\" he said. \n The boulder shifted \n Seth Stromberg had been jumping on the trampoline with his sisters and cousins while throwing a tennis ball to the dogs. One throw landed the ball in a small tunnel underneath a large formation of landscaping boulders next to the trampoline. \n Seth Stromberg crawled in to get the ball while one of his cousins was walking on top of the pile. \n That's when it happened. \n One of the large boulders, estimated to weigh about a ton, shifted and trapped Seth underneath it and the rest of the pile. \n \"It fell on me and it started to slide down because the mud was wet, so it pushed on my head,\" Seth Stromberg said. \"If I tried to move, it hurt really bad.\" \n Then the screaming started. Ken Stromberg ran into the backyard and saw Seth, his head sandwiched between the dirt and the boulder, trapped but not yet crushed. \n Seth's 9-year-old sister, Kaydence Stromberg, said she wasn't worried. After all, Dad was there. \"I thought (the rock) was so light that my dad could pick it up,\" she said. \n Ken tried using a weight bar to pry the boulder off of his son, but it wouldn't budge. It did, however, help relieve some of the pressure off of Seth Stromberg's head, so Ken Stromberg held it there until help arrived. \n \"I didn't want to believe that I was going to die, but I knew it was a possibility,\" Seth Stromberg said afterward, reflecting on the ordeal. \n At the time, he was more apologetic than scared. \n \"He kept telling me, 'Sorry, just get me out of here, I'm sorry,'\" Ken Stromberg said. \"I told him, 'I'm sorry I can't get you out.'\" \n Keep calm \n Officer Ryan Mussell, a K-9 handler with the Gillette Police Department, was one of the first emergency responders to arrive, but said there wasn't much he could do before the fire department could get there. \n So he started talking to Seth Stromberg. He never left the boy's side and focused on keeping him calm. While trapped, Seth Stromberg wasn't seriously hurt. Not further disturbing what had been shown to be an unstable pile of boulders became the priority. One little shift could crush him. \n Mussell said he tried to think of what he would want someone to say to him if he were in the boy's place. \n The two talked about school, family, sports \u2014 anything to keep Seth Stromberg's mind off of the situation. Mussell admitted he was nervous, but did his best to not let that show, because anxiety and worry can be contagious. \n The rescue was a group effort between the Campbell County Fire Department, the Campbell County Sheriff's Office, the Gillette Police Department and Campbell County Health Emergency Services. It took about 40 minutes to an hour to come up with and execute a solution that would extricate Seth Stromberg unharmed. \n Fire Capt. Bryan Borgialli led the effort, and said there wasn't \"a cookie-cutter way\" to carry out the rescue. \n Ken Stromberg compared it to surgery, where one wrong move could prove to be deadly. \n \"Or Jenga,\" added Seth Stromberg. \"I thought I'd be OK if they made the right moves. But if they did one thing wrong, then .\" \n As the sky grew darker with the oncoming nightfall, Borgialli and his crew considered and dismissed several plans before deciding on one they believed would work. Even then, the plan was constantly evolving. \n They used air chisels, chains, air bags, jacks and even the Jaws of Life. \n In the end, the key piece of equipment was a come-along, a winch with a ratchet. The crew tied two 3-ton come-alongs with chains to a pair of fence posts. They also braced the boulder with wedge tools to make sure it didn't slide. \n The boulder was lifted about an inch or two, which is all it took. Using his hands, Mussell dug underneath Seth Stromberg's head to give him a little more room, and the boy slid out with nothing but a goose-egg-sized bruise on the left side of his head. \n \"You know how you lay down for a while and you're lazy and then you wake up and you stand up and you're all dizzy?\" Seth Stromberg said. \"That's how I felt.\" \n \"It was probably one of the happiest moments I've had on this job,\" said Mussell, who's been with the police department for six years. \"I went over, gave him a pat on the back and told him he'd have a story to tell his friends the next day.\" \n The fire department's rescue truck had driven into the backyard so that the crew had quick access to the tools they needed. It caused slight damage, knocking over a satellite dish and running over a gutter. \n Ken Stromberg said the fire department even offered to pay for the damages. \n \"They're not paying for anything,\" he said. \"I'll pay for it out of my own pocket. They've done enough. They did tremendous work for us.\" \n Family time \n Since that March evening, life has changed for the Stromberg family. \n \"I don't like playing out here anymore,\" said Kaydence Stromberg, pointing out that even the dogs are afraid of that area now. \n \"We told them not to come back here and climb underneath those rocks,\" Ken Stromberg said. \n \"No, Dad, you will get stuck!\" shouted 4-year-old Halle Stromberg, worried that her dad would find himself in the same position as her brother. \n And the family, which is renting the house, is looking for a new home. \n \"It just doesn't feel right anymore,\" Ken Stromberg said. \"We're going to get out of here. My wife can't look at the backyard without crying.\" \n Positive change has come out of the scare as well. Seth Stromberg thinks things through a little more before doing them, and the family has attended church every Sunday since. \n \"This just tells you how much God has power in his hands,\" Ken Stromberg said. \"If he were to let go a little bit, it's going to be a bad deal.\" \n He hopes that others also can learn from Seth Stromberg's near-death experience. \n \"The landscapers and rocks and everything, the way they do it, it makes no sense to me,\" he said. \n Decorating a lawn is never worth more than a life, and Ken Stromberg admits that \"you never think about the freak accidents\" until they happen. If anything, he said he hopes parents will use caution with their kids when around big rocks. \n He also said he hadn't been one for playing with the kids when he came home after a long day of work. That's also changed. \n \"I spend more time with my family, less time in the garage,\" he said, adding that night \"was a shock for me, but it'll make me a better dad. We've been going for walks. If they wanna go swimming, I'll go with them. I don't want to miss that chance.\" \n A happy ending \n Campbell County Health paramedics checked Seth Stromberg out at the scene. After they cleared him, he joined his sister and cousins, who were eating ice cream. \n A typical 12-year-old boy, he was feeling a little hungry. \n \"He ate the whole box of ice cream,\" Kaydence Stromberg said. \n As Seth Stromberg scooped ice cream straight out of the tub and into his mouth, it was close to 9 p.m. He'd missed the sunset, but there would be another one tomorrow. \n ", "author": "By Jonathan Gallardo Gillette News Record", "title": "Wyoming boy trapped under boulder reflects on the experience"}

Exxon Mobil is seeking permission from the U.S. government for approval to resume drilling around the Black Sea with a Russian partner, state-owned Rosneft. \n WASHINGTON >> Exxon Mobil is seeking permission from the U.S. government for approval to resume drilling around the Black Sea with a Russian partner, state-owned Rosneft, according to a person familiar with the matter. \n The oil giant's request is being reviewed by the Trump administration and is certain to draw extra scrutiny because it involves a company formerly run by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who cultivated close ties with Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. \n The drilling venture was blocked when the U.S. imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014. Exxon applied to the Treasury Department for a waiver from the sanctions in 2015, during the Obama administration, according to the person, who spoke anonymously because the application process is confidential. Exxon has publicly disclosed licenses for other work in Russia that required waivers. \n An Exxon spokesman said the company declined to comment on ongoing issues. \n The Treasury Department, which would handle Exxon's application to drill around the Black Sea, did not respond to a request for comment. \n A State Department spokesman said Tillerson has recused himself from any matters involving Exxon for two years and is not involved with any decision involving the company before any government agency. Tillerson retired as Exxon CEO at the end of last year. He has known Putin for about two decades \u2014 the Russian president awarded Tillerson a special honor in 2013. \n Irving, Texas-based Exxon disclosed in regulatory filings in 2015 and 2016 that it received three licenses from the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control to conduct \"limited administrative actions\" with Rosneft. The company said it was complying with all sanctions regarding investments in Russia. \n The sanctions were imposed after Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014. Among other things, U.S. companies were prohibited from transferring advanced technology used to drill offshore and in shale formations. Exxon was ordered to stop drilling in the Kara Sea off Russia's northern coast. The head of Exxon's Russian partner, Rosneft, was personally blacklisted. \n As Exxon CEO, Tillerson opposed the sanctions, telling shareholders in 2014 that sanctions were usually ineffective and caused \"very broad collateral damage.\" \n Tillerson and Exxon agreed to the venture with Rosneft in 2011. The Russia sanctions have cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars. Exxon reported in 2015 that its potential losses related to the Rosneft venture could run to $1 billion. \n If the sanctions are lifted Exxon could push ahead with lucrative exploration and production opportunities in the Black Sea, Siberia and the Russian Arctic. \n Exxon's ambitions could be complicated, however, by concern over what U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded were Russian cyberattacks to interfere with the U.S. presidential election last year. Congress is also investigating possible ties between aides to then-candidate Donald Trump and Russian officials. \n Exxon's critics said that if the Trump administration approved Exxon's request, which was reported first by The Wall Street Journal, then Congress should block it on environmental and national-interest grounds. \n A Greenpeace official, Naomi Ages, said approving Exxon's request to drill in the Black Sea would give momentum to drilling in the Arctic and \"would also send a message to Russia that it can intervene in any country, including the United States, with no consequences.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Exxon seeks OK to resume Russian oil venture"}

Tens of thousands of opponents of President Nicolas Maduro flooded the streets of Caracas in what's been dubbed the \"mother of all marches\" against the embattled president. \n Protesters thronged the main avenues of Caracas and other Venezuelan cities, braving bullets, tear gas and militant supporters of President Nicolas Maduro in the biggest show of opposition to his rule in months. \n The miles-long Caracas demonstration was called \"the mother of all marches\" by organizers, who rallied demonstrators from 26 points in Caracas. Opponents also took to the streets of cities including Barquisimeto, Porlamar and Maracaibo, where they were met by national guard and local police. At least two protesters were shot dead in the capital and the western city of San Cristobal. \n \"Today without fear millions of Venezuelans mobilized to defend the constitution,\" opposition governor and two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles said in an emailed statement. Later this evening, Caprilles called for supporters to congregate at the same meeting points nationwide, including 26 locations in Caracas, on Thursday for a second day of protests. \n Ricardo Rios, a mathematics professor at Central University in Caracas, said that today's march, organized by a coalition of opposition parties, was larger than the last major demonstration in September. At least 1.2 million people filled 12 miles of streets and highways, he said. Neither the government or opposition published exact figures. \n Thousands of supporters of Maduro also rallied downtown, with state television showing trucks distributing water bottles on a hot day and an inflatable balloon in the form of the late President Hugo Chavez. \n Maduro and his supporters retain a potent capacity to resist. \n Caracas-based newspaper El Nacional reported that a 17-year-old died after being shot in the head by presumed government supporters known as \"colectivos\" early in the morning. It also reported the death of a 23-year-old woman shot by colectivos in San Cristobal.

In the afternoon, tear-gas barrages extended into parts of eastern Caracas that are opposition strongholds. \n The mobilization comes as Maduro faces scrutiny abroad and within his own government after the country's top court last month tried to grab power from the opposition-controlled congress. The opposition is trying to strengthen its momentum after its attempt last year to oust Maduro with a referendum was quashed by election officials. \n Venezuela's public prosecutor, Luisa Ortega, a member of the ruling Socialist party, urged security forces to guarantee the ability to dissent. \n \"It is a constitutional right to call for peaceful protests, and they should not put the physical safety of protesters at risk,\" she said in a statement on Twitter. \n Government Repression \n Fears of violence spiked this week after Maduro said he would increase the size of a citizen militia that supports the government to 500,000 members and give each cadet a gun. At a rally this afternoon where he sang and danced with other government officials, Maduro accused Julio Borges, the president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, of trying to foment a coup and blamed him for the day's violence. \n \"Today they tried to defeat a power, and they failed again,\" Maduro said. \"Julio Borges, don't complain when justice comes for you.\" \n Still, Maduro said that he was willing to hold talks with the opposition even after today's clashes. \n Maduro's government has been increasing its suppression of protests over the past weeks, with Caracas-based nongovernmental agency Foro Penal reporting five deaths and at least 538 arrests at protests this month. \n \"After today's march, the risk of violence will continue as the government is determined to maintain its power and close the electoral path,\" said Maria Teresa Urreiztieta, a social psychologist at Simon Bolivar University in Caracas. \"The challenge for the opposition now is to build collective leadership that can channel popular demands.\" \n U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said today in Washington that the U.S. was \"concerned\" about the situation. \n 'Tipping Point' \n Maduro has rarely appeared more vulnerable since his election in 2013 after the death of his predecessor Chavez. Criticism has mounted abroad and at home as the country continues to grapple with years of economic contraction, the world's fastest inflation and widespread shortages of food and medicine. \n The president retains one powerful ally: the armed forces. \n \"The military has strong economic incentives to hold Maduro in power,\" Diego Moya-Ocampos, an analyst at IHS Markit, said in an emailed note. \"Nevertheless, if sustained and prolonged strong protests reach a tipping point by overwhelmingly escalating beyond the capacity of security forces to contain them, then the probability of the military changing its stance and forcing the National Electoral Council to hold early elections or stage a coup to assume power directly will increase.\" \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "Massive anti-Maduro protests leave 2 dead in Venezuela"}

{"date": "April 19, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / APRIL 4 \n Victims of the suspected chemical weapons attack lie on the ground, in Khan Sheikhoun, in the northern province of Idlib, Syria. Israeli defense officials say Syrian President Bashar Assad still has up to three tons of chemical weapons. \n JERUSALEM >> Syria still has up to three tons of chemical weapons, Israeli defense officials said today in the first specific intelligence assessment of President Bashar Assad's weapons capabilities since a deadly chemical attack earlier this month. \n The estimate came as the head of the international chemical weapons watchdog said laboratory tests had provided \"incontrovertible\" evidence that victims and survivors of the April 4 attack in northern Syria were exposed to sarin nerve gas or a similar banned toxin. \n Israel, along with the United States and much of the international community, have accused Assad's forces of carrying out the attack, which killed at least 90 people, including dozens of children. \n A senior Israeli military official said Israeli intelligence believes Syrian military commanders ordered the attack, with Assad's knowledge. Briefing reporters, he said Israel estimates Assad still has \"between one and three tons\" of chemical weapons. \n The assessment was confirmed by two other Israeli defense officials. All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity under military briefing rules. \n Assad has strongly denied he was behind the attack in the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in Syria's northern Idlib province, and has accused the opposition of trying to frame his government. Top Assad ally, Russia, has asserted a Syrian government airstrike hit a rebel chemical weapons factory, causing the disaster. \n In response to the April 4 attack, the United States fired 59 missiles at a Syrian air base it said was the launching pad for the attack. Israel welcomed the strike on its northern neighbor. \n The Syrian government has been locked in a six-year civil war against an array of opposition forces. The fighting has killed an estimated 400,000 people and displaced half of Syria's population. \n Israel has largely stayed out of the fighting, though it has carried out a number of airstrikes on suspected Iranian weapons shipments it believed were bound for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Iran and Hezbollah, both bitter enemies of Israel, along with Russia have sent forces to support Assad. \n Following Russia's intervention in September 2015, Israel and Moscow opened a hotline to coordinate military activity in Syria. Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman will fly to Moscow next week for talks with senior Russian officials. \n Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons arsenal to avert U.S. strikes following a chemical weapons attack in opposition-held suburbs of Damascus in August 2013 that killed hundreds of people and sparked worldwide outrage. \n Ahead of that disarmament, Assad's government disclosed it had some 1,300 tons of chemical weapons, including sarin, VX nerve agent and mustard gas. \n The entire stockpile was said to have been dismantled and shipped out under international supervision in 2014 and destroyed. But doubts began to emerge soon afterward that not all such armaments or production facilities were declared and destroyed. There also is evidence that the Islamic State group and other insurgents have acquired chemical weapons. \n Dan Kaszeta, a U.K.-based chemical weapons expert, said the Israeli estimate appeared to be conservative, but nonetheless was enough to be highly lethal. \n \"One ton of sarin could easily be used to perpetrate an attack on the scale of the 2013 attack. It could also be used for roughly 10 attacks of a similar size to the recent Khan Sheikhoun attack,\" he said. \n A fact-finding mission from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an international watchdog, is investigating the April 4 incident and today its director-general, Ahmet Uzumcu, said that the results \"from four OPCW designated laboratories indicate exposure to sarin or a sarin-like substance.\" \n He said in a statement that further results would follow, but that \"the analytical results already obtained are incontrovertible.\" The agency, based in The Hague, Netherlands, is expected to issue a report within two weeks. \n Turkish and British tests also have concluded that sarin or a substance similar to the deadly nerve agent was used in the Idlib attack. \n Earlier this week, Assad's former chemical weapons research chief told Britain's The Telegraph newspaper that Syria had \"at least 2,000 tons\" of chemical weapons before the war and only declared 1,300. Former Brig. Gen. Zaher al-Sakat said the Syrian government still possessed hundreds of tons of chemical weapons. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Israeli defense officials: Assad still has chemical weapons"}

{"date": "April 19, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This year is poised to be a big one for legalized marijuana, with California and other states that recently approved recreational pot coming online. Yet uncertainty over the Trump administration's intents toward pot enforcement has created at least partial paralysis in those states on public consumption, licensing and other issues. \n Whether it was fear, racism or economic concerns that led the U.S. in the 1930s to ban growing or even possessing marijuana, the nation's wall against pot lasted a generation. Now, it's showing signs of wear. \n Twenty-nine U.S. states consider pot legal for people with certain medical conditions. Eight of those states, plus the District of Columbia have legalized pot for all adults over 21. \n But the United States' marijuana experiment isn't over. Many states still ban the drug for adults who aren't sick, and threats to the growing industry persist because pot use remains federally illegal. \n Three months into the Trump administration, on the eve of the 4/20 date celebrated by marijuana enthusiasts, here's a look at the drug's history in the U.S., its legal status and what's next for the ancient but mysterious plant: \n HOW WE GOT HERE  \n In the 1970s, at least 11 states removed criminal penalties or jail time for possessing small amounts of marijuana. \n A few years later, some victims of the AIDS epidemic ravaging the U.S. began turning to pot to relieve pain, stimulate their appetites and help them sleep. \n In 1996, California voters blew a hole in the anti-marijuana wall by saying sick people could use weed. The nation's most populous state simply decided it would stop prosecuting sick people for using pot. \n More than a dozen other states followed. The U.S. government expressed outrage and dispatched drug agents to the places growing and selling pot, but those sporadic raids couldn't keep the wall intact. \n Sixteen years after California voters authorized medical pot, two other Western states \u2014 Colorado and Washington \u2014 decided in 2012 that pot should be legal for all adults, not just sick people. \n Within the next four years, six more states and Washington, D.C., legalized pot for adults. \n WHERE ELSE IT'S LEGAL  \n Cannabis possession is illegal in most countries under a 1925 treaty called the International Opium Convention, and trafficking can carry the death penalty in extreme cases. Generally speaking, though, international marijuana prohibitions are thawing just as they are in the U.S. \n Dozens of countries have decriminalized small amounts for personal use, with some unenforced areas of marijuana commerce, as in an Amsterdam coffee shop. \n A few countries have authorized cultivation but not the sale of pot. Uruguay is the only country where it's legal for adults who aren't sick to grow, transport, sell and use pot. Uruguay may soon be joined by Canada, where the government has said marijuana would be made legal for recreational use by July 2018. \n WHERE IT'S ILLEGAL  \n Actually, everywhere in the U.S., since state can't override federal law. But enforcement of federal drug law has always relied on state and local officers, so the votes in those pot states to stop enforcing prohibition have made the federal ban essentially toothless there. \n HOW HAVE U.S. AUTHORITIES RESPONDED?  \n Presidents from different parties have responded in similar ways to legalization measures. \n Democrats and Republicans have held the White House as states defied pot prohibition. Those presidents disavowed weed \u2014 even as some admitted using it themselves as youths. Since 1996, states have seen plenty of saber-rattling from federal drug authorities but little coordinated effort to stop the pot experiments. \n Not long after he was elected in 2008, President Barack Obama's Justice Department sent an enforcement memo spelling out what states already knew: Federal authorities didn't plan any coordinated effort to maintain blanket marijuana prohibition in states that legalized weed. In response, marijuana businesses in some states started coming out of the shadows, behaving like traditional retailers, complete with storefronts and advertising. \n By 2012, when Colorado and Washington state authorized recreational pot, a few states had a fledgling marijuana industry, taxed and regulated. \n So far, the federal government has kept its word about not meddling with state pot laws. \n WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?  \n That's unclear. President Donald Trump said during the 2016 campaign that states should be left alone when it comes to pot. After Trump's election, some marijuana activists thought Trump would continue Obama's largely hands-off pot policy. \n Not so fast. Trump's spokesman and some of his Cabinet members have said marijuana legalization may not be tolerated any longer. \n U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a memo to the nation's prosecutors this month that he's ordered a review of existing marijuana policy to see how it may conflict with the administration's crime-fighting agenda. \n Confused? So is the industry, which continues to grow despite the uncertainty. \n WHAT'S NEXT?  \n Several members of Congress have proposed legalizing marijuana nationwide. Similar measures have been proposed before, though, and there's little reason to think this year's attempt will make it to Trump's desk. So marijuana prohibition laws are unlikely to end any time soon. \n That means the Trump administration can decide how vigorously to enforce marijuana prohibition. \n So far, the Justice Department and other agencies that may have a hand in marijuana enforcement have signaled more interest in tightening immigration law. \n Of course, that could change at any time. The American marijuana wall may be full of holes, but it hasn't been torn down yet. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Where is pot legal? A look at shifting U.S. marijuana policy"}

{"date": "April 19, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / JAN. 16 \n Contribution records from Trump's inaugural committee show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. \n WASHINGTON (AP) >> It was huge. \n Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump's inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts \u2014 to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. \n That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over \u2014 the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to \"drain the swamp\" of Washington. \n Contribution records from Trump's inaugural committee, released today by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. \n Trump's total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. \n Trump's top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump's swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. \n At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft's donation came via his limited liability company. \n Trump plans to name the New York Jets' Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country's ambassador to the United Kingdom. \n Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is \"a time-honored tradition\" and there are \"a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power.\" \n Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit pro-transparency group, countered: \"If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they're indebted to those big donors, there's certainly reason to question what donors to Trump's inaugural committee might expect in return.\" \n As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. \n Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. \n Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in \"vehicle expenses\" from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft's combined total was $500,000. \n Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman's Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn's ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. \n Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump's inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he's given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. \n Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil. \n The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. \n Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump's campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. \n While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump's only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. \n Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. \n Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn't operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn't be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. \n Trump's inaugural committee has promised to \"identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Record: $107M in donations for Trump's inaugural"}

{"date": "April 19, 2017", "text": "BOISE, Idaho >> A transgender woman is suing Idaho in federal court for refusing to change the gender listed on her birth certificate. \n Most states allow people to change their birth certificate to reflect their gender identity rather than the gender they were assigned at birth. Only Idaho, Kansas, Ohio and Tennessee have policies or laws prohibiting such changes. \n In the lawsuit, the 28-year-old identified only with the initials F.V. says she has been living as a woman since she was 15. She lives in Hawaii now but was born in Boise, and so asked the Idaho Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics in March to change the gender listed on her birth certificate. \n Idaho officials refused. In the lawsuit filed Tuesday, the woman contends that Idaho's policy serves no valid purpose, subjects her to discrimination and burdens her right to define and reflect her gender identity. \n \"A woman has the right to be treated as a woman, rather than a man, by her government; and the fact that she is a woman who is transgender does not change that right,\" her attorneys with the law firm Lambda Legal wrote in the lawsuit. The New York-based law firm focuses on civil rights issues affecting people in the LGBTQ community. \n Idaho has not yet filed a response to the lawsuit; the Idaho Attorney General's office has declined to comment on the case because it is pending litigation. \n States typically decide how to handle the birth certificates of those born within their borders, and policies vary across the nation. \n Many states, such as Colorado and Alabama, require proof of sex reassignment surgery before the change can be made. But other states, like California, require only an affidavit stating that \"clinically appropriate treatment\" for gender transition has been provided to the applicant. \n That's an important legal distinction, because not all transgender people have access to or the desire to undergo sex reassignment surgery or hormone treatment. Some transgender people may choose to transition socially \u2014 presenting themselves in a way that is consistent with their gender identities \u2014 without using medical procedures to masculinize or feminize their bodies. \n Only a few states, like Arizona, appear to have laws stating how birth certificates can be changed in other situations that can affect a person's gender, such as being born with additional sex chromosomes. \n Many states require birth certificates to show that the gender assigned at birth or a person's legal name has been changed. That can also result in \"outing\" or revealing transgender status against a persons will, F.V. notes in the lawsuit. She is asking a judge to order the state to allow people to change the gender listed on their birth certificates without including historical information that would reasonably disclose their transgender status. \n According to the lawsuit, F.V. has already faced discrimination for possessing a birth certificate that doesn't reflect her gender identity. She was subjected to hostility at a Social Security office, according to the lawsuit. \n \"After seeing her birth certificate, staff at the office referred to her as a 'tranny,' a derogatory term that disclosed F.V.'s transgender status to others in the waiting area,\" her attorneys wrote in the lawsuit, noting that someone called F.V. another derogatory term as she was leaving the office. \n Another time, before she changed the gender on her driver's license, she presented it to a cashier at a store. A man who saw the cashier's reaction then followed her and made sexual comments as she was leaving the parking lot at night, causing her to fear for her safety, she said in the lawsuit. \n Idaho does allow individuals to change the gender listed for their license plates, an inconsistency that F.V.'s attorneys noted in the lawsuit. \n \"There is no compelling, important, or even legitimate interest in the government causing transgender individuals to involuntarily disclose their transgender status any time third parties see their birth certificate,\" the attorneys wrote. \n Lambda Legal attorney Kara Ingelhart is working with Peter Renn on the case, as is Boise attorney Monica Cockerille. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Transgender woman sues Idaho over birth certificate"}

{"date": "April 19, 2017", "text": "SEAWORLD PARKS & ENTERTAINMENT \n Orca Takara helps guide her newborn to the water's surface at SeaWorld San Antonio today. \n MIAMI >> The last orca has been born in captivity at a SeaWorld park in San Antonio, Texas, just over a year after the theme park decided to stop breeding orcas following animal rights protests and declining ticket sales. \n The Orlando-based company said the orca \u2014 the last in a generation of whales bred in confinement \u2014 was born Wednesday afternoon. SeaWorld did not immediately name the calf because the park's veterinarians had not yet determined whether it was male or female. \n The mother, 25-year-old Takara, was already pregnant when SeaWorld announced in March 2016 that it had stopped breeding its orcas. The gestation period for orcas is about 18 months. \n Preparing late last month for the event, SeaWorld's chief zoological officer, Chris Dold, told The Associated Press he expected the birth to be bittersweet, because it would be the last such event at any of the parks. But just hours after the calf was born about 3:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Dold said, SeaWorld staff only felt like celebrating. SeaWorld said mother and calf both appear healthy. \n \"These are extraordinary moments,\" he said, speaking by phone while traveling to the U.S. from Abu Dhabi, where SeaWorld is developing its first new park without orcas. \"It's a tempered celebration only because we're focused on the health of these guys.\" \n SeaWorld decided to stop breeding orcas, and phase out its world-famous killer whale performances by 2019, after public opinion turned against keeping orcas, dolphins and other animals in captivity for entertainment. The backlash intensified after the 2013 release of \"Blackfish,\" a documentary critical of SeaWorld's orca care. It focused on the orca Tilikum, which killed trainer Dawn Brancheau in Orlando in 2010, dragging her into the pool before shocked visitors after a \"Dine with Shamu\" show. \n Tilkum, which sired 14 calves over nearly 25 years in Orlando, died of bacterial pneumonia in January. \n The newborn calf was sired by Kyuquot (pronounced ky YOO kit) at the San Antonio park by natural means. It brings SeaWorld's orca population in the U.S. to 23. All the orcas are expected to remain on display and available for researchers for years to come in Orlando, San Diego and San Antonio. \n SeaWorld has said it plans to introduce new \"natural orca encounters\" in place of theatrical shows. This summer, the San Diego park will unveil a new, educational attraction in a revamped pool, and new orca attractions eventually will follow in San Antonio and Orlando. \n The calf will be visible to visitors either in the orca stadium pool at the San Antonio park or in two adjacent pools. Observations about the calf and Takara by SeaWorld trainers will be provided from the moment of birth to researchers trying to fill gaps in their data about wild killer whales. \n Dold said veterinarians at the San Antonio park told him the calf was born normally \u2014 tail first \u2014 after about an hour and a half of smooth labor. Both orcas were swimming calmly, including taking breaths at the water's surface, and trainers would be watching for the calf to begin nursing. \n \"Mom generally will rest but she can't rest too much \u2026. mom's not holding onto the calf, but it's riding in her slipstream, and that's how it gets around,\" Dold said. \"Our expectation is that all of this will go smoothly, but we take none of that for granted.\" \n Birth control and \"social management\" will prevent future orca pregnancies, said spokeswoman Suzanne Pelisson Beasley. SeaWorld has not collected a wild orca in nearly 40 years, and most of its orcas were born in captivity. \n Researchers have said they worry that SeaWorld's decision to stop breeding orcas will slowly reduce their ability to study orca health, growth and behavior, limiting them in coming years to collecting data from a small pod of aging whales. \n Heather Hill, a St. Mary's University comparative psychologist who plans to monitor the sleeping habits of Takara and the calf over the coming year, said it was frustrating to see research opportunities at SeaWorld undermined by public opinion amid federal cuts to science funding. \n \"This will be one of the first times we'll be able to see not just a mother with a newborn calf but also a newborn calf with siblings,\" Hill said. \n This is Takara's fifth calf. Two of her other offspring remain at the San Antonio park, while one lives at SeaWorld Orlando and another has been loaned to a park in Tenerife, Spain. SeaWorld has no current plans to separate Takara and the newborn in the future, or to move any of its other orcas, Dold said. \n In March, Dold said SeaWorld remains committed to orca research and conservation, calling the last orca birth in captivity \"a solemn reminder of how things can change and how things can be lost.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Baby orca!

{"date": "April 19, 2017", "text": "CINDY ELLEN RUSSELL / CRUSSELL@STARADVERTISER.COM \n Department of Health Director Virginia Pressler, left, and other officials speak about rat lungworm disease at a press conference this afternoon at the department's headquarters on Punchbowl Street. \n COURTESY PHOTO \n An image of the rat lungworm parasite \n State Department of Health officials confirmed two more cases of the parasitic disease rat lungworm today and said another four are probable. \n Further reading \n The new reports stem from a single incident in Keaau on Hawaii island where six state residents drank kava, which is made from the piper methysticum plant and is used to promote relaxation. After downing the homemade brew, which had been sitting outside all night, they discovered slugs at the bottom of the large bowl. \n The six adults were hospitalized and their illnesses reported to the department over the weekend, said health officials, who announced the new cases at a news conference this afternoon at the department's headquarters on Punchbowl Street. The two patients with confirmed rat lungworm disease are Big Island residents, while three of the possible cases also involve Big Island residents and one is a Maui resident. \n \"The department is continuing to monitor this serious illness spread to individuals by infected slugs and snails,\" said Dr. Virginia Pressler, the state health director. \"Cases like this recent cluster are especially concerning because they can be prevented with basic precautions such as storing food in covered containers and properly inspecting and washing food before eating. These healthy habits can protect against food contamination and prevent serious illnesses.\" \n Officials said the two confirmed cases bring this year's total of rat lungworm to 11 confirmed cases in Hawaii, which is already more than the rat lungworm average for an entire year for the state. Although rat lungworm has been endemic to Hawaii for 50 years, the state normally averages nine cases in any 12-month period. \n The incident brings the count of confirmed cases on the Big Island to five in the last three months. There have been six confirmed cases on Maui. All but two of the cases involved residents. The other two cases \u2014 California newlyweds who contracted rat lungworm disease after visiting Hana in January \u2014 recently generated nationwide negative publicity for the state's visitor industry. \n Rat lungworm is typically prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. Victims most often contact the disease by consuming produce that contains a raw or under-cooked slug or snail that has been infected with the Angiostrongylus cantonensis parasite, which was carried to Hawaii by rats. The adult parasite is only found in rodents. But snails, slugs, freshwater shrimp, land crabs and frogs can become infected by ingesting their feces, which contains the worm larvae. \n Most of the victims infected during this cycle have required hospitalization as the disease affects the brain and spinal cord and can cause a rare type of meningitis. According to Health Department officials, symptoms start one to three weeks after exposure and can last for up to eight weeks. \n Health officials advise the public to: \n >> Carefully store, inspect and wash produce, especially leafy greens. \n >> Always store food in covered containers, wash all produce thoroughly and supervise young children playing outdoors to prevent them from putting snails or slugs into their mouths. \n >> Take precautions to control slugs, snails, and rats around properties, and especially around home gardens. \n They said symptoms of rat lungworm can vary but include severe headaches and neck stiffness, while the most severe cases can involve neurological problems, pain and disability. Anyone who suffers headaches, fever, stiff neck, tingling or painful feelings in the skin or extremities should seek medical attention, health officials advise. \n None of the 11 most recent patients have died. However, state health officials have said there have been two rat lungworm-related deaths since 2007. \n ", "author": "By Allison Schaefers aschaefers@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Rat lungworm cases climb in Hawaii: 2 confirmed, 4 more probable"}
