{"date": "April 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks at a rally for Omaha Democratic mayoral candidate Heath Mello today in Omaha, Neb. Sanders, who attracted millions of college-aged and young adults to his presidential campaign last year, is following through on a promise he made when he left the race: to promote younger leaders for the Democratic Party. \n OMAHA, Nebraska >> Bernie Sanders, who attracted millions of college-aged and young adults to his presidential campaign last year, is following through on a promise he made when he left the race: to promote younger leaders for the Democratic Party. \n It may not seem the most likely role for the slightly stooped, white-haired, 75-year-old Vermont senator. But Sanders rallied support Thursday for Omaha's Democratic mayoral candidate Heath Mello, who's half his age. \n While the Democratic Party searches for a path back to power around the country, Sanders is using his popularity to draw thousands to events to promote next-generation Democrats, though his effectiveness so far is unclear. He's on an eight-state circuit of rallies with Democratic National Committee leaders, visiting states Donald Trump carried in the November election. \n \"All over this country now, we're seeing young people inspired to run,\" Sanders told The Associated Press after headlining a rally of more than 3,000 in Omaha Thursday. \"What all of this is about at the end of the day is the belief that, in order to preserve our democracy, we have to bring millions of people, in one form or another, into the political process.\" \n The 17 candidates Sanders' political action committee has endorsed this year, including Mello, generally reflect Sanders' call for newer faces in a variety of political positions and have a direct connection to urban concerns or social justice causes. Most are in their 30s or 40s. \n \"Maybe, just maybe it's time to change one-party rule in Nebraska,\" said in University of Nebraska-Omaha's packed Baxter Arena Thursday, headlining a Democratic Party rally in the GOP-heavy state. \"And we can start right here by electing Heath Mello as the next mayor.\" \n The contrast was apparent throughout the arena, where supporters waved signs featuring the familiar image of Sanders' white hair and glasses alongside Mello's jet black hair and sunglasses. \n Mello, a 37-year-old state senator, exuded that youthful theme Thursday. \"I just believe the City of Omaha needs a unifying, aspirational vision for the future,\" he said. \n Some of the candidates Sanders has endorsed are direct products of the his campaign, such as Khalid Kamau, who was elected to the South Fulton, Georgia, City Council on Tuesday. The 40-year-old Atlanta-area activist in the Black Lives Matter movement volunteered for Sanders' campaign last year. \n Others, such as Tom Pierrello of Virginia, reflect Sanders' challenge to the party establishment. The 43-year-old former U.S. House member and adviser to former President Barack Obama is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor against Virginia Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam. \n But Sanders is using his popularity with younger Democrats to chiefly to inspire, rather than directly recruit, the younger faces he says the party needs. \n It's a tricky dance for Sanders, an independent who does call himself a Democrat \u2014 rather, a democratic socialist \u2014 but sought the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination and aligns with the party's minority in the Senate. \n Still, Sanders' call for tax-supported free college tuition and, more broadly, his indictment of the political influence of the wealthy drew millions of younger voters to his cause during last year's campaign. \n In the primaries and caucuses he captured 70 percent of the 30-and-younger vote, and those 2 million votes far exceeded the combined totals for Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. Among Democratic primary voters alone, Sanders won a solid majority of support from voters ages 45 and younger. \n Sanders seemed to pick up right where he left off when he ended his bid for the Democratic nomination less than a year ago. He brought many in the Omaha arena to their feet in rock-concert cheers when he reprised some familiar lines from his 2016 campaign. \n \"Health care is a human right, not a privilege,\" Sanders shouted, his voice cracking. \n In that way, most of what Sanders is offering on the DNC-sponsored tour through states Trump carried is the core of his standard campaign speech from last year. \n After that campaign, he didn't rule out a second bid for the White House, a prospect that troubles some next-generation Democrats. In four years, Sanders would be 79 \u2014 nine years older than Trump, who is the oldest ever to assume the White House. \n But 19-year-old Corina Campbell of Omaha said she was ready to back Sanders for president again in 2020. \"People might see their mistakes in not supporting him last time,\" the community college student said. \n It takes more than being a younger Democrat for a candidate to gain Sanders' support. His political action committee decided against endorsing 30-year-old Georgia Democrat Jonathan Ossoff, a former congressional staffer who qualified Tuesday for a June 20 runoff House election after raising more than $8 million in mostly out-of-state contributions. \n Sanders did endorse and campaign for 46-year-old Democrat James Thompson, a civil rights lawyer, ahead of his closer-than-expected losing effort in a special U.S. House election in Kansas last week. Thompson raised a fraction of Ossoff's haul, and in smaller contributions, a hallmark of Sanders' own campaign. \n Some Democrats say Sanders is headed in the right direction, but must do more. \n Rep. Tim Ryan, a Democrat from eastern Ohio, said the party needs to more aggressively organize its target audience \u2014 working- and middle-class voters who turned to Trump \u2014 and recruit from among them. \n \"We need newer faces across the board: veterans, police officers, teachers, coaches, firefighters that can improve our party's brand at least visually,\" said Ryan, who unsuccessfully challenged Nancy Pelosi for House minority leader late last year. \n Such candidates, no matter their age, Ryan said, \"can be powerful, as long as they are driving an economic message.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Sanders backs party youth to remake Democrats"}

{"date": "April 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / APRIL 18 \n Ledell Lee was sentenced to death after being convicted of killing Debra Reese with a tire iron in February 1993 in Jacksonville. \n VARNER, Ark. (AP) >> Arkansas has executed an inmate for the first time in nearly a dozen years as part of its plan to execute several inmates before a drug expires April 30, despite court rulings that have already spared three men. \n Ledell Lee's execution was the first in the state since 2005. He was pronounced dead at 11:56 p.m. Thursday, four minutes before his death warrant was due to expire. \n Lee, 51, was put on death row for the 1993 death of his neighbor Debra Reese, whom Lee struck 36 times with a tire tool her husband had given her for protection. Lee was arrested less than an hour after the killing after spending some of the $300 he had stolen from Reese. \n The state originally set four double executions over an 11-day period in April. The eight executions would have been the most by a state in such a compressed period since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The state said the executions needed to be carried out before its supply of one lethal injection drug expires on April 30. The first three executions were canceled because of court decisions. \n Two more inmates are set to die Monday, and one on April 27. Another inmate scheduled for execution next week has received a stay. \n The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for Lee's execution less than an hour before his death warrant was set to expire at midnight, rejecting a round of last-minute appeals the condemned inmate's attorneys had filed. An earlier ruling from the state Supreme Court allowing officials to use a lethal injection drug that a supplier says was obtained by misleading the company cleared the way for Lee's execution. \n Arkansas dropped plans to execute a second inmate, Stacey Johnson, on the same day after the state Supreme Court said it wouldn't reconsider his stay, which was issued so Johnson could seek more DNA tests in hopes of proving his innocence. \n Justices on Thursday reversed an order by Pulaski County Circuit Judge Alice Gray that halted the use of vecuronium bromide, one of three drugs used in the state's lethal injection process, in any execution. McKesson Corp. says the state obtained the drug under false pretenses and that it wants nothing to do with executions. \n McKesson said it was disappointed in the court's ruling. \n \"We believe we have done all we can do at this time to recover our product,\" the company said in a statement. \n Justices also denied an attempt by makers of midazolam and potassium chloride \u2014 the two other drugs in Arkansas' execution plan \u2014 to intervene in McKesson's fight over the vecuronium bromide. The pharmaceutical companies say there is a public health risk if their drugs are diverted for use in executions, and that the state's possession of the drugs violates rules within their distribution networks. \n The legal delays in the executions frustrated Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who had set the execution schedule less than two months ago. The state's elected prosecutors also criticized the roadblocks to the execution plans. \n \"Through the manipulation of the judicial system, these men continue to torment the victims' families in seeking, by any means, to avoid their just punishment,\" the prosecutors said in a joint statement issued Thursday. \n The Arkansas Supreme Court said in a 4-3 ruling that it would not reconsider its decision to stay Johnson's execution. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge's office said she would not appeal that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. \n Lawyers for the state have complained that the inmates are filing court papers just to run out the clock on Arkansas' midazolam supply. Prisons director Wendy Kelley has said the state has no way to obtain more midazolam or vecuronium bromide. At one point in the proceedings before a federal judge last week, Arkansas Solicitor General Lee Rudofsky declared, \"Enough is enough.\" \n Earlier in the evening, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on a previous batch of appeals with new justice Neil Gorsuch voting with the majority of five on the to deny the stay of execution sought by Lee and the other inmates. Justice Stephen Breyer said in a dissent he was troubled by Arkansas' push to execute the inmates before its supply of midazolam expires. \n \"Apparently the reason the state decided to proceed with these eight executions is that the 'use by' date of the state's execution drug is about to expire\u2026In my view, that factor, when considered as a determining factor separating those who live from those who die, is close to random,\" Breyer wrote. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Arkansas carries out first execution since 2005"}

Coachella,'\" said Tara Scott, 42, referring to the giant California music festival. \n About two dozen pot fans in the Los Angeles area opted for a morning celebration, gathering at a trailhead in the Altadena foothills for \"High'ke,\" a 2.5-mile trek that promised joints to everyone who made it to the 5,600-foot peak of Mount Lowe. \n Anna Acosta, 49, said she hoped to revel in the \"camaraderie of being out in nature with a bunch of nature-loving, tree-loving, like-minded people.\" \n Pot shops in some legal marijuana states were offering discounts. In Alaska, though, regulators put a damper on promotions, warning retail shops about an \"alarming amount of social media advertisements for 4/20 celebrations\" that violate state rules against certain activities, such as games or competitions, that encourage pot sales. \n A shop in Seattle was hosting a block party, and a nearby sex-toy business was offering a class about how marijuana can improve intimate relations. \n Legalization opponents weren't going quietly.

That stigma is amplified in the military. \n SEOUL, South Korea >> A watchdog group says South Korea's army is hunting down and prosecuting gay servicemen after a video of two male soldiers having sex was posted on the internet earlier this year, stoking fear in an already persecuted minority group. \n Military investigators looking into the case have threatened soldiers to out their gay peers, confiscated cellphones to check communication records, and even used dating apps to dupe soldiers into revealing their sexual identity, said Taehoon Lim, the head of the Military Human Rights Center for Korea, which tracks down abuses in the armed forces. \n South Korea's army says it's conducting a proper criminal investigation into soldiers allegedly involved with filming and uploading the video, which is a violation of the country's communications laws and a military penal code that makes homosexual activity punishable by up to two years in prison. The army has denied allegations that investigators are using the case to embark on a broader mission to weed out gay soldiers. \n \"Military investigators used the information they gained from the investigation on the sex video to track down other gay soldiers in the army, starting by forcing the suspects to identify who they had sex with and then widening their search from there,\" said Lim, who said a soldier tipped his group off about the alleged crackdown. \n In conservative South Korea, gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people are harshly stigmatized and struggle to be politically visible, while a powerful Christian lobby immobilizes politicians seeking to pass anti-discrimination laws. That stigma is amplified in the military, where most able-bodied South Korean men are required to serve about two years as the country maintains a large force in the face of potential conflict with North Korea. \n Gay men are not exempt from conscription but are banned from engaging in homosexual activity while serving, leading to an environment in which they serve without revealing their sexual identity for fear of discrimination and reprisals. \n \"South Korea's military doesn't exclude gay men from compulsory duty, but once they enter the military, they are seen as dangerous and treated as potential criminals, as the ongoing army investigation shows,\" said Han Ga-ram, an openly gay human rights lawyer. \n He said the investigation had \"touched off fear in the LGBT community.\" \n \"Hate crimes against LGBT people are already a serious problem, and the government could make it worse by sending the wrong message by punishing gay men in the military,\" Han said. \n The army doesn't reveal information about how often it pursues cases against gay soldiers, but Lim said in the five years before 2017 he knows of only two cases where soldiers were prosecuted for homosexual activity. Since the start of the year, more than 30 soldiers have come under investigation and one has been arrested, an army captain who did not know the soldiers involved, Lim said. \n \"The soldiers who are being investigated had sex with their partners under mutual consent and not inside the barracks,\" Lim said. \"The army has infringed on the realms of privacy and is falsely claiming that these soldiers committed wrongdoings.\" \n Lim said the arrested captain had never met the soldier who uploaded the video and he was arrested for allegedly obstructing the investigation by delaying his appearance for questioning due to his lawyer's schedule. The captain's lawyer could not be reached for comment. \n Lim's group in 2014 uncovered the bullying death of a 21-year-old army conscript, a case that shocked the nation and led to calls for the Defense Ministry to take serious steps to reduce bullying and hazing in the military. \n The army didn't provide details of its investigation into the video, including the number of soldiers being investigated or why the captain was arrested. It said in a statement that the investigation was proceeding legally and that the privacy of soldiers was being protected. \n The army also stressed that homosexual activity in the military is banned to allow soldiers to maintain \"sound and healthy private lives.\" \n \"The army will continue to deal with activities that disrupt the discipline of troops based on related laws,\" the army said in a statement. \n South Korea's stance runs counter to that of the United States, which maintains bases in the country and is its largest ally. In 2011, the U.S. repealed its policy, known as don't ask, don't tell, which banned open homosexuality in the military.

Two media reports say U.S. prosecutors are preparing or closely considering charges against the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, including Assange, for revealing sensitive government secrets. \n WASHINGTON >> Two media reports say U.S. prosecutors are preparing or closely considering charges against the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, including its founder Julian Assange, for revealing sensitive government secrets. \n Possible charges include conspiracy, theft of government property and violating the Espionage Act, the newspaper said, though any charges would need approval from high-ranking officials in the Justice Department. \n The move comes after WikiLeaks last month released nearly 8,000 documents that it says reveal secrets about the CIA's cyberespionage tools for breaking into computers, cellphones and even smart TVs. It previously published 250,000 State Department cables and embarrassed the U.S. military with hundreds of thousands of logs from Iraq and Afghanistan. \n CIA Director Mike Pompeo last week denounced the group as a \"hostile intelligence service\" and a threat to U.S. national security. And Attorney General Jeff Sessions told reporters Thursday that Assange's arrest is a priority as the Justice Department steps up efforts to prosecute people who leak classified information to the media. \n \"We've already begun to step up our efforts and whenever a case can be made, we will seek to put some people in jail,\" Sessions said. \n Their condemnation of WikiLeaks differed sharply from President Donald Trump's past praise of the organization. Before last year's election, Trump said he was happy to see WikiLeaks publish private, politically damaging emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, John Podesta. He was less thrilled about the release of CIA tactics, which the White House said was different because it involved information about secretive national security tools. \n The Post reported that it wasn't clear whether prosecutors are also looking at WikiLeaks' role in the Podesta case. \n Assange's attorney, Barry Pollack, told The Associated Press authorities have not apprised him of the status of their investigation. \n Assange, an Australian, has resided the last four years in Ecuador's embassy in London. He received political asylum after skipping bail to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted over a rape allegation. Ecuador's recently elected presidential candidate has promised to continue to harbor Assange, allowing him to avoid arrest. \n Assange has said WikiLeaks acts in the name of liberty and privacy. The Post reported that Justice officials in the Obama administration believed prosecuting WikiLeaks would be similar to prosecuting a news organization for publishing classified information, but they did not formally close the case. \n \"The Department of Justice should not be treating the publication of truthful information as a reason for a criminal investigation of the publisher,\" Pollack said. \"Democracy has always depended on journalists being able to inform the public of what their government is doing.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Reports: U.S. weighing charges against WikiLeaks"}

I never truly expected to do it. I had other people in mind to do it.\" \n Instead, it's Winfrey who erupts in the new HBO film \"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\" as a tormented woman in search of the mother she never knew whose tissue sample would yield medical marvels benefiting millions. \n The film, which premieres Saturday at 8 p.m. EDT, is based on the best-seller by Rebecca Skloot. It charts the rocky road to discovery shared by Henrietta Lacks' daughter Deborah (Winfrey) with Skloot, who wanted to shine light on the human story behind the legendary cell line known as \"HeLa.\" Rose Byrne (\"Damages,\" \"Bridesmaids\") plays the intrepid reporter Skloot. \n Winfrey was captivated by the book and acquired the rights with the intent of producing a film. Then two things happened to set the project on its proper course. \n She heard one of the hundreds of interviews Skloot had made with Deborah Lacks (who had died just months before the book's 2010 publication). Winfrey heard her on tape saying to Skloot, \"Girl! Did you see 'The Oprah Show' today? SHE should play me!\" \n \"I did it as a way of honoring her,\" Winfrey says, \"honoring the legacy she tried to create and build for her mother.\" \n The other reason Winfrey couldn't say no to the role: George C. Wolfe, the celebrated Tony Award-winning stage and film director, joined the project. \n Wolfe saw the film as more than an untold tale of science. \n \"The desire to know one's parents \u2014 that's a very primal thing,\" he says. \"They are literally and metaphorically the DNA of who we become.

You can't achieve that kind of connectedness with people who have their guards up.\" \n As for Winfrey in particular, Wolfe hails her as \"brave and ferocious and willing.\" \n \"I don't have a lot of acting experience,\" insists Winfrey, who says she learned her greatest acting lesson long ago, during her first, Oscar-nominated film appearance in the 1985 drama \"The Color Purple.\" \n The director, Steven Spielberg, warned her that she would need to cry in a scene the next day.

And if SHE wants to cry, she will cry. But if SHE doesn't want to cry, not even Steven Spielberg can make her.' So giving yourself over is part of the process.\" \n Perhaps by now, at 63, Winfrey has learned to give herself over to the process in ways even beyond a film role: She says she's easing up after all those hard-driving decades seeking more and more mountains to climb. \n \"The 60s are no longer about the climb. They're about enjoying the view, the view that you created based on the long climb,\" she explains. \"I feel no need to prove anything anymore.

Smith and his husband Taylor paid more than $20,000 in Hawaii for a fertility procedure when they decided to have a child using a surrogate mother. They did not know at the time that if they were a heterosexual couple, they might have saved that money. \n Health care lobbyists in Hawaii are pushing lawmakers to kill part of a bill that would expand access to fertility treatments to same-sex couples who want to have a child. \n They're saying requiring insurers to cover fertility treatments for gestational carriers that male couples rely on could lead to legal problems. \n Under Hawaii law, insurers are required to cover one round of in vitro fertilization for some married, heterosexual couples. Advocates from the gay and lesbian community are pushing for equal access to that money-saving benefit. \n A Hawaii bill would extend the IVF coverage mandate to same-sex couples and single women. It also would make Hawaii the first state to require coverage for surrogate mothers, which could help male couples who need a surrogate to carry a child. \n But health care lobbyists are pushing to remove part of the bill that extends the coverage mandate to gestational carriers, saying Hawaii law has no legal protections for surrogates because the state law is silent on the issue. They say the state should write laws on gestational carriers before making insurers cover procedures for the group. \n \"When you start thinking about it there are so many potential issues that to pass a law just seems a little bit premature,\" said Beth Giesting, lobbyist for Hawaii Association of Health Plans, which represents the major health insurers in the state. \"Without that legal infrastructure, the potential for wading into a lot of problems \u2014 not just for insurers, but also for the providers and for the surrogates and the intended parents \u2014 it's just a very unsettling situation.\" \n Intended parents and gestational carriers need to be on the same page about what they'll do if there are multiple fetuses, genetic issues or a surrogate who changes her mind about giving up the baby, she said. Without laws on the topic, insurers fear they could be caught in the middle of legal battles. \n Mandy Finlay, advocacy coordinator ACLU of Hawaii, called the insurers' argument a \"desperate, last minute attempt by an insurer to put profit over equality,\" saying they're pushing back on the surrogacy aspect of the bill because their other arguments against the proposal failed. \n Questions about what would happen under the scenarios Giesting outlined are covered in private agreements executed between intended parents and gestational carriers, and those agreements are recognized by state courts when assigning parental rights, said Carol Lockwood, a partner with Honolulu law firm Schlack Ito. \n \"It's pretty sad to say that these people who prepare so well to be parents and have to work so hard to be parents shouldn't be allowed to,\" Lockwood said. \n Hawaii is one of eight states that require insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization, a costly procedure in which a doctor retrieves eggs from a woman, combines them with sperm from a man and then implants an embryo into a woman's uterus. \n \"If you're a gay male couple, they're paying the same premiums as everyone else, they have equal rights,\" said Democratic state Sen. Maile Shimabukuro, who introduced the bill. \"But yet here, in this instance, it's clearly not equal because they cannot access the same benefit that a heterosexual couple could.\" \n Sean Smith, who with his husband paid more than $20,000 for fertility procedures before a surrogate carried their son Charlie to term, said he's disappointed that after three months of hearings on the bill insurers are taking issue with surrogates. \"They waited to the last minute to bring this up,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Health care lobby pushes back on Hawaii LGBT fertility bill"}

The dispute was then submitted for binding arbitration, a process put in place to settle contract disputes because firefighters are not allowed to strike. \n \"I think the process was a lot tougher than it needed to be because of how the employers operated throughout the whole bargaining process, but we feel the process is fair, and we can only control our side on how we operated during the bargaining process,\" Lee said. \n ", "author": "By Kevin Dayton kdayton@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Hawaii firefighters awarded 2% raises"}

In the past Weingarten has accused DeVos of feeling \"antipathy for public schools.\" \n During the visit to schools in Van Wert, a town in northwestern Ohio, Weingarten said the two women have earned a reputation of \"combatants\" but that finding common ground is crucial for the sake of students. Still, Weingarten stood somber-faced and DeVos wore a forced smile at a closing news conference. \n While DeVos complemented teachers and students at Van Wert schools, she said some 20 percent of local families have elected to send their children to other schools. \n \"It's an opportunity that we should continue to offer because the goal is for every child to be in an education environment that's best for them,\" DeVos said.

{"date": "April 20, 2017", "text": "WASHINGTON >> White House budget director Mick Mulvaney says that Democratic negotiators on a massive spending bill need to agree to funding top priorities of President Donald Trump such as a down payment on a border wall and hiring of additional immigration agents. \n Mulvaney told The Associated Press in an interview that \"elections have consequences\" and that \"we want wall funding\" as part of the catchall spending bill, which lawmakers hope to unveil next week. \n The former GOP congressman from South Carolina also said that the administration is open, though undecided, about a key Democratic demand that the measure pay for cost-sharing payments to insurance companies that help low-income people afford health policies under the Affordable Care Act. \n The $1 trillion-plus legislation is leftover business from last year's election-season gridlock and would cover the operating budgets of every Cabinet department except for Veterans Affairs. \n Talks on the measure have hit a rough patch as a deadline to avert a government shutdown looms late next week. Trump's presidency is approaching the symbolic 100-day mark, but his GOP allies in Congress have been tempering expectations that the president would emerge as a big winner. Democratic votes are likely to be needed to pass whatever bill emerges from the talks, and Senate Democrats could bottle it up entirely if they object to provisions that they deem to be \"poison pills\" \u2014 such as the money for the wall. \n GOP leaders on Capitol Hill are eager to avert a shutdown, and the slow pace may make it necessary to enact another temporary spending bill to avert a shutdown next weekend. \n \"A shutdown is never a desired end and neither is it a strategy,\" Mulvaney said. \n Mulvaney said the White House delivered an offer to negotiators Wednesday night, with funding for the border wall a top demand. Other items on the White House priority list, Mulvaney said, are a $30 billion request for a cash infusion for the military and a controversial provision to give the administration greater latitude to deny certain federal grants to \"sanctuary cities\" that refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement by federal authorities. \n \"We want wall funding. We want (immigration) agents. Those are our priorities,\" Mulvaney said. \"We know there are a lot of people on the Hill, especially in the Democratic Party, who don't like the wall, but they lost the election. And the president should, I think, at least have the opportunity to fund one of his highest priorities in the first funding bill under his administration.\" \n Democrats have taken a hard line against any money for the border wall and insist that the measure include the \"Obamacare\" payments to insurance companies. \n At issue are cost-sharing payments that are a key subsidy under the health care law to help low-income people enrolled through the law's insurance marketplaces with their out-of-pocket expenses. Trump has threatened to withhold the payments as a means to force Democrats to negotiate on health care legislation. \n The cost-sharing payments are the subject of a lawsuit by House Republicans, and Trump threatened in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week to drop the payments, which experts warn would severely disrupt Obamacare's marketplaces. \n Mulvaney said the White House isn't enthusiastic about Democratic demands on the Obamacare payments but is open to them as part of a broader agreement. \n \"The president has been quoted several times and said he's inclined not to make them and I can't tell you that I'm interested in dissuading him from that position,\" Mulvaney said. \"That being said, if it's important enough to the Democrats, we'd be happy to talk to them about including that in sort of some type of compromise.\" \n Added Mulvaney: \"If Democrats are interested and serious about compromise and negotiation, the ball is in their court.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump budget chief: Spending bill must have money for wall"}

{"date": "April 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n An anti-government protester holds a bible in the middle of a cloud of tear gas during a march in Caracas, Venezuela. Tens of thousands of protesters flooded the streets again, one day after three people were killed and hundreds arrested in the biggest anti-government demonstrations in years. \n VALENCIA, Venezuela >> General Motors announced today that it was shuttering its operations in Venezuela after authorities seized its factory in the country, a move that could draw the Trump administration into the escalating chaos engulfing the South American nation amid days of deadly protests. \n The plant in the industrial city of Valencia was confiscated on Wednesday as anti-government protesters clashed with security forces and pro-government groups in a country battered by economic troubles, including food shortages and triple-digit inflation. Three people were killed and hundreds arrested in the deadliest day of protests since the unrest began three weeks ago. \n The seizure arose from an almost 20-year-old lawsuit brought by a former GM dealership in western Venezuela. The dealership had been seeking damages from GM of 476 million bolivars \u2014 about $665 million at the official exchange rate, or $115 million on the black market where many Venezuelans are forced to turn to sell their increasingly worthless currency. GM said it was notified this week that a low-level court ordered the seizure of its plant, bank accounts and other assets in the country. \n Hundreds of workers desperate for information about their jobs gathered at the plant Thursday to meet with government and military officials, as well as representatives of the dealership that brought the lawsuit. The neglected factory hasn't produced a car since 2015 but GM still has 79 dealers that employ 3,900 people in Venezuela, where for decades it was the market leader. \n General Motors' announcement came as Venezuela's opposition moved to keep up pressure on President Nicolas Maduro, taking to the streets again Thursday a day after the biggest anti-government demonstrations in years. \n It's not the first time the Venezuelan government has seized a foreign corporation's facilities. Last July, the government said it would take over a factory belonging to Kimberly-Clark Corp. after the American personal care giant said it was halting manufacturing because materials weren't available in Venezuela. \n But the move against GM, the United States' biggest automaker, was a much more powerful statement, and could lead to a further erosion of relations between the two countries. \n \"This is a test case for Trump,\" said Raul Gallegos, a Bogota-based analyst at Control Risks consultancy. \"His response to a rogue nation taking over the assets of a brand name U.S. company will be indicative of the road it wants to take with Venezuela.\" \n The State Department said Thursday it was reviewing details of the GM case but called on authorities to act swiftly and transparently to resolve the dispute. \n \"A fair, predictable and transparent judicial system is critical to implementing the essential economic reforms critical to restoring growth and addressing the needs of the Venezuelan people,\" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. \n Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets Thursday to demand elections and denounce what they consider an increasingly dictatorial government. They were met by a curtain of tear gas and rubber bullets as they attempted to march to downtown Caracas. \n Across the country, the clashes have been intense. Pro-government militias were blamed for two deaths on Wednesday, including that of a teenager in Caracas who was heading to a soccer game with friends. However, government officials cast doubt on the account saying the other victim, a 23-year-old woman, was killed by a member of an anti-government movement led by former congresswoman Maria Corina Machado, a claim Machado denied. \n \"They're using a Venezuelan's death, for which they're responsible, to commit slander,\" Machado said on Twitter. \"That's how this criminal dictatorship works.\" \n The third fatality was a National Guard sergeant killed overnight when his squad was attacked with gunfire while trying to control disturbances in a suburb of Caracas, the chief prosecutor's office said. Another officer was wounded in the clashes. \n Another five people have been killed in the three weeks of protests sparked by a Supreme Court decision to strip the opposition-controlled Congress of its last remaining powers, a move that was later reversed amid a storm of international criticism. \n The move has energized Venezuela's fractious opposition, which had been struggling to channel growing disgust with Maduro over widespread food shortages, triple-digit inflation and rampant crime. \n Opponents are pushing for Maduro's removal through early elections and the release of scores of political prisoners. The government last year abruptly postponed regional elections the opposition was heavily favored to win and cut off a petition drive to force a referendum seeking Maduro's removal before elections late next year. The opposition sees the government measures as turning Venezuela into a nearly full-blown dictatorship. \n But the government hasn't backed down. \n Maduro, addressing supporters Wednesday, said he was \"anxious\" to see elections take place sometime \"soon\" and repeated his call for dialogue, something many in the opposition see as a stalling tactic. \n \"Today they attempted to take power by force and we defeated them again,\" said Maduro, adding that authorities rounded up several armed opponents seeking to carry out a coup. He didn't provide any evidence to back up the claim, and the opposition rejected it as an attempt to intimidate Venezuelans from exercising their constitutional right to protest. \n As tensions have mounted, the government has used its almost-complete control of Venezuela's institutions to pursue its opponents. On Wednesday alone, 565 protesters were arrested nationwide, according to Penal Forum, a local NGO that provides legal assistance to detainees. The group said 334 remained in jail. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "GM quits Venezuela after government seizes its factory"}

{"date": "April 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz says he won't for re-election or any other office in 2018. \n SALT LAKE CITY >> Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz's decision not to seek another term in Congress and possibly resign sets the GOP congressman up for a 2020 run for governor without a damaging re-election campaign or pressure to doggedly investigate his party's president. \n Instead, the 50-year-old congressman who breezed through four re-election campaigns can lay the groundwork for the governor's race, opening the door for a number of ambitious Utah Republicans to try to replace him in Congress. \n A day after announcing he wouldn't seek re-election next year, Chaffetz said Thursday that he may not even finish the two-year term that started four months ago. Chaffetz said in a text message: \"My future plans are not yet finalized but I haven't ruled out the possibility of leaving early. In the meantime I still have a job to do and I have no plans to take my foot off the gas.\" \n Chaffetz has faced mounting criticism in recent months for declining to investigate President Donald Trump and likely would have faced a bruising primary and general election battle in 2018. \n He said in his announcement Wednesday that he had \"no ulterior motives,\" is healthy and wasn't worried about his re-election chances. Instead, Chaffetz said he wants to spend time with his family, return to the private sector and potentially run for Utah governor. \n Chris Karpowitz, co-director at Brigham Young University's Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy, said Chaffetz's decision to bow out is somewhat surprising but eases the path for a governor's race. \n \"This is a decision to avoid what could have been an embarrassing defeat that would have hurt his prospects in the future,\" Karpowitz said. \n If Chaffetz runs for governor, he won't necessarily be the front-runner, Karpowitz said. \n He could face stiff challenges from potential GOP candidates that include the state's popular lieutenant governor, Spencer Cox, and Josh Romney, a Salt Lake City-based real estate developer and son of former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. \n Chaffetz's announcement came on the heels of surprisingly strong showings by Democrats in races in Georgia and Kansas and fundraising reports that showed he was being outraised by a Democratic challenger, though it's unlikely the GOP will lose the seat. \n \"It's the most conservative part of one of the most conservative states in the country,\" Utah State University political scientist Damon Cann said. \n As chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Chaffetz has been walking a fine line between party loyalty and a district that's heavily conservative but lukewarm on President Donald Trump, Cann said. \n Chaffetz led high-profile and persistent investigations into Hillary Clinton before the 2016 presidential election but took a tepid approach to Trump's alleged conflicts of interest and ties to Russia. In February, he was drowned out by boos at a town hall meeting, where constituents shouted, \"Do your job!\" A month later, he touched off anger by suggesting people should spend their money on health insurance instead of iPhones. \n Dr. Kathryn Allen, a Democrat and first-time candidate, harnessed the anger over Chaffetz's iPhone comments and raised more than half a million dollars. \n Allen said Chaffetz's decision doesn't change her platform, but she hopes it gives Democrats a better shot in the heavily Republican 3rd congressional district, which stretches from suburban Salt Lake City to desert towns in southeastern Utah. \n Utah Republican Party chairman James Evans disagreed with Allen's optimism and said despite her impressive fundraising: \"All this money is a wash out there.\" \n Evans predicted several Republicans will line up to replace Chaffetz, including Provo Mayor John Curtis, former state GOP chair Thomas Wright, Utah's House Speaker Greg Hughes and state Sen. Deidre Henderson, a former Chaffetz campaign manager. \n Henderson said she and her family are strongly considering a campaign. Curtis said Wednesday that he hasn't made any decisions but Chaffetz's announcement has \"given me pause for thought about my future.\" \n Hughes and Wright didn't return messages. \n Another potential challenger is Trump-critic Evan McMullin, a Mormon and former CIA agent who mounted an independent run for president last year. McMullin didn't respond to messages seeking comment but has said he's considering a run for U.S. Senate or House in 2018 in Utah. \n Attorney Damian Kidd, a Republican who had already stepped in to challenge Chaffetz, said he hopes Chaffetz's exit will free up fundraising money. Kidd had raised $15,500 in recent months but was left with only $1,600, according to his most recent fundraising reports. \n Since he was first elected to Congress in 2008, Chaffetz has become known as a media-savvy congressman who has made frequent appearances on cable news shows and earned publicity for sleeping on a cot in his office instead of living elsewhere in Washington. \n Utah Gov. Gary Herbert said Thursday that Chaffetz has served the state well. If Chaffetz leaves his term early, there would be a special election to fill the seat, he said. \n Chaffetz is at least the seventh House Republican to resign this year or announce plans to retire, including four who left to join Trump's Cabinet. Rep. Kristi Noem of South Dakota is running for governor, and Reps. Sam Johnson of Texas and Lynn Jenkins of Kansas are retiring. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Utah's Chaffetz says he may not finish term in Congress"}

{"date": "April 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump gives a thumbs-up as he walks to board Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, for the short trip to Andrews Air Force Base, Md., en route to Kenosha, Wis. Trump, the \"America First\" president who vowed to extricate the U.S. from onerous overseas commitments, appears to be warming up to the view that when it comes to global agreements, a deal's a deal. \n WASHINGTON >> The \"America First\" president who vowed to extricate America from onerous overseas commitments appears to be warming up to the view that when it comes to global agreements, a deal's a deal. \n From NAFTA to the Iran nuclear agreement to the Paris climate accord, President Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric is colliding with the reality of governing. Despite repeated pledges to rip up, renegotiate or otherwise alter them, the U.S. has yet to withdraw from any of these economic, environmental or national security deals, as Trump's past criticism turns to tacit embrace of several key elements of U.S. foreign policy. \n The administration says it is reviewing these accords and could still pull out of them. Yet with one exception \u2014 an Asia-Pacific trade deal that already had stalled in Congress \u2014 Trump's administration quietly has laid the groundwork to honor the international architecture of deals it has inherited. It's a sharp shift from the days when Trump was declaring the end of a global-minded America that negotiates away its interests and subsidizes foreigners' security and prosperity. \n A day after his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, certified that Iran was meeting its nuclear obligations, Trump on Thursday repeated his view the seven-nation accord was a \"terrible agreement\" and \"as bad as I've ever seen negotiated.\" \n \"Iran has not lived up to the spirit of the agreement and they have to do that,\" Trump said at a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. He said U.S. officials were analyzing the deal carefully and would \"have something to say about it in the not too distant future.\" \n Earlier Thursday, he delivered a similar assessment of the North American Free Trade Agreement, railing against the 1990s trade deal while offering no indication he was actively pushing for wholesale changes. As a candidate, Trump threatened to jettison the pact with Mexico and Canada unless he could substantially renegotiate it in America's favor. \n \"The fact is, NAFTA, whether it's Mexico or Canada, is a disaster for our country,\" Trump said. \n Trump's administration has been focused on marginal changes that would preserve much of NAFTA, according to draft guidelines that Trump's trade envoy sent to Congress. To the dismay of NAFTA critics, the proposal preserves a controversial provision that lets companies challenge national trade laws through private tribunals. \n Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, said Trump may be allowing himself to argue in the future that existing deals can be improved without being totally discarded. \"That allows him to tell his base that he's getting a better deal than Bush or Obama got, and yet reassure these institutions that it's really all being done with a nod and a wink, that Trump doesn't mean what he says,\" Brinkley said. \n So far, there's been no major revolt from Trump supporters, despite their expectation he would be an agent of disruption. In addition to Tillerson's Iran certification, this week's reaffirmations of the status quo included delaying a decision on whether to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. \n The president had previously spoken about dismantling or withdrawing from the nuclear and climate agreements as part of his vision, explained in his inaugural address, that \"every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\" \n Trump had called the Iran deal the \"worst\" ever, and claimed climate change was a hoax. But in place of taking action, the Trump administration is only reviewing these agreements, as it is doing with much of American foreign policy. \n The Iran certification, made 90 minutes before a midnight Tuesday deadline, means Tehran will continue to enjoy relief from U.S. nuclear sanctions. Among the anti-deal crowd Trump wooed in his presidential bid, the administration's decision is fueling concerns that Trump may let the 2015 accord stand. \n Similar to Trump, Tillerson on Wednesday sought to head off criticism by describing an administration review of Iran policy that includes the nuclear deal and examines if sanctions relief serves U.S. interests. The deal, he said, \"fails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran\" and \"only delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state.\" \n The White House's decision of Tuesday's climate meeting meant top aides didn't have the chance to determine what to do about the nonbinding international deal forged in Paris in December 2015. The agreement allowed rich and poor countries to set their own goals to reduce carbon dioxide and went into effect last November. Not all of Trump's advisers share his skeptical views on climate change \u2014 or the Paris pact. \n Trump has followed through with a pledge to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sweeping free trade deal President Barack Obama negotiated. The agreement was effectively dead before Trump took office after Congress refused to ratify it. Even Trump's Democratic opponent in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton, opposed the accord. \n But on NATO, Trump has completely backed off his assertions that the treaty organization is \"obsolete.\" His Cabinet members have fanned out to foreign capitals to show America's support for the alliance and his administration now describes the 28-nation body as a pillar of Western security. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Once critical of global deals, Trump slow to pull out of any"}

Chaffee teaches ninth-grade humanities at the school, where she has worked since 2007. She also leads the humanities department and manages a partnership between the school and a local theater company. \n BOSTON >> A Massachusetts high school teacher who was named National Teacher of the Year today is believed to be the first from a charter school to win the award. \n Sydney Chaffee, who teaches at the Codman Academy Charter Public School in Boston, was selected for the honor by the Council of Chief State School Officers. Last year, she became the first charter school teacher to be named Massachusetts Teacher of the Year, and the council believes she is the first national award winner. \n Chaffee, 34, teaches ninth-grade humanities at Codman Academy, which serves inner-city students in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood. Her class teaches history and language arts by examining moments of injustice in the past, she said, ranging from decades of racial segregation in South Africa to the Haitian Revolution. \n \"For me, education is a tool for social justice,\" Chaffee said. \"We arm students to fight for the world that they want, and we arm them to fight for justice.\" \n She also leads the school's partnership with the Huntington Theatre Company in Boston, which provides acting classes to all freshmen and sophomores at the school. It's meant to help students find their voices and learn communication skills. It's also a soft spot for Chaffee, who fondly remembers acting in her high-school plays and later performing as a stand-up comic and in improv comedy. \n \"Some of that training has helped me as a teacher because, being a teacher, you're performing all the time in front of your kids, and figuring out how to hook them and how to get them engaged,\" said Chaffee, who now spends most of her spare time raising her 2-year-old daughter with her husband. \n At an urban school where many students come from low-income families, it's Chaffee's job to prepare incoming students for high school academics. Year after year since she was hired in 2007, Chaffee has succeeded, said Brendan O'Connell, principal of the upper school at Codman Academy. \n \"Over the course of her career, she's been so good at pushing students who are challenged to see new things in themselves, to overcome, to do things that they thought they never could,\" O'Connell said. \"She has this intense belief that the students can do it.\" \n The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools praised the selection Thursday. \n \"Charter school teachers are public school teachers, who alongside their district peers work tirelessly, day in and day out, to provide their students with a high-quality public school education,\" Nina Rees, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement. \n Chaffee's colleagues say her humility is part of her charm. Asked what sets her apart from other teachers, she questioned whether she's all that different. \n \"I think that one of the reasons I was selected was not because I stand out, but because I do a lot of the things a lot of great teachers do,\" she said. \"I work really hard to build relationships with students. That's how we can build a foundation on which we can then push them to take risks and grow.\" \n The winner of the national award is traditionally recognized by the president at a White House ceremony soon after being chosen. The Council of Chief State School Officers says no White House event has been confirmed, yet. \n Chaffee was one of four finalists for the national award.

French media are reporting that two police officers were shot Thursday on the famed shopping boulevard. \n PARIS >> An attacker with an automatic weapon opened fire on police on Paris' iconic Champs-Elysees today, killing one officer and seriously wounding two others before police shot and killed him. \n Paris police spokeswoman Johanna Primevert told The Associated Press that the attacker targeted officers guarding the area near the Franklin Roosevelt subway station at the center of the shopping avenue popular with tourists. She said he appeared to be acting alone. \n Police and soldiers sealed off the area, ordering tourists back into their hotels and blocking people from approaching the scene. \n The Paris prosecutor's office said counterterrorism investigators are involved in the probe. Two police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation, said the attacker had been flagged as an extremist. They had no other details about him. \n The attack came three days before the first round of balloting in France's tense presidential election. Security is high preceding the vote after police said they arrested two men Tuesday in what they described as a thwarted terror attack. \n In Thursday's attack, French Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said on BFM television that a man came out of a car and opened fire on a police vehicle. He said officers were \"deliberately\" targeted. \n Speaking in Washington during a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, U.S. President Donald Trump said the shooting in Paris \"looks like another terrorist attack\" and sent condolences to France. \n Emergency vehicles blocked the wide avenue lined with shops that cuts across central Paris between the Arc de Triomphe and the Tuileries Gardens, normally packed with cars and tourists.

Cummins has been taken into custody and the girl he had disappeared with was found in Siskiyou County in northern California. \n NASHVILLE, Tenn. >> A 15-year-old Tennessee girl was rescued near a cabin in a remote part of northern California today, more than a month after her 50-year-old teacher kidnapped her and set off a nationwide manhunt, authorities said. \n Health sciences teacher Tad Cummins surrendered to sheriff's deputies without incident in Cecilville, California, hours after they had found his vehicle in the area, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said. The girl was apparently healthy and unharmed, and authorities said their main concern was her emotional and mental state. \n \"We couldn't be happier to tell you she will soon be on her way back home to Tennessee,\" Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn said. \n Cummins faces a federal charge of taking a minor across state lines to have sex, as well as state charges of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. \n Authorities received a tip late Wednesday night that the pair may have taken up residence, perhaps for more than a week, in the woods in Cecilville, where cellphone coverage is limited, bureau spokesman Josh Devine said. Authorities had earlier said the arrest happened at a commune but later clarified that it occurred in a very remote area, where the terrain was difficult to traverse and snow was still on the ground in some places. \n The pair's disappearance March 13 came after Cummins was investigated by the school system when another student reported seeing the then-married teacher kiss the girl at the Culleoka Unit School. Culleoka is a community about 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of Nashville near the Alabama state line. \n \"We're so happy that California police worked quickly and were able to find them and get her safe,\" one of the girl's sisters told The Tennessean. \n \"I believe the FBI are going to make sure she's healthy before she comes home,\" she said. \"We'll make sure she'll get what therapy she needs and that she's safe, that she knows she's safe.\" \n The Associated Press is not naming the girl or her family members because she is an alleged victim of a sex crime. \n Court papers filed recently in the girl's disappearance said she was afraid of the teacher and thought she would face repercussions at school if she resisted him. \n A lawyer for the girl's family has said the teacher was allowed to continue working at the school for two weeks after he was reported kissing the girl. Attorney Jason Whatley has said the school system must have not believed the student's report. \n The school's investigative files provided to The Associated Press by the attorney show that both Cummins and the girl denied kissing. The teacher, however, acknowledged that the girl was \"a really good friend and she does leave her other classes to come see him when she needs someone to calm her down,\" according to a school report dated Jan. 30. \n The report recommended that the girl be taken out of Cummins' class and that he be reprimanded to uphold his professional responsibility. The report also recommended that the administration monitor Cummins' classroom to make sure students weren't there when they weren't supposed to be. \n The teacher would later be reprimanded on Feb. 3 by school principal Penny Love after the girl was seen in Cummins classroom for a little more than half an hour that day. In her letter, Love said the girl being in his classroom was a violation of the principal's order to him. \n The school system didn't suspend Cummins until Feb. 6. He was fired about a month later \u2014 a day after the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation issued an Amber Alert about the teen. \n The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said it worked tirelessly for the past five weeks, looking into more than 1,500 leads from all 50 states. \n Two days after the girl disappeared, surveillance images from a Walmart in Oklahoma City showed Cummins and the girl purchasing food items in the store with cash. The images showed Cummins had altered his hair to appear darker and the girl's hair may have changed to red. \n The teacher's wife of 31 years has filed for divorce. Court records show that Jill Cummins sued her then-missing husband on the grounds of irreconcilable differences and inappropriate marital conduct. The wife, who works for the Maury County school system, said she had not seen her husband since March 13. The couple has two children together. \n Siskiyou County Sheriff's spokeswoman Kelly Giordano did not immediately return a call for comment. \n Kristin Bender in San Francisco contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tennessee student found safe, teacher arrested in California"}

{"date": "April 20, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Feb. 21, 2017, file photo, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt speaks to employees of the EPA in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Dow Chemical is pushing the Trump administration to scrap the findings of federal scientists who point to a family of widely used pesticides as harmful to about 1,800 critically threatened or endangered species. \n Lawyers representing Dow, whose CEO also heads a White House manufacturing working group, and two other makers of organophosphates sent letters last week to the heads of three Cabinet agencies. The companies asked them \"to set aside\" the results of government studies the companies contend are fundamentally flawed. \n The letters, dated April 13, were obtained by The Associated Press. \n Dow Chemical chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris is a close adviser to President Donald Trump. The company wrote a $1 million check to help underwrite Trump's inaugural festivities. \n Over the last four years, government scientists have compiled an official record running more than 10,000 pages showing the three pesticides under review \u2014 chlorpyrifos, diazinon and malathion \u2014 pose a risk to nearly every endangered species they studied. Regulators at the three federal agencies, which share responsibilities for enforcing the Endangered Species Act, are close to issuing findings expected to result in new limits on how and where the highly toxic pesticides can be used. \n The industry's request comes after EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt announced last month he was reversing an Obama-era effort to bar the use of Dow's chlorpyrifos pesticide on food after recent peer-reviewed studies found that even tiny levels of exposure could hinder the development of children's brains. In his prior job as Oklahoma's attorney general, Pruitt often aligned himself in legal disputes with the interests of executives and corporations who supported his state campaigns. He filed more than one dozen lawsuits seeking to overturn some of the same regulations he is now charged with enforcing. \n Pruitt declined to answer questions from reporters Wednesday as he toured a polluted Superfund site in Indiana. A spokesman for the agency later told AP that Pruitt won't \"prejudge\" any potential rule-making decisions as \"we are trying to restore regulatory sanity to EPA's work.\" \n \"We have had no meetings with Dow on this topic and we are reviewing petitions as they come in, giving careful consideration to sound science and good policymaking,\" said J.P. Freire, EPA's associate administrator for public affairs. \"The administrator is committed to listening to stakeholders affected by EPA's regulations, while also reviewing past decisions.\" \n The office of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the Natural Marine Fisheries Service, did not respond to emailed questions. A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who oversees the Fish and Wildlife Service, referred questions back to EPA. \n As with the recent human studies of chlorpyrifos, Dow hired its own scientists to produce a lengthy rebuttal to the government studies showing the risks posed to endangered species by organophosphates. \n The EPA's recent biological evaluation of chlorpyrifos found the pesticide is \"likely to adversely affect\" 1,778 of the 1,835 animals and plants accessed as part of its study, including critically endangered or threatened species of frogs, fish, birds and mammals. Similar results were shown for malathion and diazinon. \n In a statement, the Dow subsidiary that sells chlorpyrifos said its lawyers asked for the EPA's biological assessment to be withdrawn because its \"scientific basis was not reliable.\" \n \"Dow AgroSciences is committed to the production and marketing of products that will help American farmers feed the world, and do so with full respect for human health and the environment, including endangered and threatened species,\" the statement said. \"These letters, and the detailed scientific analyses that support them, demonstrate that commitment.\" \n FMC Corp., which sells malathion, said the withdrawal of the EPA studies will allow the necessary time for the \"best available\" scientific data to be compiled. \n \"Malathion is a critical tool in protecting agriculture from damaging pests,\" the company said. \n Diazinon maker Makhteshim Agan of North America Inc., which does business under the name Adama, did not respond to emails seeking comment. \n Environmental advocates were not surprised the companies might seek to forestall new regulations that might hurt their profits, but said Wednesday that criticism of the government's scientists was unfounded. The methods used to conduct EPA's biological evaluations were developed by the National Academy of Sciences. \n Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said Dow's experts were trying to hold EPA scientists to an unrealistic standard of data collection that could only be achieved under \"perfect laboratory conditions.\" \n \"You can't just take an endangered fish out of the wild, take it to the lab and then expose it to enough pesticides until it dies to get that sort of data,\" Hartl said. \"It's wrong morally, and it's illegal.\" \n Originally derived from a nerve gas developed by Nazi Germany, chlorpyrifos has been sprayed on citrus fruits, apples, cherries and other crops for decades. It is among the most widely used agricultural pesticides in the United States, with Dow selling about 5 million pounds domestically each year. \n As a result, traces of the chemical are commonly found in sources of drinking water. A 2012 study at the University of California at Berkeley found that 87 percent of umbilical-cord blood samples tested from newborn babies contained detectable levels of chlorpyrifos. \n In 2005, the Bush administration ordered an end to residential use of diazinon to kill yard pests such as ants and grub worms after determining that it poses a human health risk, particularly to children. However it is still approved for use by farmers, who spray it on fruits and vegetables. \n Malathion is widely sprayed to control mosquitoes and fruit flies. It is also an active ingredient in some shampoos prescribed to children for treating lice. \n A coalition of environmental groups has fought in court for years to spur EPA to more closely examine the risk posed to humans and endangered species by pesticides, especially organophosphates. \n \"Endangered species are the canary in the coal mine,\" Hartl said. Since many of the threatened species are aquatic, he said they are often the first to show the effects of long-term chemical contamination in rivers and lakes used as sources of drinking water by humans. \n Dow, which spent more than $13.6 million on lobbying in 2016, has long wielded substantial political power in the nation's capital. There is no indication the chemical giant's influence has waned. \n When Trump signed an executive order in February mandating the creation of task forces at federal agencies to roll back government regulations, Dow's chief executive was at Trump's side. \n \"Andrew, I would like to thank you for initially getting the group together and for the fantastic job you've done,\" Trump said as he signed the order during an Oval Office ceremony. The president then handed his pen to Liveris to keep as a souvenir. \n Rachelle Schikorra, the director of public affairs for Dow Chemical, said any suggestion that the company's $1 million donation to Trump's inaugural committee was intended to help influence regulatory decisions made by the new administration is \"completely off the mark.\" \n \"Dow actively participates in policymaking and political processes, including political contributions to candidates, parties and causes, in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws,\" Schikorra said. \"Dow maintains and is committed to the highest standard of ethical conduct in all such activity.\" \n ___ \n Associated Press reporters Jack Gillum in Washington and Sophia Tareen in East Chicago, Indiana, contributed to this story. \n ___ \n Follow AP environmental writer Michael Biesecker at www.Twitter.com/mbieseck \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pesticide maker tries to kill risk study"}
