{"date": "April 21, 2017", "text": "SISKIYOU DAILY NEWS VIA AP \n Siskiyou County Sheriff Jon Lopey spoke during a press conference on Thursday. \n COLUMBIA, Tenn. >> A 15-year-old Tennessee student who was allegedly kidnapped by her teacher and taken to California is back home, a lawyer for the girl's family says. \n The girl is being evaluated and treated by mental health experts specializing in trauma, lawyer Jason Whatley said in a statement today. \n \"There is no doubt that she has suffered severe emotional trauma and that her process of recovery is only just beginning,\" Whatley said. \n He said the girl is in a safe location with friends and family and is now resting. \n Authorities credit the caretaker of a remote northern California property for helping police find her and arrest her alleged abductor, fired teacher Tad Cummins. After Griffin Barry became suspicious of two people he initially thought were in distress, his tip led police to the teacher accused of kidnapping his student and taking her on a 2,500-mile cross-country journey. \n \"The girl wasn't really looking at me or anything and he was always dominating the conversation. That kind of clues people in,\" Barry said. \n After seeing a photo of Cummins in an Amber Alert, Barry said he made the connection and called authorities. \n The Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office sent a tactical unit to the cabin Thursday morning. Cummins was arrested after he came out the cabin with the girl walking behind him, the sheriff's office said. \n Cummins was cooperative with law enforcement, Siskiyou Sheriff Jon E. Lopey told the Associated Press. He said the girl was at times \"laughing, crying and acting stoic\" after police found her at the remote cabin. \n \"These two had a relationship to the extent where she didn't exhibit any anger toward him. I didn't observe any emotional distress,\" he said. \"She didn't act like a rescued person would act,\" showing no signs of elation, he said. She appeared fine physically, Lopey said, and there were no signs of trauma. \n In the cabin, he said, was a single sleeping pad and clothing along with the two loaded guns \u2014 a 9mm and a .380 compact pistol. \n Lopey said the two had previously been at a commune called Black Bear Ranch, but \"didn't get along\" with commune residents and ended up leaving. The sheriff said the two had stopped in Berkeley first and that's how they found out about the commune. \n The AP is not naming the girl or her family members because she is an alleged victim of a sex crime. \n Cummins faces federal and state charges. \n Before leaving with the girl, Cummins had been suspended from teaching and police were zeroing in on him, questioning his relationship with the girl. \n Cummins was fired about a month after being suspended \u2014 a day after the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation issued an Amber Alert about the teen. \n After taking out a loan for $4,500, the records say, the teacher took the money and two handguns and wrote a note to his wife saying he needed to go to Virginia Beach or the Washington, D.C., area to clear his head. \n But instead of going to the beach, police say he picked up the student in Columbia, Tennessee, in his wife's car on the morning of March 13. The girl's disappearance triggered a six-week law enforcement manhunt. \n \"It is believed based on the investigation to date, as set forth herein, that Cummins, age 50, and victim, age 15, are involved in a sexual relationship and traveled in interstate commerce to continue their relationship and to engage in unlawful sexual activity,\" the criminal complaint against Cummins says. \n Cummins, the federal complaint says, is charged with taking a minor across states lines to have sex. \n The girl's father has told news media he believes his daughter was brainwashed. \n Cummins also faces state charges of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. If convicted of the federal charge, he faces at least 10 years in prison, acting U.S. Attorney Jack Smith said. \n Before disappearing, Cummins was investigated by the school system when another student reported seeing the then-married teacher kiss the girl at the Culleoka Unit School. Culleoka is about 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of Nashville near the Alabama state line. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Lawyer: Abducted Tennessee girl's recovery 'just beginning'"}

{"date": "April 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Trademark applications from Ivanka Trump Marks LLC shown on the website of China's trademark database are displayed next to a Chinese online shopping website selling purported Ivanka Trump branded footwear in Beijing. \n SHANGHAI >> Ivanka Trump's brand intensified its work in China as her father closed in on the Republican nomination for U.S. president, with her company applying for nearly twice as many trademarks in a five-month span as it had in the preceding eight years. \n Ivanka Trump Marks LLC applied for 36 trademarks in China between March and July of last year. From 2008 through 2015, it applied for a total of just 19 trademarks, China's trademark database showed . \n Three of the 2016 applications were granted preliminary approval on April 6, the same day Ivanka Trump dined with China's President Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago, the Associated Press revealed this week in an article that documented how Ivanka Trump's brand has continued to expand even as she builds a new political career in her father's administration. Ivanka Trump still owns her brand, but has stepped back from management and put its assets in a family-run trust. \n China's foreign ministry has said that the government treated Ivanka's trademarks just like everyone else's. \n Ethics experts have questioned whether that's possible, particularly in a country where the ruling Communist Party influences the courts and bureaucracy. Politically sensitive decisions on, for example, the intellectual property of the family of the U.S. president, may well have been subject to high-level political review. \n \"She needs to be very careful to make sure she's on the right side of the law,\" said Norman Eisen, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under Barack Obama. \"Personally, I find it unlikely that there is no element of Chinese favoritism in the handling of her requests.\" \n Eisen is part of a lawsuit brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog group, against President Trump for alleged violations of the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution, involving, among other things, his China trademarks. Eisen argues that if President Trump or his daughter received special treatment from China in winning intellectual property protection, it would be a violation of the Constitution, which bars federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments unless approved by Congress. \n An attorney for Ivanka Trump said she has no role in her company's trademark filings. \"She left her company in January and she does not know what is filed, where it is filed, or whether it is approved or rejected,\" attorney Jamie Gorelick said. \"She has not sought, and would not want, any special treatment for the company.\" \n \"The brand has filed, updated, and rigorously protected its international trademarks over the past several years, which included those filed in China\" since 2016, Abigail Klem, the president of Ivanka Trump's brand, said in a statement Friday. She said a surge in trademark filings by \"unrelated third parties trying to capitalize on the name\" emphasizes the need to protect the trademark. \n After the election, Ivanka's name took on new commercial glamour for Chinese copycats who filed hundreds of applications for trademarks on variations of Ivanka Trump's name in English and Mandarin, covering an unlikely array of goods, including toothpaste, diapers, diet pills and biscuits. \n Trademarks form the bedrock of a brand, offering potentially valuable monopoly rights to sell branded product in a country, and companies take out trademarks for a variety of reasons. Many countries, like China, which generally awards trademarks on a first-come-first-served basis, also allow for defensive filings, to block squatters from using a brand inappropriately. Some trademark lawyers also advise clients to take out trademarks for goods that are manufactured in China, but not sold there. \n The ramp-up in China trademark filings last year by Ivanka Trump's brand cover the use of her name in both English and Mandarin for a wide range of things including jewelry, clothing, shoes, spa and beauty services, perfume, cosmetics, and leather bags. All the applications were made before her father was elected president, according to the Trademark Office database. \n If no one objects to the legitimate Ivanka Trump trademarks provisionally approved during the Mar-a-Lago summit, they will be officially registered after 90 days. In total, since the inauguration, China has granted preliminary approval for at least five Ivanka marks , though approval for one of them was subsequently withdrawn without explanation, according to China's trademark gazette . Its current status was unclear, and China's Trademark Office could not be reached for comment on Friday. \n Ivanka Trump's brand doesn't have much of a retail presence in China. \n That's not what China's state-run Global Times newspaper led readers to believe this week, in a story that had several factual errors. Global Times splashed a story across the front-page of the business section of its English-language edition Thursday claiming that Ivanka's brand was preparing a large expansion in China and that her \"amiable attitude toward China,\" would help her business flourish. \n Klem said the report in the Global Times is \"not accurate, and as we have previously explained, all of our new agreements are subject to approval by ethics counsel.\" \n Celebrities have a significant influence in the Chinese market. \"Her father is the president, which is a better selling point. It shows her status, and she has a higher business value,\" said Hao Junbo, a lawyer at Hao Law Firm in Beijing, who was also quoted in the Global Times story, told the AP. \"Chinese people like power. It is a deep mindset among the public that power is bigger than the law.\" \n Chang Tsi & Partners, which represents Ivanka Trump's brand in China, said it had never been contacted by the Global Times and declined further comment on client matters. \n The Ivanka Trump brand also applied for nine new trademarks in Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Canada and the U.S. after her father was elected president. \"These and other filings in other countries are made in the normal course of business for any company in these categories,\" Klem said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ivanka Trump's brand ramped up China trademark work in 2016"}

Her music teacher at Island Creek Elementary in Fairfax County had built her a prosthetic allowing her to move the bow with her left arm and finger the strings with her right \u2014 the opposite of how violin is usually taught. But the prosthetic was heavy and he thought there might be a better option.

The first came in at 13 ounces (369 grams); the final version shaved an ounce or two off of that after feedback from Isabella. \n The team enlisted a music professor at Mason, Elizabeth Adams, who provided feedback on what Isabella would need to play the violin with some finesse. \n On Thursday, Isabella received her final prosthetic, built from a 3-D printer, and hot pink (at her request) with \"Isabella's attachment\" emblazoned on the forearm. \n She played some scales as she adjusted the fit, and even a few bars of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy.\" \n \"Oh, my gosh, that's so much better,\" Isabella said as she tried out the new prosthetic. \n And the team had a surprise for her, a plug-in attachment designed to let her grip a handlebar and ride a bicycle. \n \"I feel very blessed that I have this amazing group of people,\" Isabella said. \n Isabella had her heart set on playing music when the school began offering strings lessons in fourth grade. \n \"I've never told her no.

The reasons for departure can range from the mundane, such as a CEO simply being ineffective in boosting the stock price, to the salacious, with accusations of improper behavior. \n Here's a look at some other recent departures of big names and what they received as they exited, according to regulatory filings and media reports: \n \u2014 Roger Ailes, Fox News, $40 million. \n It was only last summer that the other man who helped build Fox News into a ratings behemoth had his own departure from the company following allegations of sexual harassment. Ailes was chairman and CEO of Fox News and, with O'Reilly as a high-profile host, pushed it to become the most-watched U.S. cable-news channel. \n \u2014 Jeff Smisek, United Continental, $36.8 million. \n The CEO atop United Airlines stepped down in 2015 amid an investigation into whether it flew a route between Newark, New Jersey, and Columbia, South Carolina, to curry favor with the chairman of the agency that operates New York-area airports.

He also received lifetime flight benefits. \n \u2014 Marissa Mayer, Yahoo, $23 million. \n The woman brought in to save the struggling internet giant may soon be on the way out after brokering a deal to break it up. Verizon is buying Yahoo's email service and other websites, and the deal is expected to close by the end of June. The remaining part of Yahoo, which is also the far more valuable one, will be turned over to a new company called Altbaba.

Lines at other stations were much longer than usual and prices appeared to be rising significantly. \n The cause of the restrictions or how long they might last were not immediately known. \n North Korea relies heavily on China for its fuel supply and Beijing has reportedly been tightening its enforcement of international sanctions aimed at getting Pyongyang to abandon its development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. \n The issue was raised at a regular Chinese Foreign Ministry news conference in Beijing on Friday after a Chinese media outlet, Global Times, reported gas stations were restricting service and charging higher prices. \n But spokesman Lu Kang gave an ambiguous response when asked if China was restricting fuel deliveries. \n \"As for what kind of policy China is taking, I think you should listen to the authoritative remarks or statements of the Chinese government,\" he said, without elaborating on what those remarks or statements are. \"For the remarks made by certain people or circulated online, it is up to you if you want to take them as references.\" \n One of China's top North Korea scholars, Kim Dong-jil, director of the Center for Korean Peninsula Studies of Peking University, said he had not heard of new restrictions on fuel to pressure Pyongyang, but said they are considered to be an option. \n China's Ministry of Commerce had no immediate comment. \n Gasoline was selling at $1.25 per kilogram at one station, up from the previous 70-80 cents. According to a sign outside a station where ordinary North Korean vehicles were being turned away, the restrictions took effect on Wednesday. \n Gasoline is sold in North Korea by the kilogram, roughly equivalent to a liter (0.26 gallon). \n When buying gas in North Korea, customers usually first purchase coupons at a cashier's booth for the amount of fuel they want. After filling up the tank, leftover coupons can be used on later visits until their expiration date. A common amount for the coupons is 15 kilograms (19.65 liters or 5.2 U.S. gallons). \n Supply is controlled by the state. \n The military, state ministries and priority projects have the best access.

Smith and his husband Taylor paid more than $20,000 in Hawaii for a fertility procedure when they decided to have a child using a surrogate mother. They did not know at the time that if they were a heterosexual couple, they might have saved that money. \n Hawaii lawmakers killed a bill that sought equal access to fertility treatments for gay and lesbian couples and single women. \n The decision came after health care lobbyists argued it was a bad idea to make insurers cover a fertility procedure for surrogate mothers that gay male couples rely on to have a child. \n State Sen. Rosalyn Baker, the Senate's lead negotiator for the bill, suggested killing the bill at a committee hearing today. \n \"I'm not certain that it's ready for prime time, considering that we have no surrogacy laws on the books in the state of Hawaii, and I believe we need to address those,\" Baker said. \n The bill had passed the House and Senate in different forms and was in a conference committee where negotiators from the House and Senate hash out their differences. \n Hawaii law requires insurance companies to cover one round of in vitro fertilization for some married, heterosexual women. The procedure in which a doctor retrieves eggs from a woman, combines them with sperm from a man and then implants an embryo into a woman's uterus can cost more than $20,000 and often requires more than one round of treatment. \n The bill sought to extend that insurance mandate to same-sex female couples, single women and surrogate mothers that gay male couples rely on to have a child. It also sought to reduce a wait time for the benefit from five years of infertility to one year. \n Hawaii's major health insurers told lawmakers they already cover in vitro fertilization for lesbian couples and single women. But they didn't want to cover the procedure for surrogates because they feared legal complications, especially because there are no state laws covering surrogates. \n While two major Hawaii insurers have taken steps to include female same-sex couples in their fertility coverage, there are other insurance companies that have not, said Mandy Finlay, advocacy coordinator for the ACLU of Hawaii. \n \"We have heard that discrimination is happening, and whether that's human error or whether it's a discriminatory policy that's in place, that issue needs to be resolved, and the best way to do that is by eliminating the discriminatory language in our state law,\" Finlay said. \n Baker said she would rather pass a pending resolution that asks the state attorney general to study surrogacy and she hopes lawmakers can work on the issue in coming months and revisit it next session. \n \"I would hope that maybe that there would be some elements that we could salvage at this time, but given the fact that the absence of surrogacy laws in our state is difficult, I would concur with you,\" said Rep. Della Au Bellati, a negotiator for the bill in the House. \n Sean Smith, who with his husband paid out-of-pocket for IVF procedures performed on the surrogate who carried their son to term, said he was \"just shocked and sad and surprised that they couldn't agree to keep any parts of the bill.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Hawaii lawmakers kill bill seeking equal access to fertility treatment"}

Pence will meet with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Saturday as part of his 10-day, four country trip to Asia. \n SYDNEY >> Vice President Mike Pence sought to reassure Australia on Saturday that the U.S. remains committed to the countries' longtime alliance, as he tried to patch up relations that were left frayed when President Donald Trump got into a spat with Australia's leader over a refugee resettlement deal. \n Pence met with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and other Australian leaders in Sydney as part of his 10-day, four-country trip to the Pacific Rim. His agenda includes reassuring Turnbull about the state of the unusually strained U.S.-Australia alliance and laying out the new administration's priorities for the region. \n \"I bring greetings this morning from the President of the United States,\" Pence told Turnbull and other Australian officials ahead of their meeting. \"I spoke to him first thing and he wanted me to pass along his very best regards to you. And the president wanted me to \u2014 early in this administration \u2014 to reaffirm the strong and historical alliance between the United States and Australia.\" \n Pence's visit Down Under is widely viewed as an effort to smooth over relations with Australia in the wake of a highly-publicized argument between Turnbull and Trump. After taking office, Trump was infuriated upon learning that the previous Obama administration had agreed to a refugee resettlement deal with Australia. Under the agreement, the U.S. would take up to 1,250 refugees that Australia houses in detention camps on the Pacific island nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Trump's anger over the deal led to a tense phone call with Turnbull in January and an angry tweet in which the president dubbed the deal \"dumb.\" \n The fallout has strained the typically cozy alliance between the U.S. and Australia. A majority of Australians view Trump unfavorably, and some critics of the president have urged Australia to distance itself from the U.S. in favor of stronger ties with China. Turnbull has resisted pressure to choose between the two countries, both of which are considered vital allies; the U.S. is Australia's most important security partner, while China is its most important trading partner. \n The affection Australia and the U.S. usually share for each other is rooted in decades of cooperation on defense, intelligence and trade. Australia has fought alongside the U.S. in every major conflict since World War I, and is one of the largest contributors to the U.S.-led military campaign in Iraq and Syria. The country is also part of the \"Five Eyes\" intelligence-sharing program with the U.S., along with Canada, Britain and New Zealand. \n Earlier Saturday, Pence met with Governor-General Peter Cosgrove, who said the relationship between the countries is as strong as it was since \"the first time we saw each other on the battlefield in 1919.\" Cosgrove said the alliance that began during World War I started an \"unbreakable relationship.\" \n \"We've been with you every step of the way,\" Cosgrove told Pence. \n Pence is also scheduled to meet with Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and the leader of the opposition party, Bill Shorten.

David Ige's controversial nominee to the state agency that regulates Hawaii's utilities. \n Nominee Tom Gorak has been serving as interim member of the state Public Utilities Commission since Ige appointed him in June \u2014 a move that stirred controversy and a lawsuit from a former PUC chairwoman, as it came days before the PUC's decision to reject Florida-based NextEra Energy Inc.'s $4.3 billion bid to buy Hawaii's largest electric utility. \n \"I strongly recommend against the appointment of this nominee and encourage the members of this committee to not advise and consent,\" committee Chairwoman Rosalyn Baker (D, West Maui-South Maui) said at a Friday hearing. \n The committee voted 4-3 to not recommend confirmation of Gorak. The decision is now up to the full Senate, which can confirm Gorak if 13 of the 25 senators vote in favor before May 4. \n Baker said the issue with Gorak is not about his qualifications, but how the governor made the appointment without consulting the Senate. \n \"The end result (of approving Gorak) would be that the constitutional authority of the Senate to advise and consent would be permanently diminished and the inappropriate actions of the executive would be legitimized,\" Baker said. \n The vote was made after Gorak addressed the committee, following speakers from Hawaii's energy community who voiced support and opposition to his nomination. \n During his testimony, Gorak said he did not ask to be nominated and the governor never asked his opinion of NextEra's purchase of HEI. \n \"The way I was raised, when the governor of the state calls you and asks you to do something you say yes,\" Gorak said. \"And I said yes.\" \n More than 30 individuals have submitted written testimony supporting Gorak's appointment. Some of those in support included PUC Chairman Randy Iwase, former Consumer Advocate Jeff Ono, the Sierra Club of Hawaii and Mark Duda of Hawaii PV Coalition. \n Two people testified against his appointment, including former PUC Chairwoman Mina Morita and a former PUC staff member. \n Morita filed a lawsuit against Ige's appointment seeking to remove Gorak, alleging he had no legal right to hold the position. A Hawaii First Circuit Court ruled in August that Ige's appointment of Gorak is valid. Morita's appeal of that ruling is pending with the Hawaii Intermediate Court of Appeals. \n ", "author": "", "title": "Senate committee votes against Ige's choice for PUC"}

Young immigrants protected by executive action from deportation say they won't \"rest easy,\" even if President Donald Trump said they should. \n HOUSTON >> Young immigrants protected by executive action from deportation say they won't \"rest easy,\" even if President Donald Trump says they should. \n Several \"dreamers\" told The Associated Press on Friday that they were not comforted by Trump's pledge, in an AP interview, that he wouldn't target the 800,000 people brought to the U.S. as children and living in the country illegally under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \n Trump told the AP that his administration is \"not after the 'dreamers,' we are after the criminals.\" \n \"Here is what they can hear: The 'dreamers' should rest easy,\" Trump said. \"OK? I'll give you that. The 'dreamers' should rest easy.\" \n It was Trump's latest statement expressing support for immigrants in the program, even as his administration broadly cracks down on illegal immigration. U.S. officials have promised to speed up and widen deportations, and threatened local governments that don't cooperate with federal immigration agents. \n \"Obviously actions speak louder than words,\" said Saba Nafees, a 24-year-old 'dreamer' who is a graduate student at Texas Tech University. \"His actions are pretty terrifying. What I've seen across the country, it's unbearable for all of these families.\" \n Juan Escalante, a 28-year-old who came to the U.S. from Venezuela at age 11, said he was \"not comforted by the president's words.\" \n \"He has said he will treat us with 'heart' and to 'rest easy,' and it just seems so general,\" Escalante said. \n Some young immigrants pointed to the case of Juan Manuel Montes, a 23-year-old whose attorneys say is the first person enrolled in the DACA program to be deported. After initially denying Montes was covered by DACA, federal authorities said this week that Montes had violated the conditions of the program. \n Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, which is representing Montes, said Trump was trying to have it both ways. \n \"This is a president who is saying, 'I love dreamers and I care about them as children,' and yet is turning around and traumatizing them and their families,\" she said. \n The program, launched by Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, stayed deportation and granted work authorization to certain immigrants brought to the U.S. before their 16th birthday. The young people who benefit are called dreamers because the program mimics versions of the so-called DREAM Act, which would have provided legal status for young immigrants but was never passed by Congress. \n Trump has left Obama's program in place, and he said before his January inauguration that people protected under DACA would \"end up being very happy.\" A month later, he called the program \"a very difficult thing for me as I love these kids.\" \n Rafael Robles, 26, and two of his siblings have relied on the program for years to go to school and work in the U.S. Their parents brought them to the Chicago area from Mexico as young children on visitor visas, which they overstayed. \n \"In a weird way it does put my mind at ease because at least there is something to bring forward if he were to change his mind,\" said Robles, who works at a real estate development company. \"It sort of sends a message that they are having conversations about 'dreamers.'\" \n But Greisa Martinez, an immigrant in the program who is also advocacy director for the group United We Dream, said Trump could push Congress to give 'dreamers' permanent legal status if he wanted. \n \"Just telling me that he loves me and wants me to rest easy doesn't make me be able to be any more safe or more secure in my home, or tell my mother that everything is going to be OK,\" Martinez said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Young immigrants won't 'rest easy' despite Trump's comments"}

{"date": "April 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n France began picking itself up Friday from another deadly shooting claimed by the Islamic State group, with President Francois Hollande convening the government's security council and his would-be successors in the presidential election campaign treading carefully before voting this weekend. \n PARIS >> The gunman who shot and killed a police officer on the famed Champs-Elysees just days before the French presidential vote spent 14 years in prison, including for attacking other officers, Frances's anti-terrorism prosecutor said today \u2014 a lengthy criminal history that gave a jolt to an already nail-biting election and fueled growing security concerns. \n Yet, despite an arrest as recently as February, the 39-year-old assailant, Karim Cheurfi, had shown no signs of radicalization, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said, and was released for lack of evidence of a threat. \n That all changed Thursday when Cheurfi, a Frenchman born in the Paris suburbs, opened fire with a Kalashnikov assault rifle on the crowded boutique-lined boulevard synonymous with French glamour, striking a police officer with two bullets to the head and wounding two others before being shot and killed by police. \n Security forces found a note praising the Islamic State group at the scene of the attack, which apparently fell from the gunman's pocket. That, along with an unusually quick claim of responsibility by the Islamic State group were the only signs that he had entered the world of Islamic extremists, Molins said. Scraps of paper scrawled with the addresses of police stations and a satchel of weapons, munitions and the Muslim holy book were discovered in his car. \n Thursday's shootings followed the arrest this week of two men in Marseille on suspicion of plotting an attack around Sunday's hotly contested first-round presidential vote, fueling France's worst fear: a terrorist attack as crowds gather at polling stations across the nation. \n Polls suggest a tight race among the four top contenders, with far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen \u2014 who rails at France's Socialist government for being lax on crime \u2014 and Emmanuel Macron, an independent centrist and former economy minister, in the lead. \n However, conservative former Prime Minister Francois Fillon, whose campaign was initially derailed by corruption allegations that his wife was paid as his parliamentary aide, appeared to be closing the gap, as was far-leftist, Jean-Luc Melenchon. \n The attack in Paris appeared a perfect fit for Le Pen and her barbed criticism of authorities she accuses of being naive on terrorism. The outcome of the election was being closely watched for signs that Europe is moving toward nationalist candidates like Le Pen. \n U.S. President Donald Trump waded into the fray Friday, asserting in an interview with The Associated Press that the attack will stoke Le Pen's chances. \n \"She's the strongest on borders and she's the strongest on what's been going on in France,\" Trump said in the Oval Office interview, noting that he was not specifically endorsing the far-right candidate. \n \"Whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism, and whoever is the toughest at the borders, will do well in the election,\" he said. \n Le Pen, who wants France to exit the EU, says her first move if elected will be to regain control of the nation's borders, something she says is a critical component of sovereignty and a way to end what she calls a \"sieve\" for terrorists. \n France is part of a treaty for a borderless Europe, allowing travelers to freely come and go. \n Le Pen has hammered at the security issue, and on Friday she demanded the government immediately re-establish border controls. Bernard Cazeneuve, the Socialist prime minister, accused Le Pen of electoral opportunism in the face of a tragedy. He noted that Le Pen's National Front party voted against an anti-terrorism law in 2014 and, in 2015, against a law that beefed up resources for French intelligence services. \n Campaigning by the 11 presidential candidates got off to a slow start, bogged down by corruption charges around once-top candidate Fillon before belatedly switching focus to France's biggest fear: a new attack. \n The French president will be chosen in a runoff of the top two candidates on May 7. \n Sunday's vote is being held under a state of emergency, in place since terror attacks in 2015. Security is tight, with some 50,000 police and gendarmes joining 7,000 soldiers deployed around the nation for the vote. However, it was unclear whether Thursday's deadly assault would sway or dissuade the legions of undecided voters. \n \"Nothing must hamper this democratic moment, essential for our country,\" Cazeneuve said after a high-level meeting Friday that reviewed the government's security plans. \n But Molins, the prosecutor for terrorism cases in France, underscored the challenge of defeating an enemy hiding within. \n \"This last dramatic event shows, I believe, that we must remain humble\" despite the extraordinary mobilization of anti-terrorism forces, he said. \n The attack appeared to fit a pattern of European extremists targeting security forces and symbols of state to discredit, take vengeance on or destabilize society. It recalled recent attacks on French soldiers providing security at prominent locations around Paris: at the Louvre museum in February and at Paris' Orly airport last month. \n Whether voters will cast a ballot for security, normalcy or not at all is up for grabs. But pollsters are doubtful the attack will sway the vote. \n \"People unfortunately have grown accustomed to such violence,\" said Emmanuel Riviere of the Kantar Public consultancy firm. \n \"What could have an impact is if the candidates try to use the attack\" for political gain, he said. \"They would pay a heavy price for that.\" \n The slain policeman was identified as Xavier Jugele by a French association of LGBT police officers. Its president, Mickael Bucheron, told AP he would have celebrated his 38th birthday at the beginning of May. \n Jugele was among the officers who responded to the gun-and-bomb attack on Paris' Bataclan concert hall on Nov. 13, 2015, among a wave of assaults that night. He returned to the concert venue for its reopening a year later with a concert by Sting. \n On Friday, police officers gathered at the spot where their colleague was killed to lay flowers and say farewell. \n \"This is the moment of paying respect, solidarity and support,\" said Dennis Jacob of the Alternative Police Union. \"To express our sadness and anger facing this new attack in which one of our own has died for France, serving the French population.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Champs-Elysees gunman had long criminal record, praised IS"}

{"date": "April 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Supporters of then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump held signs, Oct. 27, during a campaign rally in Springfield, Ohio. The Trump administration insisted that \"drain the swamp\" is more than a throwaway catchphrase, yet in the last three months, the White House has become less transparent, hired scores of special interest players, raised money from lobbyists and taken no concrete steps to address campaign finance. \n WASHINGTON >> The leader of a bipartisan good-government group, Zach Wamp, headed to the White House last week to ask whether President Donald Trump's \"drain the swamp\" slogan would ever be more than a throwaway campaign slogan. One of the president's closest aides, Steve Bannon, assured him it's a priority. \n Bannon said he \"agrees with the concept that Washington is rigged,\" said Wamp, a former Republican congressman. \"He said he just needs to figure out what to do about it.\" \n Yet within 48 hours of the visit, the White House announced the end of an Obama administration practice aimed at greater transparency in government: It would no longer release the names of visitors to the executive mansion. \n It was another step away from the goal of \"drainage,\" curbing the outsized influence of Washington powerbrokers. Then, a filing this week showed that the president raised a record $107 million for his inauguration, much of it from companies and people who do business with the government. \n Trump also has brought scores of special-interest players into government. And he has yet to push any proposals to tighten campaign finance or lobbying disclosure rules. \n Trump's boldest anti-swamp move \u2014 a January executive order limiting the lobbying of outgoing officials \u2014 has already been undermined by a waiver he granted to at least one departing employee. The administration says it will never share information about when or why it makes those decisions, another change from the Obama era. \n \"What they do on 'drain the swamp' is very much to-be-determined,\" Wamp said. \"I think \u2014 at least I hope \u2014 my stop there last week was a reminder that these things matter.\" \n Bannon did not respond to requests for comment, and the White House says it considers Trump's early bureaucracy-slimming moves to be part of its drain-the-swamp work. At a rally last month in Louisville, Kentucky, Trump re-upped his vow: \"We are going to drain the swamp of government corruption in Washington, D.C., and we are going to keep our promises, all of the promises that we made.\" \n Indeed, \"drain the swamp\" is scrawled on one of chief strategist Bannon's white boards documenting those campaign pledges. Rep. Ken Buck, a Colorado Republican who wrote a book about the corrupting influence that fundraising has on Congress (titled, conveniently, \"Drain the Swamp\"), said Trump has \"surrounded himself with people who want to find solutions.\" He is optimistic that the president will make good on his word but argues that a mile-long White House to-do list means it'll take time. \n Democrats are skeptical Trump will ever deliver. \n \"There's a huge gap between what he's said going back to his campaign days, and what he's done,\" said Rep. John Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat who has introduced several bills aimed at reducing money in politics. \"I don't at this point have any confidence that anything he said about accountability and transparency was anything more than a head fake.\" \n Tackling corruption in Washington \u2014 a goal tied to increasing transparency and decreasing the influence of lobbyists and major donors \u2014 interests people of all political persuasions. A January NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 66 percent of Americans agree that \"reducing the influence of lobbyists and big money in politics\" is an \"absolute priority for this year.\" \n Wamp works with a Washington-based nonprofit called Issue One, which has collected 180 past and current public officials from both major parties in what it calls the \"reformers caucus\" and is pitching Capitol Hill on ways to change the way politicians raise money. \n Issue One, like other good-government advocates, has been sharply critical of Trump's secrecy decisions. Yet Issue One also sees the unconventional president as a natural potential partner, particularly on campaign finance changes such as incentivizing small donors and making the Federal Election Commission enforce rules already on the books. \n Trump raised a stunning $282 million from donors giving $200 or less to his 2016 campaign and a joint account with the Republican Party. Even a tweet urging lawmakers to take up the subjects of money in politics and lobbying would help, Wamp said. \"His bully pulpit is like no other.\" \n A CBS News poll just before Trump's inauguration found that just under half of Americans think he will be able to get big money out of politics in the next four years. In a twist, Democrats and Independents more so than Republicans had faith in Trump on that issue, according to the poll. \n Meredith McGehee, a senior adviser at Issue One who has worked for decades on campaign finance proposals, said money in politics has always been a \"third rail\" topic because lawmakers want to preserve their seats by preserving the status quo on fundraising. That means not only spending countless hours dialing for dollars for their own campaign accounts but also for leadership accounts that get parceled out to help the rest of the party. \n \"It's an insider system, and Trump did not run on being an insider,\" McGehee said. Buck also makes that case in his book. \n As Wamp said he put it to Bannon: \"Trump would not be president if the stench from the swamp hadn't gotten so bad in the first place.\" \n AP polling editor Emily Swanson contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump secrecy moves threaten his 'drain the swamp' pledge"}

My base definitely wants the border wall,\" Trump said in the Oval Office interview.

He would not provide details of rate proposals or how he planned to pay for the package but asserted the cuts for Americans will be \"bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever.\" \n Congressional Republicans seemed caught off guard by Trump's announcement and did not appear to have been briefed on the details of the White House's forthcoming plan. \n Trump spoke with the AP ahead of his 100th day in office, a marker he panned as \"artificial.\" \n Still, the White House is eager to tout progress on the litany of agenda items he promised to fulfill in his first 100 days, despite setbacks including court bans on his proposed immigration limits and a high-profile failure in repealing and replacing the current health care law. \n The president said Friday he spent his first 100 days laying the \"foundation\" for progress later in his administration.

But after the election, Trump started speaking more favorably about these immigrants, popularly dubbed \"dreamers.\" \n On Friday, he said that when it comes to them, \"This is a case of heart.\" \n This week, attorneys for Juan Manuel Montes said the 23-year-old was recently deported to Mexico despite having qualified for deferred deportation. Trump said Montes' case is \"a little different than the dreamer case,\" though he did not specify why. \n The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was launched in 2012 as a stopgap to protect some young immigrants from deportation while the administration continued to push for an immigration overhaul in Congress. \n Obama's administrative program offered a reprieve from deportation to those immigrants in the country illegally who could prove they arrived before they were 16, had been in the United States for several years and had not committed a crime since being here. It mimicked versions of the so-called DREAM Act, which would have provided legal status for young immigrants but was never passed by Congress. \n DACA also provides work permits for the immigrants and is renewable every two years. As of December, about 770,000 young immigrants had been approved for the program. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump tells young immigrants in U.S. illegally to 'rest easy'"}

Muhammad was arrested on Tuesday shortly after the deadly morning rampage that left several dead according to police. \n FRESNO, Calif. >> The suspect in this week's racially motivated shooting rampage in Fresno shouted Friday that natural disasters will increasingly hit the United States as he was ushered into a cramped courtroom for his first appearance before a judge. \n Kori Ali Muhammad, 39, was supposed to be officially informed about the first-degree murder charge he is accused of in the shooting death of an unarmed security guard, Carl Allen Williams III. \n Authorities have said he then killed three more people in the rampage, targeting white victims, before he was caught. \n Court records reviewed by The Associated Press on Friday showed Muhammad has been accused of a series of violent incidents dating back two decades, to when he was charged with beating the mother of his child and threatening to burn down her home if she went to police. \n The reading of the charge in the security guard's slaying never happened Friday because Muhammad had another outburst, yelling \"Let black people go\" and a phrase similar to \"in reparations\" that was not clearly enunciated. \n His court appointed lawyer, Eric Christensen, then told the judge: \"I believe this gentleman may not be mentally competent to proceed.\" \n Muhammad yelled again. The judge canceled the proceedings, setting bail at $2.6 million and ordering a mental evaluation for Muhammad. \n Police have said Muhammad told them that learning he was wanted for the Williams killing prompted him to try to kill as many white people as possible before he was caught. \n He shot three other white men at random Tuesday, police said, including a Pacific Gas & Electric utility worker sitting in a truck and two men who had come out of a Catholic Charities building. \n Muhammad fired 17 rounds in less than two minutes, police said. Officers with help from acoustic sensors posted in the area arrested him less than five minutes after the rampage began. \n Muhammad said Williams showed him disrespect while Muhammad was visiting a woman at the motel, according to police. \n Prosecutors said they are waiting for investigators to finish compiling their case before filing charges related the other three victims. \n Christensen after the court hearing declined comment about his client or the authorities' case. \n Years ago, Muhammad was accused in four cases of beating two women, according to Sacramento County court records retrieved from the archives at the AP's request. \n \"He threw her to floor, threw her on bed, and grabbed her hair,\" read the investigating officer's account of the assault on his child's mother in 1997. A witness said she saw Muhammad slap the woman several times and later stomp on her head with his bare foot at least twice. \n Before leaving, Muhammad threatened that \"if they called the police, he would burn down their apartment,\" according to the sheriff's detective's written account. \n Despite the witness' statement and what an officer observed to be bumps and abrasions on the victim, the charge was dismissed. But he later pleaded no contest to threatening the same woman with death or serious injury three weeks later, and was sentenced to seven days in jail. \n In August 2000, he was charged with punching a different woman in the face, then forcing her into a vehicle. The victim, his live-in girlfriend at the time, went to stay with a girlfriend, according to the investigating officer's account. But the next morning he pulled the victim to the floor, hitting and kicking her with his hands and feet. He later threatened to kill her, according to the detective's request for an arrest warrant. \n Charges from that alleged attack were dismissed, but the next year he was sentenced to eight days in jail after pleading no contest to a second assault on the same woman. \n In 2004 he pleaded no contest to carrying a loaded gun in public and was sentenced to 90 days in jail. \n They were among the nine Sacramento County criminal cases Muhammad faced between 1997 and 2004 under several aliases. Other charges included check fraud and driving under the influence. \n Muhammad frequently pleaded no contest within days of being charged. \n He spent several years on probation with periodic jail terms for probation violations before he was sent to federal prison in 2005 for possessing cocaine with intent to distribute. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fresno killings suspect has 2-decade history of violence"}

{"date": "April 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A woman held a sign at a Jan. 25 rally outside of City Hall in San Francisco. The Trump administration is moving beyond rhetoric in its effort to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. \n WASHINGTON >> The Trump administration intensified its threats to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal immigration authorities, sending letters today to nine jurisdictions warning it would withhold coveted law enforcement grant money unless they document cooperation. \n The letters went to officials in California and in major cities including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and New Orleans, all places the Justice Department's inspector general has identified as limiting the information local law enforcement can provide to federal immigration authorities about those in their custody. \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions has increasingly warned that the administration will punish communities that refuse to cooperate with efforts to find and deport immigrants in the country illegally. \n In a statement today, the Justice Department said the recipients of its letters are \"crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime.\" \n After a raid led to the arrests of 11 MS-13 gang members in California's Bay Area \"city officials seemed more concerned with reassuring illegal immigrants that the raid was unrelated to immigration than with warning other MS-13 members that they were next,\" the department said. \n The federal law in question says state and local governments may not prohibit police or sheriffs from sharing information about a person's immigration status with federal authorities. Today's letters warn officials they must provide proof from an attorney that they are following the law or risk losing thousands of dollars in federal grant money that police agencies use to pay for anything from body cameras to bulletproof vests. \n The money could be withheld in the future, or terminated, if they fail to show proof, wrote Alan R. Hanson, acting head of the Office of Justice Programs, which administers the grant program, which is the leading source of federal justice funding to state and local communities. \n The targeted jurisdictions also include Clark County, Nevada; Cook County, Illinois; Miami-Dade County, Florida; and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. \n They were highlighted in a May 2016 report by the Justice Department's inspector general that found they have policies or rules that interfere with information-sharing among local law enforcement and immigration agents. \n The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, for example, has a policy to decline all requests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to keep a suspected deportable immigrant in its custody long enough for immigration authorities to arrest the person unless that person is charged with certain violent crimes, according to the report. \n It also pointed to a Milwaukee County rule that immigration detention requests be honored only if the person has been convicted of one felony or two misdemeanors, has been charged with domestic violence or drunken driving, is a gang member or is on a terrorist watch list, among other constraints. \n The Obama administration warned cities after the report's release that they could miss out on grant money if they did not comply with the law, but it never actually withheld funds. \n The grants in question are based on population and support an array of programs, technology and equipment for local law enforcement agencies, which can use the money at their discretion. \n Sessions said earlier this week that sanctuary cities undermine efforts to fight violent gangs. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Justice Dept. threatens sanctuary cities in immigration fight"}

{"date": "April 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Authorities are searching for Jackson Standefer, 14, and Lou-Ann Merrell, 62, after the pair lost their footing Saturday and fell into the water during a family trip in a remote area of the Arizona park. \n PHOENIX >> The desperate effort this week to find two hikers who disappeared at the bottom of the Grand Canyon represented the National Park Service's most extensive use yet of drones in a search-and-rescue mission. \n The Grand Canyon is the only national park with its own fleet of unmanned aircraft for reaching people who have gotten lost, stranded, injured or killed. Under a program that began last fall, it has five drones and four certified operators. \n While the aerial search for the two hikers came up empty, it threw a spotlight on technology that can enter crevices and other rugged spots unreachable by foot while sparing searchers the dangers of going up in a helicopter. \n With its steep cliffs, nearly 2,000 square miles and mesmerizing views, the Grand Canyon can be as dangerous as it is captivating. \n Rangers were confronted with 1,200 medical emergencies, 293 search-and-rescue missions and 17 deaths in 2016, a year in which the park had nearly 6 million visitors. Last summer, a 35-year-old Yelp executive tripped while hiking, fell backward and was found dead 400 feet below. \n \"Our historic model was to take the helicopter to look and see,\" said Grand Canyon chief ranger Matt Vandzura. But now, drones can offer \"that same close look but without putting any people at risk. It has dramatically increased our ability to keep our people safe.\" \n The drones are about 18 inches across and 10 inches high, with a battery life of about 20 minutes. Drone operators watch the video in real time and then analyze it again at the end of the day. \n The aircraft were used Monday through Wednesday in the search for LouAnn Merrell, 62, and her step grandson, Jackson Standefer, 14. The park also sent out three ground search teams of about 20 people in all, an inflatable motor boat and a helicopter. \n Merrell and Standefer vanished last weekend after losing their footing while crossing a creek near the North Rim. They were on a hike with Merrell's husband, Merrell Boot Co. co-founder Randy Merrell, and the boy's mother. \n The park scaled back the operation and stopped using the drones but continued the search. In a statement, the hikers' families backed the decision and said they were \"still praying for a miracle.\" \n The drones have been used a few of times already. \n In November, after a visitor drove off a cliff and died, drones were sent in to examine the trees and brush and make sure it was safe for a helicopter to fly in and lift the car out. \n The next month, rangers used a drone to locate a woman who had jumped to her death. Then they rappelled down to retrieve the body. \n The dangers of flying choppers in the canyon were illustrated in 2003, when a Park Service helicopter experienced a mechanical failure and crash-landed on the North Rim. Those aboard suffered only minor injuries; the helicopter was totaled. \n Other national parks use drones, but for wildlife research. The use of private drones is prohibited in national parks. \n James Doyle, a spokesman for the park service's Intermountain region, said other national parks will probably seek their own drone fleets, too. He said the Grand Canyon's extreme topography \u2014 it is a mile deep \u2014 makes it a perfect candidate. \n \"It's a wonderful tool for the unfortunate situation we just found ourselves in at Grand Canyon,\" Doyle said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Drones used for first time in major search at Grand Canyon"}

Ben Cayetano has taken out a full-page ad in today's Washington Post appealing directly to President Donald Trump to end the federal government's spending deal with Honolulu on rail transit. \n The ad, which says it was paid for by the Princess Abigail K. Kawananakoa Foundation, asks Trump to withhold the $800 million or so left in the Federal Transit Administration's $1.55 billion full funding grant agreement, a move that Cayetano says will compel the city to \"seriously consider some of the less costly alternatives to complement the rail system.\" \n The ad notes that rail's costs have nearly doubled in the past several years, rising from about $5.26 billion (Cayetano puts it at $5.28 billion) at the time the federal deal was inked to costs approaching $10 billion when the financing and costs to pay off interest are included. \n \"Honolulu's rail project does not deserve a single dollar more from the federal government,\" Cayetano's signed ad states. \"It has become a poster boy for how politics incompetence, disinformation and outright lies are at the root of wasteful rail projects which do little for the public except raise taxes.\" \n Kawananakoa funded a lawsuit against the city in recent years, challenging the validity of City Council votes for the transit project, arguing that members had not publicly disclosed conflicts of interest. \n The ad further includes renderings prepared several years ago by the Honolulu chapter of the American Institute of Architects that show before-and-after images of Nimitz Highway with a large, concrete guideway running down the corridor. \n \"If built, this will change the beauty and ambience of the city forever,\" it reads. \n The ad looks to upend the 20-mile, 21-station project as planned at one of the most critical junctures in its history. With the cost increases, the project is currently about $3 billion short of what's needed to finish it and state lawmakers are weighing another extension of Oahu's general excise tax surcharge. \n The city and its rail agency also have an April 30 deadline to give the FTA a \"recovery plan\" on how they aim to deal with the funding obstacles and still build a viable system. They're hoping another GET extension will mostly help fix that challenge. \n If the FTA doesn't accept whatever plan the city submits, it could revoke the $1.55 billion. \n ", "author": "By Marcel Honor\u00e9 mhonore@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Cayetano asks Trump to ax Honolulu rail funds"}

A wide area of San Francisco was hit by a power outage. The blackout hit at midmorning today in the Financial District and other areas. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A fire truck at top left and other traffic tried to make their way around a pair of idled cablecars on California Street after a large power outage today in San Francisco. Pacific Gas & Electric said about 90,000 customers have been affected by the outage. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> A San Francisco power outage that stranded people in elevators and left tens of thousands of others in the dark today was caused by the massive failure of a circuit breaker that sparked a fire at a power substation, a utility company spokesman said. \n Pacific Gas & Electric posted online just after 5 p.m. that power had been restored to all the 90,000 customers who lost it in the Financial District and other areas of the city. Spokesman Barry Anderson said the equipment failed before a planned repair. \n The Fire Department tweeted that it had responded to more than 100 calls for service, including 20 stuck elevators with people inside. At hospitals, surgeries were disrupted briefly but no problems were reported because backup generators kicked in, Mayor Ed Lee said. \n \"The best news of all was no injuries were associated with this incident,\" Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White said. \n No traffic collisions were reported, either, and officials thanked motorists for driving so cautiously during the blackout. In fact, people in the city of 850,000 people were generally courteous to each another. \n The city's iconic cable cars were taken out of service as a precaution since streetlights were not operating on large parts of their routes. \n Tourists weren't griping, though, said spokeswoman Erica Kato. \"Everyone's very understanding \u2014 it's not us,\" she said. \n The outage initially closed the Bay Area Rapid Transit agency's downtown Montgomery Station. People used the lights of their cellphones to walk through the darkened station before service was restored. \n Later, people milled on sidewalks, controllers directed traffic manually, and shops were dark. Some buildings had power, others did not. ATM screens were blank and the city's famed cable cars were shut down for hours. \n People were confused about what was going on and what to do, said Pam Martinez, a 25-year-old San Francisco resident and software engineer who was on a train when she heard the announcement that her destination station was closed. \n \"Even crossing the street was chaotic because the streetlights don't work and there's a few ambulances trying to go through the crowds,\" Martinez said. \"It's pretty crazy.\" \n Patricio Herrera sat glumly in his darkened restaurant, Ziggy's Burgers, at what should have been a busy lunch hour full of people hungry for his freshly ground hamburgers. \n \"We have lost everything today,\" said Herrera, the store's consulting chef and manager. Six employees sat at tables behind him, chatting or checking their phones. \n Employees at a Starbucks gave away cups of iced and hot coffee in the darkened shop. A worker said that was better than letting the coffee go to waste. \n Many of those affected used social media to vent their frustrations or post celebratory memes about getting off work early to play. Police Chief William Scott said officers were working to clear traffic as quickly as possible, but in the meantime folks should just relax. \n \"Take advantage of this beautiful day. See the city and enjoy the restaurants, enjoy the parks and whatnot until we get traffic back to normalcy,\" he said. \n For some, that was easier said than done. \n Brent Chapman, who works in billing and reporting for First Republic Bank, told his team to go home after huddling on a sidewalk and waiting for word of when power would be restored. \n They had been ready to send out a finished project Friday, one they'd been working on for six months, after some had pulled an all-nighter. \n \"It's brutal.

{"date": "April 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, left, and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis took seats for a meeting at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv, Israel today. \n TEL AVIV, Israel >> Syria still possesses chemical weapons, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in Israel today, warning against the banned munitions being used again. \n At a news conference in Tel Aviv, Mattis also said that in recent days the Syrian Air Force has dispersed its combat aircraft. The implication is that Syria may be concerned about additional U.S. strikes following the cruise missile attack earlier this month in retaliation for alleged Syrian use of sarin gas. \n Mattis spoke alongside Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman. \"There can be no doubt in the international community's mind that Syria has retained chemical weapons in violation of its agreement and its statement that it had removed them all,\" said Mattis. He said he didn't want to elaborate on the amounts Syria has in order to avoid revealing sources of intelligence. \n \"I can say authoritatively they have retained some, it's a violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions and it's going to have to be taken up diplomatically and they would be ill advised to try to use any again, we made that very clear with our strike,\" he said. \n Israeli defense officials said this week that Syria still has up to three tons of chemical weapons in its possession. It was the first specific intelligence assessment of President Bashar Assad's weapons capabilities since a deadly chemical attack earlier this month. \n Lieberman also refused to go into detail but said \"We have 100 percent information that (the) Assad regime used chemical weapons against rebels.\" \n Assad has strongly denied he was behind the attack in the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in Syria's northern Idlib province, and has accused the opposition of trying to frame his government. Top Assad ally, Russia, has asserted a Syrian government airstrike hit a rebel chemical weapons factory, causing the disaster. \n In response to the April 4 attack, the United States fired 59 missiles at a Syrian air base it said was the launching pad for the attack. \n Before meeting with Mattis in Jerusalem, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters that Israel is encouraged by the change of administrations in Washington. \n \"We sense a great change in the direction of American policy,\" Netanyahu said. He referred to the U.S. cruise missile strike in Syria as an important example of the new administration's \"forthright deeds\" against the use of chemical weapons. \n A few hours later sirens wailed on the Israeli held side of the Golan Heights warning of incoming rockets from Syria, the Israeli military said. It said three \"projectiles\" were fired and no injuries have been reported. The Israeli military later said it retaliated and \"targeted the locations where the launching originated.\" \n Israel has been largely unaffected by the Syrian civil war raging next door, suffering mostly sporadic, spillover, incidents of fire. Israel has occasionally responded to fire with limited reprisals on Syrian positions. \n It has also carried out a number of airstrikes on suspected weapon convoys it believed were destined for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. \n Israel has warned against \"game-changing\" weapons reaching Hezbollah in Lebanon from Syria, which supports the militant group. Hezbollah fired more than 4,000 rockets on Israeli communities in the 2006 war, while Israel bombarded militant targets in southern Lebanon. \n Last month Israel shot down an anti-aircraft missile fired at its planes as they struck a suspected Hezbollah weapons convoy. \n Hezbollah and Iran, both bitter enemies of Israel, along with Russia have sent forces to support Assad. \n Syria agreed to give up its chemical weapons arsenal to avert U.S. strikes following a chemical weapons attack in opposition-held suburbs of Damascus in August 2013 that killed hundreds of people and sparked worldwide outrage. \n Ahead of that disarmament, Assad's government disclosed it had some 1,300 tons of chemical weapons, including sarin, VX nerve agent and mustard gas. \n The entire stockpile was said to have been dismantled and shipped out under international supervision in 2014 and destroyed. But doubts began to emerge soon afterward that not all such armaments or production facilities were declared and destroyed. There also is evidence that the Islamic State group and other insurgents have acquired chemical weapons. \n Associated Press writer Ian Deitch in Jerusalem contributed to this story. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mattis: Syria still has chemical weapons"}

{"date": "April 21, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Opponents of President Nicolas Maduro marched in Caracas, Venezuela on Thursday. \n CARACAS, Venezuela >> At least 12 people were killed overnight during looting and violence in Venezuela's capital amid a spiraling political crisis, authorities said today. \n Most of the deaths took place in El Valle, a working class neighborhood near Caracas' biggest military base where opposition leaders say a group of people were hit with an electrical current while trying to steal a refrigerator from a bakery. \n Two days of huge protests on the streets of Caracas against the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro spilled into a violent Thursday night in several parts of the city, with residents in El Valle witnessing repetitive gunfire, street barricades set aflame and more than two dozen businesses looted. Amid the confusion, mothers and newborn children had to be evacuated from a maternity hospital named after the late leader Hugo Chavez when it was swamped with tear gas. \n The Public Ministry said the violence left 11 people dead in El Valle, all men between the ages of 17 and 45. Another death was reported east of Caracas in El Sucre. Six other people were injured. \n \"This was a war,\" said Liliana Altuna, whose butcher shop was ransacked by looters armed with guns who grabbed everything in sight. \n Opposition leaders accused the government of repressing protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets but standing idly by as businesses were looted. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez pointed the finger at the opposition, saying armed groups controlled by the government's foes were responsible for the attack at the hospital. \n \"We reject and do not accept those irresponsible declarations,\" said Henrique Capriles, a former opposition candidate for president who the government recently barred from running for public office. \n Overall, at least 20 people have been killed in the unrest that erupted after the government-stacked Supreme Court gutted congress of its last vestiges of power three weeks ago \u2014 a move later reversed amid a storm of international criticism. Angry protesters are demanding new elections and denouncing a government they deem a dictatorship responsible for triple-digit inflation, soaring crime and widespread shortages of food and medical supplies. \n The violence began Thursday night and stretched into Friday in El Valle, an area historically known as a hot spot for political protest. Witnesses said masked looters wielding knives and guns descended on an area known as \"the little market\" filled with bakeries, supermarkets and butcher's shops. \n \"They left us with nothing,\" said Manuel Martinez, who was directing cleanup and repairs at a destroyed grocery store. \n \"What they did wasn't because of hunger,\" he added. \"It's vandalism.\" \n The chaos turned deadly when looters entered a bakery protected by an electric fence and tried to remove a refrigerator. The accounts varied, but one opposition leader said 13 people were hit with an electrical current after tossing containers filled with water and making contact with the refrigerator's power cord. \n Earlier Friday, officials reported that one of the dead was Mervins Guitian. The young Venezuelan man was fatally shot when he was returning home late from work Thursday and got caught in the middle of late-night street clashes. Vicente Paez, a local councilman, said Guitian was an employee of a Caracas-area city governed by an opposition mayor but didn't join the protests. It wasn't clear who shot him and there was no immediate comment from authorities. \n Venezuelan social media was ablaze late into the night with grainy cellphone videos of light-armored vehicles plowing down dark streets to control pockets of protesters who set up burning barricades in several neighborhoods. \n Vice President Tareck El Aissami said Friday the country is facing an \"unconventional war\" led by opposition groups working in concert with criminal gangs. He said opposition claims government forces were responsible for launching tear gas at the maternity hospital were another attempt to demoralize a people who have \"decided to break ties with the bourgeoisie forever.\" \n Opposition members said they have no intention of easing up on protests. \n \"Twenty days of resistance and we feel newly born,\" opposition lawmaker Freddy Guevara said at an outdoor news conference Thursday as residents looking out from balconies in a neighborhood at the heart of the protest movement cheered loudly in support. \n The next planned protest is Saturday, when opponents are being asked to dress in white and march silently to commemorate the victims of the demonstration. Sit-ins to block major highways are planned for Monday. \n General Motors announced early Thursday that it was closing its operations in Venezuela after authorities seized its factory in the industrial city of Valencia, a move that could draw the Trump administration into the escalating chaos engulfing the nation. \n A number of major Latin American governments, including Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, called on Venezuela to take steps to increase democratic order and halt the violence that has been swirling around the protests. \n The Supreme Court ruling reinvigorated Venezuela's fractious opposition, which had been struggling to channel growing disgust with Maduro. \n Opponents are pushing for Maduro's removal through early elections and the release of dozens of political prisoners. The government last year abruptly postponed regional elections that the opposition was heavily favored to win and it cut off a petition drive aimed at forcing a referendum seeking Maduro's removal before elections scheduled for late next year. \n But the government hasn't backed down. \n Already drawing criticism for the GM seizure, Maduro announced late Thursday that he wanted an investigation into cellphone operator Movistar for allegedly being part of the \"coup-minded march\" organized by his adversaries Wednesday. That march was the largest and most dramatic the country has seen in years. He said the subsidiary of Spain's Telefonica \"sent millions of messages to users every two hours\" in support of Wednesday's protests. \n As tensions mount, the government is using its almost-complete control of Venezuela's institutions to pursue its opponents. On Wednesday alone, 565 protesters were arrested nationwide, according to Penal Forum, a local group that provides legal assistance to detainees. It said 334 remained in jail Thursday. \n Associated Press photographer Juan Carlos Hernandez in Valencia and AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher in Detroit contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Venezuela officials say at least 12 people killed overnight"}
