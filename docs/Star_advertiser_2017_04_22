And then Hillary Clinton walked onstage. \n Clinton was an unannounced panelist, there to discuss the scourge of elephant poaching \u2014 the subject of Bigelow's eight-minute film \"The Protectors: Walk in the Rangers' Shoes,\" about park rangers trying to save elephants in Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \n She spoke about her work to save elephants from poachers slaughtering them for their ivory tusks, both as secretary of state in the Obama administration, and later with her family foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative. \n \"We've got to bust this market so it can't come back,\" she said of the illegal ivory market. \n Before Clinton and the three other panelists were interviewed by Bigelow, the audience donned virtual reality headsets at their seats and experienced \u2014 in 360 degrees \u2014 what it's like to be one of the 200 rangers fighting well-armed poachers in the park the size of Delaware. The film gives the viewer both the experience of being in the grass and searching for poachers, and up in the air looking down. A wrenching scene shows the rangers arriving at the carcass of a slaughtered elephant. \n \"I realized that there was an intersection between poaching and terrorism, which led me to this project,\" Bigelow said. The director of \"The Hurt Locker\" and \"Zero Dark Thirty\" directed the short along with Imraan Ismail, a virtual-reality veteran, who also was on today's panel. \"They're outmanned and outgunned and they're putting themselves in the line of fire,\" Ismail said of the rangers. \n Clinton told the audience that she first became focused on what she called \"the horrific slaughter of elephants\" when she was secretary of state. \n \"It became clear to everyone that this was not just a terrible crisis when it came to the elephant population, it was a trade, a trafficking that was funding a lot of bad folks, a lot of bad actors,\" she said. \"It was being used to take ivory and sell it in order to buy more weapons, and support the kind of terroristic activity that these and other groups were engaged in.\" \n Clinton noted that while China was the biggest market for illegal ivory, the United States was the second-biggest. \"So China is going to be a key player but we are, too,\" she said. \n The former Democratic presidential candidate noted that today was Earth Day, \"and we are marching on behalf of science,\" referring to marches throughout the U.S. \n \"And part of science is understanding the intricate relationships that we share with all those on this planet and particularly large mammals like elephants, who have a role to play both in reality and in our imaginations,\" she said. \n Clinton told Bigelow that her virtual reality film was \"so critical, because it is a portal \u2014 a portal that people can go into and think about, 'Here we are in New York, what can I do?' And there is a lot that can be done \u2014 stop the killing, stop the trafficking, and stop the demand.

{"date": "April 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Vice President Mike Pence met with South Korea's acting president and prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn on April 17. \n SYDNEY >> As tensions rose on the Korean peninsula, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who has President Donald Trump's trust but little diplomatic experience to go with it, became the top American official headed to the region after North Korea again failed to successfully launch a ballistic missile. \n Days later, the mild-mannered former governor stood along the Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea and stared back at soldiers from the North. In Australia, Pence's mission was to soothe any lingering hurt stemming from a tense telephone conversation Trump had with the prime minister in January. \n A 10-day swing through four Pacific Rim nations is offering evidence that Pence has become one of Trump's chief emissaries on the world stage, patching up relations, reassuring allies still wondering about Trump's unpredictable ways and diving into international crises like North Korea. \n Pence's trip was planned weeks ago. But it dropped him in South Korea just in time to deliver North Korea a stern warning from the U.S.: that \"all options are on the table\" when it comes to curbing the North's nuclear ambitions, and that the Trump administration will seek support from its allies to pressure Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. \n His foray into the DMZ and his meetings with South Korean and Japanese leaders allowed Pence to shape a key American foreign policy issue, presenting a new challenge for a politician whose prior foreign policy experience was limited to trips to the Middle East as a congressman and trade missions to Japan, China, Israel and Europe as Indiana's governor. \n Pence's early foreign travel schedule contrasts sharply with a mostly homebound Trump, who is not scheduled to travel overseas until late May for NATO meetings in Belgium and a gathering of the Group of Seven major industrial nations in Italy. Pence partly covered that ground when he visited Germany and Belgium in February. \n Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, had visited nine countries by late April 2009, his first three months in office, checking in with allies such as Canada, Britain and Germany. The last first-term president to wait until May to take his first foreign trip was Jimmy Carter in 1977. \n Enter Pence, whose still-evolving diplomatic playbook includes several components, all steeped in humility, personal ties and his religious faith. \n In some ways, Pence is the advance team: His earlier trip to Europe and his Asia trip that ends Tuesday are partly laying the foundation for journeys being planned for Trump. In other ways, Pence is the face of reassurance, offering in-person outreach to world leaders Trump has clashed with or who have doubted Trump's commitment to them at the start of his presidency. \n Pence's extensive Asia-Pacific tour produced a collection of images depicting a Pence-as-president parallel universe, from friendly consultations with leaders from across Asia, to donning a brown bomber jacket to watch North Korean soldiers along the DMZ to a speech to 2,500 cheering sailors aboard the USS Ronald Reagan in Tokyo Bay. \n But it also raised questions of whether allies view Pence as speaking for Trump or whether his reassurances could easily be dismissed by one of the president's tweets. \n In meetings with his counterparts, Pence frequently passed along \"greetings\" from Trump and told his hosts how much America valued their alliance, language that's commonplace in diplomacy but understated compared to the more free-wheeling Trump. \n On Thursday, for example, Pence told Indonesian President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo how \"proud\" he and Trump were to partner with him and spoke of their hopes of working together. \n Hours later and several time zones away, Trump laced into Canada, saying what America's northern neighbor had done to U.S. dairy farm workers was \"a disgrace.\" Trump was lashing out at Canada's decision to change its policy on pricing domestic milk to cover more dairy ingredients, leading to lower prices for Canadian products, including ultra-filtered milk, that compete with U.S. products. \n Pence's advisers say the differences with Trump amount to style over substance. A senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the relationship, said Trump and Pence \"are constantly talking about what message they want to be conveyed. While their styles may be a little bit different in how they do that, the message is the same.\" \n Pence's speeches, meanwhile, were peppered with phrases in the language of his host countries, aimed at making a personal connection. In Japan, he spoke of his fondness for the Japanese word \"kizuna,\" meaning bonds or connections, which he said helped define the close relationship and mutual respect between the two countries. He recalled his two trips to the country as governor, as well as his home state's ties to Toyota and Honda, the Japanese auto giants. \n In South Korea, he noted that his late father had served there during the Korean War and had received a Bronze Star nearly 64 years to the day of his trip. \n Faith and family also played a role. On the aircraft carrier in Japan, Pence said the sailors were owed a debt of gratitude from Trump and the American people and quoted from the Book of Romans, \"If you owe debts, pay debts, if honor, then honor, if respect, then respect.\" \n In Indonesia, he called the country's moderate form of Islam an \"inspiration to the world,\" comments that affirmed Widodo. A day earlier, Widodo suffered a political setback when a political ally was defeated by Islamic conservatives. Pence and his family later toured the Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia. \n Family talk also helped Pence smooth over relations with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who had a tense telephone exchange with Trump in January over a refugee resettlement deal struck under the Obama administration. \n The Turnbulls welcomed Pence, his wife and their two daughters for morning tea in Sydney, which allowed wife Karen to hold the prime minister's 8-month-old granddaughter, Alice. \"My wife is extremely impressed with your grandchildren \u2014 we don't have any yet,\" Pence told Turnbull. \n Turnbull said Karen Pence cared for the baby so well that his daughter said she should \"take over babysitting.\" \n \"We just are so grateful,\" Pence told Turnbull. \"The warmth of the welcome of our little family reflects the warmth and the feelings between the people of the United States and the people of Australia.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Amid North Korea crisis, Pence becomes Trump emissary abroad"}

KOJIMA / CKOJIMA@STARADVERTISER.COM \n Teachers and supporters marched from the Neal Blaisdell Center to the state Capitol in support of the Hawaii State Teachers Association on Feb. 13. \n Hawaii public school teachers would see multiyear pay raises totaling nearly 14 percent under a tentative four-year contract deal reached with the state today. \n The Hawaii State Teachers Association's board of directors unanimously voted to recommend the proposal to its 13,500 members for ratification next week. \n The pay raises \u2014 which HSTA says would amount to 13.6 percent \u2014 include a combination of pay grade step increases and across-the-board 3.5 percent raises in alternating years. \n The average annual salary for a 10-month teacher for the current school year is $58,959, according to the Department of Education. \n \"I am pleased that after nine months of negotiations, the state and the HSTA have reached a tentative agreement on a contract that will benefit Hawaii's teachers and their students. \u2026 This raise will help stabilize the teaching force, which we know will improve teaching and learning conditions,\" HSTA President Corey Rosenlee said in a statement issued Saturday night. \"This package is the best we could do for our teachers, in spite of the state's difficult fiscal outlook.\" \n Under the deal, Rosenlee said, the state also would increase its share of health insurance premiums. Currently the cost split varies among plans for teachers, but under the most popular health plan, the state covers 59 percent of the premium. \n Rosenlee added that the tentative deal allows for HSTA to renegotiate health plan contributions and professional development in years three and four of the contract. \n The proposed deal is significantly higher than what state negotiators had proposed in earlier rounds of contract talks. The state had offered teachers annual 1 percent lump-sum bonuses that would have been paid out in October of this year and next year. \n Rosenlee credited Gov. David Ige's involvement in negotiations for the more generous offer. \n \"The governor really worked hard to make this contract happen,\" Rosenlee said in a phone interview Saturday. \"He was working with us late at night and I think it really showed that education is a big priority to him.\" \n By comparison, under HSTA's existing 2013-17 contract, the union secured annual raises of at least 3 percent, with alternating step-ups and 3.2 percent across-the-board raises. The union used what's known as a re-opener clause to negotiate additional compensation for the final two years of that contact, including a one-time $2,000 bonus and a 1.8 percent raise that will kick in June 30, when the contract expires. \n If a simple majority of teachers \u2014 50 percent plus one vote \u2014 who vote on the proposed contract Thursday approve the agreement, the contract will begin July 1. A successful ratification vote would allow for the Legislature to fund the settlement by its April 28 fiscal deadline. \n ", "author": "By Nanea Kalani nkalani@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Teachers' union reaches 4-year contract deal with state"}

Organizers used a drone to help get an accurate tally of the turnout and were still compiling the total. \n Demonstrations also were held on Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii island. \n Elisha Wood-Charlson, a member of the research staff at UH-Manoa and the Honolulu march's spokeswoman, said the event was born out of the momentum from other marches, such as the Women's March in February. \n She said it was the first March for Science because it's the first time one has been needed, mainly because the Trump administration appears to have left science by the wayside in policy-making decisions. \n The goals of today's march were to build a local community of advocates for the sciences, encourage an environment where scientists can share scientific discoveries without fear of retribution, and promote fact-based decisions in policy-making. The Honolulu event was hosted by UH-Manoa, but funded by donations and T-shirt sales online, about 800 of which were sold. \n Jason Graham, a conservation biologist at UH Manoa, was manning one of several information booths set up on the lawn.

Then a string of political leaders passed around a megaphone and from the back of a pick-up truck repeated their demand of recent days for immediate elections and freedom for dozens of jailed government opponents they consider political prisoners. \n \"Let it be heard: The dictatorship is in its final days,\" said Maria Corina Machado, who was stripped of her seat in congress in 2014. The crowd responded with shouts of \"Freedom! Freedom!\" \n Many Venezuelans blame the socialist policies of President Nicolas Maduro's administration for triple-digit inflation and widespread shortages of food and medical supplies. \n Among the demonstrators gathered in Caracas was Andres Ramirez, a 34-year-old agricultural engineer who marched with a giant cross draped in the Venezuelan flag. \n \"I am here carrying this cross for the peace of all Venezuelans,\" he said beneath a punishing sun. \"We ask God to protect us in these moments of crisis and suffering.\" \n Elsewhere in the city, smaller pockets of violent protesters, some of them with their faces covered and throwing rocks, clashed with riot police, who responded with tear gas. \n The opposition contends rogue armed pro-government groups have been fomenting the violence that has swirled around protests.

The incident comes less than two weeks after video of a man being violently dragged off a United Express flight sparked widespread outrage. \n In an age of cellphone videos and social media, airlines are learning the hard way that it is essential to deescalate tense situations that occur during air travel, even as there are more passengers, less room and fewer flight attendants than ever before. \n United initially blamed its passenger, Dr. David Dao, before finally apologizing days after the incident, fanning the public's fury. American, by contrast, seems to have learned from United's mistakes: it immediately said it was sorry, that it had grounded the flight attendant while it investigates the incident, and that it had upgraded the passenger involved and her family to first class. \n \"American doesn't want to become the next United, but then, United didn't want to become the next United,\" said Henry Harteveldt, travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group. \"No airline wants to be seen as being anti-consumer or anti-passenger.\" \n Smartphone cameras and social media are shifting power to consumers who can share customer relations gaffes with the world. They're increasingly making confrontations with customer-facing staff headline news, making it harder for companies to sweep complaints under the rug. The faster companies own up to mistakes, the quicker they can start to do damage control. \n American's fast reaction to the incident could be helpful, said brand consultant Allen Adamson, CEO of BrandSimple. \n \"The quick reaction will prevent it from escalating further, but it won't mitigate the perception among flyers that flying is becoming a less enjoyable experience every day,\" he said. \n Overall, airlines must start to put more of an emphasis on customer service, he said. \n \"It's another example of airlines struggling to treat their passengers with the traditional 'customer is always right' attitude,\" he said. \"Good customer service is finding a way to deescalate a situation and he (the flight attendant) was throwing gasoline on it.\" \n Days after Dao was dragged off the United Express flight from Chicago to Kentucky to make room for airline crew, his lawyer spent a good part of a news conference railing against what he said was the industry-wide shabby treatment of airline passengers. Dao lost teeth, suffered a broken nose and received a concussion in the incident, which also was captured on video. \n Traveling is stressful under any circumstance, and conflict resolution training is an essential part of being a flight attendant, Harteveldt said. \n \"If airlines aren't going to improve staffing or restore leg room for customers, they should at least provide flight attendants with better, more relevant training about how to handle these types of situations,\" he said. \n At the same time, passengers should also be respectful of flight attendants \u2014 who often work long hours on multiple flights \u2014 as well, he said. \n A union that represents American Airlines flight attendants said in a statement that not all of the facts are known about the incident so there shouldn't be a rush to judgment. If a passenger threatened a flight attendant, that would be a violation of federal law, said Bob Ross, president of The Association of Professional Flight Attendants. \n \"Air rage has become a serious issue on our flights,\" he said in a statement. \"We must obtain the full facts surrounding these incidents.

But negotiations on the spending measure, a huge pile of leftover business from last year that includes the budgets of almost every federal agency, have hit a rough patch. \n Rank-and-file Republicans received few answers on a Saturday conference call by top House GOP leaders, who offered little detail and said deals remained elusive on both health care and the catchall spending measure, with no votes scheduled yet. \n It's looking like a one- or two-week temporary measure will be needed to prevent a shutdown and buy time for more talks. Negotiations have faltered because of disputes over the border wall and health law subsidies to help low-income people afford health insurance. \n Trump's Capitol Hill allies had been tempering expectations that the president will win much in the budget talks. Democratic support will be needed to pass the spending measure and Republicans fear taking the blame if the government shuts down on their watch. \n \"We have the leverage and they have the exposure,\" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California told fellow Democrats on a conference call Thursday, according to a senior Democratic aide. Pelosi wants the spending bill to give the cash-strapped government of Puerto Rico help with its Medicaid obligations, and Democrats are pressing for money for overseas famine relief, treatment for opioid abuse, and the extension of health benefits for 22,000 retired Appalachian coal miners and their families. \n An additional Democratic demand is for cost-sharing payments to insurance companies that help low-income people afford health policies under Obama's health law. The payments are a critical subsidy and the subject of a lawsuit by House Republicans. Trump has threatened to withhold the money to force Democrats to negotiate on health legislation. \n Trump's presidential victory makes it \"completely reasonable to ask and to insist that some of his priorities are funded,\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said in an interview. \"We are more than happy to talk to the Democrats about some of their priorities but we encourage them to recognize that they are a minority party.\" \n Both the White House and Democrats have adopted hard-line positions on Trump's $1 billion request for a down payment on construction of the border wall, a central plank of last year's campaign. Talk of forcing Mexico to pay for it has largely been abandoned. But in an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Trump stopped short of demanding that money for the project be included in the must-pass spending bill. \n Health care is on a separate track and facing trouble, too. The White House is pressing House Republicans to rally behind a revised bill so GOP leaders can schedule a vote this coming week that could let Trump fulfill a 100-days promise. \n A quick vote, let alone approval, seems unlikely. \n GOP leaders have shown no desire to revisit the issue until they're assured there'll be no replay of the legislative train wreck from March. The failure of that earlier attempt stung Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. The measure would have repealed much of Obama's 2010 overhaul and replaced it with fewer coverage requirements and less generous federal subsidies for many people. \n As part of the White House drive to resuscitate the bill, members of Trump's team including Vice President Mike Pence and chief of staff Reince Priebus have made multiple calls to Republicans. \n Two leaders of the House GOP's warring moderate and conservative factions devised a compromise during Congress' recess to let states get federal waivers to ignore some requirements of the health law. Those include one that now obligates insurers to cover specified services such as for mental health, and one that bars them from raising premiums on seriously ill patients. \n But there are widespread doubts that the new attempt has achieved the support it needs. \n Rep. Dan Donovan, R-N.Y., an opponent of the bill, said last week that \"it doesn't cure the issues that I had concerns\" about the bill. The moderate said his objections included changes to Obama's law that would still leave people with excessive out-of-pocket costs. \n The potential amendment was brokered by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus and Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., a leader of the moderate House Tuesday Group. \n Ryan called off a March 24 House vote on the measure after realizing that objections by conservative and moderate Republicans would have assured its defeat. Democrats were uniformly against the legislation. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Possible shutdown, health care quagmire awaiting Congress"}

{"date": "April 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED RPESS \n Workers prepare voting booths at a polling station in Lyon, central France, Saturday, April 22, 2017. The two-round presidential election will take place on April 23 and May 7. \n PARIS >> Polling stations opened Saturday in France's far-flung overseas territories for the country's unpredictable presidential election as the 11 candidates in the race observed a ban on campaigning. \n With voting beginning Sunday on the French mainland, the government has mobilized more than 50,000 police and gendarmes to protect 70,000 polling stations, with an additional 7,000 soldiers on patrol. \n France's 10 percent unemployment and its lackluster economy top voters' concerns as first-round ballots are cast this weekend in the most nail-biting French election in generations. \n Opinion polls showed a tight race among the four top contenders vying to get into the May presidential 7 runoff that will decide who becomes France's next head of state. But the polls also showed that decision was largely in the hands of the one-in-three voters who are still undecided. \n A deadly attack on police Thursday night on Paris' famed Champs-Elysees Avenue clouded the last days of campaigning. Security is a prominent issue after a wave of extremist attacks on French soil, including the gunman who killed a Paris police officer Thursday before being shot dead by security forces. The gunman carried a note praising the Islamic State group. \n Political campaigning was banned Saturday and Sunday until the polls close across France and online. \n Polling centers opened in the Atlantic Ocean territories of Saint Pierre and Miquelon as well as French Guiana in South America, the Caribbean's Guadeloupe and elsewhere. Voters abroad could also cast ballots in French embassies. \n Polls suggested that far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, an independent centrist and former economy minister, were in the lead. \n However, conservative Francois Fillon, a former prime minister whose campaign was initially derailed by corruption allegations that his wife was paid but did no work as his parliamentary aide, appeared to be closing the gap, as was far-leftist candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon. \n The mad-dash campaigning of the last few weeks came to an abrupt halt after the Champs-Elysees gun attack by 39-year-old Karim Cheurfi. Three suspects close to the attacker remain in custody, Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre of the Paris prosecutor's office said Saturday. \n Le Pen and Fillon canceled their last campaign events Friday over security concerns. Macron did too, but also accused his rivals of trying to capitalize on the attack with their anti-immigration, tough-on-security messages. \n In a sign of how tense the country is, a man holding a knife caused widespread panic Saturday at Paris' Gare du Nord train station. He was arrested and no one was hurt. \n Well-wishers paid their respects Saturday at the site of the shooting, which was adorned with flowers, candles and messages of solidarity for the slain police officer, Xavier Jugele. Across from the Eiffel Tower, women from the group Angry Wives of Law Enforcement demonstrated against violence aimed at police. \n Some believed French stoicism would prevent a lurch to the right in the presidential vote, even though the attack dominated French headlines. \n \"These 48 hours are not going to change everything \u2026 terrorism is now an everyday occurrence. It's permanent, 24 hours a day. So we're not afraid. If we're believers in freedom, we must live with it,\" said Marise Moron, a retired doctor. \n \"I'm not going to let myself be influenced by people who are trying to frighten us,\" Paris resident Anne-Marie Redouin said near the heavily-guarded Eiffel Tower. \n Others, fearful that Le Pen has been strengthened by the instability, said they would shift their votes from fringe candidates to make sure to keep the far-right out of power. \n \"With an attack such as this one, I think the National Front will get a good result. Therefore I'll change my intention and cast a useful vote \u2014 either Melenchon or Macron,\" said physics teacher Omar Ilys, 44. \n When the French vote for president Sunday, their choice will resonate far beyond France's borders, from Syrian battlefields to Hong Kong trading floors and the halls of the U.N. Security Council. \n The election is also widely being viewed as a ballot on the future of the 28-nation European Union. The far-right Le Pen and the far-left Melenchon could pull France out of the bloc and its shared euro currency \u2014 a so-called \"Frexit.\" \n A French exit could ignite a death spiral for the EU, the euro and the whole idea of European unity that was borne out of the bloodshed of World War II. France is a founding member of the EU and its main driver, along with former rival Germany. \n Financial markets are already jittery over a possible Frexit, fearing capital flight, defaults or lawsuits on bonds and contracts. Le Pen's team is downplaying possible apocalyptic scenarios and arguing that the euro \u2014 which is now used by 19 nations \u2014 is headed for a breakup eventually anyway. \n If Le Pen or Melenchon win a spot in the runoff, it will be seen as a victory for the populist wave reflected by the votes for Donald Trump and Brexit \u2014 the British departure from the EU. Many French workers who have lost out by globalization are similarly fed up with establishment parties and attracted by promises of ditching the status quo. \n Alternatively, if neither candidate makes it past Sunday's first round into the runoff, that's a clear message that populist nationalism is receding. \n Macron and Fillon are committed to European unity and would reform labor rules. Macron has framed himself as a bulwark against Trump's protectionism. \n Le Pen and Melenchon blame free trade pacts for killing French jobs and want to renegotiate them. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "France kicks off presidential vote overseas; security tight"}

{"date": "April 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Raymond Murray gets a visit from his lawyer, Robert Seewald, right, at his home in New York. Murray is the victim of deed theft, a foreclosure fraud where older people are mostly the target. \n NEW YORK >> The phone call came as Raymond Murray neared the bottom of his luck. His wife had died, his career had been ended by injuries, and struggling to get by on his disability check, he had scraped together just enough to pay a lawyer to avoid imminent foreclosure on his modest Brooklyn home. \n The man on the phone offered a godsend: The foreclosure could be averted, the legal fees could be eliminated and the monthly mortgage payment he could no longer afford could be trimmed. \n Soon, Murray was sitting at a conference room table in the man's office, finalizing the fix he believed would keep him in his home. It didn't take long for the sad truth to become clear: This aging immigrant was scammed out of his home. \n Around the U.S., deed theft has emerged as one of the most sophisticated and devastating frauds ever to menace homeowners. Foreclosure \"rescue\" scams that have stolen thousands of dollars from individual homeowners in the years since the housing collapse have been pushed by savvy perpetrators to their limit. They use lies to convince the desperate to sign over their title, then force them into homelessness or a years-long legal battle. \n \"The scammers are no longer content with stealing $5,000. Now they want the whole house,\" said Dina Levy, who heads the Homeowner Protection Program in the New York attorney general's office, which has spread word about deed theft and prosecuted culprits. \n Deed theft has been reported around the U.S., from San Diego, where prosecutors recently netted a guilty plea and six-year prison sentence for a man involved in deed thefts of at least 15 homes, to Detroit, where the register of deeds hopes to expand his fraud unit to keep up with a crush of cases. \n It has been most severe in gentrifying neighborhoods quickest to rebound from the housing crisis, nowhere more so than ever-pricier blocks of New York. \n The New York sheriff's office has taken a lead on the cases and since 2014, the office has amassed more than 1,700 complaints, with hundreds under investigation, and some 32 arrests already tallied. Sheriff Joseph Fucito ticks off the ways the thefts happen, from opportunists cobbling together documents on vacant properties to those transferring the home of an unwitting family member into their name, to fake housing assistance businesses that prey on those in financial crisis. \n \"You can just wake up,\" Fucito said, \"and it happened on a piece of paper.\" \n Murray came to New York in 1989 from his native Guyana, working as a telephone technician and then a police traffic control agent. He and his wife Desrie, a teacher, lived in a relative's basement, then rented a home before saving enough to buy. It wasn't much \u2014 a two-story brick house with a white metal gate, on a quiet, tree-lined Brooklyn street \u2014 but he felt like he finally could see what he'd been working for. \n \"It was an American dream,\" the 67-year-old says. \n After two on-the-job accidents, Murray was forced to retire. Money became tighter, but after his wife died suddenly of ovarian cancer in early 2009, Murray's real financial pinch set in. He cut back on food, kept the house darkened and found other ways to scrimp. \n His savings disappeared, he fell behind on the mortgage and a default notice alerted him that he was being referred for foreclosure. He had already spent $5,000 on an attorney to try to restructure his debt when that chance call came in January 2014, from a man named Mario Alvarenga. \n Murray said Alvarenga told him his mortgage could be modified, and the fix wouldn't even cost anything, so long as he fired his attorney. Because of his poor credit, Murray said he was told, his home would need to go in the name of another company Alvarenga was tied to, Launch Development, for 90 days; then the loan modification would be finalized and the property could be put in the name of one of his children or, as he'd remarried, his new wife. \n After signing a stack of papers at Alvarenga's office, Murray left awash in relief. But, soon after, Alvarenga phoned to tell him the loan modification wasn't approved, pleading for patience. Murray grew worried and suspicious, and Alvarenga became impossible to reach. It all climaxed with Murray finding a man on his property taking pictures and informing him the house now belonged to him. Later, an eviction notice on his door ordered him to vacate. \n The chilling realization dawned: \"They stole my home from me.\" \n Murray got help from attorneys at JASA Legal Services for the Elderly in Queens, who found a vast paper trail they say was part of the ruse to make the transaction look legitimate. What Murray believed was a mortgage restructuring was actually a sale, meticulously documented in paperwork. There is no resolution yet, but Murray has been allowed to remain in the house even as, on paper, he is no longer the owner. \n In court papers, Alvarenga's attorneys dismissed Murray's story, saying he had \"simply conspired a plan to live for free, for as long as possible.\" But Alvarenga later pleaded guilty to conspiracy. He awaits sentencing. Six others also face federal charges in the case, including two who have pleaded guilty. \n Jim Druker, one of Alvarenga's attorneys, said, \"Mario is just a nice guy who got caught up in something,\" and that it went \"from overzealous salesmanship into the criminal arena.\" As Murray's lawyers fight for the return of his home's title, he now sees why he was targeted. \n \"They see that I was desperate, that I was in need,\" he said. \"But I can see justice coming.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Scams push foreclosure fraud to limit, taking victims' homes"}

{"date": "April 22, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Thousands of demonstrators attend the March for Science in Berlin, Saturday, April 22, 2017. Thousands of people are expected to attend March for Science events around the world to promote the understanding of science and defend it from various attacks, including U.S. government budget cuts. \n WASHINGTON >> The world saw brain power take a different form today. \n From the Washington Monument to Germany's Brandenburg Gate and even to Greenland, scientists, students and research advocates rallied on an often soggy Earth Day, conveying a global message about scientific freedom without political interference, the need for adequate spending for future breakthroughs and just the general value of scientific pursuits. \n They came in numbers that were mammoth if not quite astronomical. \n \"We didn't choose to be in this battle, but it has come to the point where we have to fight because the stakes are too great,\" said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann, who regularly clashes with politicians. \n President Donald Trump, in an Earth Day statement hours after the marches kicked off, said that \"rigorous science depends not on ideology, but on a spirit of honest inquiry and robust debate.\" \n Denis Hayes, who co-organized the first Earth Day 47 years ago, said the crowd he saw from the speaker's platform down the street from the White House was energized and \"magical\" in a rare way, similar to what he saw in the first Earth Day. \n \"For this kind of weather this is an amazing crowd. You're not out there today unless you really care. This is not a walk in the park event,\" Hayes said of the even in the park. \n Mann said that like other scientists, he would rather be in his lab, the field or teaching students. But driving his advocacy are officials who deny his research that shows rising global temperatures. When he went on stage, he got the biggest applause for his simple opening: \"I am a climate scientist.\" \n In Los Angeles, Danny Leserman, the 26-year-old director of digital media for the county's Democratic party, said \"We used to look up to intelligence and aspire to learn more and do more with that intellectual curiosity. And we've gone from there to a society where \u2026 our officials and representatives belittle science and they belittle intelligence. And we really need a culture change.\" \n The rallies in more than 600 cities put scientists, who generally shy away from advocacy and whose work depends on objective experimentation, into a more public position. \n Scientists said they were anxious about political and public rejection of established science such as climate change and the safety of vaccine immunizations. \n \"Scientists find it appalling that evidence has been crowded out by ideological assertions,\" said Rush Holt, a former physicist and Democratic congressman who runs the American Association for the Advancement of Science. \"It is not just about Donald Trump, but there is also no question that marchers are saying 'when the shoe fits.'\" \n Despite saying the march was not partisan, Holt acknowledged it was only dreamed up at the Women's March on Washington, a day after Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. \n But the rallies were also about what science does for the world. \n \"Most people don't know how much funding for the sciences supports them in their lives every day. Every medical breakthrough, their food, clothing, our cellphones, our computers, all that is science-based,\" said Pati Vitt, a plant scientist at the Chicago Botanic Garden. \"So if we stop funding scientific discoveries now, in 10 years, whatever we might have had won't be; we just won't have it.\" \n In Washington, the sign that 9-year-old Sam Klimas of Parkersburg, West Virginia, held was red, handmade and personal: \"Science saved my life.\" He had a form of brain cancer and has been healthy for eight years now. \n Signs around the globe ranged from political ones \u2014 \"Make America think again,\" \u2014 to the somewhat nerdy \"What Do Want? Evidence. When do want it? After peer review\" to the downright obscure Star Trek and Star Wars references. \n In Washington there was also a science fair feel, where lectures were given in tents and hands-on science tables for kids. University of Minnesota physicist James Kakalios explained the science behind Superman, Spider-man, the Fantastic Four and other superheroes. \n In London, physicists, astronomers, biologists and celebrities gathered for a march past the city's most celebrated research institutions. In Spain, hundreds assembled in Madrid, Barcelona and Seville. \n In Santa Fe, New Mexico, Kathryn Oakes Hall pinned a sign to the back of her T-shirt as she made her way to the march in Santa Fe: \"Nine months pregnant, so mad I'm here.\" \n But she marched anyway because she worried about her baby's future in a world that seems to consider science disposable. Her husband is an engineer at Los Alamos National Laboratory, she studied anthropology, she even has a dog named rocket. \n Organizers portrayed the march as political but not partisan, promoting the understanding of science as well as defending it from various attacks, including proposed U.S. government budget cuts under Trump, such as a 20 percent slice of the National Institute of Health. \n \"It's not about the current administration. The truth is we should have been marching for science 30 years ago, 20 years, 10 years ago,\" said co-organizer and public health researcher Caroline Weinberg. \"The current (political) situation took us from kind of ignoring science to blatantly attacking it. And that seems to be galvanizing people in a way it never has before. \u2026 It's just sort of relentless attacks on science.\" \n Ice photographer and filmmaker James Balog, who says he was watched trillions of tons of ice melt, told the Washington crowd: \"We shall never ever surrender.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Advocates fan out in global show of support for science"}

Ron Wyden of Oregon and GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky adds to a chorus of calls for more transparency about how intelligence agencies use and share communications to, from and about Americans. \n The two want to know more about how agencies handle these communications as well as data about the number of Americans affected. They also want to make public the procedures on how intelligence about members of Congress is disseminated. \n There are still \"holes in the public's understanding of how U.S. person information \u2014 collected pursuant to different authorities and by different agencies \u2014 is handled,\" they wrote. \n The senators' Friday letter to Dan Coats, director of national intelligence, comes as lawmakers gear up for debate over the reauthorization of one of the government's key surveillance programs, which expires at the end of the year. Programs authorized by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act target foreigners, but domestic communications are sometimes vacuumed up as well. They were first revealed to the public by Edward Snowden, who leaked files from the National Security Agency. \n Critics who want the law reformed worry that agencies use the foreign intelligence collection tool too loosely and sometimes in connection with domestic law enforcement investigations. \n Intelligence officials have tried to allay concerns saying that any domestic communications collected are incidental to the targeting of foreigners. \n They say Section 702 allows the government to target non-U.S. citizens reasonably believed to be located outside the United States and bars the government from targeting a foreigner to acquire the communications of an American or someone in the U.S. But they say intelligence agencies are authorized under Section 702 to query communications made with Americans in certain, approved cases. \n Lawmakers seeking reforms could gain momentum from the investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election. President Donald Trump recently made an unsubstantiated claim that his conversations were wiretapped. There also is controversy surrounding intercepts that revealed former national security adviser Mike Flynn's communications with the Russian ambassador. \n The House intelligence committee probing Russian activities made a request for similar information earlier this year. \n The House committee has scheduled a closed-door hearing for Tuesday with FBI Director James Comey and Adm. Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency.
