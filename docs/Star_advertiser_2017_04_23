However, U.S. officials have told the Associated Press that the military response isn't likely. Trump has reportedly settled on a strategy that emphasizes increasing pressure on Pyongyang with the help of China. \n \"Only if all sides bear the responsibilities they're supposed to bear and come together, can the nuclear issue on the peninsula be resolved as quickly as possible,\" Xi told Trump, according to CCTV. \n The phone call, which took place Monday morning Beijing time, came as South Korean officials warned there is a chance that the North will conduct a nuclear test or a maiden intercontinental missile launch around the founding anniversary of its military on Tuesday. \n Trump has pressed Xi to exert greater pressure against North Korea, given China's status as the country's sole economic lifeline and major ally. Today's call is the second time that the two leaders have spoken by telephone since meeting in Florida earlier this month. \n In a Friday interview at the Oval Office, Trump told the AP that he declined to label China a currency manipulator mostly because he needed Xi's help with the North Korean crisis. \n \"They are working with us on North Korea. Now maybe that'll work out or maybe it won't,\" Trump said, adding that he had a \"great relationship\" with the Chinese president. \n Trump also spoke today with and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and they agreed to urge North Korea to refrain from what Abe called provocative actions. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "China's president urges restraint on N.

{"date": "April 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Maya Q'eqchi leader Rodrigo Tot has been awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize for his work in Latin America. \n GUATEMALA CITY >> Rodrigo Tot, a 60-year-old farmer and activist, was awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize on Monday for work in his Guatemala homeland, an honor that comes after two previous Latin American winners were murdered in the last year. \n The diminutive, soft-spoken evangelical pastor was recognized for defending his indigenous Q'eqchi community's lands against a mining company and the government. \n In a statement, Goldman praised Tot for \"intrepid leadership of his people and defense of their ancestral land\" and noted his fight has come at great personal cost: In 2012, one of his sons was shot to death in \"an assassination that was passed off as a robbery.\" \n In an interview with the Associated Press, Tot said he was grateful for the honor but remains the same leader and person as before. \n \"I think this could be a stimulus for the work we do,\" he said, adding that he considered the award all to be recognition for \"the struggle, because we are fighting hard for our land and our natural resources.\" \n Latin America is one of the most dangerous regions for environmental activists, with more than 450 of them murdered between 2010 and 2014, according to the London-based group Global Witness. \n In March 2016, Goldman honoree Berta Caceres of Honduras was killed by armed men who invaded her home. And in January, Mexican indigenous leader Isidro Baldenegro, another recipient of the prize, was slain in Mexico's northern state of Chihuahua. \n Tot, leader of the Agua Caliente \"Lote 9\" community in El Estor in Guatemala's eastern department of Izabal, has fought for decades to try to make the government recognize locals' right to fertile farmlands that are also coveted by mining interests for nickel and gold deposits that lie beneath. \n The struggle began in 1974 in response to a new law requiring landholders to pay about $4,500 to receive property titles. In 1985 a provisional title was granted to Tot and 63 other indigenous farmers in the community while they completed payment. \n But three years later, records of the community's ownership of the land mysteriously disappeared. And when the last payment was made in 2002, the government refused to hand over the legal title. \n In 2004, the Mines and Energy Ministry granted a mining license for a region covering 16 Maya communities including Agua Caliente, and those rights later passed to Compania Guatemalteca de Niquel. \n \"That is why we defend it, because there are lots of natural resources,\" Tot said. \"There are 10 springs that supply lots of communities. We are preserving the mountain because if it dies, there will no longer be any water.\" \n He and the community have fought in the courts to block mining on their land, arguing it poses environmental risks to forests and streams. \n \"Tot indefinitely delayed mining in Agua Caliente,\" Goldman said in its statement. \n Mining companies have been accused of using violence against those who oppose their projects in Guatemala, often in poor and marginalized indigenous communities. Other lawsuits allege abuses including rape and forcibly removing farmers from their terrain. \n According to Calas, a Guatemalan environmental and social law nonprofit group, in every case where indigenous communities have opposed mining projects, the government has backed the companies. \n Tot said he has received threats against his life. In 2012 the Inter-American Commission on Human rights ordered protective measures for him and his lawyer, something that the Guatemalan government has not provided. \n \"I will never forget the loss of my son, but I continue to fight,\" Tot said. \"We are no longer in the 1980s, when they could make a leader disappear and everything was kept quiet. Not today. When they make a leader disappear, 10 more rise up.\" \n Recounting his arrival in in the community at age 12 after his parents died, Tot said he learned to love the land while growing up there. As an 18-year-old during Guatemala's 1960-1996 civil war, he was conscripted into the Civilian Patrol, a paramilitary organization that aided the army in controlling the population. \n Tot said he was forced to do so and didn't support the military. He said that \"there were many disappearances\" during the period, including the killing of the community's then-leader for his efforts to defend the land. \n But Tot used the experience to learn how to organize resistance. \n On March 18, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights agreed to consider a lawsuit brought accusing Guatemala of violating the community's rights to land, natural resources, free determination and self-government by denying their title. \n \"We are not only asking to be legalized. We already paid. We have the receipts, the records and the right,\" Tot said. \"We have to defend (the land) as far as can be.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Guatemalan land activist wins prestigious Goldman prize"}

{"date": "April 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A sign saying \"Now Hiring\" in front of Brooks Tree Farm near Salem, Ore. Farmers, nursery and winery owners and others who depend on immigrant labor are predicting a catastrophe as federal immigration agents focus on stepping up arrests of people who are in America illegally. \n JUNCTION CITY, Ore. >> The head of Bethel Heights Vineyard looked out over the 100 acres of vines her crew of 20 Mexicans had just finished pruning, worried about what will happen if the Trump administration presses ahead with its crackdown on immigrants. \n From tending the plants to harvesting the grapes, it takes skill and a strong work ethic to produce the winery's pinot noir and chardonnay, and native-born Americans just aren't willing to work that hard, Patricia Dudley said as a cold rain drenched the vineyard in the hills of Oregon. \n \"Who's going to come out here and do this work when they deport them all?\" she asked. \n President Donald Trump's hard line against immigrants in the U.S. illegally has sent a chill through the nation's agricultural industry, which fears a crackdown will deprive it of the labor it needs to plant, grow and pick the crops that feed the country. \n Fruit and vegetable growers, dairy and cattle farmers and owners of plant nurseries and vineyards have begun lobbying politicians at home and in Washington to get them to deal with immigration in a way that minimizes the harm to their livelihoods. \n Some of the farm leaders are Republicans who voted for Trump and are torn, wanting border security but also mercy toward laborers who are not dangerous criminals. \n Farming uses a higher percentage of illegal labor than any other U.S. industry, according to a Pew Research Center study. \n Immigrants working illegally in this country accounted for about 46 percent of America's roughly 800,000 crop farmworkers in recent years, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the U.S. Departments of Labor and Agriculture. \n Stepped-up deportations could carry \"significant economic implications,\" a 2012 U.S. Department of Agriculture study said. If America's unauthorized labor force shrank 40 percent, for example, vegetable production could drop by more than 4 percent, the study said. \n The American Farm Bureau Federation says strict immigration enforcement would raise food prices 5 to 6 percent because of a drop in supply and because of the higher labor costs farmers could face. \n In addition to proposing a wall at the Mexican border, Trump wants to hire 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and has served notice that he intends to be more aggressive than the Obama administration in deporting immigrants. \n ICE agents have arrested hundreds of immigrants since Trump took office, though how much of a change from the Obama administration that represents is a matter of debate. \n Field hands have been among those targeted, with apple pickers detained in upstate New York and Guatemalans pulled over in Oregon on their way to a forest to pick a plant used in floral arrangements. \n It doesn't appear the arrests themselves have put a sizable dent in the agricultural workforce yet, but the fear is taking its toll. \n Some workers in Oregon are leaving for job sites as early as 1 a.m. and staying away from check-cashing shops on payday to avoid dragnets. Farm employers are worried about losing their workforces. \n \"They say, 'Don't go out, don't get drunk, don't do nothing illegal' because they need us too. They worry too,\" said Moses Maldonado, who is in the U.S. illegally and has worked for nearly four decades tending wine grapes and picking fruit in Oregon. \n In Los Banos, California, asparagus farmer Joe Del Bosque said workers are so afraid of being arrested in the field that he struggled to find enough hands in March to pick his crop. \n When immigration attorney Sarah Loftin held a recent seminar in the Oregon wine-region town of Newberg to talk about immigrants' legal rights, she was surprised to see about half of those present were winery owners or farmers. \n By law, job seekers must provide documents establishing their eligibility to work in the U.S. But the papers are often fake. Many agricultural employers say that it's not their responsibility \u2014 and that they lack the expertise \u2014 to determine if they're genuine. \n At the same time, they say that U.S.-born workers have little interest at laboring in the dirt and the cold at the crack of dawn. \n As 18 Guatemalans in hoodies and rubber boots toiled in such conditions recently in Oregon's Willamette Valley, their boss expressed admiration for their willingness to do the back-breaking work he said native-born Americans won't do. \n \"Homeless people are camped in the fir forest over there,\" the farmer said, pointing to a stand of trees. \"And they're not looking for work.\" \n He lamented that crackdowns may force him to retire because he won't be able to find workers. Fearing reprisals from federal agents, he spoke on condition of anonymity and didn't want even his crop identified. \n Some immigration hardliners say people who are in the U.S. illegally steal jobs from Americans. But a 2013 study by an economist at the Center for Global Development looked at farms in North Carolina and found that immigrant manual laborers had \"almost zero\" effect on the job prospects of native-born U.S. workers. \n \"It appears that almost all U.S. workers prefer almost any labor-market outcome \u2014 including long periods of unemployment \u2014 to carrying out manual harvest and planting labor,\" Michael Clemens wrote. \n While lobbying for visa and immigration reforms, agricultural employers are also looking into contingency plans such as mechanization or a switch to less labor-intensive crops. In Vermont, officials are considering a vocational program to train inmates in dairy farming. \n Dudley, the vineyard owner, isn't optimistic about some of the alternatives. \n \"I don't trust that temps off the street, or jailhouse labor, or whatever alternative they come up with would work,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fearing a worker shortage, farmers push back on immigration"}

The Anti-Defamation League found an increase in cases of anti-Semitic intimidation and vandalism in 2016, evidence that anti-Jewish bias intensified during the election. \n NEW YORK >> The Anti-Defamation League found an increase in cases of anti-Semitic intimidation and vandalism last year, evidence that anti-Jewish bias intensified during the election. \n The Jewish civil rights group found 1,266 cases of anti-Semitic harassment last year, compared to 941 in 2015 and 912 in 2014. The increase continued into the first three months of this year, with reports of 541 incidents compared to 291 in the same period the year before, according to the ADL data released Monday. \n The preliminary 2017 numbers include a wave of more than 150 bomb threats that started in January against Jewish community centers and day schools. Authorities arrested an Israeli Jewish hacker who they said was behind the harassment. The ADL insists those threats should still be considered anti-Semitic since Jews were the target. During the same period, a former journalist in St. Louis was also charged with threatening Jewish organizations as part of a bizarre campaign to intimidate his former girlfriend. But authorities believe the Israeli man is primarily responsible. \n Even without those bomb threats, the number of anti-Jewish incidents this January, February and March in the report would be higher than the year before. \n The FBI compiles annual hate-crime statistics, but the 2016 numbers aren't expected to be released until the end of this year. The ADL tally includes a much broader array of incidents, such as distribution of hateful materials, threats, slurs, intimidation and vandalism, along with physical assaults. The organization says its researchers evaluate reports from individuals, community leaders and law enforcement. \n This latest compilation includes only a few cases of online harassment \u2014 incidents that led to \"on the ground\" intimidation \u2014 so that the organization can continue making year-to-year comparisons of ADL data going back to the group's first report in 1979, before the internet and social media were so broadly used, according to Oren Segal, director of the ADL Center on Extremism. \n Anti-Semitic harassment in the U.S. has been at historic lows in recent years, according to the organization. In some prior years, the number of incidents surpassed 1,500 or 2,000, Segal said. But the recent uptick has fueled anxiety among American Jews during a period of emboldened expressions of white-supremacism and white-nationalism during the presidential election. Last week, a Jewish woman sued the founder of the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, accusing the publisher of orchestrating a barrage of anti-Semitic messages from anonymous internet trolls starting last December. \n \"I think the pace in which the incidents are happening, the speed at which the spike is occurring, I think the historic low is a thing of the past,\" Segal said. \n The report linked 34 cases last year to the presidential race, including graffiti found in Denver last May that said \"Kill the Jews, Vote Trump.\" ADL chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt was among the most vocal Jewish leaders pressing Donald Trump, as a candidate and president, to do more to combat anti-Semitism, including among his supporters. Critics, in the Jewish community and elsewhere, said partisanship was behind such pressure on Trump. In February, Trump opened his address to Congress with a strong condemnation of recent cases of vandalism at Jewish cemeteries. \n On college campuses last year, the number of reports of anti-Semitic incidents remained about the same compared to the previous year, the ADL said. Many of the schools have been roiled in recent years by protests over Israeli policies toward Palestinians. However, the organization saw an increase in the number of reports of harassment against Jewish school children from elementary age through high school. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Report: U.S. cases of anti-Semitism increased last year"}

Macron, a 39-year-old investment banker, made the runoff on the back of a grassroots campaign without the support of a major political party. \n With 90 percent of votes counted, the Interior Ministry said Macron had nearly 24 percent, giving him a slight cushion over Le Pen's 22 percent. Fillon, with just under 20 percent, was slightly ahead of the far-left's Jean-Luc Melenchon, who had 19 percent. \n The euro jumped 2 percent to more than $1.09 after the initial results were announced because Macron has vowed to reinforce France's commitments to the EU and euro \u2014 and opinion polls give him a big lead heading into the second round. \n While Le Pen faces the runoff as the underdog, it's already stunning that she brought her once-taboo party so close to the Elysee Palace. She hopes to win over far-left and other voters angry at the global elite and distrustful of the untested Macron. \n With a wink at his cheering, flag-waving supporters who yelled \"We will win!\" in his election day headquarters in Paris, Macron promised to be a president \"who protects, who transforms and builds\" if elected. \n \"You are the faces of French hope,\" he said. His wife, Brigitte, joined him on stage before his speech \u2014 the only couple among the leading candidates to do so Sunday night. \n Le Pen, in a chest-thumping speech to cheering supporters, declared that she embodies \"the great alternative\" for French voters. She portrayed her duel with Macron as a battle between \"patriots\" and \"wild deregulation\" \u2014 warning of job losses overseas, mass immigration straining resources at home and \"the free circulation of terrorists.\" \n \"The time has come to free the French people,\" she said at her election day headquarters in the northern French town of Henin-Beaumont, adding that nothing short of \"the survival of France\" will be at stake in the presidential runoff. \n Her supporters burst into a rendition of the French national anthem, chanted \"We will win!\" and waved French flags and blue flags with \"Marine President\" on them. \n France is now steaming into unchartered territory, because whoever wins on May 7 cannot count on the backing of France's political mainstream parties. Even under a constitution that concentrates power in the president's hands, both Macron and Le Pen will need legislators in parliament to pass laws and implement much of their programs. \n France's legislative election in June now takes on a vital importance, with huge questions about whether Le Pen and even the more moderate Macron will be able to rally sufficient lawmakers to their causes. \n In Paris, protesters angry at Le Pen's advance \u2014 some from anarchist and anti-fascist groups \u2014 scuffled with police. Officers fired tear gas to disperse the rowdy crowd. Two people were injured and police detained three people as demonstrators burned cars, danced around bonfires and dodged riot police. At a peaceful protest by around 300 people at the Place de la Republique some sang \"No Marine and no Macron!\" and \"Now burn your voting cards.\" \n Macron supporters at his election-day headquarters went wild as polling agency projections showed the ex-finance minister making the runoff, cheering, singing \"La Marseillaise\" anthem, waving French tricolor and European flags and shouting \"Macron, president!\" \n Mathilde Jullien, 23, said she is convinced Macron will beat Le Pen. \n \"He represents France's future, a future within Europe,\" she said. \"He will win because he is able to unite people from the right and the left against the threat of the National Front and he proposes real solutions for France's economy.\" \n Fillon said he would vote for Macron on May 7 because Le Pen's program \"would bankrupt France\" and throw the EU into chaos. He also cited the history of \"violence and intolerance\" of Le Pen's far-right National Front party, founded by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who was trounced in the presidential runoff in 2002. \n In a defiant speech to supporters, Melenchon refused to concede defeat before the official count confirmed pollsters' projections and did not say how he would vote in the next round. \n In a brief televised message, Socialist Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve urged voters to back Macron to defeat the National Front's \"funereal project of regression for France and of division of the French.\" \n Socialist presidential candidate Benoit Hamon, who was far behind in Sunday's results, quickly conceded defeat. Proclaiming that \"the left is not dead,\" he also urged supporters to back Macron. \n Voting took place amid heightened security in the first election under France's state of emergency, which has been in place since gun-and-bomb attacks in Paris in 2015. On Thursday, a gunman killed a police officer and wounded two others on Paris' iconic Champs-Elysees boulevard before he was fatally shot. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "France's next leader: centrist Macron vs. far-right Le Pen"}

{"date": "April 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n This image made from a 2014 video shows the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. According to Park Chan-mo, the university chancellor, North Korea detained Tony Kim, a U.S. citizen who also goes by his Korean name Kim Sang-duk. \n PYONGYANG, North Korea >> North Korea has detained a U.S. citizen, officials said today, bringing to three the number of Americans now being held there. \n Tony Kim, who also goes by his Korean name Kim Sang-duk, was detained on Saturday, according to Park Chan-mo, the chancellor of the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. \n Park said Kim, who is 58, taught accounting at the university for about a month. He said Kim was detained by officials as he was trying to leave the country from Pyongyang's international airport. A university spokesman said he was trying to leave with his wife on a flight to China. \n The Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang said it was aware of a Korean-American citizen being detained recently, but could not comment further. The embassy looks after consular affairs for the United States in North Korea because the two countries do not have diplomatic relations. \n The State Department said it was aware of the report about a U.S. citizen being detained, but declined further comment \"due to privacy considerations.\" \n Park said Kim had taught at the Yanbian University of Science and Technology in China before coming to Pyongyang. He said he was informed that the detention had \"nothing to do\" with Kim's work at the university but did not know further details. \n As of Sunday night, North Korea's official media had not reported on the detention. \n The Pyongyang University of Science and Technology is the only privately funded university in North Korea. It held its first classes in 2010. It is unique in the North for its large number of foreign staff. \n Colin McCulloch, the director of external affairs, said the university was not under investigation and was continuing its normal operations. He said he could not immediately confirm Kim's hometown. \n Though no details on why Kim was detained have been released, the detention comes at a time of unusually heightened tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. Both countries have recently been trading threats of war and having another American in jail will likely up the ante even further. \n Last year, Otto Warmbier, then a 21-year-old University of Virginia student from suburban Cincinnati, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in prison after he confessed to trying to steal a propaganda banner. \n Kim Dong Chul, who was born in South Korea but is also believed to have U.S. citizenship, is serving a sentence of 10 years for espionage. \n Another foreigner, a Canadian pastor, is also being detained in North Korea. Hyeon Soo Lim, a South Korean-born Canadian citizen in his 60s, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 2015 on charges of trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system and helping U.S. and South Korean authorities lure and abduct North Korean citizens. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "North Korea detains U.S. citizen, the 3rd American being held there"}

{"date": "April 23, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n White House budget director Mick Mulvaney speaks at the White House, in Washington. Mulvaney says that Democratic negotiators on a massive spending bill need to agree to funding top priorities of President Donald Trump, such as a down payment on a border wall and hiring of additional immigration agents. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump is heading into one of the most challenging weeks of his presidency, juggling a renewed health care push and a looming budget deadline. It's all complicated by a potential showdown with Democrats over paying for a border wall. \n The symbolic 100-day mark for the administration is Saturday. That's the same day government could shut down without a budget deal. Trump has announced a rally in Pennsylvania that day. \n Despite Trump's dismissal that the 100-day marker is \"artificial,\" the White House is planning a packed week of activities leading up to Saturday. Trump will sign executive orders on energy and rural policies, dine with Supreme Court justices, meet with the president of Argentina and travel to Atlanta for a National Rifle Association event. Top aides will also fan out around the country to promote the administration. \n Aides stressed on Sunday talk shows that funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and a vote on an effort to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's health care law were priorities. But they also suggested a shutdown could be avoided. \n \"I don't think anyone foresees or expects or would want a shutdown,\" said budget director Mick Mulvaney on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \n Trump would like to revive a failed effort by House Republicans to replace the Affordable Care Act, or \"Obamacare.\" He also hopes to use a $1 trillion catchall spending bill to salvage victories on his promised border wall, a multibillion-dollar down payment on a Pentagon buildup, and perhaps a crackdown on cities that refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement by federal authorities. \n But so far, negotiations have proven difficult, with disputes over the border wall and health law subsidies to help low-income people afford health insurance. House members received little information from leaders on a conference call Saturday. \n White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he believes the spending bill will include \"something satisfactory\" to reflect Trump's desire to build a wall. The legislation would keep the government running through Sept. 30, the end of the budget year. \n \"We expect the priorities of the president to be reflected,\" Priebus said, citing ongoing talks with the House and the Senate. He added that \"it'll be enough in the negotiation to move forward either with construction or the planning \u2026 to get going on the border wall and border security.\" \n House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California described a border wall as \"immoral\" and \"expensive\" when asked if there was any scenario in which Democrats will agree to money for a wall to avoid a shutdown. \n \"Democrats do not support the wall,\" she said, speaking also on NBC. \"Republicans on the border states do not support the wall.\" \n \"The Republicans have the votes in the House and the Senate and the White House to keep government open. The burden to keep it open is on the Republicans,\" Pelosi said. She noted that when Trump promised to build a wall during his campaign, he never indicated he would \"pass billions of dollars of cost of the wall onto the taxpayer.\" \n Trump weighed in on his proposed border wall Sunday on Twitter, saying \"Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.\" \n Trump has repeatedly asserted that Mexico would pay for the wall, which he says is necessary to stop the flow of immigrants crossing the border illegally as well as drug smugglers. \n On Obama's health law, Priebus said he'd like to have a vote on the GOP repeal-and-replace bill in the House this coming week. But he insisted it didn't make too much difference to the White House whether the vote came next \"Friday or Saturday or Monday.\" \n \"It's a marathon, not a sprint,\" he said. \n Trump tweeted a warning at Democrats on Sunday, saying: \"ObamaCare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going \u2013 otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought.\" \n Trump is also planning to outline a tax cut plan on Wednesday. He told The Associated Press on Friday that it would include a \"massive\" tax cut for both individuals and corporations. \n On Fox, Mulvaney said to expect \"some specific governing principles, some guidance, also some indication on what the rates are going to be.\" He added: \"I don't think anybody expects us to roll out bill language on Wednesday.\" \n The White House is eager to tout progress on the litany of agenda items Trump promised to fulfill in his first 100 days, despite setbacks including court bans on his proposed immigration limits and the high-profile failure in repealing and replacing Obamacare. \n The president said Friday he spent his first 100 days laying the \"foundation\" for progress later in his administration, including by building relationships with foreign leaders. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump heads into tough week with budget, health care battles"}
