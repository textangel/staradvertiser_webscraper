Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, and the jury will begin considering Strong's eligibility Friday. \n Prosecutors said Strong, who is already serving a life sentence for a separate slaying, spent hours killing 35-year-old Luis Rios, 29-year-old Adrienne Heredia and her four children, ages 6 to 13, in Yuma in 2005. \n They said he suffocated Heredia and three of her children and fatally shot her youngest child and Rios. Police said the two oldest children were bound and strangled. A 9 year-old girl also had been strangled, and the 6-year-old was bound by electric cords, police said. \n \"This crime required information and access to these victims,\" prosecutor Karolyn Kaczorowski said during closing statements. \"It required motives; it required a great deal of opportunity because, as you've seen and what we will discuss, is these murders happened over at least six hours' worth of time. That's a huge chunk of opportunity that's needed.\" \n Prosecutors said Strong and Rios had been arguing over money and how much time he had been spending with Rios and her children. Prosecutor John Tate said Rios had given Strong thousands of dollars over the years but decided to cut him off at some point before the killings, leading to a fight between the friends. \n Prosecutors also said fingerprint evidence was found on bags that were discovered near some of the victims while DNA evidence was on a nightstand and on the steering wheel of Rios' car. \n The defense said the evidence was flimsy and that Strong's DNA could have gotten on the family's items because he spent a lot of time with them. They cast doubt on two eyewitnesses who told police they had seen a Hispanic man leaving the crime scene. Strong is black. \n Strong's attorneys said an ex-girlfriend mentioned she was with Strong during a time when police say he had to have been committing the killings. \n \"It is a leap to say that because he had prints on a bag that he's guilty of murder. That's a leap,\" attorney Ray Hanna said. \n Strong is in prison for life in the 2007 killing of Satinder Gill, a Yuma physician who was strangled and bludgeoned in his home. Prosecutors said a large amount of money was stolen. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Arizona man convicted of killing best friend, woman, 4 kids"}

The husband of U.S. citizen Phan \"Sandy\" Phan-Gillis, who has been charged in China with spying, has spent months trying to prove his wife's innocence with the little information he had. \n HOUSTON >> An American woman detained during a business trip to China was convicted of spying and sentenced today to 3 \u00bd years in prison, raising the possibility that she may be allowed to return home soon. \n Phan Phan-Gillis has faced an uncertain fate since March 2015, when she disappeared from her group traveling in southern China. She was later accused of espionage, which carries a possible death sentence. A United Nations panel has said her detention violated international norms, and the U.S. has long pressed China to resolve the case fairly. \n Her Chinese lawyer Shang Baojun told The Associated Press Wednesday that a deportation order has been issued, and that she should be released \"very soon.\" He said authorities don't usually inform the lawyer of the deportation date. \n He said he couldn't give more details about the spying conviction because \"it is related to state secrets,\" but that the court should release its verdict within five days. \n The U.S. State Department confirmed that she had been sentenced. While Phan-Gillis' trial was closed to the public, a representative from the American Consulate in Guangzhou was allowed to attend the public announcement of the verdict against her, the State Department said. \n The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a message about her case. \n Phan-Gillis is of Chinese descent, but was born in Vietnam and is an American citizen who lived in Houston and worked as a business consultant. Known by friends as \"Sandy,\" she made numerous trips to China for business and as a volunteer to promote cultural and business exchanges. \n She disappeared from the rest of her group during a trip in March 2015 to promote business opportunities in Houston. It took her husband, Jeff Gillis, almost two weeks to confirm through American consular officials that she had been detained by Chinese state security. \n China's opaque legal system often provides little or no explanation for why someone is detained or punished. Jeff Gillis, who did not return a message Tuesday, said last year that he was told his wife was accused of conducting a spy mission in 1996, then trying to recruit new spies the following two years \u2014 allegations he called \"beyond ridiculous.\" \n \"I have the passport that shows that she didn't even have a visa in '96, no entries or exits,\" he said. \"I have her pay stubs that show that she was not off on extended leave.\" \n The San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation, which monitors human rights and legal issues in China, said Phan-Gillis was the first American citizen to be convicted of spying in a Chinese court since 1973. But Phan-Gillis' 3 \u00bd-year prison term is on the low end of sentences for espionage charges, according to Dui Hua's research. \n China sometimes releases foreigners as an apparent sign of goodwill. Last year it allowed Kevin Garratt, a Canadian citizen held for two years and accused of spying, to return home after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau mentioned Garratt to top officials in Beijing. \n In Phan-Gillis' case, John Kamm, founder of Dui Hua, credited the Trump administration and particularly Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who visited Beijing last month. Kamm said he was told by \"people who were in the room\" that Tillerson pressed Phan-Gillis' case in private meetings. \n \"If U.S.-China relations were not going as well as they are right now, I think this outcome would have been different,\" Kamm said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Chinese court sentences U.S. businesswoman accused of spying"}

Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon \u2014 which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use \u2014 can't slow down Netflix or block YouTube. \n NEW YORK >> Internet companies are readying for a showdown with telecoms and a Republican-controlled government over a policy near and dear to their hearts: net neutrality. \n Net neutrality basically prevents broadband providers from playing favorites or steering users toward (or away from) particular internet sites. Under rules enacted during the Obama administration, the likes of Comcast and Verizon \u2014 which offer their own video services they'd very much like subscribers to use \u2014 can't slow down Netflix, can't block YouTube, and can't charge Spotify extra to stream faster than Pandora. \n Broadband companies hate the net neutrality rules, and they have an ally in new Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai, who has repeatedly called the regulations a mistake. Pai could launch the process of unwinding the rules as early as Wednesday, according to reports. \n EARLY TECH RESISTANCE  \n The government may downgrade federal prohibitions on anti-consumer and anticompetitive actions to voluntary commitments by internet service providers. The internet industry, which considers net neutrality essential for its business, isn't standing still \u2014 and it may be keeping some of its most potent tactics in reserve. \n Many internet companies are already running the Washington playbook \u2014 lobbying Congress, schmoozing government regulators, and signing letters of protest. Boston tech companies and venture capitalists met with Sen. Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, last Friday to discuss defending net neutrality. \n Smaller companies have made the loudest noises so far. Engine, a policy group for startups, is calling up small internet companies to keep them updated and asking them to sign a letter that urges the FCC not to dismantle the net neutrality rules. \n Etsy brought sellers to meet with legislators or their staff members in Washington last month, although the company says the visit involved other issues in addition to net neutrality. Roku, the streaming-video gadget maker, hired lobbyists to set up D.C. meetings for the first time. \n CALM BEFORE THE STORM  \n The industry's giants, however, have mostly stayed silent beyond offering blanket statements of support for net neutrality. The Internet Association, which speaks for Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, did call on Pai to support net neutrality earlier this month. Things could get noisier if and when the FCC begins to formally review a rollback. \n Meanwhile, the FCC chairman has also been looking for allies. Pai traveled to Silicon Valley last week to meet with big tech companies, a visit that was \"extremely well received,\" according to Oracle senior vice president Ken Glueck. (Oracle sides with the telecom industry in opposing net-neutrality rules.) \n Pai attended an event held at Cisco, with attendees from Oracle, Apple, Facebook, HP, Salesforce and Intel, Glueck said. (Pai said he met with Oracle, Cisco, Intel, Facebook and other companies.) \n At least one big supporter of net neutrality \u2014 Netflix \u2014 has tempered its rhetoric recently. The streaming-video company said in January that weaker net neutrality wouldn't hurt it because it's now too popular with users for broadband providers to interfere with its service. The company added that it still supports net neutrality \"on a public policy basis.\" \n WHAT COMES NEXT  \n The tech industry is pretty good at getting consumers on its side when it decides to fight for a cause. \n In 2012, internet companies took on the entertainment industry in a fight over online piracy. Thousands of websites, including Wikipedia, one of the internet's most well-trafficked sites, temporarily went dark to protest legislation that would have given the government power to \"blacklist\" sites from the internet. \n Companies collected millions of signatures and asked users to protest to lawmakers. The bills, which aimed to curb illegal downloads and sales of movies and songs as well as other products, were dropped. \n In 2014, smaller companies held an \"internet slowdown\" event to remind users of the net-neutrality fight. Sites such as Reddit, Etsy and WordPress displayed a \"site loading\" icon intended to signify the slowdowns users could theoretically expect without net neutrality. John Oliver also dedicated a show segment to the topic, which raised awareness of an otherwise jargon-y, abstract issue. \n For the moment, though, there's no net-neutrality development to rally around, and won't be until there's an actual FCC proposal up for debate. \n And no one is saying exactly what might happen once there is. \"Next steps haven't been figured out yet,\" Kickstarter general counsel Michal Rosenn said in an interview two weeks ago. \n \"I certainly think we will try every possible avenue, including reaching back out to John Oliver,\" said Engine's executive director, Evan Engstrom. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Internet firms winding up for a fight on 'net neutrality'"}

Fiat Chrysler and Google said today for the first time they will offer rides to the public in the self-driving automobiles they are building under an expanding partnership. \n DETROIT >> Fiat Chrysler and Google for the first time will offer rides to the public in the self-driving vehicles they are building under an expanding partnership. \n Waymo, Google's self-driving car project, said today it's adding 500 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans to its self-driving vehicle fleet. It will allow hundreds of people in the Phoenix area to take rides in the vehicles so it can get feedback on the experience. \n Phoenix-area residents could apply on Waymo's website starting today. The vehicles will also pick up riders in Chandler, Tempe, Mesa and Gilbert, Waymo said. All of the vehicles will have Waymo backup drivers who can take over in an emergency. \n Fiat Chrysler and Waymo have been partners since last spring, when they announced they would build 100 self-driving Pacifica hybrids minivans. Those vehicles were delivered to Waymo in December. The companies have been testing the vehicles in Arizona, California and Michigan. \n Waymo began offering a small number of public rides in Arizona two months ago before deciding to expand the program, a spokesman said. \n Waymo \u2014 created by Google in 2009 \u2014 has given rides to the public before in its hometown of Mountain View, California. In 2015, it let a blind man ride around Austin, Texas, in one of its completely self-driving pods. The Phoenix program will be much larger in scale, and it will be the first to use the Pacifica minivans. \n Waymo isn't the first to put regular passengers in self-driving cars in the race to develop the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber has had self-driving Volvos on the road in Pittsburgh since last fall. Boston startup nuTonomy is giving taxi rides to passengers in Singapore and Boston. In all cases, there is a backup driver behind the wheel. \n Waymo said it wants to learn where people want to go in a self-driving vehicle, how they communicate with it and what kinds of information and controls they want. \n Fiat Chrysler builds the Pacifica minivan in Windsor, Canada, just across the border from Detroit. It adds Waymo's self-driving software and hardware, including sensors and cameras, at a facility in Michigan. Fiat Chrysler's U.S. headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. \n \"This collaboration is helping both companies learn how to bring self-driving cars to market, and realize the safety and mobility benefits of this technology,\" said Waymo chief John Krafcik in a company release. \n Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst for the car shopping site Autotrader, says studies have shown that a majority of Americans are still reluctant to ride in a fully self-driving car. Opening Waymo's vehicles to the public will help build riders' confidence, she said. \n \"The key to acceptance is exposure and education,\" she said. \n Ultimately, Waymo says, self-driving cars could prevent many of the 1.2 million deaths that occur on worldwide roads each year. \n Waymo has made clear that it intends to form partnerships with automakers and not build its own self-driving cars. It's also in talks with Honda Motor Co. about a potential collaboration. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fiat Chrysler and Google begin offering rides in self-driving cars"}

Having a good constructive working relationship allows us to work through those irritants.\" \n The U.S. and Canada typically enjoy a friendly trading relationship, but things have soured in recent months. \n Trump has been railing against Canada's decision to change its policy on pricing domestic milk to cover more dairy ingredients, leading to lower prices for products, including ultra-filtered milk. Trump has called the move \"a disgrace\" that hurts U.S. producers in dairy states like Wisconsin. \n Trump tweeted today that Canada is making life \"very difficult\" for American dairy farmers and that the government \"will not stand\" for it. \n \"This has been going on for a while. And we're not going to put up with it,\" Trump said during a round table today with farmers. \"People don't realize Canada's been very rough on the United States. Everyone thinks of Canada as being wonderful, and so do I. I love Canada. But they've outsmarted our politicians for many years.\" \n Later in the day, the White House said Trump and Trudeau talked by phone a few hours after the president's comments and had \"a very amicable call.\" A statement said the two leaders discussed the dairy and lumber trade, but it gave no details. \n Trudeau's government, however, offered a more detailed read-out of the call and said Trudeau \"refuted the baseless allegations\" by the U.S. Commerce Department about Canadian softwood lumber. It said Canada would \"vigorously defend\" the interests of its lumber industry and \"would continue to defend its interests\" in milk products. \n Lumber and dairy issues were also problems under previous presidents. In softwood lumber, the countries have had a once-a-decade cycle of tariffs, trade litigation, and ultimately settlements. \n Officials said Canada is not likely to challenge the new tariff legally under the North American Free Trade Agreement or with the World Trade Organization until next year. \n The softwood spat is unfolding amid a much bigger trade issue \u2014 renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

{"date": "April 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump speaks at Snap-On Tools in Kenosha, Wis. on April 18. Trump garnered the attention of the masses, in part, because he sounded different than what the public had come to expect from politicians. \n NEW YORK >> Campaign promises may have been reshaped and some self-imposed deadlines reset. But among the things kept intact in the opening months of the new administration is the unmistakably distinct style of President Donald Trump's speech. \n Trump's trademark talk is full of rambling, aside-filled bursts of simple but definitive words, laden with self-congratulatory bravado and claims that have fact-checkers working overtime, all dispatched from mind to lips in such record time it seemingly bypasses any internal filter. \n It has been a source of curiosity for language scholars and laymen alike, sparked anew by a recent Associated Press interview with Trump that has brought newfound opportunity for parsing a brand of presidential oratory not previously recorded. \n \"This kind of pushes the limits of linguistic analysis,\" said historian Kristen Kobes Du Mez. \n A look at some features of Trump-speak: \n A NEW PRESIDENTIAL SCRIPT \n Trump garnered the attention of the masses, in part, because he sounded different from what the public had come to expect from politicians. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, said Trump's extemporaneous speech is best described as stream-of-consciousness, a big change from what we're used to from those seeking \u2014 and occupying \u2014 the highest office in the land. \n \"The public speech of the president in the past has been crafted speech, it has been considered speech. Presidents prepared before speeches, presidents prepared before press conferences, presidents had stock answers ready to give,\" she said. \n With Trump, the mold of focus-group-tested, carefully-selected words was broken. \n REPETITION, ASIDES AND NON SEQUITURS \n The AP interview is just the latest example of some of Trump's favored tactics in speaking. Word choice is typically simple \u2014 to Trump, things are terrible or incredible, best or worst. Asides are frequent. And repetition is rampant: When Trump wants to get a point across, he makes it again and again. \n Then there are the familiar non sequiturs. In one campaign speech, for example, Trump begins to talk about the Iran nuclear deal only to veer far afield into talking at length about his uncle, who was a scientist. \n Early in the AP interview, he makes an unprompted mention of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, saying his chemistry with her was great. He then goes on to say the credit he's been given for his \"great chemistry with all of the leaders,\" and even when the interviewer attempts to shift the discussion, returns to the point he wants to make, talking again of establishing \"amazing relationships\" and \"great relationships\" and \"great chemistry.\" \n \"There is a lot of repetition, building up patterns of trust with the listener, repetition of 'you know,'\" said Paul Breen, a senior lecturer at the University of Westminster in England. \"I think there is actual method in what others may portray as his madness.\" \n Trump has suggested there's method to his word choice too, that the simple terms he often opts for can be more effective than the flowery eloquence listeners may be used to from presidents. \"I went to an Ivy League school. I'm very highly educated. I know words; I have the best words,\" he said during the campaign. \n VERY, SUPER-DUPER, GREAT \n Throughout Trump's interview with AP, his remarks are littered with \"verbal intensifiers,\" in the parlance of Du Mez, chair of the history department at Calvin College. That means things like \"very, very\" and \"many, many\" or, the rare \"super-duper.\" \n \"I don't know that any president has ever used 'super-duper' in his rhetoric before,\" Du Mez said. Still, while she said the president is sometimes mocked for his elementary word choices, \"In terms of oral rhetoric, you want a simpler grade level. That's a more effective way to communicate.\" \n Eric Acton, a linguist at Eastern Michigan University, noted Trump's penchant for superlatives including 'biggest,' 'toughest,' and 'strongest.' And, of course, the word Trump stitched into campaign hats and repeats, dozens of times, in an hour-long conversation. \n \"He really does seem to love the word 'great,'\" Acton said. \n TELEPROMPTER VS. TOUGH GUY \n As with anyone, Trump's manner of speaking can vary with the setting. John Baugh, a linguist at Washington University, says Trump's communiques can be generally pooled into three groups: spontaneous speeches; scripted, carefully-delivered addresses; and tweets. \n The scripted speeches hew closest to the presidential norm, with his address to a joint session of Congress in February most often pointed to as an example of Trump mirroring leaders past. The most bombastic talk is delivered in Trump's spontaneous remarks or hastily penned tweets. \n All of it, though, comes tinged in a very specific voice. \n \"There is a style of speaking that's associated with tough New Yorkers, the stereotype of men in New York and we typically associate this with working-class men,\" said Baugh. \"They're not only plain-spoken but they're tough guys.\" \n SALESMAN'S SPIEL? \n In Barack Obama, you often heard a lawyer at work, speaking carefully and with some semblance of self-monitoring, Jamieson said. With Trump, glimpses of a businessman come through in his use of categorical statements and his repeated assertions that he's successful and admired. \n \"He's telling you that the Trump brand is a good brand, that everyone likes the Trump brand,\" Jamieson said. \n David Beaver, a linguist at the University of Texas at Austin, said Trump mirrors the tactics of advertisers, going with an emotional type of persuasion over rationality. That means graphic imagery stirred by vivid words, and language more typical on streets than of statesman. \n \"When was the last time you heard a president say 'scum' twice in one sentence?\" Beaver asked. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's speaking style still flummoxes linguists"}

The girl's father filed for divorce Monday, citing the alleged abuse. His daughter was found safe with her teacher last week at a cabin in a remote part of Northern California. \n The girl's father has said the 50-year-old teacher brainwashed his daughter. In divorce documents, he said the teacher used his position of authority to \"prey upon her, groom her, and ultimately entice her into running away with him.\" \n The Associated Press is not naming the student or any family members because the teen is an alleged victim of a sex crime. \n The teacher, Tad Cummins, faces federal charges of bringing a minor across state lines for sex and state charges of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor. Cummins' attorney has said the girl went with her teacher willingly, and was not forced, threatened or coerced. \n School records showed the girl often relied on Cummins \"like a friend and a counselor\" when she became upset or anxious at school. \n A history of abuse at home can make children particularly susceptible to manipulation disguised as help, said David Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire. \n \"They're very vulnerable to the grooming because this is an adult who seems to care about them and is interested in them, and that's probably something they're not getting elsewhere,\" he said. \n Authorities said the mother physically abused several of her children for about a year, beginning in November 2014. The teen's father was living at home during that time, but the couple separated in November 2015 and the father took sole custody of the children, according to the divorce filing. The parents have been married for 30 years and have 10 children together, though only four of them are still minors. \n The mother is accused of hitting her children until they bled, knocking a daughter unconscious with a wooden board and throwing a chair at another daughter, bruising her leg, court documents show. The mother also smacked a child in the head for injecting herself with her brother's EpiPen. \n The mother said she can't comment about the case. Her attorney has asked for more detail on the allegations and access to the children's social media accounts. \n The mother has been ordered to stay away from the children, court records said. \n The mother is alleged to have banged the 15-year-old's head on a washer, and at another point, she threw the girl down basement steps and locked her inside, the documents said. \n The children wrote letters to the Department of Children's Services about the abuse before the mother was arrested, according to one of the teen's relatives. \n Department spokesman Rob Johnson said he could not comment on the case. \n The girl's relative said Cummins knew the girl had been abused and took advantage of that information. \n \"We have a 15-year-old girl with a 50-year-old man and he obviously used his power, his authority to, whether it's groom her or convince her, to do certain things,\" the girl's sister-in-law said. \n In January, another student reported seeing Cummins kissing the girl on the lips, setting off an investigation into their relationship. The teen and the teacher denied they had kissed, but the investigation found that the teen often relied on Cummins for support. \n \"She looks at him like a friend and a counselor who knows how to calm her down when she is experiencing anxiety,\" school records said. \n Cummins described the girl as \"a really good friend\" and told school officials that the girl did leave her other classes to come see him \"when she needs someone to calm her down.\" \n School administrators told the girl that she needed to go to a school counselor for anxiety issues and ordered the health science teacher to stay away from her. Cummins disobeyed that order a week later and was suspended, the records said. \n He wasn't fired until about a month later \u2014 a day after the girl was reported missing March 13, when the case began to attract national attention. \n Federal court documents alleged the teacher had been plotting his escape with the girl after their relationship was discovered and planned to take her to Mexico, possibly by boat. \n Authorities credit the caretaker of the remote Northern California property for helping police find the girl. The caretaker will get a $10,000 reward on Friday. \n Abused children are often exploited by teachers, coaches and other people in authority, but what makes the Tennessee case so unusual is that they left the area together, Finkelhor said. \n Still, he said, there's a reason there are laws protecting children from statutory rape or abuse by authority figures. \n \"And the reason why,\" Finkelhor said, \"is we want these people to be thinking about the welfare of children without having their own sexual gratification become part of the equation.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Teen abused by mom before kidnapping by teacher"}

{"date": "April 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n A man walks during a protest in April 2016 at Stone Mountain Park, in Stone Mountain, Ga. Extremist groups are joining together with a shared goal for whites. \n BIRMINGHAM, Ala. >> White extremists, almost by nature, are seldom good at working together. \n Creating consensus among white nationalists, neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klansmen and the like is akin to herding rattlesnakes, given the caustic personalities often involved. Members typically get mad at each other and split, sometimes within days, resulting in the near-constant creation of new groups and a churning of both leaders and followers. \n That's why it's something of a surprise that an alliance of white-power groups born in a KKK bar in Georgia is marking its first birthday. Composed of multiple extremist groups, the Nationalist Front had its anniversary Saturday. \n Similarly, six Klan organizations from around the country announced a consolidation last month. \n The common goal, as these alliances see it, is protecting the white race at a time when the Census Bureau projects whites will be a minority within three decades. \n Watchdog groups that track hate organizations aren't impressed. They say the Nationalist Front now lists 11 member groups, about half the number it had when it was formed. \n \"These things never last,\" said Heidi Beirich, director of the hate-monitoring Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center. \n Beirich said that while white supremacists have been emboldened by President Donald Trump's election, such groups have been trying on and off for decades to merge, generally to appear larger than they really are. \n But leaders say there's a difference this time: A spokesman for the Nationalist Front, Matthew Heimbach, said U.S. white nationalists are trying to follow the example of far-right European groups that have learned to work together rather than bicker over ideology, theology and organizational structure. \n U.S. nationalist groups have cooperated on projects such as video presentations and propaganda strategies over the last year, Heimbach said, and they worked together to support white nationalist Richard Spencer when he spoke at Auburn University earlier this month. \n Originally called the Aryan National Alliance, the Nationalist Front renamed itself and dropped its use of the swastika in an attempt to broaden its appeal. \n Some robe-wearing KKK members who were initially part of the Nationalist Front dropped out, and some Klan groups are now consolidating to build membership and power. \n The American Alliance of Klans formed during a meeting in rural Florida in March. More Klan groups have joined since, leaders say. \n Tom Larson of Delaware, imperial wizard of the East Coast Knights of the KKK, a part of the new alliance, said: \"We want to see people stand up and make this country great again, like Trump is saying. We're tired of seeing white people lose everything.\" \n None of these groups will provide membership numbers, but it's safe to say none is huge. About 100 people have registered to attend a Nationalist Front gathering this weekend in Pikeville, Kentucky, Heimbach said. \n Photos from the meeting where the Klan alliance was formed showed about two dozen people in KKK robes and black uniforms giving the Nazi salute, but organizers said that was only leaders and does not represent total membership. \n Both the Nationalist Front and the Alliance of Klans are but shadow of the United Klans of America, an Alabama-based group that claimed membership in the thousands in the 1960s and was blamed for the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four black girls. It was disbanded in 1987 after the Klan murder of a black man resulted in criminal convictions and a lawsuit that bankrupted the group. \n The SPLC's Beirich said she is less worried about new supremacist alliances than free-standing extremist entities like The Daily Stormer, which she describes as an anti-Semitic, misogynistic, racist website that entered the real world last year by forming \"book clubs\" that hold local meetings. \n Beirich said a single hate-based website can reach millions. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "White-power groups banding together, but for how long?"}

The Antiquities Act does not give the president explicit power to undo a designation and no president has ever taken such a step. \n The order is one of a handful the president is set to sign this week as he tries to rack up accomplishments ahead of his 100th day in office. The president has used executive orders aggressively over the last three months, despite railing against their use by Obama when he was campaigning. \n Zinke said the order, which Trump will sign during a visit to his department, will cover several dozen monuments across the country designated since 1996 that total 100,000 acres or more, from the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah to the Bears Ears in southeastern Utah. \n He'll provide an interim report in 45 days in which he'll provide a recommendation on Bears Ears and a final report within 120 days. \n Over the last 20 years, Zinke said, tens of millions of acres have been designated as national monuments, limiting their use for farming, timber harvesting, mining and oil and gas exploration, and other commercial uses. \n Though \"by and large,\" Zinke said, he feels the designations have done \"a great service to the public,\" he said he worries about overuse and overreach. \n \"I think the concern that I have and the president has is that when you designate a monument, the local community affected should have a voice,\" he said. \n Some, including Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, have hailed the order as the end of \"massive federal land grabs\" by presidents dating to Bill Clinton. \n But Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., said that if Trump truly wants to make America great again, he should use the Antiquities Act to protect and conserve America's public lands. In New Mexico, Obama's designation of Rio Grande del Norte National Monument and Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument have preserved important lands while boosting the economy, Heinrich said, a story that has been repeated across the country. \n \"If this sweeping review is an excuse to cut out the public and scale back protections, I think this president is going to find a very resistant public,'\" Heinrich said. \n Recent polls have shown strong support for national parks and monuments, said Christy Goldfuss, who directed the White House Council on Environmental Quality under Obama. \n Kristina Waggoner, vice president of the Boulder-Escalante Chamber of Commerce in Utah, said business near the Grand Staircase-Escalante monument in southern Utah are booming, driven by sharp increases in tourism since the area was designated in 1996 by President Bill Clinton. \n \"I'm here today to support the monument and my 3-year-old son,\" Waggoner said on a conference call with reporters organized by a pro-Obama group. \"Once our land is gone, it's gone forever.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump to order review of national monuments"}

{"date": "April 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 30. \n Several conservative Congressional holdouts on the stalled GOP health-care bill said they're ready to sign on after revisions to the measure, potentially giving it a new lease on life, but a number of moderate Republicans said they're still opposed. \n House Republicans have been under intense pressure to deliver on years of promises to repeal Obamacare, but GOP leaders weren't making predictions of an imminent vote, despite renewed pressure from the White House as President Donald Trump approaches his 100th day in office on Saturday. \n The new enthusiasm stems from an amendment that would give states the authority to apply for waivers from some of Obamacare's requirements under certain conditions. \n \"It's pretty much everything I was looking for in terms of concessions,\" said Representative Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who had opposed an earlier version. \n House Speaker Paul Ryan and his lieutenants don't know whether the new converts will add up to enough support to pass the bill. \n \"We're showing people the language now,\" Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said today. \"And as we work through and talk through, we're going to talk to more members tonight and tomorrow. Check with me tomorrow and we'll be able to know.\" \n Republicans haven't yet conducted an updated vote count, according to several House GOP members who discussed the measure in a closed-door meeting today. \n STILL 'CAUTIOUS' \n \"Cautious,\" said Representative Phil Roe of Tennessee, a medical doctor, of the approach that House Republican leaders are taking. Representative Steve Chabot of Ohio said everyone is proceeding quietly so that nothing happens \"to blow everything up.\" \n But an influential Republican moderate, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, said the changes don't soften his opposition to the GOP bill. \n \"The amendment as I understand it doesn't change my position. I am still a no,\" he said today. \n The White House, which has been involved in discussions about the changes, is still eager to resurrect the health-care bill. \n \"We're not going to overpromise anything; when the votes are there, the speaker will bring it to the floor but no sooner than that,\" White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus told reporters late today. He said he didn't know if that might be this week or next. \n Repeal of the Affordable Care Act was a major Trump campaign promise and a longtime goal of House Republicans. \n GROWING SUPPORT \n \"We probably had about half of the members of the Freedom Caucus in the first go-around,\" White House legislative affair director Marc Short told reporters today. \"With this amendment, I'd like to think we have greater than 80 percent \u2014 we are very confident in that.\" \n Short said he still thinks they could get the health-care bill passed before the GOP tax bill is introduced in the next four to six weeks. \n Much of the renewed optimism stems from new support within the House Freedom Caucus, a group of about three dozen staunch conservatives. \n Opposition from many inside that group, who wanted a more robust repeal measure, along with skepticism from many Republican moderates, was pivotal to Ryan's decision last month to abruptly scrap a vote on the bill for lack of votes. \n Today, Freedom Caucus' chairman, Mark Meadows of North Carolina, had a meeting at the White House, and told reporters afterward, \"There is a lot of optimism.\" \n Other members of the Freedom Caucus who previously didn't support the bill, including Representative Dave Brat of Virginia, and DesJarlais, said they now support the measure. \n Both pointed to changes hashed out over a two-week recess by Meadows and Representative Tom MacArthur, a New Jersey Republican and co-chairman of a group of House moderates. \n Their amendment was being circulated among members today and is expected to be discussed at a Wednesday morning GOP conference meeting and a Freedom Caucus gathering later in the day. \n STATE WAIVERS \n The amendment would allow insurers to charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions in states that get a waiver. To obtain the waiver, states would have to provide sick people priced out of commercial insurance access to a so-called high-risk pool run by the federal government, or establish their own, and satisfy other conditions. \n Said Brat of his possible support: \"If it shows up in language the way we discussed it, yeah.\" A founding Freedom Caucus member, Jim Jordan of Ohio, said the group as a whole will hold its own meeting on Wednesday about the bill. \n Even Mo Brooks of Alabama, a conservative who opposed the previous version, said he's considering the amendment. \n \"I believe there will be some movement,\" he said. \"I don't know how much.\" \n But it's far from clear if the Freedom Caucus will take a united position backing the amended bill. And anything short of united support could cause problems, given the continued opposition of a number of moderates who don't see the change as an improvement and continue to have concerns about the Medicaid cuts and other issues central to the bill. \n Dent said the bill doesn't provide a \"soft enough\" landing for states that expanded Medicaid, and still doesn't provide sufficient support to help low- and middle-income people, in his view. \n Pressure from the White House, combined with fresh support from conservatives, could put intense pressure on moderates to vote for the bill. But those moderates in swing districts, unlike the members of the Freedom Caucus, could end up losing their seats if the repeal bill continues to remain unpopular. \n \"I will vote my conscience,\" said Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey, who said he also remains opposed. \n ", "author": "By Bloomberg News", "title": "Stalled health bill wins new support from conservative holdouts"}

{"date": "April 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin points to a member of the media as he answers questions during the daily briefing in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, Monday. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump plans to propose massive tax cuts for businesses big and small as part of an overhaul that he says will provide the biggest tax cuts in U.S. history. \n In addition to big tax cuts for corporations, Trump also wants to cut taxes for small business owners from a top tax rate of 39.6 percent to a top rate of 15 percent, said an official with knowledge of the plan. \n The top tax rate for individuals would be cut from 39.6 percent to the \"mid-30s,\" the official said. \n The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was not authorized to discuss the plan publicly ahead of Trump's announcement, scheduled for Wednesday. \n White House officials had already revealed that Trump's plan would reduce the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. The plan will also include child-care benefits, a cause promoted by Trump's daughter Ivanka. \n Republicans who slammed the growing national debt under Democrat Barack Obama said today they are open to Trump's tax plan, even though it could add trillions of dollars to the deficit over the next decade. \n Echoing the White House, Republicans on Capitol Hill argued that tax cuts would spur economic growth, reducing or even eliminating any drop in tax revenue. \n \"I'm not convinced that cutting taxes is necessarily going to blow a hole in the deficit,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee. \n \"I actually believe it could stimulate the economy and get the economy moving,\" Hatch added. \"Now, whether 15 percent is the right figure or not, that's a matter to be determined.\" \n The argument that tax cuts pay for themselves has been debunked by economists from across the political spectrum. Today, the official scorekeeper for Congress dealt the argument \u2014 and Trump's plan \u2014 another blow. \n The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said today that a big cut in corporate taxes \u2014 even if it is temporary \u2014 would add to long-term budget deficits. This is a problem for Republicans because it means they would need Democratic support in the Senate to pass a tax overhaul that significantly cuts corporate taxes. \n The assessment was requested by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who has been pushing a new tax on imports to fund lower overall tax rates. Senate Republicans have panned the idea, and officials in the Trump administration have sent mixed signals about it. \n The import tax is not expected to be part of Trump's plan. \n Trump dispatched his top lieutenants to Capitol Hill today to discuss his plan with Republican leaders. They met for about half an hour. No Democrat was invited. \n Afterward, Hatch called it, \"a preliminary meeting.\" \n \"They went into some suggestions that are mere suggestions, and we'll go from there.\" \n Republicans have been working under a budget maneuver that would allow them to pass a tax bill without Democratic support in the Senate \u2014 but only if it didn't add to long-term deficits. \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate was sticking to that strategy. \n \"Regretfully we don't expect to have any Democratic involvement in\" a tax overhaul, McConnell said. \"So we'll have to reach an agreement among ourselves.\" \n Democrats said they smell hypocrisy over the growing national debt, which stands at nearly $20 trillion. For decades, Republican lawmakers railed against saddling future generations with trillions in debt. \n But with Republicans controlling Congress and the White House, there is no appetite at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue to tackle the long-term drivers of debt \u2014 Social Security and Medicare. Instead, Republicans are pushing for tax cuts and increased defense spending. \n \"I'm particularly struck by how some of this seems to be turning on its head Republican economic theory,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \n Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said, \"On a lot of fronts, both the administration and Republicans have been contradictory, to say the least.\" \n \"There's no question we should try to reduce (the corporate tax rate), but I don't see how you pay for getting it down that low,\" Casey said. \"Fifteen percent, that's a huge hole if you can't make the math work.\" \n The Trump administration today stuck with its assertion that tax reform could push economic growth above 3 percent. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that the combination of changes on taxes, trade and regulations being pushed by the administration would accelerate the pace of economic gains. \n \"There is no reason that we should not be able to hit that \u2014 if not beat it,\" Ross said at the White House news briefing. \n Many economists are skeptical that growth could consistently eclipse 3 percent. The flow of workers into the U.S. economy has slowed because of retirements by an aging baby boomer population, while improvements in productivity have been sluggish. \n Officials with the Federal Reserve estimate that the economy will grow at a 2.1 percent clip this year and at 1.8 percent in the longer run. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump to propose massive tax cuts for businesses"}

It's expected to be formally commissioned sometime before 2020, after sea trials and the arrival of its full air complement. \n Vice chairman of China's Central Military Commission and Communist Party Central Committee member Fan Changlong presided over the launch, which came just three days after the anniversary of the People's Liberation Army Navy's symbolic founding in 1949. \n Also attending was navy commander Vice Adm. Shen Jinlong, a former commander of the South Sea Fleet responsible for defending China's claim to virtually the entire South China Sea. \n Reports of the launch said a bottle of champagne was broken across the ship's bow and other craft in the port sounded their horns in celebration. \n Like the 60,000-ton Liaoning, which was purchased from the Ukraine, the new carrier is based on the Soviet Kuznetsov class design, with a ski jump-style deck for taking off and a conventional oil-fueled steam turbine power plant. That limits the weight of payloads its planes can carry, its speed and the amount of time it can spend at sea relative to American nuclear-powered carriers. \n The main hull of the new carrier has been completed and its power supply put into place. Next up are mooring tests and the debugging of its electronic systems, the Defense Ministry said. \n China is believed to be planning to build at least two and possibly as many as four additional carriers, with one of them, the Type 002, reported to be already under construction at a shipyard outside Shanghai. They are expected to be closer in size to the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered 100,000-ton Nimitz class ships, with flat flight decks and catapults to allow planes to launch with more bombs and fuel aboard. \n Along with their role in protecting China's maritime interests, Chinese naval strategists see the carrier program as \"about having naval power commensurate with China's international status, to impress both external and domestic audiences,\" said Michael Chase, an expert on the Chinese military at U.S. think tank the RAND Corporation. \n The new carrier \"is likely to be seen as further evidence of China's desire to become the most powerful and influential country in the region,\" Chase said. That will be especially worrying to Indian security analysts who are already concerned about Beijing's ambitions in the Indian Ocean, he said. \n India, along with Japan and Taiwan which also view Chinese carriers as threats, will likely respond by building new submarines and anti-ship missiles, said Ian Easton, a research Fellow at The Project 2049 Institute in Arlington, Virginia. \n China's \"expansionist behavior in the South China Sea and its aggressive efforts to undermine the security of Taiwan and Japan, in particular, have translated into a situation where few countries now trust that Beijing has benign motives,\" Easton said. \n China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under control by force if necessary, and was seen as advertising that threat when it sailed the Liaoning through the Taiwan Strait earlier this year. \n According to Chinese reports, the new, as yet unnamed, carrier will carry 24 Shenyang J-15 fighters, based on the Russian Sukhoi Su-33, along with 12 helicopters for anti-submarine warfare, airborne early warning and rescue operations. That compares to 85-90 fixed wing aircraft and helicopters carried by a Nimitz-class carrier. \n The new carrier is part of an ambitious expansion of the Chinese navy, which is projected to have a total of 265-273 warships, submarines and logistics vessels by 2020, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Naval Analysis. That compares with 275 deployable battle force ships presently in the U.S. Navy, China's primary rival in the Asia Pacific. \n The U.S. operates 10 aircraft carriers, has 62 destroyers to China's 32, and 75 submarines to China's 68. The U.S. Navy has 323,000 personnel to China's 235,000. \n China has offered little information about the roles it expects its carriers to play, although its planning appears to be evolving as it gains more experience. The Liaoning was initially touted mainly as an experimental and training platform, but in December was declared to be combat-ready and has taken part in live-firing exercises in the South China Sea, where tensions have risen over China's construction of man-made islands complete with airstrips and military structures. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "China launches 1st domestically-made aircraft carrier"}

It also expands the case to include Dianne Brandi, Fox's chief counsel. \n Fox News said it vehemently denies the allegations, calling them \"copycat complaints.\" It said Brandi denies the claims against her. \n The original lawsuit was filed in late March by two black women who worked in the network's payroll department, and a third colleague later joined it. The expanded lawsuit, incorporating the other employees, seeks unspecified compensatory damages and an elimination of unlawful employment practices at Fox. \n The workers allege that their complaints about the actions of Judith Slater, the fired former comptroller, went unanswered for years. They say Brandi told them it was because Slater \"knew too much\" about former Fox Chairman Roger Ailes and top-rated host Bill O'Reilly, who have been ousted over the past year because of sexual-harassment accusations. \n A lawyer for Slater, Catherine Foti, said the actions against Slater are meritless and frivolous.

Wright said O'Reilly, who's white, refused to show a piece Wright had prepared after racial protests in Ferguson, Missouri, because they showed blacks in too positive a light. \n A former employee, Musfiq Rahman, a dark-skinned Bangladeshi, said he was punished after mistakenly walking into Ailes' office by no longer being allowed on Ailes' floor without an escort. \n Mark LeGrier, a former financial employee who's black, said he was subjected to retaliation when he complained to Brandi about Slater's behavior. \n \"When it comes to racial discrimination, 21st Century Fox has been operating as if it should be called 18th Century Fox,\" said Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. \n Meanwhile, Nielsen company ratings showed that Tucker Carlson moved into O'Reilly's old time slot at Fox News on Monday night and took over his status as the most-watched host in cable news \u2014 at least for a night. \n O'Reilly, who hosted \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" was fired by Fox last week following news about Fox settling sexual-harassment cases involving him for millions of dollars.

{"date": "April 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of N.Y., accompanied by Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., pointed to a reporter during a media availability after a policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington today. \n WASHINGTON >> Congressional negotiators today inched toward a potential agreement on a catchall spending bill that would deny President Donald Trump's request for immediate funding to construct a wall along the Mexico border. The emerging measure would increase the defense budget and eliminate the threat of a government shutdown on Trump's 100th day in office this Saturday. \n Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said Republican negotiators were following the lead of Trump, who signaled Monday evening that he would not insist on $1 billion worth of wall funding now as an addition to the $1 trillion-plus spending bill. Trump told a gathering of conservative media reporters that he might be willing to wait until September for the funding. \n Other stumbling blocks remain, but the decision by Trump and his GOP allies to back down on the wall steered the talks on the spending measure in a positive direction. \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he was optimistic the talks would produce \"an agreement in the next few days.\" \n An existing temporary funding bill expires Friday at midnight and all sides anticipated that another stopgap measure would be required to buy time for the House and Senate to process the massive spending bill, which would wrap together 11 unfinished agency spending bills through September. \n Trump campaigned throughout the country last year promising a wall across the entire 2,200 mile southern border, promising that Mexico would pay for it. But while the idea is a priority of Trump's most fervent supporters, it is resolutely opposed by Democrats and even many Republicans, who see it as wasteful and who prefer other steps like new technologies and additional border agents to curb illegal immigration. \n \"I support additional border security funding,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a GOP critic of Trump who dined with the president Monday at the White House. \"But a 2,200-mile wall, I don't think there's a whole lot of support for it.\" \n Trump vowed to fight for the wall. \n \"The wall is going to get built,\" he said at the White House today. Asked when, he said, \"Soon.\" \n Democrats vowed not to give up, either, and look forward to the fight. \n \"It's not a negotiation,\" Schumer said. \"No wall.\" \n Meanwhile, Trump appeared poised to procure about $15 billion to boost the military. Democrats said they were satisfied with the emerging outlines of the measure, which stick closely to versions of the legislation that were being negotiated late last year. \n Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., observed that GOP negotiators \"have simply ignored\" a roster of \"$18 billion in extreme cuts\" offered by White House budget director Mick Mulvaney to lower the measure's cost. The measure would also while maintain foreign aid accounts that Trump has targeted, along with a series of grant programs popular with lawmakers in both parties, such as community development block grants. \n Several issues remain unresolved. Democrats, with McConnell's help, were pushing to extend health benefits for 22,000 retired Appalachian coal miners and their families whose medical coverage is set to expire at the end of April. Democrats faced White House opposition in an uphill battle to give Puerto Rico help with its Medicaid commitment, while Republicans are pressing policy \"riders\" to undo new Obama-era financial regulations. \n Another potential stumbling block involved a recent threat by Trump to scuttle a portion of former President Barack Obama's health law that helps low-income people afford insurance policies. \n Democratic votes are invariably needed to pass catchall spending bills, which typically are resented by many tea party Republicans. That gave Democratic leaders like Schumer and Pelosi significant leverage, and the top Democrats had earlier this month taken a hard line in response to Trump's threats to deny the Obamacare payments for out-of-pocket costs for the poor, injecting the issue into the spending bill talks. Schumer, however, backpedaled on Tuesday and would no longer insist that the issue be addressed in the catchall bill and the White House sent conciliatory signals as well. \n Meanwhile, House lawmakers returned to Washington this evening and faced a renewed push from the White House to revive their beleaguered health care bill in hopes of attracting enough votes to finally push it through the House. \n Leaders of the conservative House Freedom Caucus met to consider a proposal to change the GOP legislation to let states get federal waivers to ignore coverage requirements imposed by President Barack Obama's health care law. These include a prohibition against insurers charging higher premiums for seriously ill customers. \n The plan \"has real merits worthy of consideration for all the Freedom Caucus folks,\" said Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., leader of that group. He helped craft the idea with Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., a leader of a group of GOP moderates. \n Meadows and numerous conservatives and moderates opposed an initial version of the bill, forcing House leaders to withdraw the measure before a planned vote last month. GOP leaders are trying to determine if the proposed changes can gain enough votes to pass, but that remains uncertain. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "GOP drops U.S.-Mexico wall demands as spending talks advance"}

{"date": "April 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n City Attorney Dennis Herrera talked about a federal judge's order blocking any attempt by the Trump administration to withhold money from \"sanctuary cities \"during a news conference in San Francisco. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> A federal judge today blocked President Donald Trump's attempt to withhold funding from \"sanctuary cities\" that do not cooperate with U.S. immigration officials, saying the president has no authority to attach new conditions to federal spending. \n U.S. District Judge William Orrick issued the preliminary injunction in two lawsuits \u2014 one brought by the city of San Francisco, the other by Santa Clara County \u2014 against an executive order targeting communities that protect immigrants from deportation. \n The injunction will stay in place while the lawsuits work their way through court. \n The judge rejected the administration's argument that the executive order applies only to a relatively small pot of money and said Trump cannot set new conditions on spending approved by Congress. \n \"Federal funding that bears no meaningful relationship to immigration enforcement cannot be threatened merely because a jurisdiction chooses an immigration enforcement strategy of which the president disapproves,\" the judge said. \n It was the third major setback for the administration on immigration policy. The Justice Department had no immediate comment. \n San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera praised the ruling today and said the president was \"forced to back down.\" \n \"This is why we have courts \u2014 to halt the overreach of a president and an attorney general who either don't understand the Constitution or chose to ignore it,\" Herrera said in a statement. \n Santa Clara County Counsel James Williams said the ruling will allow cities and counties across the country to prepare budgets without the \"unconstitutional threat of federal defunding hanging over our heads.\" \n A Justice Department attorney, Chad Readler, previously defended the president's executive order as an attempt to use his \"bully pulpit\" to \"encourage communities and states to comply with the law.\" \n Readler also said the order applied to only three Justice Department and Homeland Security grants that would affect less than $1 million for Santa Clara County and possibly no money for San Francisco. \n But the judge said executive order was written broadly to reach all federal grants and potentially jeopardized hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to San Francisco and Santa Clara. \n He cited comments by the president and Attorney General Jeff Sessions as evidence of the order's scope and said the president himself had called it a \"weapon\" to use against recalcitrant cities. \n The government hasn't cut off any money yet or declared any communities to be sanctuary cities. But the Justice Department sent letters last week advising communities to prove they are in compliance. California was informed it could lose $18.2 million. \n Sanctuary cities is a loosely defined term for jurisdictions that don't comply with immigration authorities. \n The Trump administration argued that the executive order applied narrowly to cities that forbid officials from reporting people's immigration status to federal authorities. But Orrick said it could also be construed to apply to cities that refuse to hold jail inmates for immigration authorities. \n The Trump administration says sanctuary cities allow dangerous criminals back on the street and that the order is needed to keep the country safe. San Francisco and other sanctuary cities say turning local police into immigration officers erodes the trust that is needed to get people to report crime. \n The order has also led to lawsuits by Seattle; two Massachusetts cities, Lawrence and Chelsea; and a third San Francisco Bay Area government, the city of Richmond. The San Francisco and Santa Clara County lawsuits were the first to get a hearing before a judge. \n Also today, mayors from several cities threatened with the loss of federal grants emerged from a meeting with Sessions saying they remain confused about how to prove their police are in compliance with immigration policies. \n The sanctuary city order was among a flurry of immigration measures Trump signed after taking office in January, including a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and a directive calling for a wall on the Mexican border. \n A federal appeals court blocked the travel ban. The administration then revised it, but the new version also is stalled in court. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Judge blocks Trump threat to withhold 'sanctuary city' funds"}

{"date": "April 25, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Markings on a soda can show that it is subject to a five-cent deposit in Vermont, Maine, New York, Iowa, Massachusetts, Oregon, Connecticut and Hawaii. \n HARTFORD, Conn. >>As curbside recycling has grown, environmentalists around the United States find themselves fighting to protect decades-old bottle recycling programs that critics say are becoming obsolete. \n Connecticut, Massachusetts and Iowa are among the states where bills have been proposed to replace the bottle deposits with a tax. Supporters say the tax revenue could support recycling efforts that did not exist when the bottle redemption systems were introduced. \n The so-called \"bottle bills\" remain in place in 10 states. Typically, consumers pay an extra few cents when they buy certain beverages, a deposit they get back when they bring their cans or bottles to a redemption center or grocery store. \n Some fear people will be more likely to toss their empties if they're no longer worth cash. \n \"This is the most effective, proven way that we have to guarantee that these containers do not end up on our streets and do not end up on our beaches and open spaces as litter,\" said Louis Burch, the Connecticut program director for Citizens Campaign for the Environment. \n In 1971, Oregon became the first state to pass a bottle bill. It was seen as a way to address a growing litter problem along the state's beaches and highways. Since then, Hawaii, California, Iowa, Michigan, New York, Vermont, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts have passed similar legislation. The types of beverage containers and the deposit amounts can vary by state. \n In eight of the 10 deposit states, beverage distributors have both the financial and operational responsibility for the system. \n Kevin Dietly, an economic consultant to the American Beverage Association, said there is no evidence that litter is any worse in Delaware since that state scrapped its bottle bill in 2010. \n In Connecticut, distributors were allowed to keep the unclaimed bottle deposits to help offset the costs of running the program, but state officials decided in 2009 to use that money \u2014 about $34 million each year \u2014 to help balance the government's budget. \n That change, coupled with the growth in single-stream recycling where glass, metal, plastic and paper is placed in a resident's curbside bin, has prompted legislation that would replace the existing bottle redemption system. It would create a two-phase system covering a broader range of containers and creating a minimum 4-cent tax. \n Lawrence Cafero, executive director and general counsel of the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of Connecticut, said the two recycling systems have \"competed with each other over the years with very mixed and, some might say disappointing results\" in the state. He said it's time to choose one system over the other. \n Susan Collins, president of the Container Recycling Institute, said it would be towns and taxpayers that get stuck with the bill for single-stream recycling. \n There are other bills up for debate this year in Connecticut that would increase the handling fee paid to redemption centers, increase the deposit to 10 cents and expand the law to include other beverages, such as teas and sports drinks. \n An estimated 3,000 to 3,500 jobs in New England and New York stem from bottle bill laws currently in place, according to Andrew Crowley, a senior plant manager for Strategic Materials, overseeing glass recycling operations in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. He has warned lawmakers that scrapping the bottle deposit system would lead to the elimination of jobs. \n \"We think there are advantages to both systems and I wouldn't propose going too radical in either direction,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Several states consider tossing bottle deposit programs"}

Yates is scheduled to appear at a congressional hearing next month on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a Senate committee announced today. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn spoke during a daily news briefing, Feb. 1, at the White House, in Washington. The White House refused to provide lawmakers with information and documents related to President Donald Trump's first national security adviser's security clearance and payments from organizations tied to the Russian and Turkish governments. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, appeared to violate federal law when he failed to seek permission or inform the U.S. government about accepting tens of thousands of dollars from Russian organizations after a trip there in 2015, leaders of a House oversight committee said today. \n The congressmen also raised new questions about fees Flynn received as part of $530,000 in consulting work his company performed for a businessman tied to Turkey's government. \n The bipartisan accusations that Flynn may have broken the law come as his foreign contacts are being examined by other congressional committees as part of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. Congress returned earlier this week from its spring recess, and today's announcements reflected renewed interest on Capitol Hill. \n Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said Flynn could be criminally prosecuted because, as a former Army officer, he was barred from accepting payments from foreign governments. Flynn, who headed the military's top intelligence agency, is a retired lieutenant general and was Trump's national security adviser until he was fired in February. \n \"That money needs to be recovered,\" said Chaffetz, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. \"You simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else.\" \n The congressmen spoke after reviewing classified documents regarding Flynn that were provided by his former agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency. They were also briefed by agency officials. The congressmen declined to describe in detail the materials they reviewed. \n Chaffetz and Cummings said they planned to write to the comptroller of the Army and the Defense Department's inspector general to determine whether Flynn broke the law and whether the government needs to pursue criminal charges. \n Cummings also criticized the White House for refusing to turn over documents the committee requested about Flynn's vetting before his appointment and his foreign contacts during his three-week stint as national security adviser. In response to a letter to White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, a Trump administration official told the committee that documents relating to those contacts likely contained classified and other sensitive information and could not be turned over. \n \"That is simply unacceptable,\" Cummings said. \n The committee also wants documents relating to Flynn's security clearance. In the White House response, Marc T. Short, Trump's director of legislative affairs, said the material could be provided only by the Defense Department. \n Flynn campaigned for and advised Trump before the presidential election and was chosen as national security adviser in January. Trump fired him in February on grounds that he had failed to notify senior administration officials about his contacts with Russian officials before his appointment. \n Cummings said Flynn's failure to formally report the Russian payments on paperwork requesting his security clearance amounted to concealment of the money, which could be prosecuted as a felony. Chaffetz said Flynn was obligated to request permission from both the Defense and State departments about prospective foreign government payments. \n Flynn's lawyer said in a statement that Flynn briefed the Defense Intelligence Agency about the 2015 Moscow event organized by the Russia Today news organization. Flynn had led the spy agency until 2014, when he was forced to retire by the Obama administration. \n During his briefings, Flynn \"answered any questions that were posed by DIA concerning the trip,\" attorney Robert Kelner said. \n A spokesman for the Defense Intelligence Agency, Jim Kudla, has said Flynn briefed the agency in advance about his trip to Moscow \"in accordance with standard security clearance procedures.\" \n A spokesman for Flynn previously said that Flynn disclosed the RT trip when he last came up for a security clearance review in January 2016. \n Flynn received $33,750 from RT, which has been described by U.S. intelligence officials as a propaganda front for Russia's government. During a televised RT celebration, Flynn sat at the head table, next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n Chaffetz and Cummings said today said that the documents they reviewed showed no evidence Flynn asked permission for the payments or later detailed the amounts he received to military authorities. \n \"There was nothing in the data to show that Gen. Flynn complied with the law,\" Chaffetz said. \n Chaffetz added that while \"it would be a bit strong to say that Flynn flat-out lied,\" he should have sought and received permission before accepting any foreign government payments. At issue in any further inquiry is whether the Russian and Turkish entities that paid Flynn were clearly government-supported or controlled. \n Flynn also disclosed to the White House that he received between $50,000 and $100,000 as part of his personal stake in $530,000 that his company, Flynn Intel Group, received for consulting work performed last year for a Turkish businessman. Flynn's firm filed as a foreign agent last month with the Justice Department for the consulting work and acknowledged that it may have benefited the government of Turkey. Flynn's client, Inovo BV, is owned by a Turkish businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. \n Earlier today, a Senate Judiciary subcommittee announced a public panel May 8 to hear testimony for the first time from the former acting attorney general, Sally Yates, who played a role in Flynn's firing. \n Yates was supposed to testify publicly before the House intelligence committee in March, but that was canceled and has yet to be rescheduled.

When rodents expel the larvae of the worm, they can be ingested by snails, slugs, crabs and frogs, then passed to people. \n The disease is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands and has been seen in Africa, the Caribbean and the U.S. It's rare, and most people completely recover without treatment, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n Symptoms can range from mild headaches to temporary paralysis, and diagnosis is difficult, requiring a spinal tap, said William L. Gosnell, program director for the graduate certificate in tropical medicine at University of Hawaii's medical school. \n Hawaii sees between one and 11 cases each year, with 11 in 2016, state health officials said. Two deaths have occurred since officials began tracking it in 2007. \n HOW DO PEOPLE GET IT? \n By eating food contaminated by the larvae of the parasite. They can be found in raw snails or in produce contaminated by tiny snails or slugs. \n Two adults on the Big Island got the disease after consuming contaminated homemade elixir, health officials said last week. \n They left homemade kava, a dietary supplement, in uncovered buckets overnight and noticed slugs after drinking it, Pressler said. \n Four others who drank the same batch are suspected of being infected. \n HOW DO YOU PREVENT IT? \n Avoid eating raw snails or slugs and properly wash produce. \n Manilla said had he and his wife, Eliza Lape, known about the disease, they would have more thoroughly cleaned fruits and vegetables. They believe they contracted it in the remote Hana area of Maui early this year. \n \"It's easy in the U.S. to think that we're impervious to things that occur often in the developing world and apparently in some of the remote areas of Hawaii,\" Manilla said in an email. \n The couple declined an interview but told Hawaii News Now that the symptoms began after they returned to San Francisco. \n \"My symptoms started growing to feeling like somebody was taking a hot knife and just stabbing me in different parts of my body,\" Lape told the Honolulu news station. \n Still, the couple can't wait to return to Hana, Manilla said. \n \"We'll do it a bit differently next time knowing what we know now about rat lungworm disease,\" he wrote. \n WHAT IS HAWAII DOING ABOUT IT? \n The state health director says the department works with the Hawaii Tourism Authority to warn visitors about risks on the islands. \n Pressler pointed to \"hard to miss\" information about the disease on the department's website . \n The tourism agency also has been meeting with members and contractors who book travel to explain the disease, and it's working on getting messages to tourists that Hawaii is safe, said George Szigeti, president and CEO. It noted a special alert on its website and a mention in its e-newsletter. \n For residents, the state is holding community forums, Pressler said. \n Hawaii needs to do much more, said Susan Jarvi, professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Hawaii's Hilo campus. \n \"I think most people on the island of Hawaii feel the state hasn't done enough to help,\" she said. \n Jarvi wants to see more funding to combat disease-transmitting pests and more education about controlling invasive species. \n \"The research and education on this disease is really lacking,\" she said. \n SHOULD TOURISTS AVOID HAWAII? \n The tourism authority said people should not overreact and urged visitors to keep eating at restaurants and enjoying fresh produce. \n \"The key facts that everyone needs to remember about rat lungworm disease is that it is very rare, it is very uncommon for people to get infected, and the disease is easily preventable by properly washing and storing all food, especially produce, before eating,\" Szigeti said in a statement. \n Ashlynn Martin, of Yuma, Arizona, has been planning a Maui vacation for two years. The October trip isn't refundable, so she and her husband aren't changing their plans. \n \"We're just going to take the chance,\" she said, adding that she will make sure to wash produce. \"It worries me, but I feel like so many people travel to Hawaii. \u2026 I think we'll be OK.\" \n Associated Press writers Cathy Bussewitz in Honolulu and Michael Stobbe in New York and AP researcher Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "State officials reassure visitors after brain parasite cases"}

The conference aims at building support for investment in women's economic empowerment programs. \n BERLIN >> Ivanka Trump brushed aside groans and hisses today over her father's track record and defended his attitudes toward women as she made her first international outing as a White House adviser. \n Trump pledged to push for \"incremental, positive change\" for women in the U.S. economy and told a Berlin conference on women that she's still \"rather unfamiliar\" with her role as first daughter and adviser to President Donald Trump. \n The scattered groans and hisses came as she described her father as \"a tremendous champion of supporting families.\" \n Trump's one-day visit, at the invitation of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, gave Merkel and other officials face-to-face access with the president's influential daughter at a time when world leaders are still trying to discern where his policies will lead. \n Merkel and Trump were part of a high-powered panel discussion today at the W20 Summit, a women-focused effort within the Group of 20 countries, entitled \"Inspiring women: Scaling up women's entrepreneurship.\" They were joined by Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde and the Netherlands' Queen Maxima, among others. \n The 35-year-old Trump, who stepped away from both running her fashion brand and from an executive role at the Trump Organization to become an unpaid White House adviser, said she is still finding her feet in her new role. \n \"I'm listening, I'm learning, I'm defining the ways in which I think that I'll be able to have impact\" in empowering women in the U.S. economy and beyond, she said. \n She says she plans \"to bring the advice, to bring the knowledge, back to the United States, back to both my father and the president \u2014 and hopefully that will bring about incremental, positive change. And that is my goal.\" \n Trump has been a vocal advocate for policies benefiting working women and vocational training. During Merkel's visit to Washington in March, she organized a discussion with the German leader, her father, and American and German executives about how companies can better train workers. \n However, Trump has faced a backlash in the United States, particularly from liberals who think she has done little to temper her father's conservative agenda. Since the president took office in January, liberal groups have questioned the impact of his policy moves on families. \n Berlin moderator Miriam Meckel brought Trump today into the discussion with a pointed question about her White House role. \n \"As a part of the audience, especially the German audience, is not that familiar with the concept of the 'first daughter' I'd like to ask you: what is your role and who are you representing \u2014 your father as the president of the United States, the American people or your business?\" she asked. \n The question drew a quick response from Trump. \n \"Certainly not the latter. And I am rather unfamiliar with this role as well, as it is quite new to me,\" Trump responded. She added that \"it has been a little under 100 days but it has just been a remarkable, incredible journey.\" \n Meckel intervened again after Trump described the president as \"a tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive,\" noting some reactions from the audience. \n \"Some attitudes toward women your father has publicly displayed in former times might leave one questioning whether he's such an empowerer for women,\" said the moderator, who is the editor of a German business magazine and also a professor of corporate communications at St. Gallen University in Switzerland. \n \"I've certainly heard the criticism from the media, and that's been perpetuated,\" Trump replied. \n But Trump added that her own personal experience and the fact that \"thousands\" of women have worked with and for Donald Trump for decades in the private sector \"are a testament to his belief and solid conviction in the potential of women and their ability to do the job as well as any man.\" \n \"He encouraged me and enabled me to thrive,\" Trump said. \"I grew up in a house where there was no barrier to what I could accomplish beyond my own perseverance and my own tenacity.\" \n There was, she stressed, \"no difference between me and my brothers. And I think as a business leader you saw that, and as a president you will absolutely see that.\" \n Before the event, President Trump tweeted today that he is \"proud of @IvankaTrump for her leadership on these important issues.\" \n Trump, who promoted child care and family leave policies during her father's campaign, told reporters today that child care \"is going to be part of comprehensive tax reform.\" \n The president is set to roll out tax reform priorities Wednesday, but his daughter didn't specify whether it would be part of that announcement. \n She also said more needs to be done to help female entrepreneurs secure funding in the U.S. \u2014 \"we are not where we need to be.\" \n Later Tuesday, Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser gave Trump a tour of a training center in Berlin run by the German industrial conglomerate. Germany is proud of its vocational training system. Siemens says it has some 12,000 young people worldwide, including 9,000 in Germany, in programs that combine study with practical training. \n Before heading to a formal dinner, Trump visited the German capital's memorial to the 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazis. Trump converted to Judaism herself ahead of her 2009 marriage to Jared Kushner. \n Trump walked slowly through the field of undulating ground filled with concrete slabs, along with U.S. Embassy personnel. She was also flanked by a strong police guard to keep curious tourists and others at a distance. \n She paused occasionally to look at the slabs, meant to symbolize the chaos of the Holocaust, and donned sunglasses before emerging on the other side of the monument to a crush of cameras and onlookers. \n Catherine Lucey contributed to this report from Washington and Geir Moulson from Berlin. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Ivanka Trump defends father, brushes aside groans in Berlin"}

Heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas made those records more likely or more intense. \n \"The world is not quite at the point where every hot temperature record has a human fingerprint, but it's getting close to that,\" said lead author and Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh. \n Climate change's influence was spotted 57 percent of the time in records for lowest rainfall in a year and 41 percent of the time in records for most rain in a 5-day period, according to the study in Monday's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n For the last several years, researchers have come up with a generally accepted scientific technique to determine whether an individual weather extreme event was made more likely or stronger because of climate change. It usually involves past weather data and extensive computer models that simulate how often an event would happen with no warming from greenhouse gases and compare that to how often it does happen. \n Outside scientists said what makes Diffenbaugh's study different and useful is that he doesn't look at an individual event such as California's five-year drought. Instead, he applies the technique to weather stations as a whole across the world, said Columbia University climate scientist Adam Sobel, who wasn't part of new work. \n \"This is a step forward in that it allows general statements about what fraction of events of the given types selected have a statistically significant\" human influence, Sobel said in an email. \n ___ \n ___ \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Man-made extreme weather has hit all over the world"}
