These are some of the many public school teachers casting their contract ratification votes. \n Hawaii public school teachers overwhelmingly voted in favor today of a four-year labor contract that will boost their pay by 13.6 percent over the next four years. \n Ninety-eight percent of teachers who cast a ballot today voted to ratify the deal, the 13,500-member Hawaii State Teachers Association announced. Nearly 8,000 HSTA members voted, according to the union. \n \"Our goal from the start was to establish a fair and equitable contract that offers professional pay and improves working conditions to attract and retain the best and the brightest into the classrooms to enhance student learning and give our keiki the schools they deserve,\" Corey Rosenlee, the union's president, said Thursday night after the votes were tallied. \n The contract calls for annual pay raises through a combination of pay grade step increases and across-the-board 3.5 percent raises in alternating years. A spokeswoman for Gov. David Ige said the wage increases will cost an estimated $115.4 million. \n Under the contract, a beginning licensed teacher will earn $47,443 at the start of next school year and end up making $53,177 at the end of the contract. Pay for HSTA's most senior teachers \u2014 who will receive $1,500 bonuses in lieu of step movements \u2014 will increase to $91,950 over the life of the contract. \n Under the deal, the state also will increase its share of health insurance premiums. \n Teachers began casting ballots after the school day ended today at 30 polling sites across the state. \n At McKinley High School, where teachers from 32 Honolulu-area schools were assigned to vote, several teachers said they were looking forward to bigger paychecks. \n Social studies teacher Shaun Kamida, who's in his fourth year of teaching at McKinley, said he has to supplement his teacher salary with a second job at a supermarket, where he works most nights until 11:30 p.m. \n \"It's not always about the pay, but pay is important,\" said Kamida, who voted in favor of the contract. \"I'm very grateful that it is a lot better than what was originally offered to us.

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Deputy Kenneth Bryant, who married Asia Childress in Mississippi in 2012, filed suit last week against R. Kelly. \n JACKSON, Miss. >> A Mississippi sheriff's deputy is suing singer R. Kelly, alleging that Kelly had a yearslong affair with his wife that broke up his marriage. \n Deputy Kenneth Bryant, who married Asia Childress in Mississippi in 2012, filed suit last week in a county circuit court in Jackson, the state capital. He's seeking unspecified damages. Bryant's lawsuit includes images of texts he says Childress and Kelly exchanged. \n Representatives of the rhythm and blues crooner, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, didn't immediately return requests for comment today. Kelly hasn't yet responded to the suit. \n Anna Powers, a lawyer for Bryant, said Kelly was served with the suit Saturday when he performed in Jackson. Powers said Bryant, before marrying Childress, knew she previously had a relationship with Kelly. \n \"That was water under the bridge, over and done,\" Powers said. \"Our client loved his wife, wanted to work out his relationship.\" \n But the lawsuit says Childress reconnected with Kelly after attending one of his concerts in October 2012, leading to multiple liaisons over more than four years. \n At one point in their marriage, according to Bryant, Childress persuaded him to move to the Atlanta area, claiming it would improve her career. Bryant said he sacrificed a good job but that his wife really wanted to be closer to Kelly to pursue the affair. Kelly, 50, once lived in Atlanta part-time. \n \"Each time R. Kelly would have a concert in a nearby state, Childress would disappear to unite with her lover,\" the lawsuit states. \"Time after time, R. Kelly cuckolded Bryant, with blatant disregard for Bryant's and Childress' vows.\" \n Powers said that Childress has asked for a divorce, but none has been filed. Childress is a licensed public school teacher in Mississippi, but it's unclear where she now lives and she could not be reached for comment. \n Mississippi is one of only a handful of states that allow spouses to sue others for breaking up their marriages in what are called alienation of affection lawsuits. The others are Hawaii, North Carolina, South Dakota and Utah. \n \"R Kelly's wanton and reckless interference with plaintiff's marriage relationship, his blatant disregard for family values, and his un-condoned and unrelenting adulterous relationship with plaintiff's wife was accompanied by R. Kelly's enticement of Childress to ignore her marriage,\" the suit states. \n Kelly is currently touring to promote his albums \"The Buffet,\" his 16th solo or collaborative release since 1992. His hits include \"I Believe I Can Fly,\" \"Bump N' Grind\" and \"Ignition.\" Kelly's shows and lyrics often focus on sex and infidelity \u2014 such as his Trapped in the Closet series, dealing with a web of sexual deceit. \n The Grammy winner has in the past denied allegations he had sexual relationships with underage girls, although he has settled a number of lawsuits. In 2008, a Chicago jury acquitted Kelly of child pornography charges after he was accused of having sex with an underage girl and videotaping it. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Mississippi man sues R.

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "WARNER BROS. / APRIL 5 \n Oprah Winfrey, left, and Laura Dern appear with host Ellen DeGeneres at a taping of \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" in Burbank, Calif. Twenty years ago Winfrey and Dern guest-starred with DeGeneres in an episode of her comedy series \"Ellen,\" where she declared she was gay. \n NEW YORK >> With a headline of \"Yep, I'm Gay\" on the cover of Time magazine and the same declaration on her sitcom, Ellen DeGeneres made history 20 years ago as the first prime-time lead on network TV to come out, capturing the hearts of supporters gay and straight amid a swirl of hate mail, death threats and, ultimately, dark times on and off the screen. \n The code-named \"The Puppy Episode\" of \"Ellen\" that aired April 30, 1997, was more than just a hit. It was one of those huge cultural \"where were you\" moments for anybody remotely interested in TV, or the advancement of LGBTQ people working in TV, or who were itching to come out of their closets at home at a still-perilous time. \n Variety summed it up this way: \"Climaxing a season of swelling anticipation, Ellen Morgan (the bookstore-managing alter ego of Ellen DeGeneres) finally acknowledges her lesbianism tonight in an 'Ellen' hour that represents television's most-hyped coming out since Little Ricky came out of Lucy 44 years ago.\" \n The hype was real, fed by DeGeneres' personal desire to end her secret-keeping at age 38 and to bring her TV character along for the ride. The off-screen act came first in Time by slightly more than two weeks, but \"Puppy\" was months in the making under lock and key, something that failed to matter when the script leaked and the world then waited. \n Why risk it all? Because DeGeneres, one of America's sweethearts then and now, was done with the lying and the hiding. \n \"It became more important to me than my career,\" she said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"I suddenly said, 'Why am I being, you know, ashamed of who I am just to be successful and famous in society's eyes?'\" \n The hate was also real. There was pulpit-pounding from conservatives, including full-page newspaper ads (the late Rev. Jerry Falwell called her \"Ellen DeGenerate\"). There was nasty mail all around, including some for guest star Oprah Winfrey suggesting that she \"go back to Africa.\" After \"Puppy\" wrapped, cast, crew and live audience were hustled out of the Burbank, California, studio because of a bomb threat. \n Winfrey, who played Ellen's therapist, told the AP she had no clue that \"I would get the worst hate mail of my career.\" She praised DeGeneres for having the courage to produce a \"seminal moment for anybody who was hiding behind anything.\" \n The episode was watched by an estimated 44 million viewers. It won an Emmy for writing, a Peabody as a landmark in broadcasting and numerous other accolades. The attention coincided with a new and very public relationship for DeGeneres with her girlfriend at the time, Anne Heche, herself new to the out life. \n The following season, DeGeneres' fifth, was the last. It was a failure in terms of ratings. The network took to slapping \"adult content\" warnings on the show, something DeGeneres knew nothing about ahead of time. The season was bashed by some as unfunny and \"too gay,\" as was the out-and-proud DeGeneres herself as she lived life big with Heche offscreen. Sponsors fled and the show was canceled. \n DeGeneres went into a \"hole,\" a deep depression, where she stayed without work for more than three years. Laura Dern, among the guest stars on \"Puppy\" and happy to be included, didn't work for a year after she played the out love interest to whom Ellen Morgan finally came out. (Both Dern and Winfrey join DeGeneres on Friday on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" to mark the anniversary). \n Ellen Garcia in San Pedro, California, is a gay, 47-year-old office administrator for a mental health nonprofit. She was 27 and out to just close friends and co-workers when she watched. \n \"How you feel about yourself, and how you feel about how society views you, plays a huge factor and that's why this show was so significant, because it brought all those things out,\" she said. \"It made me feel normal.\" \n So what made it the right time for DeGeneres? Well, nothing, she said. \n \"There was every indication that I should not do it. My publicist at the time said, 'Don't do it.' The studio, the network, everyone said (it),\" she recalled. \"I said, 'You know, look, you may lose a show but you have thousands of other shows revolving through this door that come to you and you'll have another show. This is my career. If I'm willing to lose my career for this, you have to let me do this.'\" \n The doing wasn't easy. The first draft of \"Puppy\" was rejected by the show's Disney point person. It took forever for script approval, with \"Puppy\" finally hitting air as the fourth season's third-to-last show, a full hour as opposed to the usual half-hour. DeGeneres had thrown a bash at her California house for cast members and writers months earlier, at the top of the fourth, declaring then that she wanted to come out, but nobody was sure how it would all play out. \n \"I remember these walks from our offices to the Disney offices to see the big guys,\" recalled Dava Savel, one of the executive producers and writers. \"We walked with her and it was kind of like the Bataan Death March. We were like, 'Ohhh, here we go.' I remember Ellen crying on the way back when Disney finally gave her the OK.\" \n History was made. Friends gathered around TVs. The gay rights advocacy group GLAAD organized watch parties after an ABC affiliate in Alabama declined to air \"Puppy.\" \n DeGeneres herself made a spectacular comeback, eventually, now the host of her own daytime talk show and still America's sweetheart at age 59. (President Barack Obama awarded her the nation's highest civilian honor, the Medal of Freedom, last year.) Numerous gay leads followed on TV, yet advocates hope for still more diversity and accuracy in story and character development. \n None of that mattered the night of April 30, 1997. \n Eric Marcus, creator and host of the podcast \"Making Gay History\" and author of a 2002 collection of oral history of the same name, put it this way: \"For everyday people, Ellen made gay OK.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'Yep, I'm Gay': Happy 20th out anniversary, Ellen"}

Conservatives are worried that right-wing speakers aren't given equal treatment as liberal campus presenters and some students have complained about free expression fanning racial tensions. \n In Madison, home to the University of Wisconsin's flagship campus, students shouted down and traded obscene gestures with ex-Breitbart editor and conservative columnist Ben Shapiro during a presentation in November. This week, supporters of conservative commentator Ann Coulter rallied behind her after the University of California-Berkeley canceled her speech citing concerns that violence could erupt. \n The bill is based on a model proposal the conservative Arizona-based Goldwater Institute put together to address campus free-speech issues. Legislation based on the model has been enacted in Colorado, with others being considered in five states, including Michigan, North Carolina and Virginia, according to the institute. \n The lawmakers sponsoring Wisconsin's bill said it represents Republicans' promise \"to protect the freedom of expression on college campuses.\" \n \"All across the nation and here at home, we've seen protesters trying to silence different viewpoints,\" Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, one of the bill's chief sponsors, said in a news release today. \"Free speech means free speech for everyone and not just for the person who speaks the loudest.\" \n UW-Madison's policy already calls for facilitating free speech equally and objectively, school spokesman John Lucas said. Mandating sanctions eliminates the ability of a disciplinary committee to consider all the circumstances of the situation, he said. \n \"We urge the Legislature to work with the Board of Regents to identify policies that will address the free exchange of ideas and need for order while respecting the existing student conduct process that has served institutions well for many years,\" Lucas said in an email. \n University of Wisconsin System spokeswoman Stephanie Marquis said the system is committed to ensuring freedom of speech at its institutions. \n Scot Ross, executive director of liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, called Vos and the bill's other authors, Reps. Jesse Kremer and Dave Murphy and Sen. Sheila Harsdorf, \"fragile snowflakes.\" \n \"These Republicans want to make our campuses safe spaces for Republicans to be free of criticism and subject students to legal sanctions if they speak out,\" Ross said. \n The legislation would require regents to quickly adopt a policy requiring each campus to remain neutral on current public controversies. It wasn't immediately clear whether the bill would bar chancellors and faculty members from expressing their viewpoints or if university lobbyists' work would be forbidden. \n Vos clarified that portion during a brief interview today, saying he believes chancellors and faculty should be allowed to express their personal opinions but universities shouldn't take sides. He said a description of what qualifies as a university would be part of the process as the bill moves through the Legislature. \n The policy also would have to include a range of disciplinary sanctions for students and faculty who engage in \"violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous, obscene, unreasonably loud, or other disorderly conduct\" that interferes with someone's free speech rights. The bill doesn't define what constitutes any of that behavior. \n Students would be entitled to a disciplinary hearing and appeals. Any student found to have interfered with someone's free expression twice would be suspended for a semester or expelled. And anyone who feels his or her free speech rights have been violated can bring a lawsuit within a year to stop the violation. \n Larry Dupuis, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Wisconsin chapter, said the neutrality provisions are so vague they could prevent universities from promoting tolerance for people and opinions. \n Suspending or expelling hecklers, Dupuis added, is \"unnecessarily draconian.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "GOP bill would discipline hecklers at college speeches"}

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, right, joined by National Economic Director Gary Cohn, speaks in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Among the likely winners in President Donald Trump's tax-cut plan would be a real estate developer turned reality TV star who now happens to occupy the White House. \n The one-page proposal released Wednesday seems sure to benefit the president's businesses. It would eliminate the estate tax, repeal the alternative minimum tax that affects some affluent people, deeply slash corporate rates and reduce investment taxes \u2014 all of which could in theory benefit a billionaire real estate magnate like Trump. \n It's a sensitive subject for a White House that is telling Americans its proposed cuts to individual and corporate tax rates would aid the middle class and fuel stronger economic growth. \n When Trump's spokesman, Sean Spicer, was asked by reporters Thursday whether it was fair to inquire about the benefits that the tax cuts would provide for the president and his family, he sidestepped the question. \n \"I would guess that most Americans would applaud what the president is doing,\" Spicer said. \n Democrats are using the possibility of presidential profits to bash the proposal. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, noted Thursday that the proposal would have lopped more than $30 million off Trump's 2005 income taxes, based on a partial copy of Trump's tax return for that year that was leaked months ago. \n \"His tax outline is a wish-list for billionaires, trickle-down all over again \u2014 and guess who it is trickling all over?\" Pelosi said. \n It's unclear just how much the tax overhaul would help Trump because the proposal still amounts to mainly a series of bullet points \u2014 and because the president has steadfastly refused to release his tax returns despite having promised to do so in the past. \n The refusal to release his tax returns during the campaign broke decades-old precedent, and Trump \"has no intention\" of doing so now, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said. \n \"We should see his tax returns,\" said Frank Clemente, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness in Washington. \"We have no idea what deductions he's taking; whether he's still paying the alternative minimum tax.\" \n Steve Witkoff, a New York-based real estate developer and a friend of Trump, defended the proposed tax changes, arguing that they could foster an environment in which more Americans take the sort of financial risks that create jobs and feed prosperity. \n Witkoff said Trump's major goal was to drive a stronger economy, not enhance his own financial standing. \n \"I think this president ought to be commended for standing on the soap box and saying, 'I don't accept that we're going to have mediocre growth,'\" Witkoff said, adding that the president had \"too much money to really care about benefiting himself.\" \n Here's a breakdown of four major changes to the tax code that could possibly reduce the president's taxes: \n ESTATE TAX \n Under current tax rules, your heirs must pay 40 percent in taxes on any assets they inherit in excess of $5.49 million ($10.98 million for married couples). Trump says he is worth $10 billion or so. As a result, eliminating the inheritance tax could possibly produce an enormous windfall for his heirs. \n PASS-THROUGHS \n Much of Trump's income from his various businesses are taxed as \"pass-through\" corporations, a category that requires owners under current rules to pay individual tax rates as high as 39.6 percent. That would change under Trump's proposed plan. Owners of \"pass-throughs\" would be taxed at the new, much lower corporate rate of 15 percent. \n The administration says it would ensure that wealthier Americans wouldn't exploit the lower pass-through rate, but it provided no details on how that would do so. \n If the rules work in Trump's favor, he could receive more than half off on the \"pass through\" portion of his tax bill. \n AMT \n The plan calls for the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, which raises the federal tax bill of wealthy Americans like Trump who would otherwise capitalize on special tax breaks to pay far less. The benefit to Trump could run as high as tens of millions of dollars a year. According to recently leaked Trump documents from 2005 cited by Pelosi, Trump paid $36.5 million in federal taxes that year because of the AMT. Without it, he would have owed just $5.5 million. \n INVESTMENT TAX \n One of the sources for funding in President Barack Obama's health insurance law is a 3.8 percent net investment income tax that applies to capital gains and rental and royalty income, among other sources. \n Trump would eliminate this tax in hopes of improving growth, but it would probably also reduce his tax bill. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tax plan stands to benefit the man in the White House"}

Inspired by visits to the city's priciest hotels, the posh public bathroom cost nearly $300,000 and comes complete with freshly delivered flowers, imported tiles, classical music and artwork. \n NEW YORK >> In a park amid skyscrapers, a gem has emerged: a posh public bathroom that cost nearly $300,000, complete with freshly delivered flowers, imported tiles, classical music and artwork. \n The free-of-charge, air-conditioned splendor, inspired by visits to the city's priciest hotels, is open to everyone. More than 1 million people a year are expected to use the facility, park officials said. \n On Thursday, two bathroom attendants held toilet tissue that a park official cut as the inaugural ribbon for the high-tech facility housed in a landmarked Beaux Arts building behind the New York Public Library in Manhattan. The toilets, in 310 square feet divided between the women's and men's sides, are reopening after a three-month renovation. \n The eye-popping, LED-illuminated elegance is unusual in a city where public toilets are scarce and generally grungy. \n \"It's very clean, and the flowers are alive,\" said Irena Marentic, a tourist from Slovenia, as she left the space, whose walls and floors are lined with tiles from Spain and Italy and adorned with art created by Bryant Park's painters-in-residence. \n The women's side has three toilet stalls, while the men's side has two stalls and three urinals, the same number as before the renovation. The facility can't be expanded because the space surrounding it is considered a scenic landmark. \n The public luxury was funded privately by the Bryant Park Corp., a not-for-profit that manages the city-owned park and works to improve business in the neighborhood, which includes Fifth Avenue. \n \"We strive for perfection and only settle for excellence,\" declared Dan Biederman, the executive director of the Bryant Park Corp. \n The team behind the new posh public bathroom visited the Waldorf Astoria and other luxury hotels for inspiration. \n A few out-of-town companies provided donations not included in the facility's $280,000 cost. The Japanese luxury brand Toto contributed self-flushing, energy-saving toilets and hands-free faucets and wash basins. Brill Hygienic Products Inc., of Delray Beach, Florida, supplied sanitary, electronic seat covers that rotate with each use. \n Attendants with mops keep everything clean from 7 a.m. until midnight during the warm months and until 10 p.m. the rest of the year. By park rules, no tips are allowed. \n The bathroom is most often used by visitors to the leafy, grassy refuge of Bryant Park, which draws them with its seasonal attractions including a skating rink in winter, holiday shops, outdoor movies on summer nights and tables and chairs. \n The park went through a makeover some years ago after decades of urban decay and crime that spilled into the bathroom, which was closed for years and reopened only in the 1990s. \n With the improvement of the park, the number of visitors has increased.

The incidents are just the latest targeting the president's gold glass tower just off the Las Vegas Strip. \n LAS VEGAS >> Anti-war demonstrators wanted attention Thursday when they moved their protest after several days from a remote U.S. Air Force base to the foot of the Trump International Hotel just off the Las Vegas Strip. \n They nearly got more than they bargained for, after a man was accused of trying to set fire to the 64-story property less than a day earlier. \n But no one \u2014 the U.S. Secret Service, police or protest organizers \u2014 said they knew of any link between the demonstrations against drone warfare and a 28-year man now facing arson charges after telling police in colorfully profane language that he just wanted to create mischief. \n Police said the man used towels and toasters to ignite fires that were quickly doused in two places: a pool deck restroom and a 17th floor hallway. \n \"He didn't say anything about the President,\" said police Capt. John Pelletier, patrol commander of an area including the Trump hotel and the glittery casino and entertainment corridor. \n The fire and the peaceful rally marked the latest incidents to unfold around a gold glass tower that is becoming a lightning rod for rallies due to the name on the top. \n \"We're here because we want to say to the president, 'No bombs.

The proposal unveiled Wednesday would also repeal several taxes that target the wealthy but eliminate many deductions they use. Democratic lawmakers say the plan would favor the wealthy and blow a deep hole in the federal budget. \n An independent estimate by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates federal revenue would plunge $5.5 trillion over a decade under the Trump plan, likely causing the deficit to balloon. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has suggested faster economic growth of 3 percent or more would replace the lost tax revenue, a position most budget experts dispute. \n The administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss private deliberations, suggested Thursday that the White House might also find a way to work around a Senate rule that requires a 60-vote majority to pass bills that increase the deficit over the longer term. Under the rule, measures passed by a simple majority that increase the deficit expire in a 10-year window. \n The official indicated that the administration might not necessarily need to follow a 10-year window, noting that budget forecasts are often inaccurate. It was unclear how the suggested maneuver would overcome Senate procedure. \n Republicans currently hold a 52-seat majority in the Senate, leaving them in need of support from at least eight Democrats under the rule. \n On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he planned to pass a tax overhaul without Democratic support, but only if it didn't add to long-term deficits. \n \"Regretfully we don't expect to have any Democratic involvement in\" a tax overhaul, McConnell said. \"So we'll have to reach an agreement among ourselves.\" \n The Trump tax outline would reduce the top corporate tax rate by 20 percentage points, to 15 percent, and enable private business owners to claim the new lower rate for their incomes. The number of tax brackets for individuals would be reduced from seven to three, with the top tax rate lowered from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. It would roughly double the standard amount taxpayers could deduct. \n The measure would eliminate the estate tax and reduce taxes on investments primarily paid by the wealthy. It would further reduce the tax burden for the rich by eliminating the alternative minimum tax, which ensures the high-income can't get away with paying little to no taxes. \n Senate Democrats quickly came out against the proposal. \n \"This scheme is a massive tax giveaway to millionaires, billionaires and big corporations at the expense of middle-class families,\" said Sen.

Coulter had said she was forced to cancel a speaking engagement at the school. University officials said they had been unable to find a suitable and safe spot for her to speak, and offered a May 2 date. \n She did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press, but she told Fox News's Tucker Carlson after the event that she wasn't going to say anything more inflammatory than calling for enforcement of immigration laws. \n \"Well, my seditious and hateful speech, the theme of it, obviously, it was going to be a searingly brilliant speech on immigration,\" she said. \n Thursday's tensions were another example of how Berkeley has emerged as a flashpoint for extreme left and right forces amid the debate over free speech in a place where the 1960s U.S. free speech movement began before spreading to college campuses across the nation. \n Berkeley student Joseph Pagadara, 19, said he had worried about violence and added that the university is caught in the middle of the country's political divide. \n \"Both sides are so intolerant of each other. We are a divided country. We need to listen to each other but we're each caught in our own bubbles,\" he said. \n As for Coulter, Pagadara said the university should have let her speak. \"Now she's making herself look like the victim and Berkeley like the bad guys,\" he said. \n University police erected barricades and refused to let any protesters enter the campus. Six people were arrested; one for obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police, and another for possessing a knife. \n Several hundred people gathered for the afternoon event supporting Coulter at Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park in downtown Berkeley. \n \"It's a shame that someone can't speak in the home of the free speech movement,\" said Wilson Grafstrom, an 18-year-old high school student from Menlo Park. \n He wore a military grade helmet with a \"Make America Great Again\" sticker across the back, goggles, a gas mask and knee pads. He blamed people opposed to Coulter and President Donald Trump for forcing him to gear up for problems. \n Many at the park about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the university's main Sproul Plaza also wore such helmets and body armor. Some had \"Build That Wall\" or Trump stickers across their headgear. One man had duct tape reading \"Berkeley\" over his mouth. \n While the afternoon rally ended without serious conflict, police at one point formed a human wall in the street separating anti-Trump protesters from the park where pro-Trump groups were gathered. \n Anti-Coulter protesters at the park held a banner that read: \"It's not about 'free speech,' it's about bigots trying to normalize hate.\" \n Earlier, dozens of police wearing flak jackets and carrying 40 mm launchers that shoot \"foam batons\" flanked Sproul Plaza while a small group of protesters condemning Coulter staged a rally outside campus. \n Officers took selfies with students in an attempt to lighten the mood. \n Gavin McInnes, co-founder of Vice Media and founder of the pro-Trump \"Proud Boys,\" spoke at the park gathering later in the day. He said America doesn't have an obligation to take people from other countries. \n \"We are here because Ann Coulter got canceled,\" he said. \"She is one of the most inspiring writers in America today. She is an American hero.\" \n On its Facebook page, the group calls itself a fraternal organization aimed at \"reinstating a spirit of Western chauvinism during an age of globalism and multiculturalism.\" \n University officials said they feared violence on campus if Coulter spoke, citing \"very specific intelligence\" of threats that could endanger her and students. In a letter to the campus Wednesday, Chancellor Nicholas B. Dirks said the university is committed to defending free speech but also to protecting its students. \n \"This is a university, not a battlefield,\" Dirks wrote. \n Earlier this month, a bloody brawl broke out in downtown Berkeley at a pro-Trump protest that featured speeches by members of the white nationalist right. They clashed with a group of Trump critics who called themselves anti-fascists. \n In February, violent protesters forced the cancellation of a speech by right-wing writer Milo Yiannopoulos, who like Coulter was invited by campus Republicans. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Berkeley protests peaceful as hundreds rally over Coulter"}

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Labor secretary-designate Alexander Acosta testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington. The Senate confirmed Acosta as President Donald Trump's secretary of labor. \n WASHINGTON >> The Senate today confirmed Alex Acosta as secretary of labor, filling out President Donald Trump's cabinet as he approaches his 100th day in office. \n The 60-38 vote confirms Acosta to the post. Once sworn as the nation's 27th secretary of labor, the son of Cuban immigrants will lead an a sprawling agency that enforces more than 180 federal laws covering about 10 million employers and 125 million workers. \n Acosta has been a federal prosecutor, a civil rights chief at the Justice Department and a member of the National Labor Relations Board. He will arrive at the top post with relatively little clear record on some of the top issues facing the administration over key pocketbook issues, such as whether to expand the pool of American workers eligible for overtime pay. \n Acosta wasn't Trump's first choice for the job. Former fast food CEO Andrew Puzder withdrew his name from consideration last month, on the eve of his confirmation vote, after becoming a political headache for the new administration. \n Puzder acknowledged having hired a housekeeper not authorized to work in the U.S. and paying the related taxes years later \u2014 after Trump nominated him \u2014 and came under fire from Democrats for other issues related to his company and his private life. \n Acosta's ascension would come at a key moment for Trump, just two days before he reaches the symbolic, 100-day mile marker. The White House has sought to cross the threshold with its own list of Trump's accomplishments. \n Labor secretary is the last Cabinet post for Trump to fill. Trump's choice for U.S. trade representative, a job considered Cabinet-level, is awaiting a Senate vote. \n From the beginning, Acosta's was a quiet march to confirmation that stood out because it didn't attract the deep partisan battles faced by some of Trump's other nominees, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Justice Neil Gorsuch's nomination provoked such a fight that majority Senate Republicans used the \"nuclear option\" to remove the 60-vote filibuster barrier for Supreme Court picks. \n Thursday's vote marks the fourth time Acosta has been confirmed for the Senate. \n Democrats and most labor groups were mostly muted in their response to Acosta's nomination. At his confirmation hearing, Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington State and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts hammered Acosta for answers on a selection of issues important to labor and whether Acosta would cave to political pressure from Trump. Acosta refused to answer the policy questions until he's confirmed, and he vowed to be an independent and fair voice for workers. Both senators said they had great concerns, and both were expected to vote no. \n Our standard can't be 'not Puzder,'\" Murray said Wednesday on the Senate floor. \n But tellingly, even as Acosta's nomination wound through the Senate, Democrats and their allies also tried to move on to other, labor-related issues \u2014 namely, a minimum wage hike to $15 an hour, which Trump opposes. \n Meanwhile, the Labor Department's landing page bears a glimpse of Acosta's policy priorities: \"Buy American, Hire American.\" \n That's the title of Trump's executive order this week directing the secretaries of labor and other agencies to issue guidance within 60 days on policies that would \"ensure that, to the extent permitted by law\" federal aid \"maximize the use of materials produced in the United States, including manufactured products; components of manufactured products; and materials such as steel, iron, aluminum, and cement.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Senate confirms Alex Acosta as Trump's secretary of labor"}

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n YouTube's inability to keep ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google's digital family into a problem child. The key question is whether a recently launched ad boycott of YouTube turns out to be short-lived or the start of a long-term marketing shift away that undercuts Google's growth, as well as Alphabet Inc., its corporate parent. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> YouTube's inability to keep big-brand ads off unsavory videos is threatening to transform a rising star in Google's digital family into a problem child. \n It's not yet clear whether a recent ad boycott of YouTube will be short-lived or the start of a long-term shift away from the video service \u2014 one that could undercut Google's growth and that of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. \n Alphabet's first-quarter results, released Thursday, provided few clues. Major advertisers didn't start pulling their money from YouTube until the three-month period was nearly over. \n The company's earnings rose 29 percent to $5.4 billion while revenue climbed 22 percent to $24.8 billion. Shares surged nearly 5 percent, to $933, in Thursday's extended trading. \n CLOUD OVER YOUTUBE \n But the fallout from the YouTube boycott is likely to be felt through the rest of this year. Skittish advertisers have curtailed their spending until they are convinced Google can prevent their brands from appearing next to extremist clips promoting hate and violence. \n \"There is no entity in the world that is more risk averse than a senior marketing person,\" says Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University in New York. \"They don't want to go with a media choice that presents problems for a brand, and they don't have to because they have many other choices.\" \n Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts during a Thursday review of the first quarter that the company has had \"thousands and thousands\" of conversations with advertisers as YouTube takes steps to protect their brands. \"We are evolving overall to a better place,\" Pichai said. \n At another point, he assured analysts that YouTube is still experiencing \"extraordinary\" growth without providing specifics. \n Even if YouTube continues to lose advertisers, it won't leave a huge dent in Alphabet's earnings. That's because marketers are expected to keep feeding the company's golden goose \u2014 Google's dominant search engine. Ads appearing alongside the billions of search results Google churns out each day still generate most of Alphabet's revenue even as it expands into other fields. \n But ad spending has been accelerating at a rapid pace on YouTube over the past two years as brands sought to connect with its audience of more than 1 billion people. Now it looks like things might taper off. \n TAKING THE GLOSS OFF \n Before the boycott began, YouTube's ad revenue after subtracting commissions was expected to rise 26 percent this year to $7 billion, based on estimates from the research firm eMarketer. Alphabet doesn't disclose YouTube's finances. \n Advertisers began to flee YouTube last month, after The Times in London and other media outlets turned up evidence that their brands were appearing alongside clips promoting terrorism and racism. \n The findings alerted advertisers that YouTube didn't have adequate technology or staffing to shield brands from some of the appalling material that gets posted on a site that receives 400 hours of video per minute. \n \"This is an ostrich situation where the ostrich just pulled its head out of the sand,\" says Harry Kargman, CEO of Kargo, which helps manage ad campaigns on mobile devices. \n FLIGHT OF THE BRANDS \n At one point, about 250 advertisers were boycotting YouTube. (Some also stepped back from a related system that Google operates to place commercials next to videos on outside websites.) The list included big-spending marketers such as PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores, Starbucks, AT&T, Verizon, Johnson & Johnson, and Volkswagen. \n It's unclear how many, if any, of those have returned to YouTube since Google promised to hire more human reviewers and upgrade its technology to keep ads away from repugnant videos. \n Both Verizon and AT&T, two companies that are trying to expand their own digital ad networks to compete with Google, told The Associated Press that they are still boycotting YouTube. FX Networks confirmed that it isn't advertising on YouTube either. Several other boycotting marketers contacted by AP didn't respond. \n TEMPORARY HIT OR PERMANENT SCAR? \n Even if advertisers return, Kargman predicted they are unlikely to spend as much as they once did. \"It's going to be a slow burn as brands quietly shift their spending away,\" he said. \"There are now questions about the quality of video on YouTube in the long term.\" \n Investors, however, apparently aren't too worried so far. YouTube's financial contributions remain a fairly small part of a company expected to generate $87 billion in revenue this year, after subtracting ad commissions. \n RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates the reduced spending on YouTube and Google's ad network for video on third-party sites could reduce Alphabet's net revenue by $300 million, to $1.5 billion, this year. \n Some of that spending could shift to Facebook, Mahaney said, although the social network is facing its own challenges trying to block live videos of violence that appall viewers and advertisers alike. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "YouTube ad boycott could spell trouble for Alphabet's Google"}

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n German scientist Andreas Beck takes notes in Robert Island, in the South Shetland Islands archipelago, Antarctica. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> New climate-change findings mean the Pacific Ocean off California may rise higher, and storms and high tides hit harder, than previously thought, officials said. \n The state's Ocean Protection Council on Wednesday revised upward its predictions for how much water off California will rise as the climate warms. The forecast helps agencies in the nation's most populous state plan for climate change as rising water seeps toward low-lying airports, highways and communities, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area. \n Discoveries that ice sheets are melting increasingly fast in Antarctica, which holds nearly 90 percent of the world's ice, largely spurred the change. \n As fossil-fuel emissions warm the Earth's atmosphere, melting Antarctic ice is expected to raise the water off California's 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) of coastline even more than for the world as a whole. \n \"Emerging science is showing us a lot more than even five years ago,\" council deputy director Jenn Eckerle said Thursday. \n Gov. Jerry Brown has mandated that state agencies take climate change into account in planning and budgeting. The council's projections will guide everything from local decisions on zoning to state action on whether to elevate or abandon buildings near the coast and bays. \n In the best-case scenario, waters in the vulnerable San Francisco Bay, for example, likely would rise between 1 foot and 2.4 feet (one-third to three-fourths of a meter) by the end of this century, the ocean council said. \n However, that's only if the world cracks down on climate-changing fossil-fuel emissions far more than it is now. \n The worst-case scenario entails an even faster melting of Antarctic ice, which could raise ocean levels off California a devastating 10 feet by the end of this century, the state says. That's at least 30 times faster than the rate over the last 100 years. \n Scientists say rising water from climate change already is playing a role in extreme winters such as this past one in California, contributing to flooding of some highways and helping crumble cliffs beneath some oceanfront homes. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "California says oceans could rise higher than thought"}

Officials there were found to have manipulated appointment data and engaged in other schemes in attempt to cover up the backlog. \n Trump also joined veterans' groups in calling on the Senate to pass a pending accountability measure. \n The House has already passed a bill to make it make it easier for the VA to fire, suspend or demote employees for poor performance or bad conduct, but Senate continues to work on its version of the legislation. Shulkin said Trump's decision to create the office even before Congress sends him a bill speaks to his commitment to accountability at the VA. \n \"He's asking through his executive order for VA to do everything that it can internally,\" Shulkin said Wednesday at a White House briefing. \"But we know that that's not going to be enough to get done what I want to get done, which is to be able to, once we identify people that need to leave the organization, to get them out quickly. So I do need legislative help as well.\" \n The VA said it will have an executive director for the accountability office by mid-June. The director will help identify ways the VA secretary can discipline or terminate a VA manager or employee as well as reward top performers. The VA has often complained it can't discipline or remove employees due to a lengthy union grievance process. \n Shulkin also announced additional steps Thursday to improve VA care and to reduce waste, fraud and abuse at the department through a task force made up of private-sector and government groups. \n The VA also plans to partner with the Department of Health and Human Services to allow medical professionals from the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps to help provide care to veterans at VA facilities in underserved areas. Shulkin has said that his reform effort includes building a more \"integrated\" model of VA care that uses private doctors and doctors from other federal agencies. \n The VA will also exempt state-owned veteran nursing homes from federal requirements to remove red tape and offer veterans more services, Shulkin said. \n Meanwhile, veterans' groups want the Senate to act soon to send the accountability legislation to Trump for his signature. \n \"The longer the Senate waits, the longer veterans will suffer,\" said Mark Lucas, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America. \n The new VA office will also investigate reports of retaliation against VA employees who expose illegal or unethical conduct, Shulkin said, adding that \"we will take actions\" if it is determined that an employee whistleblower has been subjected to retaliation for coming forward. \n No new hiring will be done for the office. Existing VA employees will be transferred there, despite department-wide employee shortages and a decision to leave thousands of VA positions unfilled. Shulkin said he didn't have dollar figures for how much the office would cost, but said it will require a \"substantial commitment.\" \n The executive order is one of several Trump is signing this week as he seeks to score accomplishments before Saturday, his symbolic 100th day in office. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump signs order creating accountability office at VA"}

At stake may be the president's credibility over whether and how he will deliver on his campaign vow to undo decades of American trade policy and restore millions of manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition. \n The latest puzzler broke out Wednesday over the prospect that the Trump administration would simply abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement rather than start to renegotiate it. The White House leaked that possibility to reporters, rattling investors and drawing protests from business groups and Republican lawmakers. \n Yet hours later, Trump called it all off. He would actually seek to revamp the trade pact with Canada and Mexico, he said, and pull out of NAFTA only if he couldn't secure a favorable deal. \n The U-turn followed a reversal on his trade stance on China. Trump this month broke a campaign promise to label China a \"currency manipulator.\" He had decided, he said, to instead reward Beijing for helping deal with a belligerent North Korea. Nor has he followed up on vows to punish American companies that move jobs overseas or on threats to tax Chinese and Mexican imports. \n \"Unquestionably, he's not delivered on his campaign promises,\" says Lori Wallach, a critic of NAFTA and other trade deals and director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch. \n The president's gyrations over NAFTA have been especially puzzling. On the campaign trail, Trump called the trade deal a job-killing \"disaster\" that had encouraged U.S. companies to move factories to Mexico to take advantage of cheap labor. If he couldn't get Canada and Mexico to make concessions, he said, he'd pull America out of the deal. \n Then, in March, the administration sent a draft letter to Congress spelling out plans to renegotiate NAFTA. The plan kept much of the existing agreement intact. Many critics of NAFTA said they were deeply disappointed. \n So it came as a surprise Wednesday when word leaked that Trump was again taking a harsh stance: Aides said the president was considering a draft executive order to pull out of NAFTA within days. The Mexican peso fell against the U.S. dollar. American farm groups, which credit NAFTA with lifting U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico, howled. \n \"Mr. President, America's corn farmers helped elect you,\" Wesley Spurlock, president of the National Corn Growers Association, said in a statement. \n Spurlock added: \"NAFTA has been a huge win for American agriculture \u2026 losing access to these markets will be a huge blow.\" \n Many businesses complain that pulling out of NAFTA would disrupt the cross-border supply chain companies have built since the agreement took effect 23 years ago. \n \"The whole NAFTA structure is interwoven in our economy in a very close and important way,\" said Josh Bolten, former chief of staff for President George W. Bush and now head of the Business Roundtable, a trade association for CEOs. \"Many of America's biggest, most successful businesses are highly dependent on North American supply chains and their goods may cross one or the other borders several times during the production process.\" \n Republican lawmakers, who have typically supported free trade, weighed in, too. \"Withdrawing from #NAFTA would be a disaster for #Arizona jobs & economy,\" tweeted Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. \"POTUS shouldn't abandon this vital trade agreement.\" \n Then Trump announced that the leaders of Mexico and Canada had reached out to him Wednesday and that he would bow to their request to try to fix NAFTA through negotiations before abandoning it. \n \"I decided, rather than terminating NAFTA, which would be a pretty big, you know, shock to the system, we will renegotiate,\" Trump said. \"Now, if I'm unable to make a fair deal, if I'm unable to make a fair deal for the United States, meaning a fair deal for our workers and our companies, I will terminate NAFTA. But we're going to give renegotiation a good, strong shot.\" \n Some trade policy analysts say the confusion reflects divisions within the administration between those who support Trump's tough campaign rhetoric on trade and those who take a more traditional Republican view favoring trade agreements. \n \"It likely reflects certain staff and structural problems in the White House, which are worsened by the ideological cash between competing factions,\" says Eric Shimp, a former U.S. diplomat and adviser on trade at the law firm Alston & Bird. \n Alternatively, aides could have been trying to rack up a tough-sounding accomplishment before Trump's 100th day on the job. \n Others see the threat to withdraw from the agreement as an attempt to jar Canada and Mexico into coming to the bargaining table ready to make concessions. Shimp notes, though, that they'd already said they were willing to negotiate changes to NAFTA. \n Clyde Prestowitz, a U.S. trade official in the Reagan administration who supports a tougher U.S. trade policy, says Trump's modestly worded draft proposal for NAFTA in March probably suggests how negotiations will end: \n \"In the end, there will be some minor changes to NAFTA and victory will be declared.\" \n \"Trump has talked tougher than other presidents, but so far his actions are completely consistent with what they did,\" Prestowitz says. \"Talking about it is much easier than actually doing it.\" \n Then again, the administration has just slapped tariffs on Canadian softwood timber imports and launched investigations into whether steel and aluminum imports jeopardize U.S. national security. \n And Congress has yet to approve Trump's nominee for U.S. trade representative: Robert Lighthizer, who has advocated using existing trade law more aggressively to combat unfair trading practices. \n \"While the president clearly has failed to deliver on his 100-day promises, the longer story is unwritten,\" Wallach says. \"It could go either way.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's gyrations on NAFTA cause a flurry of head-scratching"}

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump listened as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin spoke at the Treasury Department, April 21, in Washington. Trump is once again taking aim at a federal appeals court district that covers Western states, including Hawaii, saying he is considering breaking up a circuit that is a longtime target of Republicans and is where his first travel ban was halted. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump is once again taking aim at a federal appeals court district that covers Western states, including Hawaii, saying he is considering breaking up a circuit that is a longtime target of Republicans and is where his first travel ban was halted. \n Yet it would take congressional action to break up the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Republicans have introduced bills this year to do just that. \n Asked Wednesday during a White House interview by the Washington Examiner if he'd thought about proposals to break up the court, Trump replied, \"Absolutely, I have.\" \n \"There are many people that want to break up the 9th Circuit. It's outrageous,\" he told the Examiner. He accused critics of appealing to the 9th \"because they know that's like, semi-automatic.\" \n The comments echoed his Twitter criticism of the court Wednesday morning. \n Democratic Congressmen John Conyers, Jr. of Michigan and Jerrold Nadler of New York, members of the House Judiciary Committee, responded in a statement today that Trump would \"rather attack the judiciary than defend his inhumane and unconstitutional executive orders.\" \n \"The Muslim ban is unconstitutional, the so-called 'sanctuary cities' order is unlawful, and the path forward on these issues does not involve recycling a tired proposal to dismantle the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,\" the congressmen said. \n Trump called U.S. District Judge William Orrick's preliminary injunction against his order stripping money from so-called sanctuary cities \"ridiculous\" on Twitter. He said he planned to take that case to the Supreme Court. However, an administration appeal of the district court's decision must go first to the 9th Circuit. \n Republicans have talked for years about splitting the circuit into two appellate courts, but earlier legislative proposals have failed, most recently in 2005. Those battles have often pitted lawmakers from California against members from smaller, more conservative states. \n Critics say the court has a liberal slant, a high caseload and distances that are too far for judges to travel. The circuit is the largest of the federal appellate courts, representing 20 percent of the U.S. population. It includes California, Alaska, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. \n The circuit has 29 judicial positions, many more than the 5th, which is the next largest circuit with 17. The 9th Circuit was created in 1891 when the American West was much less populated. \n Democrats have opposed the split. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California was a leading opponent in the 2005 push, which she said was politically motivated. She has suggested adding judges to the court instead. \n In March, 9th Circuit judges appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents told lawmakers that breaking up the court was a bad idea. \n The 9th Circuit in February refused to immediately reinstate Trump's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, prompting the administration to release a new, narrower ban. That also has been held up by the courts. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump mulls breaking up 9th Circuit Court"}

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Rick McVey, owner of Dilly Lily. If the Trump administration's plan to lower tax rates becomes law, it will likely benefit McVey. The florist has a range of possibilities, not just from the prospect of lower taxes, but that he'd get more business from customers who have more money to spend. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump's plan to overhaul the nation's tax code could provide significant tax cuts for the working-class voters who elected him, but the unknowns could end up hurting many of these core supporters of the president. \n A look at how Trump's tax plan could affect families at different income levels: \n THE WORKING CLASS \n These are the people who have been left behind by an increasingly globalized economy. \n Trump's proposal, a one-page proposal short on detail, says he would double the standard tax deduction, which could provide significant relief to working-class families. But Trump's top economic adviser used some bad math to describe the proposal, raising questions. \n Gary Cohn said the standard deduction for a married couple would be doubled to $24,000. But that's not double. The standard deduction for a married couple is $12,700, so double would be $25,400. \n Cohn said the deduction would create \"a zero tax-rate for the first $24,000.\" \n That sounds great, but very few families making $24,000 a year pay federal income tax, said Roberton Williams, a fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. In fact, 44 percent of all U.S. households pay no federal income tax, though most pay other taxes. \n Trump's one-page sketch is silent on whether the tax code would still include the personal tax exemption, which allows most married couples to exempt $8,100 in income. \n During the campaign, Trump released a tax proposal that would eliminate the personal exemption. \n Also during the campaign, Trump proposed getting rid of the \"head of household\" filing status, which is mainly used by single parents. This filing status provides a lower tax rate and a higher standard deduction than filing as a single person. \n Trump's new plan is silent on this issue as well. \n THE MIDDLE CLASS \n The median household income in the U.S. is about $55,000, though people living in high-cost areas can make much more than that and still feel like they are in the middle class. \n Doubling the standard deduction \u2014 or at least raising it to $24,000 \u2014 could provide significant tax relief to middle-income families. But whether they pay more or less depends largely on details that have yet to be released. \n One of those pesky details is how will Trump structure the tax rates on individual income. \n Trump has proposed reducing the number of tax rates from seven to three \u2014 10 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. But the administration has yet to determine the income levels for people who would be put in each bracket. \n HIGH-INCOME FAMILIES \n Trump's plan has the potential to provide big tax cuts to high-income families \u2014 unless you live in a state with high state and local taxes. \n Trump calls for eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax, which was enacted in 1969 to prevent high-income people from paying no income tax. It has evolved over the years and now impacts about 5 million households, most of them making between $200,000 and $1 million a year. \n In 2005, Trump himself paid $36.5 million in taxes, mostly because of the AMT. Without it, he would have paid just $5.5 million, according to a leaked copy of that year's return. \n On the flip side, Trump wants to eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes, a big tax break that benefits millions, especially people living in Democratic-controlled states with high local taxes such as New York, New Jersey and California. \n Last year, more than 43 million families claimed the deduction, saving them nearly $70 billion. \n THE SUPER RICH \n These are the 1 percenters, people like Trump who make millions a year and are worth even more. Trump is proposing big tax cuts for the superrich, including repealing the estate tax. \n The federal estate tax is widely misunderstood. The fact is it affects very few estates. \n If you're parents' estate is worth less than $10.9 million, you don't have to worry about this tax. This year, about 5,200 estates will pay the tax, according to the Tax Policy Center. \n Trump also wants to reduce the top income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. But perhaps the biggest windfall for rich people could come from Trump's plan to lower the top tax rate for small business owners from 39.6 percent to 15 percent. \n Rich people, including Trump, tend to report a lot of business income, Williams said. \n But the true effect of this tax will depend on how the Trump administration defines a small business owner. If the tax cut applies to all business income reported on individual tax returns, it would be a huge windfall for many rich families. \n Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Trump will propose safeguards that would prevent rich people from taking advantage of the tax cut, but he provided no details on how that would work. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump tax plan: Relief for his voters but lots of unknowns"}

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n David Dao, who was dragged off a United Airlines flight, settled with the airlines for an undisclosed amount. \n CHICAGO >> The passenger who was dragged off a flight after refusing to give up his seat settled with United for an undisclosed sum today in an apparent attempt by the airline to put the fiasco behind it as quickly as possible. \n David Dao's legal team said the agreement includes a provision that the amount will remain confidential. One his lawyers praised United CEO Oscar Munoz. \n Munoz \"said he was going to do the right thing, and he has,\" attorney Thomas Demetrio said in a brief statement . \"In addition, United has taken full responsibility for what happened \u2026 without attempting to blame others, including the city of Chicago.\" \n The deal came less than three weeks after the episode and before Dao had even sued. The deal means United will not face a lawsuit, which could have been costly, both in legal bills and in further damage to the airline's reputation. \n Keeping settlement amounts secret is standard practice, including because companies often don't want others contemplating lawsuits or negotiating deals over separate grievances to know how much they've been willing to pay previously. \n Several legal observers unconnected to Dao's case said a payout to him of a few million dollars was possible. Chicago-based attorney Terry Sullivan said United executives may have been willing to pay as much as $5 million to make this particular case go away. \"United just couldn't afford any more bad publicity on this,\" he said. \n United issued a brief statement Thursday, saying it was pleased to report \"an amicable resolution of the unfortunate incident that occurred aboard Flight 3411.\" \n The dragging was one of several recent embarrassments for United. \n The airline was criticized in March after a gate agent stopped two teenage girls from boarding a flight because they were wearing leggings \u2014 an apparent violation of a dress code for passengers traveling in a program for employees and their dependents. Then a giant showcase rabbit died this week after it was shipped across the Atlantic on a United flight from London's Heathrow Airport to O'Hare. \n Cellphone video of the April 9 confrontation aboard a jetliner at Chicago's O'Hare Airport sparked widespread public outrage over the way Dao was treated. \n The footage showed airport police officers pulling the 69-year-old Kentucky physician from his seat and dragging him down the aisle. His lawyer said he lost teeth and suffered a broken nose and a concussion. \n In a phone interview with The Associated Press, Demetrio said the settlement also averts any lawsuit against Chicago officials. The airport police officers who pulled Dao off the jet work for the city. \n \"I praise Mr. Munoz and his people for not trying to throw the city under the bus or pass the buck,\" Demetrio said. \"He stood in front of the world and has stated that, 'We, United, take full responsibility.'\" \n Demetrio said it was \"unheard of\" for a company to admit responsibility so quickly and completely. \n \"I hope corporate America notices when you goof up, people respect you a heck of a lot more when you admit it, instead of making people go through three years of depositions, motions, court hearings.\" \n He said Dao was also impressed that \"United stepped up to the plate.\" \n The incident arose from a common air travel issue \u2014 a fully booked flight. Wanting to seat four crew members, the airline offered passengers $400 and later $800 to voluntarily relinquish their seats. When no one did, United selected four passengers at random. \n Three people got off the flight, but Dao refused, saying he needed to get home to treat patients the next day. The airline then summoned the officers, who forcibly removed Dao. \n The dragging was a major public-relations crisis for United. The company's response in the immediate aftermath was widely criticized. Munoz first defended the airline and described Dao as \"belligerent\" before publicly apologizing days later and vowing to do better. \n The three airport police officers who took Dao off the plane were placed on leave from the Chicago Department of Aviation. \n The agency released a report Monday in which the officer who pulled Dao from his seat, James Long, gave his version of events. Long said Dao was verbally and physically abusive and was flailing his arms before he lost his balance and struck his mouth on an armrest. \n The department's roughly 300 officers guard the city's two main airports but are not part of the regular Chicago police force. They receive less training and cannot carry guns inside the terminals. \n Also Thursday, the airline released a report detailing mistakes that led to the incident. United said it would raise to $10,000 the limit on the payments it offers to customers who give up seats on oversold flights and increase training for airline employees. \n The airline has vowed to reduce, but not eliminate, overbooking. \n United representatives have not said whether ticket sales have dropped since Dao was removed from the jet. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Passenger who was dragged off jetliner settles with United"}

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump spoke in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, today, during a meeting with Argentine President Mauricio Macri. \n WASHINGTON >> Senate Democrats late today blocked a quick vote on a short-term spending bill to keep the government open, roiling Washington with brinkmanship less than 30 hours before a midnight Friday deadline for a shutdown and President Donald Trump's 100th day in office. \n Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pressed for an agreement on the short-term legislation that will carry through next week, giving lawmakers more time to complete negotiations on a $1 trillion government-wide spending bill for the remainder of the 2017 budget year. \n Democratic leader Chuck Schumer insisted that any vote only occur when Republicans abandon efforts to add provisions on abortion, financial regulations and the environment to the legislation. \n \"Our position has been clear and it's nothing news. No poison-pill riders,\" Schumer said. \n As families prepare for summer vacations in our National Parks \u2013 Democrats threaten to close them and shut down the government. Terrible! \n I promise to rebuild our military and secure our border. Democrats want to shut down the government. Politics! \n The House is scheduled to vote on the one-week extension on Friday morning and the Senate could still vote ahead of the deadline. \n In addition to the failure to come up with a spending deal that could pass ahead of Trump's 100-day mark, the House GOP looked unlikely to give Trump a victory on health care before then. A revised health care bill has won the support of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, holdouts on an earlier version that collapsed last month, but GOP leaders were struggling to round up votes from moderate-leaning Republicans. \n \"I don't know if it's bringing anyone over,\" said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., who said he had been lobbied by leadership but still opposed the legislation because it undoes an expansion of Medicaid under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. \"There's much of 'Obamacare' that has to be fixed. That part of it is critical,\" Smith said. \n Trump himself unleashed a tweetstorm of criticism of Democrats involved in negotiations on the spending bill, accusing them of trying to close national parks and jeopardize the safety of U.S. troops. \n \"As families prepare for summer vacations in our National Parks \u2013 Democrats threaten to close them and shut down the government. Terrible!\" Trump tweeted. \n \"Democrats jeopardizing the safety of our troops to bail out their donors from insurance companies. It is time to put #AmericaFirst,\" he wrote. \n Democrats dismissed such accusations. \n \"We are never going to shut government down. In fact, we don't even have the power to do so,\" said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Referring to Republicans, she said: \"They have the majority. They have the president. They have the Senate. They have the House. Any shutting down of government, the ball is in their court.\" \n Nonetheless, leaders in both parties projected certainty that a deal would ultimately be reached on the spending legislation, which covers all government agencies and is leftover business from last year. \n \"Talks on government funding legislation have continued throughout the week on a bipartisan, bicameral basis,\" said McConnell, R-Ky., adding that the short-term extension will allow time for a final agreement to be completed and voted on next week. \n The talks involving congressional Republicans and Democrats had progressed relatively smoothly after the White House earlier this week backed off a threat to withhold payments that help lower-income Americans pay their medical bills and Trump dropped a demand for money for the border wall. \n After the U.S.-Mexico wall issue and the Obamacare controversy were addressed, negotiators turned to a lengthy roster of unfinished issues, many of which involve extraneous policy \"riders\" on the environment and financial services regulations. \n Negotiations continued throughout today toward an agreement that might not be revealed until early next week. \n \"Now we're making progress \u2014 we're not there yet,\" said Schumer, D-N.Y. \"I think there's been a real desire, I give leader McConnell credit.

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Mike Flynn arrived, Feb. 13, for a news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington. Documents released by lawmakers show Flynn, now the former national security adviser, was warned when he retired from the military in 2014 not to take foreign money without \"advance approval\" by Pentagon authorities. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump, left, accompanied by then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, second from left, White House press secretary Sean Spicer, right, and Senior Adviser to the President Jared Kushner, spoke on the phone with King of Saudi Arabia Salman bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud in the Oval Office, Jan. 29, at the White House in Washington. \n WASHINGTON >> Investigations intensified into President Donald Trump's ousted national security adviser, Michael Flynn, today as the Pentagon watchdog joined lawmakers in probing payments he accepted from foreign sources including a Russian state-sponsored TV network. \n At the same time, documents released by the top Democrat on a House oversight committee showed Flynn was warned by authorities after he retired from the military in 2014 not to take foreign government-sourced money without \"advance approval\" from the Pentagon. \n Flynn, a former Army lieutenant general and Defense Intelligence Agency chief, later accepted tens of thousands of dollars for his work on behalf of foreign interests, including RT, the state-supported Russian television network, and a Turkish-owned company linked to Turkey's government. \n The Pentagon's acting inspector general's office confirmed he has launched an inquiry into whether those payments qualify as coming from foreign governments and whether Flynn properly informed military authorities about them. \n The White House defended its hiring of Flynn and attempted to shift blame for any problems with his vetting onto the Obama administration, which handled the reissuance of his security clearance in January 2016. \n Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who released the documents, said during a news conference that Flynn had been clearly informed he needed to get permission to receive foreign payments and there's no evidence he did so. \n \"The Pentagon's warning to General Flynn was bold, italicized and could not have been clearer,\" Cummings said. \n In a key 2014 document, Flynn was told by a Defense Intelligence Agency official that the U.S. Constitution's emoluments provision prohibits any monetary payments or gifts \"from a foreign government unless congressional consent is first obtained.\" The Oct. 8, 2014, letter \u2014 which was sent to Flynn at his request \u2014 explained that such \"advance approval\" would need to come \"from the relevant service secretary.\" \n Earlier this week, Cummings and Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House committee, said that they had found no evidence Flynn asked the Army for permission to receive foreign payments or informed the military he had accepted them. Army spokeswoman Cynthia O. Smith said the Army had no records that Flynn requested that permission. \n One episode in question involves a trip he took to Moscow in 2015 for RT's anniversary celebration. He was paid at least $33,750 to attend the gala at which he was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n \"General Flynn's attorney says he discussed his trip to Moscow with DIA, but we have no evidence, not a shred, that he disclosed his payments,\" Cummings said. \n In a statement, Flynn's attorney Robert Kelner said the Defense Department \"was fully aware of the trip,\" citing his previous statements that his client briefed DIA officials before and after the RT trip. \n Kelner also pointed to a letter, released in redacted form by Cummings, that notes that Flynn provided a thumb drive to the agency containing documents detailing the RT event, including that Leading Authorities, a speakers bureau that handled Flynn's paid speeches, was handling the event for him. \n Kelner's statement did not address other payments Flynn received from foreign sources. Flynn has previously disclosed he got between $50,000 and $100,000 as part of his personal stake in $530,000 that his company, Flynn Intel Group, received for consulting work last year for a Turkish businessman. \n Last month Flynn's firm filed as a foreign agent with the Justice Department for its consulting work and acknowledged the work may have benefited the government of Turkey. Flynn's client, Inovo BV, is owned by a businessman who is also a member of a committee overseen by Turkey's finance ministry. \n In comments to the AP, Utah Republican Chaffetz, chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said that Flynn \"had an obligation to seek approval to take money from a foreign government. We found no evidence that he did that.\" \n Chaffetz's office released a letter he sent today to the Army, asking the service's acting secretary to make a final determination as to whether Flynn violated federal law by accepting the payments, and if so, to start the process of recovering that money. \n Chaffetz also asked the Army to say why it hasn't yet made a determination as to the legality of Flynn's payments from RT given that they have been widely reported for at least two years. He also wants the Army to disclose any other investigations it's launched since 2010 into similar legal violations. \n The committee's inquiry is one of several congressional investigations into Flynn's contacts with foreign officials. Trump fired Flynn in February for failing to inform senior administration officials about his contacts with Russian officials \u2014 contacts that are being examined as part of the wider inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. \n Today, 18 House Democrats on the oversight committee signed a letter calling on Chaffetz to do more to pressure the White House to release documents regarding Flynn. \n \"There is obviously a paper trail that the White House does not want our committee to follow,\" the Democrats wrote in the letter. \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer rebuffed criticism from Cummings that the White House was covering up. Asked about Trump administration vetting, Spicer appeared to shift blame onto the Obama administration, which had fired Flynn as head of the DIA. \n \"Why would you re-run a background check on someone who is the head of the Department of Defense Intelligence Agency that had and did maintain a high-level security clearance?\" Spicer asked.

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n U.S. Pacific Command Commander Adm. Harry Harris Jr. testified on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, before a House Armed Services Committee hearing on North Korea. \n WASHINGTON >> U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Thursday that China has threatened to impose sanctions on North Korea if it conducts further nuclear tests. \n \"We know that China is in communications with the regime in Pyongyang,\" Tillerson said on Fox News Channel. \"They confirmed to us that they had requested the regime conduct no further nuclear test.\" \n Tillerson said China also told the U.S. that it had informed North Korea \"that if they did conduct further nuclear tests, China would be taking sanctions actions on their own.\" \n Earlier Thursday, the senior U.S. Navy officer overseeing military operations in the Pacific said the crisis with North Korea is at the worst point he's ever seen, but he declined to compare the situation to the Cuban missile crisis decades ago. \n \"It's real,\" Adm. Harry Harris Jr., commander of U.S. Pacific Command, said during testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee. \n Harris said he has no doubt that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un intends to fulfill his pursuit of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the United States. The admiral acknowledged there's uncertainty within U.S. intelligence agencies over how far along North Korea's nuclear and missile programs are. But Harris said it's not a matter of if but when. \n \"There is no doubt in my mind,\" Harris said. \n The Trump administration has declared that all options, including a targeted military strike, are on the table to block North Korea from carrying out threats against the United States and its allies in the region. But a pre-emptive attack isn't likely, U.S. officials have said, and the administration is pursuing a strategy of putting pressure on Pyongyang with assistance from China, North Korea's main trading partner and the country's economic lifeline. \n With international support, the Trump administration said Thursday it wants to exert a \"burst\" of economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea that yields results within months to push the communist government to change course from developing nuclear weapons. \n Susan Thornton, the acting top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, said there's debate about whether Pyongyang is willing to give up its weapons programs. She said the U.S. wants \"to test that hypothesis to the maximum extent we can\" for a peaceful resolution. \n But signaling that military action remains possible, Thornton told an event hosted by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies \u2014 the Washington think tank has advocated tougher U.S. policies on Iran and North Korea \u2014 that the administration treats North Korea as its primary security challenge and is serious that \"all options are on the table.\" \n \"We are not seeking regime change and our preference is to resolve this problem peacefully,\" Thornton said, \"but we are not leaving anything off the table.\" \n Tillerson took a similar stand in the Fox News interview Thursday, saying: \"We do not seek regime change in North Korea. \u2026 What we are seeking is the same thing China has said they seek \u2014 a full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\" \n After weeks of unusually blunt military threats, President Donald Trump's national security team briefed lawmakers Wednesday on North Korea's advancing nuclear capabilities that served to tamp down talk of military action amid alarm over Pyongyang's atomic and missile testing. A joint statement from the agency heads made no specific mention of military options, though it said the U.S. would defend itself and friends. \n Harris told the committee that the financial sanctions imposed against the North Korean regime by the U.S. and other countries have done nothing to slow North Korea's quest for weapons of mass destruction. He also said he's been skeptical of China's willingness to exert its influence over North Korea and convince Pyongyang to pull back from the brink. But Harris said he's become \"cautiously optimistic\" following recent talks between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. \n \"It's only been a month or so and it's too early to tell,\" Harris said. \"I wouldn't bet my farm on it.\" \n Harris said North Korea's pursuit of an atomic arsenal and the long-range missiles to deliver nuclear weapons comes at the expense of the North Korean people, who are isolated and forced to live with a lifeless economy. \n \"In confronting the North Korean threat, it is critical that the U.S. be guided by a strong sense of resolve both publicly and privately in order to bring Kim Jong-Un to his senses, not his knees,\" Harris said. \n Despite the depravity, Harris said it's a \"hollow hope\" to think that North Koreans will rise up and topple Kim Jong Un. Harris said Kim Jong Un is revered and considered a \"god king\" by many North Koreans. \n In a show of military might, the U.S. has sent a massive amount of American weaponry to the region. A group of American war ships led by the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson is in striking range of North Korea \"if the president were to call on it,\" Harris told the committee. A U.S. missile defense system called Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense is being installed in South Korea. \n Harris said he has adequate forces to \"fight tonight\" against North Korea if that were to become necessary. But the admiral also said he lacks all the attack submarines he needs and has no capable defense against the thousands of artillery pieces North Korea has assembled near the Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea. There are about 28,500 U.S. military personnel serving in South Korea. \n \"We do not have those kinds of weapons that can counter those rockets once they're launched,\" Harris said in response to a question from the committee's Republican chairman, Sen. John McCain of Arizona. \n Associated Press writer Matthew Pennington contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Tillerson says China asked North Korea to stop nuclear tests"}

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Director-General of South Bangkok Prosecutor's Office Suthi Kittisupaporn talks to reporters at the South Bangkok prosecutor's office in Bangkok, Thailand, Thursday, April 27, 2017. \n BANGKOK >> An heir to the Red Bull fortune failed to show up Thursday to face charges over an alleged hit-and-run that killed a Thai police officer almost five years ago, as prosecutors declared they would now seek a warrant for his arrest. \n Prayuth Petchkhun, a deputy spokesman for the attorney general's office, told The Associated Press that Vorayuth \"Boss\" Yoovidhya failed to meet a 4 p.m. deadline. His office had said that if Vorayuth failed to appear, it would send his case to the police on Friday so they can ask the court for an arrest warrant. \n \"If it turns out that he is in Thailand, Thai police can find him and arrest him. But if he is abroad we will then begin the extradition process,\" Prayuth said. \n Vorayuth has been a no-show for meetings with prosecutors on several occasions, complaining through his attorney of unfair treatment or citing duties abroad. A recent Associated Press report revealed that he's been living lavishly, traveling to Formula One races, snowboarding in Japan and cruising in Venice. \n The case is one of several involving the offspring of Thailand's elite that have attracted public scorn as examples of judicial impunity in which the well-connected are able to avoid or delay justice in way that ordinary Thais wouldn't be able to. \n On Thursday, prosecutors rejected Vorayuth's latest request for a delay and said he must show up by 4 p.m. \n \"The suspect must meet prosecutors as scheduled. If he does not, it would mean he has the intention of delaying and evading the case and we will proceed with requesting an arrest warrant from the court,\" Somnuek Siangkong, another spokesman for the attorney general's office, said at a news conference ahead of the deadline. \n Vorayuth is accused of fleeing the scene of a 2012 crash in his Ferrari after allegedly hitting a police officer on motorcycle patrol. \n Vorayuth has failed to show up when ordered to face criminal charges of speeding, hit-and-run, and deadly, reckless driving. Police say Vorayuth disputes the reckless driving charge, claiming the officer swerved in front of him. The speeding charge expired after a year. The more serious charge of hit-and-run, which police say carries a penalty of up to six months in jail, expires Sept. 3. \n The reckless driving charge, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail, expires in 10 years if left unchallenged. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Thai prosecutors to seek arrest warrant for Red Bull heir"}

{"date": "April 27, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this Dec. 4, 2016, file photo, retired Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch, left, chats on the sidelines players on the bench in the second half of an NFL football game against the Carolina Panthers in Seattle. \n ALAMEDA, Calif. >> Marshawn Lynch is coming out of retirement after agreeing on a two-year deal with the Raiders that paved the way for a trade to his hometown team in Oakland. \n Lynch passed a physical Wednesday and agreed to a restructured two-year contract. Those were the final steps needed before Seattle could trade his rights along with a 2018 sixth-round pick to the Raiders for a 2018 fifth-rounder. \n NFL Network said Lynch would get a $3 million base deal this season, with a chance to make an additional $2 million if he rushes for at least 1,000 yards. \n Lynch had been slated to make $9 million this season if he came out of retirement. With Seattle unwilling to pay that amount and Lynch only wanting to play for the Raiders, finalizing a trade was simple once Oakland was able to re-do Lynch's contract. \n Lynch also must apply to the NFL for reinstatement from the retired list before he can play with the Raiders. \n Lynch retired following the 2015 season but decided he wanted to come back and play with his hometown team. The Raiders met with him early this month to gauge his interest and wanted to get a deal done before the draft. \n The Raiders have a need for a power running back after losing Latavius Murray in free agency. Second-year backs Jalen Richard and DeAndre Washington are both smaller backs and are not as suited to short-yardage and goal-line situations. \n \"Marshawn is one of the best running backs I've ever played against in my short career so far,\" Raiders defensive end Khalil Mack said last week. \"It would be a great, great, great treat to have him on this side, on the dark side.\" \n Lynch was perhaps the best power back in the league before he retired. He had double digits in touchdown runs every season from 2011 to 2014, and his 51 TDs on the ground are the most in the NFL since 2011 despite playing just seven games in 2015 and being retired last season. \n Lynch's 245 broken tackles since the start of the 2013 season are 66 more than any other player in that span, according to Pro Football Focus. \n \"I think he's the most physical guy I've played against,\" Mack said. \"I remember playing against him, I believe, my second season. They ran a power right at me. I remember that play. You're talking about one of the most physical guys I've played against, running back-wise.\" \n The 31-year-old Lynch averaged 3.8 yards per carry in his limited action in 2015 before retiring. Before that, he was one of the game's top running backs, with more than 1,200 yards rushing in each of the previous four seasons. \n His production in Oakland should be helped by running behind a line that had three Pro Bowlers last season in left tackle Donald Penn, left guard Kelechi Osemele and center Rodney Hudson. In his final year with the Seahawks, Lynch averaged just 1.1 yards per carry before contact, the lowest for any back with at least 100 carries, according to Pro Football Focus. \n For his career, Lynch has rushed for 9,112 yards and 74 touchdowns. \n Lynch was born and raised in Oakland and played college ball nearby at California. He still has strong ties to the area through his Beast Mode company and would be a welcome addition for a fan base still stung by the team's pending move to Las Vegas for the 2020 season. \n ___ \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Raiders bring Marshawn Lynch out of retirement"}
