He also ruled in favor of the state's motion to dismiss the case, but is allowing CPS to come back with a new argument. He gave the school district until May 26 to file an amended complaint. \n CPS CEO Forrest Claypool had said the judge's decision could mean the district would end the school year on June 1 without additional funding from the state. \n \"The kids of the City of Chicago will be in school until the end of the school year,\" Mayor Rahm Emanuel said at a news conference today. \"That is where they belong.\" \n Although CPS officials said they haven't determined how the district will pay its bills, Emanuel said officials will search for funds to keep the doors open. \n \"Missing a school day is wrong,\" he said. \n While Valderrama rejected the lawsuit, he did express sympathy for the plight of Chicago's school district. \n \"The court is not oblivious to the fiscal challenges confronting CPS,\" Valderrama wrote in his opinion. \"To say that the State's current scheme of funding public education is broken is to state the obvious. Plaintiffs' Complaint, however, as constituted is not the vehicle to redress this inequity.\" \n CPS argued that the way the state funds its schools violates the civil rights of Chicago's predominantly-minority student population. CPS educates 20 percent of Illinois students, but the district only receives 15 percent of state funding. \n Emanuel said the children in Chicago's poorer neighborhoods of Englewood and Woodlawn count just as much as those in the city's wealthier suburbs. \n \"We are not asking for special treatment for the children of Chicago, we are seeking equitable treatment,\" he said. \n Illinois disperses money to schools through a complex calculation that provides per-student funding that even state officials acknowledge is insufficient, causing school districts to rely heavily on local property tax revenues. There's wide consensus that the 1997 formula is unfair with a wide spending gap between low and high poverty districts, like Chicago. But there's little agreement on how to overhaul it and the nearly two-year state budget impasse has overshadowed other issues at the Capitol. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Chicago schools to stay open despite suit's rejection"}

It is also looking to identify fake accounts, and says it will notify people if their accounts have been targeted by cyber-attackers. \n NEW YORK >> Facebook is acknowledging that governments or other malicious non-state actors are using its social network to influence political sentiment in ways that could affect national elections. \n It's a long way from CEO Mark Zuckerberg's assertion back in November that it was \"pretty crazy\" to think that false news on Facebook influenced the U.S. presidential election. It's also a major sign that the world's biggest social network is continuing to grapple with its outsized role in how the world communicates, for better or for worse. \n In a paper posted online on Thursday, Facebook security researchers and its chief security officer said the company will monitor the efforts of those who try to hurt \"civic discourse\" on its service, whether that's governments or other groups. It is also looking to identify fake accounts, and says it will notify people if their accounts have been targeted by such cyberattackers. \n \"(We) have had to expand our security focus from traditional abusive behavior, such as account hacking, malware, spam and financial scams, to include more subtle and insidious forms of misuse, including attempts to manipulate civic discourse and deceive people,\" the report states. It was written by researchers Jen Weedon and William Nuland and Facebook exec Alex Stamos and titled \"Information Operations and Facebook.\" \n ELECTION MEDDLING  \n The team defined \"information operations\" as any actions taken by governments or other actors to \"distort domestic or foreign political sentiment\" to achieve a strategic purpose. Such operations can include the dissemination of false news and disinformation and the use of fake-account networks aimed at manipulating public opinion through a variety of means. \n Using the 2016 U.S. presidential election as an example, Facebook said it uncovered \"several situations\" where malicious actors used social media to \"share information stolen from other sources, such as email accounts, with the intent of harming the reputation of specific political targets.\" \n The company did not name the actors or the victims, but it said its data \"does not contradict\" a January report by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence that Russia tried to meddle with the U.S. election. \n MORE TO DO  \n Jonathan Albright, a professor who studies data journalism at Elon University in North Carolina, urged journalists and others back in February to look not just at the role of Facebook in spreading false or misleading information, but also at the sources of such information. That is, to attempt to identify both the producers of this material and those who spread it using social networks and other means. \n Facebook's paper addresses the amplifiers of such content \u2014 the fake accounts that \"like\" and share false news stories, for example. The company has also announced steps to support legitimate journalism and news literacy. But the paper does not delve into ideas about attacking false news and propaganda at the source, including by banning such content from the site. \n Currently, Facebook users who want to share an article that has been debunked by outside fact-checkers, for example, are able to do so after they get a warning from Facebook. Facebook has long held that it does not want to be the arbiter of truth \u2014 that it wants its users to decide for themselves (within limits of its terms of service) what they want to read and post. \n But balancing a desire not to censor with a desire to weed out state-sponsored propaganda has been a challenging exercise for the company. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Facebook gearing up to fight political propaganda"}

The stomach-turning suicide scene has triggered criticism from some mental health advocates that it romanticizes suicide and even promoted many schools across the country to send warning letters to parents and guardians. \n NEW YORK >> It's a scene as painful to watch as it is graphic: A 17-year-old girl climbs into a bathtub with a razor. We see her slice into her skin, we see the blood pour out, hear her cry and struggle to breathe. Then she is still. \n The suicide of the heroine in Netflix's new popular series \"13 Reasons Why\" shouldn't come as a shock, since it's depicted in the final episode of a series built around the character's death. But knowing that it is coming doesn't make it any easier. \n That stomach-turning scene has triggered criticism that it romanticizes suicide and prompted many schools across the country to send warning letters to parents and guardians. The show's creators are unapologetic, saying their frank depiction needs to be \"unflinching and raw.\" \n \"Many people are accusing the show of glamorizing suicide and I feel strongly \u2014 and I think everyone who made the show \u2014 feel very strongly that we did the exact opposite,\" said writer Brian Yorkey, who won a Tony Award and a Pulitzer Prize for the musical \"Next to Normal,\" which grappled with mental illness. \"What we did was portray suicide and we portrayed it as very ugly and very damaging.\" \n The 13-episode drama, co-produced by actress and singer Selena Gomez, is based on Jay Asher's young-adult 2007 bestseller about a high school student who kills herself and leaves behind 13 audiotapes detailing the events that led to her death, including sexual assault, substance abuse and bullying. \n Per usual, Netflix released all 13 hours of the series at once \u2014 on March 31 \u2014 leaving suicide prevention specialists worried teens might binge the entire series without a chance to fully absorb the issues and ask questions. They also say they wish the show would consistently flash the National Suicide Prevention hotline. \n \"Graphic details about suicide we know historically are not recommended,\" said Phyllis Alongi, the clinical director of The Society for the Prevention of Teen Suicide . \"I understand what the producers are saying but it could really be unsafe and I think we need to be a little more responsible.\" \n Netflix and the show creators point out that several mental health professionals were consulted and they offer a 30- minute show called \"Beyond the Reasons\" that delves deeper into the tougher topics portrayed, as well as a site with links to resources. \n The show is rated TV-MA, which means is may be unsuitable for children under 17, and three episodes that contain explicit material have \"viewer discretion advised\" warnings. \n But some mental health professionals are going further, with the National Association of School Psychologists declaring, \"We do not recommend that vulnerable youth, especially those who have any degree of suicidal ideation, watch this series.\" \n Critics of the show argue that depression and mental illness \u2014 keys to understanding suicide \u2014 are rarely mentioned and the fact that its heroine, Hannah, gets to tell her story after her death sends a potentially dangerous message. They're also upset that the school guidance counselor depicted on the show seems to blame the victim. \n The Jed Foundation and Suicide Awareness Voices of Education joined forces to create 13 talking points for young adults and guardians to discuss while watching the series, including warnings that the way the counselor is portrayed is \"not typical\" and that \"leaving messages from beyond the grave is a dramatization produced in Hollywood.\" \n School systems across the country are alerting parents, making them aware that their teens may be streaming the series, urging them to watch it with them, and providing information to help them talk about it. \n In the upstate New York community of Grand Island, school administrators warned that the series \"sensationalizes suicide.\" Indiana's largest school district warned in an email that the series \"does not accurately model what we would want or hope individuals do if they are struggling or in crisis.\" \n In Maryland, principals in the Montgomery County public school system noticed teens talking about the series and wanted to make sure parents had resources to handle tough questions. A warning letter and links to resources eventually went out to all 35,000 middle schoolers. \n \"There's a lot to take in and digest. If you're a young, growing mind being informed by what you see, this could have an impact,\" said Derek Turner, spokesman for the district. \"So we're giving them tips and tools.\" \n According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide was the second leading cause of death for children and young adults ages 10 to 24 in 2014. \n Dr. Helen Hsu, a clinical psychologist in Fremont, California, whose work involves suicide prevention in schools, helped shape some of the \"13 Reasons Why\" scripts. She said not showing Hannah's suicide would be almost \"coy and avoidant\" and that medical studies aren't definitive about the risks of suicide contagion. Plus, there are already graphic how-to guides online. \n \"If you think your child can't find this in one second on the internet already in the past 10 years, you are sadly mistaken,\" she said. \"To say this is going to trigger that is sort of naive. What I really emphasized in the script writing was I said. 'It has to focus on that it's not glamorous, that it's ugly, it's painful and I really want you to focus on the pain of her parents and the people left.'\" \n While suicide has been depicted on TV shows, the youth of the roles in \"13 Reasons Why\" is pioneering. It has clearly struck a nerve: The show has 340,000 Twitter followers and 2.4 million likes on Facebook. \n Gomez, who has talked openly about her own mental-health struggles, said she was braced for a backlash: \"It's going to come no matter what. It's not an easy subject to talk about. But I'm very fortunate with how it's doing.\" \n Yorkey said creators wanted to tell a young adult story in \"a more honest way that it has ever been told on television.\" \n \"I understand it's hard to watch,\" he said. \"It was supposed to be hard to watch because these things are incredibly hard to endure and we wanted to say, 'These things are happening in kids' lives. You can keep quiet about them. You can keep kids from watching shows about them. It's not going to stop them from happening in kids' lives and you should be talking about that.'\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "'13 Reasons' sparks criticism of teen suicide depiction"}

The Associated Press could not legally confirm the authenticity of the uploaded files. \n New episodes of \"Orange\" are scheduled for official release on June 9.

A spokeswoman for the video streaming service declined to comment on the release of the episodes Saturday. \n Earlier, Netflix said that a small production vendor that works with several major TV studios suffered a breach. The Los Gatos, California, company described it as an \"active situation\" that's being investigated by the FBI and other authorities. \n The Dark Overlord had been demanding that Netflix pay an unspecified ransom in exchange for not releasing the episodes prematurely online.

The Dark Overlord promised to also release titles from those other networks unless \"modest\" ransoms are paid. \n Rumors of a massive leak of Hollywood films and TV episodes have been circulating online for months, fed by purported screenshots of the footage and a copy of a proposed deal to delete the stolen material in return for tens of thousands of dollars in electronic currency. \n When the AP contacted The Dark Overlord in February, the hacker said the purloined video wouldn't be made publicly available after all, making the far-fetched claim that \"no one really (cares) about unreleased movies and TV show episodes.\" \n It's not clear what triggered The Dark Overload's renewed ransom demands. \n Netflix is counting on \"Orange\" to help it add 3.2 million subscribers from April through June.

Authorities say Soules called 911 and sought help for Mosher before leaving the scene in another truck, leaving his damaged vehicle in a ditch.

Police are investigating whether alcohol played a role in the crash and are trying to identify who drove Soules from the scene. \n Today's rulings seal the warrants, applications for them, affidavits that detail investigators' probable cause and inventories of items seized. \n Soules, who starred on the ABC reality show two years ago and later appeared on \"Dancing With The Stars,\" had been scheduled to face a preliminary hearing next week.

{"date": "April 28, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. spoke to reporters during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington Thursday. \n ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer of N.Y. spoke to reporters during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington Thursday. \n WASHINGTON >> Congress took the easy way out to keep the government open on the eve of Donald Trump's 100th day in office, passing a weeklong stop-gap spending bill today that amounted to more of a defeat for the president than a victory. \n Lawmakers cleared the measure easily with just hours to spare before the shutdown deadline at midnight. But with Trump marking his presidency's milestone Saturday, he did not wring any major legislation out of Congress, despite a renewed White House push to revive the House GOP's health care bill in time for a vote that could give him bragging rights. \n House leaders are still short of votes for the revised health bill, though they could bring it to the floor next week if they find the support they need. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the plan was to pass the bill \"as soon as possible.\" \n Also next week lawmakers plan to pass a $1 trillion package financing the government through Sept. 30, the end of the 2017 fiscal year. \n The temporary spending bill keeps the government functioning through next Friday, to allow lawmakers time to wrap up negotiations on the larger measure. The Senate sent the stopgap bill to Trump by voice vote today after the House approved it by a lopsided 382-30 margin. \n \"Today's measure shows the American people that we are making a good-faith effort to keep our government open,\" said Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas. \"While this is not ideal, I support this effort to provide our colleagues with more time to reach a final agreement on legislation to fund the government through the fiscal year.\" \n The struggle over both bills was embarrassing to the GOP, which has Trump in the White House and majorities in Congress. Yet even with unified control, it's proving an uphill fight for Republicans to make good on seven years' worth of promises to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama's health care law. \n \"I'm disappointed that it doesn't go quicker,\" Trump said of his interactions with Congress, in an interview airing on Fox News Channel. \n At least 18 Republicans, mostly moderates, said they oppose the health care legislation, and many others remained publicly uncommitted. That puts party elders in an uncomfortable spot because if 22 Republicans defect, the bill will fail, assuming all Democrats oppose it. \n House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., wants to avoid an encore of last month's embarrassment, when he abruptly canceled a vote on a health care overhaul because of opposition from moderates and conservatives alike. \n Republicans have recast the health bill to let states escape a requirement under Obama's 2010 law that insurers charge healthy and seriously ill customers the same rates. The overall legislation would cut the Medicaid program for the poor, eliminate Obama's fines for people who don't buy insurance and provide generally skimpier subsidies. Centrist Republicans were the primary target of lobbying by the White House and GOP leaders. \n Meanwhile negotiations moved ahead on the longer-term spending bill, which would fund the day-to-day operations of virtually every federal agency. Most of the core decisions about agency budgets have been worked out, but unrelated policy issues \u2014 such as a Democratic request to help the cash-strapped government of Puerto Rico with its Medicaid burden \u2014 are among the hold-ups. \n Democrats denied Trump a win on obtaining an initial down payment for his oft-promised border wall with Mexico, while anti-abortion lawmakers steered clear of even attempting to use the measure to try to cut off federal funds for Planned Parenthood. But Trump and defense hawks have procured a $15 billion infusion for the Pentagon and funds for other border security accounts such as detention beds for people entering the country illegally. \n Republicans also are pressing for policy wins on blocking environmental regulations such as Obama's sweeping expansion of the Clean Water Act. But Democrats, whose votes are needed to pass the measure, are pushing back. \n Democrats praised a $2 billion funding increase for the National Institutes of Health \u2014 rejecting steep cuts proposed by Trump \u2014 as well as additional funds to combat opioid abuse and fund Pell Grants for summer school. A provision extending health care for 22,000 retired Appalachian coal miners and their families had yet to be finalized, though it's a priority of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other coal-state lawmakers like Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia. \n The catchall spending bill is the first major piece of bipartisan legislation during Trump's short tenure. Democrats have been actively involved in the talks, which appear on track to produce a lowest-common-denominator measure that won't look much different than a deal that could have been reached on Obama's watch. \n AP reporters Erica Werner, Andrew Taylor and Kevin Freking contributed to this report. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Congress settles for stopgap to avoid government shutdown"}

{"date": "April 28, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. pauses during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington to talk about the failed health care bill. From cancer to addiction, doctors and patient groups are warning that the latest Republican health care bill would gut hard-won protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. \n WASHINGTON >> From cancer to addiction, doctors and patient groups are warning that the latest Republican health care bill would gut hard-won protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. Some GOP moderates who may seal the legislation's fate are echoing those concerns. \n In a strongly worded statement this week, the American Medical Association said the Republican protections \"may be illusory.\" The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said the plan could take the nation back to a \"patchwork system\" that pushes costs on people with life-threatening conditions. \n Such stark messages may be connecting with lawmakers anxious about making the right decision on issues that touch every family. Rep. Patrick Meehan, R-Pa., said the rewritten bill \"doesn't change the fundamental concerns I had at the outset\u2026making sure people with serious medical conditions could get affordable and adequate coverage.\" Count him among the GOP moderates who remain opposed. \n And veteran Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said Friday he's \"not comfortable\" with the bill and would like to see it changed. A former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Upton said he was concerned people with pre-existing medical problems could face unaffordable premiums. \n The Affordable Care Act passed under former President Barack Obama requires insurers to take all applicants, regardless of medical history. Patients with health problems pay the same standard premiums as healthy ones. \n The latest version of House Republicans' American Health Care Act would allow states to opt out of the requirement for standard premiums, under certain circumstances. \n If a state maintains safeguards such as a high-risk pool, it can allow insurers to use health status as a factor in setting premiums for people who have had a break in coverage and are trying to get a new individual policy. Critics of the Republican approach say there is no requirement that a state must provide an affordable coverage option for those consumers. \n Proponents say people in poor health would still be protected as long as they maintain coverage. And the higher premiums would revert back to standard rates after 12 months, assuming the customer could afford to keep paying. \n \"All they are doing is moving the venue where people are going to be discriminated against,\" said AMA President Andrew Gurman. \"It would simply give them an escape clause for 50 states.\" The nation's largest doctors' group supported passage of the Obama-era law, and is now pressing for a bipartisan approach to fix problems with the program. \n Gurman used the hypothetical example of a low-income worker with a new cancer diagnosis. \n \"This is not the kind of thing you can put off for a while,\" he said. \"They're going to need urgent surgery, radiation. They are not going to be able to work. If they lose coverage for more than 60 days, how are they going to afford huge insurance premiums? That scenario is all too common, unfortunately.\" \n Along with the AMA and other groups, the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society is raising concerns about another GOP provision that would let states to get waivers from \"essential health benefits.\" That's the requirement in the Obama-era law that insurers must cover 10 broad categories of services, from hospitalization to preventive care, from lab tests to mental health and substance abuse treatment. \n Part of the risk is that the ACA's financial protections, including no annual or lifetime dollar limits on coverage, are tied to medical care under the essential benefits. \n \"Without these protections in place, we are returning to the Wild West again,\" said Kirsten Sloan, vice president for policy at the Cancer Action Network. \n Nonetheless House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said recently he thought people with pre-existing medical conditions would be better off under the GOP plan because they'd have more options. \"That's the whole goal,\" he said, \"to make it easier for people.\" \n But Republican health economist Gail Wilensky said she's greatly concerned about the latest shift on pre-existing conditions. \n \"It definitely gives the state the option, in a waiver process, of greatly diminishing if not gutting the pre-existing conditions protections,\" she said. High-risk pools can serve effectively as a backstop, she added, but House Republicans have not provided enough money for them. \n \"I think this is flawed,\" Wilensky said. \"The moderates in the House are pushing back, and I can't imagine it getting out of the Senate.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Fears of losing pre-existing conditions protection under GOP"}

Minhaj will host the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner in Washington while Bee will be hosting the \"Not the White House Correspondents' Dinner\" in Washington. \n Will Smith and George Clooney, step aside for Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. \n It's safe to say that the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner \u2014 traditionally the most glittery night on the Washington social calendar, where A-list celebrities sprinkle their stardust as coveted guests of media organizations \u2014 will have a different vibe this year. With the current president \u2014highly unpopular in Hollywood \u2014 staying away, organizers say the focus will not be on the red carpet but on the bedrock principles of the event: the First Amendment and the crucial role of the press in a democracy. \n Not that those principles haven't always been central to the mission of an event that began in 1921, notes Jeff Mason, WHCA president. But, he says, \"the focus will be entirely on that this year, and I think that's a great thing.\" \n The absence of President Donald Trump, who has called the media \"fake\" and \"dishonest\" and even \"the enemy of the people,\" marks the first time a president has declined since Ronald Reagan in 1981 \u2014 and he was recovering from an assassination attempt (but phoned in some friendly, humorous remarks nonetheless.) Trump has decided to hold a rally in Pennsylvania instead, and his White House staff will also be absent, in what was described as \"solidarity\" with their boss. \n But even if Trump had decided to come, this year's event would have been different, Mason says, \"based on the tension that has existed in the relationship and some of the things he has said about the press. We were preparing for a different dinner either way.\" \n So as opposed to last year, when guests at President Barack Obama's final dinner included Smith, Emma Watson, Kerry Washington, Helen Mirren, the late Carrie Fisher, and, for a Kardashian quotient, model Kendall Jenner, this year's big stars seem to be Woodward and Bernstein \u2014 not Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, who played the famous reporting duo, but the men themselves, who'll be presenting journalism awards. Woodward told the Washington Post the two will speak about \"the First Amendment and the importance of aggressive but fair reporting.\" \n There will be, as usual, a comedian emceeing the event, which will air on C-SPAN: Hasan Minhaj, of \"The Daily Show.\" But he will have competition: late-night star Samantha Bee will be headlining \"Not the White House Correspondent's Dinner,\" airing at 10 p.m. EDT on TBS (TV stars like Alysia Reiner of \"Orange Is The New Black,\" Retta of \"Parks and Recreation,\" and Matt Walsh of \"Veep\" are among those scheduled to attend the party afterward.) \n Besides the high-profile after-parties (some of which have been canceled this year), the correspondents' dinner has spawned a number of annual events the same weekend, like the fundraiser Friday night for The Creative Coalition, an advocacy group fighting for continued arts funding. Tim Daly of \"Madam Secretary\" (the group's president), Keegan-Michael Key of \"Key & Peele,\" Walsh of \"Veep,\" and many others are scheduled to attend. \n There's also a traditional garden brunch co-hosted by media consultant Tammy Haddad \u2014 who will be attending the correspondents' dinner too, and says she's looking forward to it. \"What you're going to see Saturday is more journalists per square inch than ever before, united in showing what they do and how they do it,\" she says. \n \"Those celebrity spots will now be taken by journalists,\" Haddad adds. \"There's going to be more interest in what they do. I mean, look at David Fahrenthold,\" she said of the Pulitzer-winning Washington Post reporter, one of the dinner's award recipients. \"He's the Bono of journalism. Journalists are heroes now.\" \n The dinner didn't start out as a multi-day celebrity-studded event. Most trace that development to 1987, when then-Baltimore Sun reporter Michael Kelly brought Fawn Hall, the secretary in the center of the Iran-Contra affair. That began a tradition. In 2012, Lindsay Lohan came as the guest of Fox News' Greta Van Susteren, a development that earned scorn from Tom Brokaw. (\"Give me a break,\" he said in an interview with Politico.) \n The potentially (to some) uncomfortable glitz factor, not to mention the schmoozing of administration officials and journalists who cover them, led a few news organizations to stop attending in recent years. But other guests have seen it as a good opportunity to get some business done. \n \"There's always business going down,\" says Robin Bronk, CEO of The Creative Coalition. \"In Washington, you'd be hard-pressed to find a party that doesn't have a purpose. It tastes good, but it's good for you.\" \n Bronk says the WHCA dinner, celeb factor aside, \"does a fine job of reminding us why a free press is so important. They always do a great job protecting this great amendment that we have.\" \n Mason, of the WHCA, says Trump may be sending a signal with his absence, but that's up to him: \"The signal that WE are sending is that we will uphold the principles of the First Amendment and we will celebrate that at this dinner.\" \n Still, it won't be all serious, he says, promising that Minhaj will be using his comedy chops \u2014 without \"roasting the president in absentia.\" \n \"People don't want to come to a dinner and feel bored or preached at. Hopefully neither of those things will happen.\" \n Bee says she, too, will focus on celebrating the press. \n \"We're intending our show to really focus on honoring the press for all of the work that we vampire from them, all the hard work that people do that go into making a show like ours possible,\" she told the Associated Press at an event this week. \n Trevor Noah, the \"Daily Show\" host, said he was excited to see what both Bee and Minhaj bring to the weekend's festivities. \n \"Maybe there's something different that we'll get to see from the correspondents' dinner,\" he said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "At Trump-less correspondents event, focus back on journalism"}

{"date": "April 28, 2017", "text": "STAR-ADVERTISER / DEC. 31, 2016 \n The start of HART's mass transit rail line in East Kapolei along Kualakai Parkway. State lawmakers who are trying to resolve the fate of the Honolulu rail funding tossed a new idea into the mix this morning by proposing to increase the state's hotel room tax to raise $1.3 billion to help fund both the rail project and public education. \n House and Senate negotiators tentatively agreed this afternoon to a plan to increase the state hotel room tax to 12 percent to raise $1.3 billion to help fund both the rail project and public education. \n House Transportation Chairman Henry Aquino suggested lawmakers drop the idea of extending the half-percent excise tax surcharge that is now providing most of the funding for the rail project, and instead increase the transient accommodations tax by 2.75 percentage points for 10 years starting January 2018. \n The hotel room tax is now 9.25 percent, and the House proposal would increase it to 12 percent for the next decade, said Aquino (D, Waipahu). That tax increase would raise $1.3 billion by 2027, he said, which means the money would be available to the city for use on the rail project sooner than it would be if the state extended the excise surcharge on Oahu. \n House and Senate leaders hailed the decision as an innovative way to resolve the sometimes bitter rail funding debate, and to shift more of the burden of building the 20-mile rail line from Hawaii residents to visitors. \n However, state Sen. Donna Mercado Kim said the last-minute proposal is legally questionable because it was never debated in a public hearing and did not comply with the lawmaking process that is set out in the state Constitution. \n \"The industry had no input, nobody had any input on this, so at this hour to come out with an increase in the (hotel room tax) that was never discussed, never went to a public hearing, to me is not legal,\" said Kim, (D, Kalihi Valley-Moanalua-Halawa). \n She said the bill will be vulnerable to a legal challenge if it passes because \"the law says it has to have three readings, and it didn't go through three readings.\" \n The proposal that lawmakers gave preliminary approval would divide up revenue from the extra hotel room tax collections, with $50 million a year deposited into a \"New Start Education Special Fund,\" Aquino said. Lawmakers would determine the use of that money next session, he said. \n The remainder of the $1.3 billion from the hotel tax increase would go to the city to use on the rail project. Aquino said that because the money would be provided to the city years earlier than it would with an excise tax extension, it would amount to the equivalent of $2.4 billion in future excise tax revenue. \n At the same time, the state would reduce the city's current share of the hotel room tax by $13 million, and apply that money to the rail project as well, said Senate Ways and Means Committee Chairwoman Jill Tokuda. \n An earlier proposal would also have diverted a some of the neighbor island counties' share of the hotel room tax to help pay for rail, but Tokuda nixed that idea. \"I think that is only fair given that this project is for the City and County of Honolulu, and it should not disproportionately impact the neighbor island counties,\" she said. \n Aquino also said the proposed bill \"would prohibit the City and County of Honolulu from overextending itself fiscally by using public funds to reconstruct or redevelop the Neal S. Blaisdell Center, which is expected to cost nearly $500 million,\"Aquino said. \n House Finance Chairwoman Sylvia Luke said that \"we've been told time and time again that the tourists should pay for the rail, and that's what the mayor (Kirk Caldwell) has continued to say,\" she said. \"That's why today, we're ensuring the elderly and working poor are not taxed anymore with this new proposal,\" which instead would tax tourists. \n Tokuda called the proposal \"unique and innovative.\" \n Senate Bill 1183 now goes to the full House and Senate for further consideration. Senate Majority Leader J. Kalani English said a group of senators met in Senate President Ron Kouchi's office to discuss the measure and said he believes the bill has the votes to pass in the Senate. \n House Majority Leader Scott Saiki said the House Democrats have not yet been briefed on the proposal. \n If the House and Senate approve the bill, it will be sent to Gov. David Ige, who will have the options of signing it into law, vetoing the bill, or allowing it to become law without his signature. \n ", "author": "By Kevin Dayton kdayton@staradvertiser.com", "title": "Lawmakers tentatively agree on proposal to raise hotel tax for rail, education"}

Demonstrators gathered near the University of California, Berkeley campus amid a strong police presence and rallied to show support for free speech and condemn the views of Ann Coulter and her supporters. \n BERKELEY, Calif. >> Berkeley officials declared their handling of protests over Ann Coulter's canceled appearance a success thanks to a massive police presence that ensured the city did not become a \"fight club,\" the mayor said today. \n Hundreds of Coulter's supporters gathered in a downtown park Thursday after the University of California, Berkeley, nixed a speech by the conservative commentator. Many of them came dressed for conflict, wearing flak jackets, ballistic helmets adorned with pro-President Donald Trump stickers and other protective gear. \n There were tense shouting matches but no major confrontations between Coulter's supporters and opponents, who held a nearby counter-rally. The two sides were separated by a wall of riot police, while hundreds of other officers were deployed around the city and campus. \n \"Having a large police presence definitely helped yesterday,\" Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin told San Francisco TV station KTVU. \"What we saw was people in the park speaking out, there were lots of discussions and debates that happened, and that's what we wanted to facilitate. \n \"But nobody crossed the line to violence, and that's what we wanted. We don't want to turn our city into a fight club,\" the mayor said. \n Police and officials, both for the city and its prominent public university, have faced criticism for failing to keep the peace at several political rallies in recent months that have erupted in violence. \n This time, police said they took a new approach, including a large deployment of visible officers and a low tolerance for violence. Seven people were arrested, including one for obstructing an officer and wearing a mask to evade police, and another for possessing a knife. \n Officers on campus also took selfies with students to try to lighten the mood. \n Neither the university nor the police have disclosed how many officers were involved, but UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said it had backup from a \"wide range\" of law enforcement agencies. \n It is not clear how much the security cost, but Arreguin said the university footed the bill. \n \"This was a university event, they invited Ann Coulter and so they took on the responsibility of paying for, calling in mutual aid and helping coordinate with the city the mutual response,\" Arreguin said. \n Coulter was invited to speak by campus Republicans, who also had invited right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulous to speak in February. That event was canceled because of violent protests by a left-wing extremist group that smashed windows on campus and set fires outside the student union. \n Arreguin also attributed today's peaceful rallies to the fact that the \"very extremist left-wing groups didn't really show up,\" as had been expected. \n Berkeley, birthplace of the U.S. free speech movement in the 1960s, has emerged as a flashpoint for the extreme left and right amid debate over free speech. \n Earlier this month, a bloody brawl broke out in downtown Berkeley at a pro-Trump protest that featured speeches by members of a self-described white nationalist group. They clashed with a group of left-wing Trump critics who called themselves anti-fascists. \n Officials at UC Berkeley had said they feared renewed violence on campus if Coulter followed through with plans to speak despite the cancellation, citing \"very specific intelligence\" about threats that could endanger Coulter and students. Coulter said the threats were motivated by a university bias against conservative speakers. \n She posted on Twitter about the peaceful rallies in Berkeley: \"Amazing what cops doing their jobs can accomplish!\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Berkeley praises police for keeping peace at Coulter rallies"}

{"date": "April 28, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump arrives to speak at the National Rifle Association Leadership Conference, Friday, April 28, 2017, in Atlanta. \n WASHINGTON >> Even though he named Michael Flynn to be his top national security aide, President Donald Trump on Friday laid the blame for any flaws in Flynn's vetting at the feet of his predecessor. \n In an interview airing Friday evening on Fox News Channel's \"The First 100 Days,\" Trump tried to deflect recent criticism of his decision to appoint Flynn as national security adviser despite Flynn's past lobbying on behalf of Turkish government interests and his acceptance of tens of thousands of dollars from a Russian state-sponsored television network. \n \"When they say we didn't vet, well Obama I guess didn't vet, because he was approved at the highest level of security by the Obama administration,\" Trump said, referring to the previous administration's approval of Flynn's security clearance. \n \"So when he came into our administration, for a short period of time, he came in, he was already approved by the Obama administration and he had years left on that approval,\" Trump added. \n Though Flynn was indeed with the Trump administration for a short period before he was forced out, he campaigned vigorously for Trump for months during the 2016 election battle, including a fiery speech at the Republican National Convention in which he joined in as the crowd jeered Democrat Hillary Clinton. \"Lock her up, that's right,\" he called out, applauding the delegates' chants. \n President Barack Obama fired Flynn from his post as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, but Flynn maintained a security clearance that was reissued in January 2016. Trump appointed Flynn as national security adviser in January. He sacked him in February, saying Flynn had misled senior administration officials, including the vice president, about his contacts with Russian officials. \n Trump's comments echoed the defense advanced by his press secretary Sean Spicer on Thursday, as the Pentagon's watchdog confirmed it was investigating Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, over whether he failed to get U.S. government approval to receive foreign payments. \n Among those payments was more than $33,000 from the RT television network, which U.S. intelligence officials have branded as propaganda front for Russia's government. The network paid Flynn for attending a gala in Moscow. At the event, Flynn was seated next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n Earlier this week, the top Republican and Democrat on a House oversight committee said they believe Flynn broke federal law by failing to get permission to accept foreign payments and failing to disclose the payments after he received them. \n A House oversight committee, the Defense Department's inspector general and the U.S. Army are scrutinizing the Russia-linked payments as well as Flynn's share of more than $530,000 worth of foreign agent work he did for a Turkish businessman. Flynn acknowledged in a filing with the Justice Department last month that his work investigating a Turkish cleric could have principally benefited Turkey's government. \n On Friday, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform faulted the Trump administration for blaming Obama. \n \"The White House had its own responsibility to fully vet General Flynn since new information became public during the transition \u2014 well after General Flynn's last background check \u2014 about his lobbying on behalf of foreign interests,\" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md. \"The White House needs to stop making excuses to protect General Flynn.\" \n In addition to the scrutiny of his foreign payments, Flynn's foreign contacts are being examined as part of the wider inquiries into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. He has been interviewed by the FBI, which is investigating Trump associates' contacts with Russia, and he is being probed by the House and Senate intelligence committees. \n ", "author": "By Star-Advertiser staff", "title": "Trump blames Flynn's vetting on Obama administration"}

Turning to diplomacy after flexing military muscle, the United States urged the U.N. Security Council today to increase economic pressure on North Korea over its nuclear weapons program, leaning on China in particular to turn the screws on its wayward ally. \n Update 5:23 p.m. \n SEOUL >> North Korea's state media has reiterated the country's goal of developing a nuclear missile capable of reaching the continental United States on the same day rivals Washington and Seoul detected a failed missile launch from an area near Pyongyang. \n The Rodong Sinmun newspaper also said Saturday that the North revealed two types of new intercontinental ballistic missiles in an April 15 military parade honoring its late state founder, Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of current ruler Kim Jong Un. The parade featured previously unseen large rocket canisters and launcher trucks. \n It said: \"The large territory that is the United States has been entirely exposed to our pre-emptive nuclear strike means.\" \n Referring to the United States sending the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier to Korean waters, the newspaper said that \"rendering aircraft carriers useless is not even a problem\" for its military. \n The newspaper says that the North displayed three types of ICBMs during the parade, including two new types that were inside the canisters. \n Analysts say the North's existing liquid-fuel ICBMS, including the KN-08 and KN-14, are potentially capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, although the North has never flight tested them. \n Previous coverage \n SEOUL >> A North Korean mid-range ballistic missile apparently failed shortly after launch today, South Korea and the United States said, the third test-fire flop just this month but a clear message of defiance as a U.S. supercarrier conducts drills in nearby waters. \n North Korean ballistic missile tests are banned by the United Nations because they're seen as part of the North's push for a nuclear-tipped missile that can strike the U.S. mainland. The latest test came as U.S. officials pivoted from a hard line to diplomacy at the U.N. in an effort to address what may be Washington's most pressing foreign policy challenge. \n President Donald Trump said on Twitter, \"North Korea disrespected the wishes of China & its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!\" He did not answer reporters' questions about the missile launch upon returning to the White House from a day trip to Atlanta. \n The timing of the North's test was striking: Only hours earlier the U.N. Security Council held a ministerial meeting on Pyongyang's escalating weapons program. North Korean officials boycotted the meeting, which was chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \n South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the missile flew for several minutes and reached a maximum height of 71 kilometers (44 miles) before it apparently failed. \n It didn't immediately provide an estimate on how far the missile flew, but a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said it was likely a medium-range KN-17 ballistic missile. It broke up a couple minutes after the launch, and the pieces fell into the Sea of Japan. \n Analysts say the KN-17 is a new Scud-type missile developed by North Korea. The North fired the same type of missile April 16, just a day after a massive military parade where it showed off its expanding missile arsenal, but U.S. officials called that launch a failure. \n Some analysts say a missile the North test fired April 5, which U.S. officials identified as a Scud variant, also might have been a KN-17. U.S. officials said that missile spun out of control and crashed into the sea. \n The two earlier launches were conducted from an eastern coastal area, but the missile was fired in the west, from an area near Pukchang, just north of the capital, Pyongyang. \n Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, speaking after a meeting of Japan's National Security Council, said the missile is believed to have traveled about 50 kilometers (30 miles) and fallen on an inland part of North Korea. \n The North routinely test-fires a variety of ballistic missiles, despite U.N. prohibitions, as part of its weapons development. While shorter-range missiles are somewhat routine, there is strong outside worry about each longer-range North Korean ballistic test. \n Today's launch comes at a point of particularly high tension. Trump has sent a nuclear-powered submarine and the USS Carl Vinson aircraft supercarrier to Korean waters, and North Korea this week conducted large-scale, live-fire exercises on its eastern coast. The U.S. and South Korea also started installing a missile defense system that is supposed to be partially operational within days. \n On Friday, the United States and China offered starkly different strategies for addressing North Korea's escalating nuclear threat as Tillerson demanded full enforcement of economic sanctions on Pyongyang and urged new penalties. Stepping back from suggestions of U.S. military action, he even offered aid to North Korea if it ends its nuclear weapons program. \n The range of Tillerson's suggestions, which over a span of 24 hours also included restarting negotiations, reflected America's failure to halt North Korea's nuclear advances despite decades of U.S.-led sanctions, military threats and stop-and-go rounds of diplomatic engagement. As the North approaches the capability to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile, the Trump administration feels it is running out of time. \n Chairing a ministerial meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday, Tillerson declared that \"failing to act now on the most pressing security issue in the world may bring catastrophic consequences.\" \n His ideas included a ban on North Korean coal imports and preventing its overseas guest laborers, a critical source of government revenue, from sending money home. And he warned of unilateral U.S. moves against international firms conducting banned business with Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs, which could ensnare banks in China, the North's primary trade partner. \n Yet illustrating the international gulf over how best to tackle North Korea, several foreign ministers on the 15-member council expressed fears of a conflict on the Korean Peninsula, which was divided between the American-backed South and communist North even before the 1950-53 Korean War. The conflict ended with no formal peace treaty. And while danger always has lurked, tensions have escalated dramatically as the North's young leader, Kim Jong Un, has expanded a nuclear arsenal his government says is needed to avert a U.S. invasion. \n No voice at Friday's session was more important than that of China, a conduit for 90 percent of North Korea's commerce and a country Trump is pinning hopes on for a peaceful resolution to the nuclear crisis. Trump, who recently hosted President Xi Jinping for a Florida summit, has sometimes praised the Chinese leader for a newfound cooperation to crack down on North Korea and sometimes threatened a go-it-alone U.S. approach if Xi fails to deliver. \n Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China would adhere to past U.N. resolutions and wants a denuclearized peninsula. But he spelled out no further punitive steps his government might consider, despite Tillerson's assertions in an interview hours ahead of the council meeting that Beijing would impose sanctions of its own if North Korea conducts another nuclear test. \n Wang put forward a familiar Chinese idea to ease tensions: North Korea suspending its nuclear and missile activities if the U.S. and South Korea stop military exercises in the region. Washington and Seoul reject the idea. \n Tillerson said the U.S. does not seek regime change in North Korea, and he signaled American openness to holding direct negotiations with Pyongyang. The U.S. also could resume aid to North Korea once it \"begins to dismantle its nuclear weapons and missile technology programs,\" he said. Since 1995, he added, Washington has provided more than $1.3 billion to the impoverished country. \n But the prospects for any more U.S. money going there appeared bleak. Even negotiations don't seem likely. \n Tillerson said the North must take \"concrete steps\" to reduce its weapons threat before talks could occur. Six-nation nuclear negotiations with North Korea stalled in 2009. The Obama administration sought to resurrect them in 2012, but a deal to provide food aid in exchange for a nuclear freeze soon collapsed. \n \"In a nutshell, (North Korea) has already declared not to attend any type of talks which would discuss its nuclear abandonment, nuclear disbandment,\" Kim In Ryong, North Korea's deputy U.N. ambassador, told The Associated Press. His government declined to attend Friday's council meeting. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "North Korea says its missiles target U.S. mainland"}

Federal officials said humpback whales have been dying in unusually large numbers along the Atlantic Coast. (Suzanne Thurman/MERR Institute Inc. via AP) \n PORTLAND, Maine >> Government scientists are investigating an unusually large number of humpback whale deaths from North Carolina to Maine, the first such \"unusual mortality event\" declaration in a decade. \n Forty-one whales have died in the region in 2016 and so far in 2017, far exceeding the average of about 14 per year, said Deborah Fauquier, a veterinary medical officer with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Marine Fisheries. \n Ten of the 20 whales that have been examined so far were killed by collisions with boats, something scientists are currently at a loss to explain because there's been no corresponding spike in ship traffic. \n The investigation, which began Thursday, will focus on possible common threads like toxins and illness, prey movement that could bring whales into shipping lanes, or other factors, officials said. \n Humpbacks can grow to 60 feet long and are found in oceans around the world. They're popular with whale watchers because of the dramatic way they breach the ocean's surface, then flop back into the water. \n \"The humpback is generally people's favorite because they're so animated. They're the ones that like to jump out of the ocean completely,\" said Zack Klyver, a naturalist with Bar Harbor Whale Watch Co. \n The humpback whale population that feeds in North Atlantic waters each summer was removed from the Endangered Species Act last year when NOAA divided humpback populations into 14 distinct population segments around the world. There are currently about 10,500 in the population that visits North Atlantic waters, scientists say. \n While they're not threatened, federal scientists are nonetheless keeping close tabs on the whales, said NOAA spokeswoman Kate Brogan. \n The humpback whale deaths that prompted the \"unusual mortality event\" designation break down to 26 last year and 15 to date this year. \n NOAA also declared \"unusual mortality events\" involving humpbacks in 2003, 2005 and 2006, Fauquier said. No conclusive cause of the deaths was determined in those investigations, she said. \n The 10 confirmed fatal boat strikes far exceeds the annual average of fewer than two per year attributed to boat collisions, officials said. \n Whales tend to be somewhat oblivious to boats when they're feeding or socializing, said Gregory Silber, coordinator of recovery activities for large whales in NOAA's Office of Protected Resources. \n \"A vessel of any size can harm a whale. In smaller vessels they tend to be propeller strikes. And in larger vessels they appear to be in the form of blunt trauma, hemorrhaging or broken bones,\" he said. \n Klyver said any whale death is upsetting. Scientists and whale watchers know many of the whales that visit each summer. \n \"Each whale has its own personality,\" he said. \"We are connected to so many of them as individuals that we hate to see any of them perish.\" \n ", "author": "By David Sharp Associated Press", "title": "NOAA investigates increasing humpback whale deaths off East Coast"}

{"date": "April 28, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. listens as President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington. For Donald Trump, master negotiator, making deals with Congress was supposed to be easy. \"This Congress is going to be the busiest Congress we've had in decades, maybe ever,\" Trump predicted shortly after taking office. \n WASHINGTON >> For Donald Trump, self-proclaimed master negotiator, making deals with Congress was supposed to be easy. \"This Congress is going to be the busiest Congress we've had in decades, maybe ever,\" Trump predicted shortly after taking office. \n Not so far. \n With Republicans in charge of the House, the Senate and the White House for the first time in a decade, Trump didn't reckon with the reality of GOP divisions so intractable they may doom his major legislative priorities. \n A restive right flank willing to defy party leaders dealt him a humiliating setback on health care last month. That called into question whether Republicans will ever make good on their longstanding promise of repealing and replacing former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. If they can't, they will likely also struggle to produce the sweeping tax legislation and massive infrastructure investments that Trump promised. \n The White House is pushing House GOP leaders to try again on health care, and there's been recent progress as the conservative House Freedom Caucus endorsed the latest version of the bill. But leaders are struggling to round up support from more moderate Republicans, and it's uncertain when or if the legislation will come to a vote. \n Meanwhile, the government is operating under a one-week, stopgap spending bill to avert a shutdown on Saturday, which coincides with Trump's 100th day in office. Lawmakers needed more time to finish their sweeping $1 trillion legislation for the remainder of the 2017 budget year, work that is Congress' most basic function. \n The White House intervened in the negotiations late in the game to make demands on issues including the U.S.-Mexico border wall \u2014 subsequently dropped. That was an intervention even some Republicans said was not productive. \n With little in the way of actual results so far, some Republicans have begun to fret openly about their thin record of accomplishments, and sound alarms about a backlash from voters if the GOP doesn't begin to produce. \n \"We can't afford to go to the country in 2018 with a Republican president, Republican Senate and Republican House and say 'well we just couldn't get it done,'\" said GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma. \"That's not defensible.\" \n It wasn't supposed to be this way after eight years of chafing under Obama. \n House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky pledged they would seize the opportunity to work with the new Republican president and enact a bold GOP vision starting with making good on seven years of promises to get rid of Obama's health law and replace it with something better. Comprehensive tax reform was to follow, plus work on infrastructure, immigration, an orderly budgeting process emphasizing GOP priorities, and more. \n \"The people have given us unified government. And it wasn't because they were feeling generous. It's because they wanted results,\" Ryan said in his opening day address to the House in January after his election as speaker. \"How could we live with ourselves if we let them down?\" \n It didn't take long for lofty goals to fizzle as it became clear that Republicans, after achieving political success as an opposition party, were less accustomed to the role of governing. \n Trump himself, unfamiliar with the arduous process of legislating, set unrealistic goals, pledging an Obamacare repeal on Day One, something that was never going to happen. Other legislative priorities he had promised to work on with Congress during his first 100 days \u2014 including school choice legislation, ethics reforms and a community safety bill \u2014 have barely been discussed at all. \n The one bright spot that stands out for many Republicans is Senate confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. It took breaking Senate rules to do it, but for many Republicans lifetime appointment of a young and reliably conservative jurist makes up for many other deficiencies. \n \"There are some people I know who voted for Trump solely because he would put a conservative on the court, so they're good,\" said Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla. \n Republicans also point to progress on regulatory issues, with Congress employing a tool called the Congressional Review Act, previously little used, to undo a raft of regulations passed toward the end of the Obama years. \n For their part, Democrats scoff at the GOP's underwhelming record, noting that Congress passed a massive economic stimulus bill and other legislation during Obama's first 100 days. \n \"Republicans have not accomplished very much in the first 100 days,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. \"If they reach out to Democrats and work in a bipartisan way they could get a lot more done.\" \n Republicans say the best could still be yet to come, with House leaders nurturing hopes of passing their health bill as soon as next week along with completing work on the 2017 spending bills, which would allow them to turn to tax legislation and other issues. \n Said Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania: \"I just hope the second 100 days are better than the first.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump, Congress and 100 days: Lofty goals hit reality"}

{"date": "April 28, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n At the Trump administration's request, a federal appeals court agreed Friday to postpone a ruling on lawsuits challenging Obama-era restrictions on carbon emissions. \n WASHINGTON >> In a blow to environmental groups, a federal appeals court agreed today to postpone a ruling on lawsuits that challenge Obama-era limits on carbon emissions. \n The limits are part of the Clean Power Plan, a centerpiece of President Barack Obama's efforts to reduce emissions from existing power plants. The Clean Power Plan was challenged by a coalition of states and industry groups that profit or benefit from the continued burning of coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels. \n The Environmental Protection Agency asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to put the legal fight on hold after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to roll back the plan. Trump has called climate change a hoax, disputing the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the world is warming and that man-made carbon emissions are primarily to blame. \n Today's order from the court agreed to postpone the case for 60 days and asks the parties for guidance on whether the rule should be sent back to the EPA to potentially be revised or repealed. \n While not final, the postponement is letdown to environmentalists who vehemently opposed the request for delay. They have urged the court to rule on the merits of the case, despite the change in administration. \n \"We are in a race against time to address the climate crisis,\" said Vickie Patton, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund. \"Climate progress and clean energy cannot be stopped by the litigation tactics of polluters.\" \n The Supreme Court last year blocked the Clean Power Plan from taking effect while the appeals court considered whether it was legal. Ten judges on the court of appeals in Washington heard arguments in the case last year and could have issued a ruling at any time. \n \"Today's decision by the court is a positive step toward protecting West Virginia coal miners and those who depend upon their success,\" said West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, who was among those who challenged the rules. \"The court recognized the landscape has changed and that a decision on the merits is not appropriate at this time.\" \n The Clean Power Plan sought to reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants by about one-third by 2030, a goal in line with the United States' commitment under the global climate treaty signed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015. About two dozen mostly coal-friendly states and more than 100 companies sued to stop the Clean Power Plan, calling it an unconstitutional power grab. Opponents claim the plan will kill jobs, slash demand for coal and increase electricity prices. \n Trump has pledged to reverse decades of decline in a U.S. coal industry under threat from such cleaner sources of energy as natural gas, wind turbines and solar farms. He has also said he plans to \"renegotiate\" the Paris accord. \n In a second order issued today, the appeals court in Washington also postponed consideration of a separate case challenging an EPA rule capping greenhouse gas emissions from new or renovated power plants. \n Under a prior Supreme Court ruling, EPA is required to regulate carbon emissions. But Trump's appointees could seek to greatly dial back the level of reductions mandated under the Obama-era plan. \n Jonathan Adler, a Case Western Reserve University law professor, said the order gives the Trump administration a chance to show it is moving forward with its own regulations to replace the current plan. He noted that the appeals court is requiring the EPA to submit status reports on its progress every 30 days. \n \"The court doesn't want to rule on something that doesn't have to be ruled upon,\" Adler said. \"At the same time, the court doesn't want the let the agency shirk its obligations, either.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Court agrees to hold off ruling on carbon restrictions"}

Trump is expected to attend a private fundraiser for Republican congressional candidate Karen Handel, a local election that has become a national referendum on his presidency. \n Trump has been a champion of gun rights and supportive of NRA efforts to loosen restrictions on gun ownership. During the campaign, he promised to do away with President Barack Obama's efforts to strengthen background checks and to eliminate gun-free zones at schools and military bases. \n The last president to address an NRA convention was Ronald Reagan, who spoke to the 1983 gathering, according to the powerful gun rights lobby. Trump's appearance in Atlanta has sparked protests. \n The NRA is pushing for federal legislation to make any state's concealed-carry permits valid nationwide. Opponents say the move would effectively turn the weakest gun standards in the nation into the law of the land. The GOP-led Congress already passed a resolution to block a rule that would have kept guns out of the hands of certain people with mental disorders, and Trump quickly signed it. \n Trump, who also attended last year's NRA convention as a candidate, boasts of owning a pair of guns and says his two adult sons are avid hunters. He stirred controversy during the campaign when he suggested that \"Second Amendment people\" could stop his opponent Hillary Clinton, which some interpreted to be a call for violence against the Democratic nominee. Trump disputed that charge. \n White House press secretary Sean Spicer said on the plane trip from Washington that NRA members supported Trump during the election based on his strong commitment to gun rights. He also cited Trump's appointment of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. \n \"I know the NRA is glad to have a justice in that seat who is such a staunch defender of the Constitution,\" he said. \n Kevin Michalowski, executive editor of a magazine published by the United States Concealed Carry Association, said seeing that a president will be addressing the annual meeting \"gives the gun industry a feeling of he's on our side.\" \n The political landscape has changed dramatically with a president now in the White House friendly to the gun industry and gun rights. But Michalowski said it's premature to get complacent with gun sales having tapered off since the election and \"there's always a group out there that opposes the Second Amendment and what it stands for.\" \n After addressing NRA members, Trump is scheduled to attend a private fundraiser for Republican congressional candidate Karen Handel. It's the president's first such endeavor for a congressional hopeful since taking office and confirmation that the GOP sees Georgia's 6th Congressional District runoff as a barometer of the 2018 midterm elections. \n The affluent, well-educated district has been in Republican hands since 1979 \u2014 when the future House Speaker Newt Gingrich took office \u2014 and it still covers the usually conservative northern suburbs of Atlanta. But an upstart Democrat, 30-year-old Jon Ossoff, used an anti-Trump wave to raise more than $8 million ahead of an April 18, multiparty primary and nearly won the seat outright, finishing almost 30 points ahead of Handel, the top Republican vote-getter. \n Handel largely avoided mentioning Trump during the primary campaign, a nod to his struggles in November, when he barely won a district that usually gives GOP presidential nominees more than 60 percent of the vote. \n But Handel has openly embraced the president in the opening days of the runoff campaign. Trump called to congratulate her on qualifying for the runoff and praised her via his personal Twitter account. Both major parties and their aligned organizations have flooded the district with volunteers, paid staffers and promises of millions in additional television advertising ahead of the June 20 second round. \n The winner will succeed Republican Tom Price, who resigned to joint Trump's Cabinet as health secretary. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump tells NRA: 'You have a true friend' in White House"}

The union representing public school principals, athletic directors and other educational officers has reached a tentative new agreement with the state that provides for raises totaling 13.53 percent over the next four years, according to the Hawaii Government Employees Association. \n The union representing public school principals, athletic directors and other educational officers has reached a tentative new agreement with the state that provides for raises totaling 13.53 percent over the next four years, according to the Hawaii Government Employees Association. \n The agreement covers about 900 public employees in HGEA's Unit 6, and if ratified by the membership would run from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2021, the union said. \n On Thursday HGEA announced arbitration decisions that cover six other bargaining units covering about 27,500 public workers, which are binding agreements. However, the new tentative agreement involving Unit 6 is different because it is a negotiated agreement that must be ratified by the union members before it can take effect. \n The union has scheduled a series of ratification meetings for the Unit 6 members today and Saturday in an effort to get the contract finalized. \n Contracts for all 14 of the public worker bargaining units expire on June 30, and the unions have been pressing for settlements last week and this week to try to get the new agreements funded by state lawmakers before the 2017 session of the state Legislature adjourns for the year. Lawmakers are scheduled to end this year's session May 4. \n The tentative agreement with Unit 6 calls for across-the-board pay increases of 1.8 percent on July 1, and salary step pay increases for all members that would take effect Jan. 1, 2018. Union members who cannot receive step increases because they are already at the maximum pay levels under the salary schedule would receive 1.4 percent lump sum payments, HGEA said. \n The agreement also calls for a 2.05 percent across-the-board pay increase on July 1, 2018 and another step movement for employees on Jan. 1, 2019, with another 1.4 percent lump payment for workers who are already at the top of the pay scale. \n Additional 1.8 percent across-the-board pay increases would take effect July 1, 2019 and July 1, 2020, HGEA announced. On Jan. 1, 2020 and Jan. 1, 2021, the union members would receive either another salary-step increase or a 1.4 percent bonus under the tentative agreement. \n Ratification meetings for union members have been scheduled today on Oahu at Kapolei Middle School Cafeteria and Mililani High School from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.; at the Windward School District Office from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.; and McKinley Community School from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. \n A ratification meeting is also scheduled for Saturday at the HGEA 1st Floor Conference Room from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. \n If the tentative agreement is ratified, the agreement will take effect. If it is not, Unit 6 will proceed to an arbitration that is already scheduled to begin June 5, the union said. \n ", "author": "By Kevin Dayton kdayton@staradvertiser.com", "title": "School administrators reach tentative agreement with state"}

{"date": "April 28, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n In this artist rendering provided by Robots in Service of the Environment, a new robot that hunts the dangerous and invasive lionfish made its debut in Bermuda in April. It stuns lionfish with an electric current and then the fish is vacuumed into a container alive and it can later be sold for food. \n WASHINGTON >> A robot zaps and vacuums up venomous lionfish in Bermuda. A helicopter pelts Guam's trees with poison-baited dead mice to fight the voracious brown tree snake. A special boat with giant winglike nets stuns and catches Asian carp in the U.S. Midwest. \n In the fight against alien animals that invade and overrun native species, the weird and wired wins. \n \"Critters are smart \u2014 they survive,\" said biologist Rob \"Goose\" Gosnell, head of U.S. Department of Agriculture's wildlife services in Guam, where brown tree snakes have gobbled up nearly all the native birds. \"Trying to outsmart them is hard to do.\" \n Invasive species are plants and animals that thrive in areas where they don't naturally live, usually brought there by humans, either accidentally or intentionally. Sometimes, with no natural predators, they multiply and take over, crowding out and at times killing native species. \n Now, new technology is being combined with the old methods \u2014 weed pulling, trapping and pesticides. Finding new weapons is crucial because invasive species are costly \u2014 $314 billion per year in damages in just the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa, India and Brazil. It's also one of the leading causes of extinction on islands, such as Guam, according to Piero Genovesi, an Italian scientist who chairs the invasive species task force for an international organization. \n \"We have totally new tools that were just unthinkable a few years ago,\" Genovesi said. \n Case in point: There are companies that now market traps for wild pigs that are triggered by cellphones. \n \"There's enough activity that there's starting to be an industry,\" said University of California, Santa Cruz research biologist Bernie Tershy. \n LIONFISH \n A new underwater robot is targeting the stunning but dangerous lionfish, which has spread over the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and up the U.S. East Coast as far north as New York's Long Island, with its venomous spines that are dangerous to touch. With no natural predator in the Atlantic, the voracious aquarium fish devour large amounts of other fish including key commercial fish species such as snapper and grouper. The robot is the creation of Colin Angle, chief executive officer of IRobot, which makes the Roomba vacuum cleaner. Along with his wife, Erika, and colleagues, he created a new nonprofit to turn automation into environmental tools. \n The robot, called Guardian LF1, uses what Angle says is a gentle shock to immobilize the lionfish before they are sucked alive into a tube. In its first public outing this month, the robot caught 15 lionfish during two days of testing in Bermuda. Top chefs competed in a cook-off of the captured lionfish. Lionfish go for nearly $10 a pound and Angle is hoping to get the price of the robot down from tens of thousands of dollars to about $500. \n \"What's next?\" Angle said. \"Our ambition is much larger than lionfish.\" \n BROWN TREE SNAKES \n A few decades ago, native birds started disappearing from the Pacific island of Guam, baffling scientists until they found that non-native brown tree snakes were eating all the birds and their eggs. The snakes, which live in the trees, had no natural enemies and just trapping them wasn't working, Gosnell said. The snakes did prove to have one enemy: the painkiller acetaminophen, a generic form of Tylenol. \n So biologists came up with a plan : Use a painkiller pill glued to dead fetal mice as bait. The mice are put in tubes, and dropped by helicopter in batches of 3,000. The mice pop out, and the whole contraption dangles in the trees. It's still experimental but it will soon go to more regular use. There is one problem. Using dead fetal mice as bait is expensive and they have to be kept cold. But biologists are working on a solution: mouse butter. A new bait mixture smells like mice to snakes, but minus the expense and logistical problems. \n ASIAN CARP \n U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials are using souped-up old technology to catch Asian carp, a fish that's taken over rivers and lakes in the Midwest. They use a specialized boat \u2014 the Magna Carpa \u2014 with giant winglike nets that essentially uses electric current as an underwater taser to stun the fish, said biologist Emily Pherigo. At higher doses, the fish are killed and float to the surface. In just five minutes, they can collect 500 fish, and later turn them into fertilizer. Using electro-fishing was written about as a possible conservation technique back in 1933, said biologist Wyatt Doyle. \n WILD GOATS \n On the Galapagos islands, wild goats were a major problem. In less than five years, scientists wiped out tens of thousands with sterile \"Mata Hari\" females. Biologist Karl Campbell of the nonprofit Island Conservation introduced specialized female goats that researchers sterilized and chemically altered into a permanent state of heat, to lure the male goats into fruitless goat sex. Santiago Island, once home to 80,000 goats, is now goat free and larger Isabella Island is getting close, he said. \n And now, Campbell and others are going one step further: Tinkering with the genes of mosquitoes and mice to make them sterile or only have male offspring. That would eventually cause a species to die off on an island because of lack of females to mate with. There are worries about regulating and controlling this technology, along with actually being able to get it done, so it is years away, Campbell said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Robots, tasers join battle against invasive species"}
