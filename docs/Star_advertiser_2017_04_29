His body has been recovered from the site and been taken to Lukla, where the only airport in the Mount Everest area is located. \n It was not clear how Steck died but he was planning to climb 8,850-meter (29,035-foot) Mount Everest and nearby Mount Lhotse next month. \n He was the first casualty in the spring mountaineering season in Nepal that began in March and will end in May. Hundreds of foreign climbers are on the mountains to attempt scale Himalayan peaks in May when there are a few windows of favorable weather. \n The 40-year-old Steck was one of the most-renowned mountaineers of his generation. He was best known for his speed-climbing, including setting several records for ascending the north face of the Eiger, a classic mountaineering peak in the Bernese Alps that he climbed in two hours and 47 minutes without using a rope. \n In 2013 he achieved the first solo climb of the Annapurna south face in Nepal after almost losing his life in a fall there in 2007. For that he received the \"Piolet d'Or\" \u2014 considered the Oscar of mountaineering \u2014 the following year. \n In 2015, Steck decided to climb all 82 peaks in the Alps higher than 4,000 meters (13,100 feet) traveling between mountains by foot, bike and paraglider only. He completed the feat in 62 days, helping cement his reputation as the \"Swiss Machine.\" \n Steck said in an interview last month with Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger that he considers himself an \"outsider\" in the mountaineering scene because athletic achievement is more important to him than adventure. \n Asked about his upcoming Everest-Lhotse expedition, involving a quick climb from one peak to the other including an overnight in the \"death zone,\" Steck said: \"When I'm on Everest I can stop at any point. The risk is therefore quite small. For me it's primarily a physical project. Either I get through, or I don't have the strength for the whole traversal.\" \n Asked what he would consider to be success on his expedition, Steck told Tages-Anzeiger: \"Of course I want to climb Everest and Lhotse.

During Obama's final months in office, the Philippine president moved to build closer economic ties with China and Russia while repeatedly threatening to end his nation's longstanding military alliance with the U.S. \n Duterte's apparent dislike for Obama began when the U.S. State Department expressed concern over his drug war \u2014 which has left thousands of suspects dead \u2014 and asked Philippine government officials to take steps to stop extrajudicial killings. \n At one point Duterte suggested he may even move to abrogate a 2014 defense agreement that allows U.S. military access to five Philippine military camps. \n He has walked back most of those threats but has proceeded with his efforts to align closer with China. \n Today, three Chinese navy ships, including a guided-missile destroyer and a guided-missile frigate, were welcomed in Davao city, Duterte's southern hometown, by officials, including presidential daughter and city Mayor Sarah Duterte, military officials said. \n Asked if the rare Chinese naval visits were a sign that Duterte was backing away from Washington, Department of National Defense spokesman Arsenio Andolong said: \"We are not veering away from the U.S. but rather we are expanding our relations with our fellow nations in the global community.\" \n Abella said without elaborating that concern over North Korea also came up in Trump's talk with Duterte. \n Duterte suggested in a news conference Saturday that the Trump administration should back away from an intensifying standoff with North Korea, not in surrender, but to avoid risking a nuclear holocaust that could smother Asia. \n \"It would be good for America to just restrain a little bit and if I were President Trump, I'll just back out, not really in surrender and retreat, but just to let the guy realize that, 'Ah, please do not do it.'\" Duterte said. \n Washington, he said, should not play into provocations of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \n \"It behooves upon America, who wields the biggest stick, just to really be prudent and patient. We know that we are playing with somebody who relishes letting go of his missiles and everything,\" Duterte said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Philippines says Trump called Duterte to affirm alliance"}

The red carpet that once featured Oscar winners, TV stars and a few major-league athletes barely turned heads. \n Instead, speakers at the dinner promoted press freedom and responsibility and challenged Trump's accusations of dishonest reporting. \n The stars of the night were Watergate reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who recounted what they learned about journalism from their reporting for The Washington Post that helped lead to President Richard Nixon's resignation more than 40 years ago. \n \"Like politicians and presidents sometimes, perhaps too frequently, we make mistakes and go too far,\" Woodward said. \"When that happens we should own up to it. But the effort today to get this best obtainable version of the truth is largely made in good faith. Mr. President, the media is not 'fake news.'\" \n The evening was not without humor aimed at the press and Trump. \n \"We've got to address the elephant that's not in the room,\" cracked the entertainment headliner, Hasan Minhaj of \"The Daily Show\" on TV's Comedy Central. \"The leader of our country is not here. And that's because he lives in Moscow. It's a very long flight. As for the other guy, I think he's in Pennsylvania because he can't take a joke.\" \n Trump was indeed in Pennsylvania, having scheduled a rally in Harrisburg to mark his 100th day in office. He began his remarks with a lengthy if familiar attack on the news media while dismissing the dinner and its participants. \n \"A large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation's capital right now,\" Trump said. He added: \"And I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from Washington's swamp, spending my evening with all of you and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people, right?\" \n Trump became the first president since Ronald Reagan in 1981 to skip the event \u2014 and Reagan was recovering from an assassination attempt. \n The official WHCA dinner began in 1921. In recent decades, the event offered Washington's press corps an opportunity to wear black tie and stunning gowns while mixing with celebrity guests. Most people trace that development to 1987, when Baltimore Sun reporter Michael Kelly brought Fawn Hall, the secretary at the center of the Iran-Contra affair. \n Jeff Mason, the WHCA president, said before the event that this year's dinner would have been different even if Trump had attended, \"based on the tension that has existed in the relationship and some of the things he has said about the press. We were preparing for a different dinner, either way.\" \n The correspondents' dinner was briefly upstaged Saturday afternoon when late-night TV star Samantha Bee of \"Full Frontal\" pulled in celebrities for the first \"Not the White House Correspondents' Dinner,\" among them Alysia Reiner of \"Orange Is the New Black,\" Retta of \"Parks and Recreation\" and Matt Walsh of \"Veep.\" \n Bee's taped show, a tongue-in-cheek tribute to American news organizations, featured actor Will Ferrell and other guests roasting Trump and his allies.

{"date": "April 29, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump looks out an Oval Office window at the White House in Washington following an interview with The Associated Press. \n WASHINGTON >> Health care is complicated. China can be a useful ally. NATO isn't obsolete. Being president is hard. \n Over the course of his 100 days in office, President Donald Trump has been startlingly candid about his public education in the ways of Washington and the world. \n He's been blocked by the courts and befuddled by a divided Republican Party that's running Congress, and his first months on the job have left the long-time reality-TV and real estate tycoon struggling for major governing victories and searching for a new approach to many of his campaign promises. \n His \"America first\" campaign rhetoric has bumped up against the challenges of conflict overseas. His ambitious declarations on health care and immigration have run into the limits of Congress and the courts. \n A president who prides himself on his ideological flexibility has struggled to manage a novice political team, split between moderate and conservative advisers, and he's found himself reaching out to the friends and business associates from the world he left behind. \n On foreign policy, Trump has been persuaded by foreign leaders and has leaned heavily on a national security team with more governing experience than his political advisers. He's looked for lessons in his biggest victory: putting a conservative judge, Neil Gorsuch, on the Supreme Court. \n \"I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility. And the human responsibility,\" Trump said in an Associated Press interview, assessing the difficulty of the presidency. \n \"This is tougher than what he thought,\" said Trump friend and business partner Phil Ruffin, who has visited the president twice since he took office Jan. 20. \"In business, you make a decision and it happens. In government, it's not like that.\" \n Just days into Trump's presidency, the courts rejected his first travel ban. Since then, they've pushed back on his rewritten travel ban and his attempt to cut federal money for cities that harbor people who are in the United States illegally. But Trump's roughest lesson has come from Congress, which has balked at his attempt to repeal the Obama-era health law his party campaigned against for years. \n During the campaign, Trump said the Affordable Care Act would be gone on his first day in the White House. In the weeks after his inauguration, the realities set it. \n By February, he told a group of governors that \"it's an unbelievably complex subject,\" adding: \"Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.\" \n For Trump, the health care battle was a rude introduction to the complicated internal politics in the Republican-run House, which includes hard-liners in the Freedom Caucus and moderates in the Tuesday Group. When the White House made concessions to conservatives, it pushed some moderates away, and vice versa. \n Unable to cut a deal in late March, House Republicans pulled the health bill from consideration. Trump lashed out at Freedom Caucus leaders on Twitter and indicated he would seek retribution come campaign season. \n Trump's team tried to pick up the pieces but hasn't gotten there yet. A renewed burst of momentum this past week, buoyed by hopes the House would vote before Saturday, Trump's 100th day, petered out. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said he would not be rushed by the president's deadline. \n The contrast between the scuttled first attempt on health care and the relative smooth sailing of Gorsuch was a learning experience. The takeaway: working behind the scenes with outside groups, which lined up solidly behind Gorsuch, and lawmakers can pay dividends. \n \"Outreach to partner organizations starting sooner is helpful and I think that you will see that,\" said Marc Short, the White House legislative director. \"Probably we were a little bit surprised when we engaged some of the conservative groups on health care that they felt they'd been left out of the conversation from the Hill.\" \n None of Trump's top advisers had deep experience in legislating. Now they've begun to compensate with outreach. The White House has hosted 230 members of Congress, and there have been 10 bowling sessions in the Executive Mansion's basement. But no amount of bowling can overcome the division in the Republican Party. \n The president has seemed taken aback. \n In the AP interview, Trump said there was \"a pretty vast area\" between the approach by the most conservative members of his party and those who are more moderate. \n To bridge the divides, Trump's advisers have worked to moderate between the factions as his team tries to revive the health bill. The White House is taking a similar approach on the president's tax plan. \n Restless in Washington, Trump is working at \"breakneck speed,\" chief of staff Reince Priebus told reporters. Sometimes so quickly that his own advisers can't keep up. \n The president's declaration last week that his team would release a tax proposal before the 100 day mark startled some in the White House, who scrambled to put together the one-page outline that was released Wednesday. \n The proposal lacks the details about making taxes simpler and more efficient in ways that don't add to the federal government's mounting debt. Those are core Republican principles that would require lawmakers to eliminate or reduce precious tax breaks enjoyed by millions of people. \n Trump did meet his goal of starting work on the plan in his first 100 days, but another tough challenge awaits on Capitol Hill as he still contends with health care. \n Trump's frustration with a lack of progress has sometimes erupted in anger \u2014 and sometimes in the direction of his political advisers. He's frequently blamed his team for being unable to quash negative stories. He was particularly incensed by the steady drip of revelations about his campaign's possible ties to Russia. \n After Attorney General Jeff Sessions stepped aside from Russia investigations because of his own undisclosed contacts with a Russian ambassador, Trump unleashed on his top advisers in an Oval Office meeting. Sessions' decision overshadowed Trump's well-received first address to Congress days earlier; it was a speech the White House hoped would give the president a burst of momentum. \n But ultimately it was Trump himself who created the biggest distraction. The morning after his Oval Office row with his staff, he tweeted a series of inflammatory accusations about his predecessor wiretapping Trump's New York skyscraper. \n One of the lowest moments of Trump's young administration was the forced resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who misled the White House about his Russia ties. Flynn's departure cleared the way for a well-received overhaul of the National Security Council. \n Trump has relied heavily on Flynn's replacement, Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who has formed an alliance of experience with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. The president has largely heeded their advice on major foreign policy decisions and given the Pentagon vast control over military operations around the world. \n It's been Trump's evolution on foreign affairs that's perhaps been clearest to track. \n Confronted with photos of injured children, victims of a chemical attack in Syria, Trump quickly pivoted from what he billed as an \"America first\" policy during the campaign in favor of intervention. \n After listening to European leaders make the case for NATO, he stopped saying it was obsolete. \n And after pleas from business executives and warnings of economic turmoil from foreign leaders, Trump just this week abruptly abandoned plans to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement. \n Each shift has different forces behind it. \n On Syria, Priebus said he said sees a \"Trump Doctrine\" coming into focus: a combination of putting America first but not sitting around while world injustices, such as the Syrian government's alleged use of chemical weapons, go unanswered. \n In some cases, Trump has acknowledged he was ill-informed during his campaign. As a candidate, he dismissed the NATO alliance without knowing much about it, he told AP last week. \"Now I know a lot.\" \n He had pledged to label China a currency manipulator, part of his tough-on-China populist rhetoric. But after a particularly warm visit from President Xi Jinping, Trump acknowledged the downside to alienating a power that could be a useful partner in curbing North Korea's nuclear program. \n \"The bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he's helping us with North Korea,\" he said. \"What am I going to do, say, 'By the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you're a currency manipulator.' It doesn't work that way.\" \n Trump has proved to be open to persuasion, particularly from world leaders and outside forces. When news spread Thursday that Trump was considering triggering the U.S. withdrawal from NAFTA, the leaders of Mexico and Canada launched a diplomatic full-court press to persuade Trump to rethink the plan. It took only a matter of hours before the president relented. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump's first 100 days: A president's very public education"}

{"date": "April 29, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Organizers of the Fyre Festival in the Bahamas, produced by a partnership that includes rapper Ja Rule, have canceled the weekend event at the last minute Friday after many people had already arrived and spent thousands of dollars on tickets and travel. \n In this day and age, the young and beautiful live and die on social media. \n In the case of the ill-fated Fyre Festival \u2014 a multiday music, art and culture party that promised \"an invitation to let loose and unplug with the likeminded\" on the Bahamian island of Exuma \u2014 it's been a sudden and ugly death, chronicled in real-time on YouTube and filtered through Facebook. \n Organizers canceled the event at the last minute after poor planning, disorganization and lack of accommodations. Most of the A-list acts had pulled out of the festival days before, citing a lack of payment. \n It was supposed to be a sun-soaked experience filled with yachts, gourmet food and models. Ticket prices ranged from $500 to $12,000. \n But by Saturday morning, the partygoers had decamped, many of them to hotels in Miami in hopes of salvaging a weekend. People decried the festival accommodations as being like a \"disaster tent city\" and a \"refugee camp.\" \n The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism expressed its deep disappointment in a statement sent to the media. \n \"Hundreds of visitors to Exuma were met with total disorganization and chaos,\" the tourism office wrote in a statement. \n In a statement posted on the Fyre Festival website Saturday, co-organizer Billy McFarland said festival goers will be refunded in full. \"We will be working on refunds over the next few days and will be in touch directly with guests with more details. Also, all guests from this year will have free VIP passes to next year's festival,\" he wrote. \n The hype for Fyre Festival began months ago, marketed with slick videos on social media. \n \"I saw it on Instagram and booked it before the lineup was announced,\" said Mitch Purgason, a 25-year-old bespoke menswear designer in Charlotte, North Carolina. \n The Instagram ads looked especially \"ridiculous\" \u2014 parlance for amazing \u2014 what with models like Gigi Hadid and rapper Ja Rule. Blink-182 was supposed to perform. Photos of the impossibly blue water and the sugary sandy beach looked incredible. And the veritable icing on the cake: wild, docile pigs lived on the beach and swam in the warm water, perfect props for a killer Instagram selfie. \n Although the festival on the island chain east of Florida appeared to cater to the Millennial trust fund crowd, it was people like Purgason and 29-year-old Jake Strang of Pittsburgh who purchased early tickets \u2014 young professionals who wanted to spend a fun weekend in the tropics. \n Like Purgason, Strang paid $500 for a flight to the island from Miami, lodging and food. Strang and seven of his friends planned the trip to coincide with a birthday. They reserved a \"lodge\" for eight, with four king beds and a seating area in the middle. \n \"Everything made it look amazing,\" said Strang. \n The festival website was also enticing. It promised a treasure hunt of \"exceptional proportions,\" with over $1 million in riches to be found. It also said the event would be held on a private island. \n Purgason said he was skeptical, but went ahead with the planned vacation anyway. \"Worst case scenario, I figured, we're still in the Bahamas in a villa.\" \n His first inkling that something was amiss came on Thursday morning. Purgason was on the first flight from Miami to Exuma and when they landed, organizers said the villas weren't ready. So they whisked the planeload of partygoers to a restaurant at a nearby resort. He noted that it wasn't a private island at all. \n Still, food and drink were free and plenty. Cute pigs and bikini-clad girls roamed the beach. There was a DJ. \n \"They actually treated us pretty well,\" he said. \"The first three hours was dope.\" \n Jenna Conlin, 30, an advertising professional in Venice, California, said, \"They were putting down bottles of tequila on every table in an attempt to make everybody happy.\" \n Strang flew in later Thursday and wasn't so lucky. \n \"When we arrived, it essentially looked like a construction site. It looked like they were trying to sell lots for homes,\" he said. \n The festival goers were suddenly told by the promoter to find a tent, and waved his arm in a direction. But the tents had holes that had obviously allowed rain to come in because the beds were wet. They were given a Styrofoam container of food that involved \"two slices of ham, lettuce and one slice of cheese on soggy bread,\" Strang said. \n A few lucky patrons had been relocated to resorts. Most were left to find beds in the tents. \n It wasn't like it was easy to just grab another hotel room; Exuma is a small island with a population of about 7,000, without the well-developed tourist infrastructure of Nassau or Freeport. The island's hotels were already booked months in advance by a well-known regatta, wrote Robert Carron, owner of the Bahamas Tribune newspaper. \n By daybreak, people had already started to line up and complain, and buses began taking people to the airport. It was official: the festival was cancelled. Word got out via social media that organizers issued a statement citing \"circumstances out of our control\" for their inability to prepare the \"physical infrastructure\" for the event in the largely undeveloped Exuma. \n \"I'm heartbroken at this moment,\" Ja Rule, whose real name is Jeffrey Atkins, said on Twitter. \"I wanted this to be an amazing event.

A wet spring snow fell in Denver, where several hundred activists posed in the shape of a giant thermometer for a photograph and a dozen people rode stationary bikes to power the loudspeakers.

Trump has called climate change a hoax, disputing the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the world is warming and that man-made carbon emissions are primarily to blame. \n Among those attending the Chicago rally were members of the union representing Environmental Protection Agency employees. Trump has proposed cutting the EPA's budget by almost one-third, eliminating more than 3,000 jobs. \n John O'Grady, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, called the march \"a chance to speak out in unity against this administration\" and its \"ridiculous gutting of the EPA budget and staffing.\" \n More than 2,000 people gathered at the Maine State House in Augusta. Speakers included a lobsterman, a solar company owner and members of the Penobscot Nation tribe. \n \"I've seen firsthand the impacts of climate change to not only the Gulf of Maine, but also to our evolving fisheries, and to the coastal communities that depend upon them,\" said lobsterman Richard Nelson of Friendship, Maine. \n People in the crowd spoke about the importance of addressing climate change to industries such as renewable energy, forestry, farming and seafood. Saharlah Farah, a 16-year old immigrant from Somalia who lives in Portland, talked about how climate change could have a bigger toll on marginalized groups that have less financial resources. \n \"But I see untapped power here today,\" she said. \n A demonstration stretched for several blocks in downtown Tampa, Florida, where marchers said they were concerned about the threat rising seas pose to the city. \n People gathered on the Boston Common carried signs with slogans such as \"Dump Trump.\" Handmade signs at Seattle's march included the general \u2014 \"Love Life\" \u2014 and the specific \u2014 \"Don't Kill Otters.\" \n Some of the marches drew big-name attendees, including former Vice President Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the nation's capital.

From left, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Lao Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith. \n MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 Southeast Asian leaders ended their annual summit in Manila on Saturday without any sign that host Philippines raised its crucial arbitration victory against China over disputed South China Sea territories. \n President Rodrigo Duterte has said he would not raise the July 12 ruling, which invalidated China's historic claims to most of the disputed waters, as he moved to warm once-frosty ties with and secure infrastructure funding from Beijing. \n Duterte, who took office in June, has promised to take up the decision with China during his six-year term. The 72-year-old leader, however, faced calls to raise the ruling in the summit of leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that he hosted Saturday. \n A final draft of the communique Duterte would issue after the summit did not mention his country's arbitration triumph over China. \n An alternative phrase, \"full respect for legal and diplomatic processes,\" was removed from a South China Sea chapter and moved elsewhere in the draft statement as Chinese officials have requested, three Philippine officials told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters. \n \"Non-mention of The Hague ruling would be a diplomatic triumph for China,\" said former Philippine national security adviser Roilo Golez, referring to the European tribunal that issued the landmark decision. \n \"It might embolden them to advance some more in their South China Sea master plan,\" said Golez, who has called for a stronger Philippine response to increasingly bolder steps by China to assert its claims in the disputed sea, one of the world's busiest. \n Duterte has said he would not take up the arbitration ruling in the ASEAN summit because it was an issue between China and the Philippines and did not concern other members of the 10-nation regional bloc. \n Aside from the Philippines, ASEAN members Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam also are involved in the territorial conflicts, which many fear could spark the next major armed conflict in economically bustling Asia. China and Taiwan constitute the rest of the claimants of the waters that are believed to be sitting atop potential oil and gas deposits. \n Concern over the standoff between North Korea and President Donald Trump's administration also was high on the agenda of the ASEAN summit. \n Duterte suggested Saturday to his American counterpart to back away from an intensifying standoff with North Korea, not in surrender but to avoid risking a nuclear holocaust that could smother Asia. \n Duterte said at a news conference after hosting the summit that he expected a call from Trump later Saturday. He said he would ask the U.S. president \"to see to it that there is no war because my region will suffer immensely.\" \n The Philippine leader did not explain why Trump planned to call him. \n Duterte said: \"It would be good for America to just restrain a little bit, and if I were President Trump, I'll just back out, not really in surrender and retreat.\" \n \"It behooves upon America, who wields the biggest stick, just to really be prudent and patient. We know that we are playing with somebody who relishes letting go of his missiles and everything,\" he said. \n During the daylong summit, the spotlight also was on Duterte. \n The 72-year-old leader faces a mass murder complaint before the International Criminal Court and an impeachment bid at home as bodies continue to pile up in his drugs campaign. \n Duterte found solace from the storm of criticism in ASEAN, which has a bedrock policy forbidding member states from meddling in each other's domestic affairs. \n That has helped ASEAN, founded a half-century ago, to become an unwieldy collective of dictatorships, authoritarian states and a monarchy, along with fledgling democracies. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "No sign Philippines raised sea feud win vs. China in summit"}

{"date": "April 29, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n President Donald Trump walks across the South Lawn as he arrives at the White House in Washington, Friday, April 28, 2017, returning from traveling to Atlanta to speak at the National Rifle Association Leadership Forum. \n WASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump today marked his 100th day in office by saying he had brought \"profound change\" to Washington and reaffirming that \"my only allegiance\" is to those he governs. \n On a threshold that Trump has both derided and tried to define, the president also said he is putting Americans first even as he learns on the job. \n \"My only allegiance is to you, our wonderful citizens,\" Trump said in his weekly radio address. \n It was a preview of a day on which Trump traveled to Pennsylvania to emphasize such priorities as American manufacturing, better trade deals for the U.S. and his underdog victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in November. He also was promoting a still-to-be defined tax cut plan and the nation's strong economy, on which many of his political fortunes rest. \n Meanwhile, North Korea's missile launch Saturday signaled its continued defiance against the U.S., China and other nations, on which Trump tweeted: \"Bad!\" Asked on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" if military action would follow a nuclear test by the North, Trump responded: \"I don't know. I mean, we'll see.\" \n Trump's 100th day events were set in politically important Pennsylvania, which he won with 48 percent of the vote. It was the first time the state had voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush in 1988. \n In Pennsylvania, Trump was visiting a shovel company when he signed an executive order directing the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to conduct a study of U.S. trade agreements. The goal is to determine whether America is being treated fairly by its trading partners and the 164-nation World Trade Organization. \n The AMES Companies in Pennsylvania's Cumberland County has manufactured shovels since 1774. After Trump's visit there, he was to hold a campaign-style rally in Harrisburg, the state capital. Democrats planned their own rally nearby. \n Trump's 100-day rally was a bit of counterprogramming from the former reality television star. Back in Washington, media organizations and a few stars were gathering on Saturday for the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner. Trump, who has derided journalists as \"dishonest\" and even enemies of the American people, is the first president since 1981 to stay away from the event. That year, Ronald Reagan was recovering from an assassination attempt. \n At the 100-day mark, Trump chose instead to spend the evening with people who helped elect him and, polls show, remain largely in his corner. Though the White House created a website touting its accomplishments of the first hundred days, Trump has tried to downplay the importance of the marker, perhaps out of recognition that many of his campaign promises have gone unfulfilled. \n \"It's a false standard, 100 days,\" Trump said while signing an executive order on Friday, \"but I have to tell you, I don't think anybody has done what we've been able to do in 100 days, so we're very happy.\" \n His rally Saturday in Pennsylvania will give him a chance \"to talk to voters about what he has done over the past 100 days and how he sees the next 100 days and the 100 days after that,\" White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said. \n A failed effort to overhaul President Barack Obama's health care law behind him, Trump is turning to what he's billed as the nation's biggest tax cut. It apparently falls short of Reagan's in 1981, and tax experts are skeptical that the plan would pay for itself, as Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has claimed. \n The economy, so far, has been Trump's ally. Polls show that Americans feel slightly better about his job performance on that subject than his job performance overall. \n \"Together we are seeing that great achievements are possible when we put American people first,\" Trump said in his weekly radio and internet address. \"That is why I withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That day was a turning point for our nation. It put the countries of this world on notice that the sellout of the American worker was over.\" \n He said in his remarks: \"In just 14 weeks, my administration has brought profound change to Washington.\" \n Executive orders in line to be signed Saturday would be the 31st and 32nd since Trump took office \u2014\u2014 the most of any president in his first 100 days since World War II. During the campaign, Trump railed against Obama's use of orders, which don't need congressional approval. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump says he's brought 'profound change' to Washington"}

{"date": "April 29, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n From left, EU Chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk make their way to a media conference at an EU summit in Brussels on Saturday, April 29, 2017. \n BRUSSELS >> European Union leaders vowed Saturday to stand shoulder-to-shoulder behind their negotiating team during the divorce proceedings with Britain and warned that demands from British Prime Minister Theresa May will be dealt with \"firmly.\" \n The 27 EU leaders in Brussels finalized the cornerstones of their negotiating stance within four minutes of starting a short smooth summit, a month after the British leader triggered two years of exit talks on March 29. The negotiations themselves are to open shortly after Britain holds an early election on June 8. \n \"We now have unanimous support from all the 27 member states and the EU institutions, giving us a strong political mandate for these negotiations\" under chief negotiator Michel Barnier, EU Council President Donald Tusk said. \n Tusk said there can't be any discussions on the future relationship between the EU and Britain until there has been major headway on key issues. \n \"We must first achieve sufficient progress on citizens' rights, finances and the border issue in Ireland. It is too early to speculate on when this might happen,\" Tusk said Saturday. \n He said the 27 leaders would unanimously have to say there was \"sufficient progress\" to allow the talks to go to the next phase. That would give any EU country with a dispute with Britain, like Spain over Gibraltar, major influence over the timetable of the talks. \n The negotiating guidelines also halted British hopes of having future trade relations being discussed concurrently through the talks. \n \"Before discussing the future, we have to sort out our past. We will handle it with genuine care \u2014 but firmly,\" Tusk said. \n Some at the summit were already considering how to deal with possible British negotiating tactics. \n \"Maybe the British government will do its utmost to split the 27 nations. It is a trap we need to avoid,\" said Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel. \n Ever since the June 23 referendum last year in which Britons narrowly voted to leave the bloc, the unity of the remaining 27 EU nations \"has been really exemplary,\" said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \n In contrast, citizens in Britain have been divided because of the momentous changes looming. \n The EU is also intent on making Britain pay a divorce bill, which some EU officials have put as high as 60 billion euros ($65 billion). The money aims to pay for everything from pensions to financial commitments already made in the EU's 7-year-budget, which runs until 2020. \n French President Francois Hollande said the leaders agreed on \"a simple principle,\" applicable to Britain or any other country that might want to quit the bloc in the future, \"that they must not be in a more favorable situation on the outside than they were on the inside.\" \n \"There is always a price, a cost, a consequence from quitting the Union,\" Hollande said at his farewell European summit. \n To kick off the negotiations with Britain, Tusk wants to center on the millions of people living in each other's nations who would be immediately affected. \n All sides \"need solid guarantees for all citizens and their families who will be affected by Brexit on both sides. This must be the No. 1 priority,\" Tusk said. \n Some 3 million citizens from the 27 nations live in Britain while up to 2 million Britons live on the continent, all facing massive uncertainty on such issues as health benefits, pensions, taxes, employment and education. \n Tusk said the sustained unity of the 27 will help May since she will have political certainty throughout the talks. \n \"Our unity is also in the U.K.'s interest,\" he said. \n Over the past years, the bloc has often been bitterly divided over issues like the financial crisis, the euro debt crisis, bailouts to financially-strapped members like Greece and how to deal with the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have been entering the bloc. \n The 27 EU leaders also acknowledged that Northern Ireland could join the bloc in the future if its people vote to unite with EU member Ireland. The two share the same island, and the difficulties of re-establishing a land border once Britain leaves the EU are immense and politically fraught. \n Irish Prime Minister Edna Kenny said if a Northern Irish referendum to break away from the United Kingdom is approved \"at some time in the future, EU membership is assured, and is unanimously accepted by the European Council.\" \n Kenny stressed that such a referendum was not in sight at this stage. \n Future relations between Ireland and Britain, including how the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would work with the U.K. outside the bloc, have emerged as a key problem. \n Kenny conceded that EU unity will be tested once negotiations start, given the challenge of accommodating the sometimes-competing interests of the countries involved. \n \"It won't all be as calm and as measured as today,\" he said. \n EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker already complained Saturday that \"Britain currently blocks the decision-making\" on a review of the EU's long-term budget. \n \"It would be good and it would make the start of the talks easier if Britain could lift its objection,\" Juncker said. \n British officials say the government prefers to postpone the decision on such an important matter as the EU budget until after the election is over. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "EU leaders unite ahead of Brexit divorce talks with UK"}

{"date": "April 29, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Pope Francis arrives to celebrate Mass for Egypt's tiny Catholic community, at the Air Defense Stadium in Cairo, today. \n CAIRO (AP) >> Military helicopters flew overhead and police fanned out in force Saturday as Pope Francis celebrated an open-air Mass for Egypt's tiny Catholic community on the second and final day of a visit aimed at comforting Christians following a series of attacks by Islamic militants.  \n Despite the security concerns, Francis zoomed around the Cairo sports stadium in an open-topped golf cart before the start of Mass, evidence of his desire to be close to his flock at all costs. \n The crowd cheered him wildly, waiving Egyptian and Holy See flags and swaying to hymns sung by church choirs. The defense ministry's stadium has a capacity of 25,000, but it was less than half-full, a reflection that Catholics represent less than 1 percent of Egypt's 92 million people. \n In his homily, Francis urged them to be good and merciful to their fellow Egyptians, saying \"the only fanaticism believers can have is that of charity!\" \n \"Any other fanaticism does not come from God and is not pleasing to him!\" he said. \n It was a very pastoral message after Francis on his first day demanded that Muslim leaders renounce religious fanaticism that leads to violence. Francis made the appeal during a landmark visit to Cairo's Al-Azhar, the revered, 1,000-year-old seat of Sunni Islam learning that trains clerics and scholars from around the world. \n Security was exceptionally tight around the stadium and in the upscale neighborhood where Francis spent the night, with uniformed and plain-clothed police stationed every meter (yard) or so along his motorcade route. Police used metal detectors to check vehicles for explosives and armed guards stood watch, some on rooftops, their faces covered. \n But Francis decided to forego the bullet-proof \"popemobile\" that his predecessors used on foreign trips and drove through Cairo in a simple Fiat, his window rolled down. \n His gestures sent a defiant message to the extremist Islamic State group, whose local affiliate in Egypt has vowed to go after Egypt's Christians to punish them for their support of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. \n El-Sissi, as defense minister, led the military's ouster of the Islamist Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president whose one-year rule proved divisive. \n Already, attacks against Christians in northern Sinai, the epicenter of the insurgency, have forced hundreds of families to flee the region, seeking refuge elsewhere in Egypt. Recent attacks on churches \u2014 one in Cairo in December and twin Palm Sunday attacks in cities north of the Egyptian capital \u2014 have claimed at least 75 lives and injured scores. \n The attacks led to heightened security at churches nationwide and the declaration by el-Sissi of a state of emergency. \n Francis strongly backed the government's crackdown on the extremists Friday, saying Egypt was uniquely placed to bring peace to the region and \"vanquish all violence and terrorism.\" \n He ended the day paying tribute to the victims of a December bombing at central Cairo's St. Peter's church, which is located in close proximity to the St. Mark's cathedral, the seat of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Blood on one of the church walls remains along with pictures of the victims in remembrance of the attack. \n His visit drew praise from Egyptian Catholics, who haven't seen a pope in their land since St. John Paul II visited in 2000. \n \"He is a messenger of peace, he is really a messenger of peace,\" said Amgad Eskandr before the Mass got under way at the stadium. \"All his words talk about peace, call for peace, push for peace which is great.\" \n What is at stake in Egypt, home to one of the world's oldest Christian communities, is to prevent a repeat of what happened in Iraq in the years that followed the 2003 ouster of dictator Saddam Hussein, when militants of al-Qaida \u2014 the IS forerunner in Iraq \u2014 systematically targeted the country's ancient Christian minority and forced many to flee. \n Pope Tawadros II, the spiritual leader of Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Christians, is a close el-Sissi ally who has tirelessly advocated Muslim-Christian harmony. \"Egyptians are united in pain and in joy,\" he told Francis on Friday. \n After Mass on Saturday, Francis will meet with Catholic priests and seminarians before returning to Rome. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pope celebrates open-air Mass in Cairo"}

They include the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports which together form the largest container shipping port in the nation. But the ports also have a contentious labor history. \n SAN FRANCISCO >> Dockworkers were given the chance Friday to vote on a new contract extension that could provide long-term labor peace at West Coast seaports, where in recent years work slowdowns and strikes have affected billions of dollars in cargo. \n Union delegates for 29 ports from Washington to California voted to allow about 20,000 rank-and-file members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union to vote on a proposal from employers. \n The deal from the Pacific Maritime Association would move the expiration date of the current contract from 2019 to 2022. \n The offer includes a wage increase of 3.1 percent per year and pension increases. \n The Pacific Maritime Association, which represents shipping companies and port terminal operators, praised the decision to bring the offer to a vote. \n \"Extending our contract would maintain stability on the waterfront for the next five years \u2013 a crucial time as the West Coast waterfront faces increased competition from other North American ports, and as the maritime industry continues to battle global economic challenges,\" spokesman Wade Gates said. \n West Coast ports handle a huge volume of trans-Pacific trade that is vital to the U.S. economy. They include the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports which together form the largest container shipping port in the nation. \n But the ports also have a contentious labor history. \n In early 2015, bitter negotiations over the contract now in effect caused major disruptions in the flow of cargo. Ports from San Diego to Seattle were all but shut down as the two sides haggled. Companies that accused workers of coordinated slowdowns decided to cut their shifts, shuttering ports on nights and weekends. \n The tit-for-tat led to long lines of ships queueing outside of harbors, waiting for space at the docks. \n Other strikes and lockouts affecting longshoremen, port clerks and truckers have also proven costly over the years. \n The contract extension is aimed at ensuring West Coast ports remain a reliable gateway for international commerce. Importers and exporters have another option in the newly expanded Panama Canal, which allows larger ships to ply the route between the East and Gulf coasts and Asia. Ports on the Pacific coast of Mexico and Canada also are vying for U.S. business. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Dockworkers to vote on deal seeking labor peace"}
