Three people were killed by flooding and winds in Arkansas, with officials saying two more people are missing. Rushing water swept away a car, drowning a woman in Missouri; and a death was reported in Sunday morning storms that raked Mississippi. \n Flooding closed part of Interstate 44 near Hazelgreen, Missouri, and officials expected it would be at least a day before the highway reopened. Interstate 70 in western Kansas was closed because crews were waiting for snow falling at 3 to 4 inches an hour being blown by 35 mph winds to subside. \n An Arkansas volunteer fire department chief was killed while working during storms in north-central Arkansas, state police said. \n Cove Creek/Pearson Fire Chief Doug Decker died shortly before 4 a.m. Sunday after being struck by a vehicle while checking water levels on Highway 25 near Quitman, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) north of Little Rock, Trooper Liz Chapman said. It wasn't known if he will be included as a storm-related death, she said. \n Rescuers in northwest Arkansas continued Sunday to look for an 18-month-old girl and a 4-year-old boy who were in a vehicle swept off a bridge by floodwaters in Hindsville, the Madison County Sheriff's Office said. \n In northwest Arkansas, a 10-year-old girl drowned in Springdale and the body of a woman who disappeared riding an inner tube Saturday was found in a creek in Eureka Springs. Also, a 65-year-old woman in DeWitt in the eastern part of the state was struck and killed in her home by a falling tree, officials said. \n In Texas, search teams were going door to door Sunday after the tornadoes the day before flattened homes, uprooted trees and flipped several pickup trucks at a Dodge dealership in Canton. \n \"It is heartbreaking and upsetting to say the least,\" Canton Mayor Lou Ann Everett told reporters at a news conference Sunday morning. \n The storms cut a path of destruction 35 miles long and 15 miles wide in Van Zandt County, Everett said. The largely rural area is about 50 miles east of Dallas. \n The National Weather Service found evidence of four tornadoes with one twister possibly on the ground for 50 miles. \n The first reports of tornadoes came about 4:45 p.m. Saturday, but emergency crews were hampered by continuing severe weather, said Judge Don Kirkpatrick, the chief executive for Van Zandt County. \n \"We'd be out there working and get a report of another tornado on the ground,\" he said. \n The storms rolled through Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama on Sunday with strong winds causing isolated pockets of damage. In Durant in central Mississippi on person died in the storms. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency didn't give details. \n Alexa Haik went to bed Saturday night expecting just rain, but heard the sirens Sunday morning and turned on the television to see the tornado warning. She rounded up her pets and hid in a hallway with her family, then was stunned to emerge to trees down all in her neighborhood in Clinton, Mississippi, about 20 miles (32 km) west of Jackson. \n A trip up the road showed how isolated the worst of the storms were. \"I really thought when we got out of our neighborhood, there would be damage everywhere. But our little subdivision was the only one hit,\" Haik said. \n Near Clever in southwestern Missouri, a man tried to save his 72-year-old wife from floodwaters that swept away their vehicle Saturday, but her body was found when the water receded, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said. \n A second death from weekend flooding was announced Sunday by Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens but he did not release any details about the victim or the circumstances of the death. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "10 killed by storms and flooding in South and Midwest"}

{"date": "April 30, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Chaz Wing types labels for electronic equipment he fixes and sells at a flea market in Brunswick, Maine. From almost his first day at Brunswick Junior High, Chaz said kids harassed him. Complaining to teachers and administrators didn't help, he said. \n BRUNSWICK, Maine >> Chaz Wing was 12 when they cornered him in the school bathroom. The students who tormented him were children, too, entering the age of pimples and cracking voices. \n Eventually, he swore under oath, the boys raped him and left him bleeding, the culmination of a year of harassment. Though Chaz repeatedly told teachers and administrators about the insults and physical attacks, he didn't report being sexually assaulted until a year later, launching a long legal fight over whether his school had done enough to protect him. \n Chaz's saga is more than a tale of escalating bullying. Across the U.S., thousands of students have been sexually assaulted, by other students, in high schools, junior highs and even elementary schools \u2014 a hidden horror educators have long been warned not to ignore. \n Relying on state education records, supplemented by federal crime data, a yearlong investigation by The Associated Press uncovered roughly 17,000 official reports of sex assaults by students over a four-year period, from fall 2011 to spring 2015. \n That figure represents the most complete tally yet of sexual assault among the nation's 50 million students in grades K-12. But it also does not fully capture the problem: Such attacks are greatly under-reported, some states don't track them and those that do vary widely in how they classify and catalog sexual violence. \n And with school reputations and funding at stake, there is tremendous pressure to hide such violence. Even under varying state laws, acknowledging an incident can trigger liabilities and requirements to act. \n \"No principal wants their school to be the rape school,\" said Dr. Bill Howe, a former teacher who spent 17 years overseeing Connecticut's compliance with a federal law that helps protect student victims of at-school sexual assault. \"It's the courageous principal that does the right thing.\" \n The attacks AP tracked ranged from rape and sodomy to forced oral sex and fondling. Assaults occurred anywhere students were left unsupervised: buses and bathrooms, hallways and locker rooms. No type of school was immune, whether it be in a wealthy suburb, inner city or farm town. And all types of children were targeted. \n Children remained most vulnerable to peer-on-peer sexual assault in the privacy of a home, AP's analysis of the federal crime data showed. But schools were the No. 2 place where they were sexually violated by other children. \n About 5 percent of reported attacks involved 5 and 6 year olds. Incidents jumped between ages 10 and 11 \u2014 typically the start of middle school \u2014 and continued rising until age 14, when they began dropping as students progressed through high school. \n Unwanted fondling was the most common form of assault, and about one in five of the abused kids were penetrated in some way. \n The data also showed sexual assaults by peers were more common than those by teachers, which receive far more attention. For every adult-on-child sexual attack reported at school, there were seven by students. \n \"Schools are required to keep students safe,\" said Charol Shakeshaft, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor who specializes in school sexual misconduct. \"It is part of their mission. It is part of their legal responsibility. It isn't happening. Why don't we know more about it, and why isn't it being stopped?\" \n Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia tracked student sexual assaults, AP found, though some only when incidents led to student discipline. Some of the nation's largest school districts claimed zero sexual assaults over several years, even though AP found cases in court records or local media reports. \n States varied widely in whether they required any training to stop or address student-on-student sexual assault; only 18 told AP they did. \n \"Everyone feels like we don't have a problem, and the reason they feel that way is they have their heads in the sand,\" said Oregon psychologist Wilson Kenney, who has developed student intervention programs. \n The AP found that schools often mischaracterized sexual attacks as bullying, hazing or consensual behavior, and broadly interpreted privacy laws to withhold basic information from their communities. \n In multiple cases, districts bungled investigations, failed to supervise students they knew were trouble, or neglected to inform parents or authorities of an assault. \n Prosecutors can be reluctant to charge juveniles, and families face high legal thresholds to successfully sue school districts for not maintaining safe learning environments. \n In Maine, Chaz Wing and his family battled the Brunswick school district for four years \u2014 first before the state's human rights commission and then in federal court. \n From almost his first day of sixth grade in 2010, kids harassed Chaz about his weight and labeled him as \"gay,\" according to deposition testimony and other government and school records AP reviewed. Complaining to teachers and administrators at Brunswick Junior High School did not stop the abuse, he said. \n The bullying escalated to three bathroom rapes during seventh grade, according to sworn testimony by Chaz and statements he made to police, doctors, a child-abuse specialist and a state investigator. Fearing the bullies' threats, he said, he kept quiet about the sexual violence, sliding into depression and refusing to go to school. \n Finally, in October 2012, after his mom found him curled up in her bed, he confided through his tears, \"They hurt me.\" \n Sexual abuse allegations can be difficult to investigate. Because many accusers initially keep quiet, physical evidence can be lost. Often, there are no eyewitnesses, leaving only the conflicting accounts of the accuser and the accused. \n Brunswick school administrators said they had promptly looked into Chaz's bullying complaints \u2014 and that they immediately investigated his sex assault allegations once his mother contacted them. \n The school's principal, who had no experience investigating sexual assaults, testified he found the denials of the accused boys \"very credible.\" He concluded, after speaking with staff and surveying sites of the alleged attacks, that Chaz's claims were \"very unlikely.\" \n Police investigated but pursued no charges, despite the child-abuse evaluation that found Chaz's statements \"were clear, consistent and provided idiosyncratic and sensory details.\" The examiner also found \"strong evidence\" Chaz had been sexually abused. \n In 2014, the Maine Human Rights Commission ruled that the district had failed to see \"the overall picture\" of bullying and allowed \"a hostile education environment to persist.\" \n The state commission made no determination on the sexual assault accusations, saying the verbal and physical harassment were \"pervasive\" enough to grant the Wings a right to sue. Its investigator did note that Chaz's ongoing treatment for depression and a scar he said resulted from the first rape \"tend to support his allegations.\" \n After legal wrangling, the sides settled last year: Brunswick would make safety improvements, and Chaz would get $50,000 \u2014 though not the apology he wanted. \n Brunswick officials declined AP's interview requests. So did parents of some of the accused students, except to say their sons were innocent. \n In an email, district lawyer Melissa Hewey told AP that \"there is \u2014 as there should be \u2014 always an inclination to believe allegations of sexual assault at the outset. But sometimes, the evidence compels the conclusion that those allegations are false.\" \n \"The little boys who were accused,\" she said, \"are the real victims in this case.\" \n The AP does not usually name alleged victims of sexual assault. But Chaz, who turns 18 in a few weeks, and his parents decided to speak publicly in hopes of helping others. \n \"I don't want this to happen to other kids,\" said his mom, Amy Wing. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "The hidden horror of sex assaults by K-12 students"}

{"date": "April 30, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Soila Solano prepared to inject herself with insulin at her home in Las Vegas. Casino owners and their employees' unions are attempting to rein in soaring prescription drug prices in an attempt to control their own medical insurance costs. \n CARSON CITY, Nev. >> Aiming to rein in soaring prescription drug prices, an unlikely Nevada coalition is trying to force pharmaceutical companies to disclose how they set insulin prices \u2014 and issue refunds to diabetics or their insurance companies if annual price hikes surpass inflation. \n Las Vegas casino owners have banded together with their employees' unions of cooks, servers and other resort workers to support the unprecedented legislation in their effort to control their own medical insurance costs. \n The bill expected to face its first vote in early May would attempt to cap how much employers, insurers and corporate middle men pay for insulin, which is injected to manage blood sugar levels. Lawmakers also hope the bill would cap what diabetics pay out of their own pockets near their current cost levels \u2014 typically between $50 and $600 per month, depending on diabetics' insurance coverage. \n It remains far from clear that the bill, if passed, would survive legal challenges or have the intended effect. But it would make Nevada the first U.S. state to force detailed release of drugmakers' proprietary information and effectively establish a price control on prescription drugs via the refund plan. \n The bill is expected to pass in both houses of Nevada's Democratic-controlled Legislature. Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, in an interview with the Associated Press, did not rule out signing it. \n The move in Nevada illustrates public ire reaching critical mass over price hikes on insulin, epinephrine, antibiotics and other common prescription medicines, said Steve Brozak, president of the New Jersey-based WBB Securities investment banking firm, which focuses on health care. \n Brozak and other industry experts warned against assuming government intervention would result in lower pharmacy bills, and said drugmakers would likely sue to block the law. They said price constraints could have unintended consequences. \n \"I don't think this will work in the way people think it will, but this could be the shot across the bow,\" Brozak said. \n The bill would trigger reimbursements to insurers and others who pay for diabetes-related drugs when price increases outpace the national Consumer Price Index Medical Care Component, which rose between 2 percent and 5 percent each of the last 10 years. \n \"There is no question that lives are at stake and that, every day that people have to make the choice between their medicine and putting food on the table, we go further down the road to reaching a true public health crisis,\" said bill sponsor Sen. Yvanna Cancela, former political director with the Culinary Union 226 lobbying for the bill's passage. \n The pharmaceutical industry argues that basing refunds on sticker prices would be ineffective because those rates constantly fluctuate and the market is much more complex than bill supporters say. Drugmakers also say prices reflect research costs and point a finger at insurance companies that have drastically increased co-pays and deductibles. \n Nevada's casino owners and unions representing casino workers have long opposed each other in wage proposals but formed their rare lobbying partnership after reviewing costs in their negotiated health care plans. \n Insulin and other diabetes medications represent 21 percent of prescription costs for the casino unions' 57,000 Nevada members, and increased 21 percent from 2015 to 2016, said Bobbette Bond, health policy director at Unite Here Health, which oversees Culinary Union 226 health plans. \n About one in every 11 Nevada residents had diabetes in 2014, similar to the national average that year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n Jacobo Perez-Jimenez, a Las Vegas cook who has diabetes, said a monthly bottle of insulin cost him $7 in 2011. Now he pays $75. \n Perez-Jimenez, whose health insurance covers part of his medical costs, said insulin makers are \"killing people with those prices.\" \n The Nevada effort comes less than a year after the pharmaceutical industry won a major victory against prescription drug price controls in California. Ohio voters will consider the same proposal in November. \n Lawmakers in about half of U.S. states have made some attempt to curb prescription drug prices. \n Vermont last year adopted a law asking drugmakers to justify certain price increases of 15 percent or more, and California legislators are now seeking notification of price hikes above 10 percent. \n The Nevada bill would mark the first time drugmakers would be required to publicly detail business data about specific drugs including research costs and discounts they give insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and wholesalers. \n Supporters claim disclosure will prompt manufacturers to lower prices, but market experts said there's no guarantee the idea would work and the notion disappoints some consumers who want immediate action. \n \"Even if they cough up that information, what would it benefit me?\" said Soila Solano, a diabetic resident of Las Vegas. \"How would I know if they're really, you know, giving you the right information?\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Nevada coalition seeks unprecedented insulin refund law"}

{"date": "April 30, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS FILE \n The Detroit-based music publishers for Eminem are suing New Zealand's conservative National Party for using a similar soundtrack titled \"Eminem Esque\" for a 2014 TV ad. \n WELLINGTON, New Zealand >> They may not have lost themselves in the music or the moment but a judge and nine lawyers in a New Zealand courtroom did listen politely to Eminem's \"Lose Yourself\" as a copyright trial involving the country's ruling political party began today. \n The Detroit-based music publishers for Eminem are suing New Zealand's conservative National Party, alleging the soundtrack for a 2014 election campaign ad copied the rapper's acclaimed 2002 song. Titled \"Eminem Esque,\" the track has the familiar urgent, pulsing beat of the original. \n The party has previously said it purchased the track through an Australian-based supplier and doesn't believe it has infringed anyone's copyright. \n In 2014, when the case was filed, lawmaker Steven Joyce said he thought the use of the song was \"pretty legal,\" and that Eminem's team \"are just having a crack and a bit of an eye for the main chance because it's an election campaign.\" That response was widely ridiculed, including by comedian John Oliver on his show \"Last Week Tonight.\" \n \"Pretty legal? That's not a concept that exists. That's like being sort-of dead,\" Oliver joked on the show. \n Spokespeople for both Joyce and the National Party said today they wouldn't be commenting while the case was before the court. \n Garry Williams, the lawyer for Eminem's music publishers Eight Mile Style, told the High Court in Wellington that the National Party had wanted a song that was edgy and modern but showed the party was dependable. He said the music fared better with focus groups than a classical piece. \n He quoted from National Party emails, including one in which the song is described as an Eminem \"sound-alike\" and another in which an agent for the party wrote \"I guess the question we're asking, if everyone thinks it's Eminem, and it's listed as Eminem Esque, how can we be confident that Eminem doesn't say we're ripping him off?\" \n Williams said the emails showed it was \"utterly clear\" the party knew it was using a copyrighted song. \n Speaking outside the court, Joel Martin, a spokesman for Eminem's music publishers, said he was surprised the two sides hadn't settled and that going to trial against an entity like a governing political party was unusual and extraordinary. \n \"The bottom line is we would never have permitted the use of the song in any political advertisement,\" he said. \n Martin said the publishers are seeking both a cash settlement for an undisclosed amount and an acknowledgement by the court that the National Party breached copyright. He said that by pursuing the case, they are showing they take copyright infringement around the world seriously. \n He said the political views of the National Party were not a factor: \"We are Americans and we don't know about politics in New Zealand,\" he said. \n Judge Helen Cull ruled that some details in the case would remain confidential because they were commercially sensitive. \n The judge-only case is expected to last about six days and will determine whether copyright was breached. The amount of any damages would be decided later. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Eminem lawsuit against New Zealand political party begins"}

{"date": "April 30, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Shoe repairman Jumpei Takemiya spoke at his shop located across from Yokota Air Base. \n FUSSA, Japan >> Residents living near U.S. military bases in Japan are facing a fresh reality: Their neighborhoods are on the frontline of North Korea's dispute with America and if Pyongyang were to attack they would have just minutes to shelter from incoming missiles. \n \"It's impossible. There is no way we can run away from it,\" said Seijiro Kurosawa, a 58-year-old taxi driver in Fussa, near Yokota Air Base. \"We don't have bunkers, shelters or anything like that.\" \n His company recently instructed drivers to park their cabs and take immediate refuge in the event of an attack, but he isn't sure where he could go. \"All we can do is run into a department store perhaps,\" he said. \n A possible missile strike and what to do about it have dominated TV talk shows and other media in Japan in recent weeks as regional tension has spiked, with the North Korean regime continuing to test-fire rockets and President Donald Trump sending an aircraft carrier to nearby waters in a show of force. \n North Korea has yet to reach its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile that can reach the U.S. mainland, but its current arsenal is capable of striking the 50,000 U.S. troops stationed across Japan. The government raised caution levels in March after Pyongyang said four ballistic missiles that landed a few hundred kilometers (miles) off Japan's coast were meant to simulate a nuclear strike on U.S. bases there. \n While Japanese tabloids and television programs have reported on nuclear shelters ordered by a handful of rich people or touted gas masks as a more affordable option, it's largely business as usual in Fussa, a town of 58,000 people in Tokyo's western suburbs. \n \"Whatever will be, will be,\" said 34-year-old Jumpei Takemiya, who runs a shoe repair shop across from Yokota Air Base. \"Just think calmly about it. Is Yokota really going to be the first one to be hit? I doubt it, and frankly I'm not so nervous,\" he said. \n Looking out his shop window, he added: \"As you can see, there is no heightened security or any other unusual development around here.\" \n For 75-year-old Yoshio Takagi, the talk of North Korean missiles brings back memories of World War II, when he had to temporarily relocate to a rural village to avoid American bombs falling in and around Tokyo that killed his two older brothers. He remains opposed to the use of weapons, but is also realistic about current circumstances. \n \"Tension has escalated and the situation has become more unpredictable under Trump,\" he said. \"But Japan relies on the U.S. military and there is a base here. I think we just have to accept the consequences.\" \n Visits to a government crisis management website surged to the millions in April from a previous record of tens of thousands in March, as the government tweeted and put out fresh instructions for what to do in the event of a missile attack. \n The instructions are simple: If you are outdoors, take refuge in strong buildings or underground shopping arcades and if no such facilities are nearby, drop to the ground and cover your head. A chemical weapon is possible, so the instructions advise covering your nose and mouth with a cloth and shutting doors and windows. \n A first-ever missile attack drill was held in March in Akita prefecture in northern Japan, and the government recently instructed all 47 prefectures to draw up plans quickly for similar drills. So far, only two others \u2014 Yamagata in the north and Nagasaki, home to Sasebo naval base, in the south \u2014 have started to make concrete plans for drills in the coming months. \n \"We need to plan carefully in order to raise awareness, not to scare off the public,\" said Keiko Nakajima, a Tokyo crisis response official. \n Some think the risk is overblown. \n North Korea is \"mostly bluffing its military capability, and the missile scare is further hyped up largely by TV,\" said Hiroki Fujii, a 40-year-old utility employee who lives near Yokota. \n Akinori Otani worries more about a U.S. military plane crashing in the area. At bases around Japan, residents have raised concern about the safety of the tilt-rotor MV-22 \"Osprey\" aircraft. \n \"Ospreys are actually flying around,\" said Otani, a 42-year-old resident of Hamura, another town near Yokota. \"I'm more concerned about them than a missile that I think is unlikely to hit us.\" \n In the southwestern town of Iwakuni, home to a U.S. Marine Corps air station, residents began asking about attack response plans after the area was mentioned on TV among possible targets, said Yuji Yamaguchi, an emergency response official there. \n He questioned whether it is possible to predict a missile's course and issue an alert before it reaches Japan and said that without such information, drawing up an evacuation scenario is difficult. It is believed that it would take about 10 minutes for a North Korean missile to reach Japan, yet when the four missiles landed off the coast in March, it wasn't until 20 minutes after that the government notified local fishermen. \n For Reiko Naya, who runs a gift shop just outside the Yokota base, she is concerned that the tension may be used by the government as a justification to bolster Japan's military capability. \n \"Japan has renounced war, but it seems we are gradually getting embroiled into a conflict,\" she said. \"We thought North Korean missiles would never reach Japan, but after all these tests, they now seem routine. Eventually, one of them might come flying.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Business as usual for Japanese on frontline of N. Korea dispute"}

{"date": "April 30, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS / APRIL 1 \n Children played inside a damaged car in a neighborhood recently retaken by Iraqi security forces from Islamic State militants on the western side of Mosul, Iraq. \n BAGHDAD >> The U.S.-led coalition has come under increasing scrutiny by monitoring groups regarding civilian casualties in the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq, a turn that is worrying some in the country's political leadership who fear the destruction and loss of life could complicate hopes of reconciliation with the country's minority Sunnis. \n The Pentagon acknowledged over the weekend that at least 352 civilians have been killed by coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria since the start of the air campaign against IS in 2014. However, activists and monitoring groups say the number is much higher. \n The coalition argues that casualties are inevitable in urban warfare with irregulars mixing with civilians and determined to stage a last stand. But critics see a degree of recklessness and excess that aligns with the heavy-handed rule of the Sunni areas by the Shiite dominated Iraqi government. \n Here's a look at some aspects of the situation. \n A devastating mistake \n Last month, the Pentagon launched an investigation into an incident in which Mosul residents say a single airstrike killed more than 100 civilians sheltering in a house in the western part of the Iraqi city that was also being used by IS fighters. \n While both Iraqi and coalition planes are active in the skies above Mosul, the U.S. acknowledged coalition planes conducted a strike \"at the location corresponding to allegations of civilian casualties,\" but did not confirm the number of casualties inflicted or the circumstances of the event. \n The incident sparked outrage in Iraq and beyond with calls from local government officials as well as the United Nations for greater restraint in the fight against IS for Mosul. \n Despite the allegations surrounding the March 17 strike, the spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition Col. John Dorrian told The Associated Press that the coalition's anti-IS operations remain \"the most precise air campaign in history.\" \n \"But all the tactics, techniques and procedures and plans that we have, all these things are executed by people,\" he said, \"and what that means is, it's not going to be perfect, it's going to be as good as we can possibly make it.\" \n More than a month since the incident, Dorrian declined to specify when the investigation \u2014 the most extensive single investigation into civilian deaths undertaken by the coalition since the fight against IS began \u2014 would be complete. \n Why it's happening \n Civilian deaths in the nearly three-year battle against IS spiked as Iraqi forces pushed into Mosul, undertaking some of the toughest fighting yet. The battle space, with its narrow streets, is claustrophobic and the Islamic State group is holding hundreds of thousands of civilians in the city as human shields. \n Since Iraqi forces pushed into western Mosul in February, the fighting has killed and wounded more than 4,000 civilians, according to the United Nations, a number that only counts civilians who reached a trauma hospital for treatment. \n In the most recent report, the Pentagon announced on Sunday that investigations conducted during the month of March show that coalition airstrikes killed 45 civilians, mostly in and around Mosul. In each incident, the Pentagon said \"all feasible precautions were taken,\" but the strikes still resulted in \"unintentional\" loss of civilian life. \n The report came days after President Donald Trump gave the Pentagon greater flexibility to determine the number of U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria. The Pentagon had already been making quiet, incremental additions to the troop levels in both countries in recent months. \n A look at the numbers \n The Pentagon acknowledged over the weekend that at least 352 civilians have been killed by coalition strikes in Iraq and Syria since the start of the air campaign against IS. Activists and monitoring groups put the number much higher, with London-based monitoring group Airwars reporting coalition strikes have killed more than 3,000 civilians in Iraq and Syria since 2014. \n The Pentagon's Sunday statement also included the findings of an audit begun in March that inspected the way the U.S.-led coalition reports and tracks civilian casualties in the fight against IS. \n The statement said the audit found that 80 civilian deaths caused by coalition airstrikes had not been previously publicly reported and two civilian deaths previously reported were found to have not been caused by the coalition. \n Some in Iraq's political leadership have expressed concern that the levels of damage and loss of human life in Mosul will make reconciliation with the country's minority Sunni population more difficult after a military defeat of IS. \n What it means for post-war governance \n Iraq's Parliament speaker, Salim al-Jabouri, one of the highest ranking Sunni government officials, has said that reports of increased civilian casualties in western Mosul are of \"great concern.\" \n When Haider al-Abadi took office in 2014, he promised reforms that would hold corrupt Iraqi leadership accountable and allocate more of a political stake to the country's Sunnis. Al-Abadi has handed more control over to Iraq's regional leadership and appointed a Sunni to lead the Ministry of Defense. But some Iraqis are warning the outcome of the Mosul operation could be pivotal for how the country's Sunnis view Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government. \n Iraq's foreign minister has warned such a massive reconciliation effort will need funding and support akin to the Marshall Plan that helped western Europe recover from the devastation of World War II. \n In order for Iraq's military gains to stick, the international community needs \"to present assistance to Iraqis and support development and overcome the effect of war against Daesh terrorist gangs,\" Jaafari said in a statement released by his office. Daesh is an Arabic name for IS. \n Roots of IS support \n When the Islamic State group rampaged through northwestern Iraq in 2014, the extremists were welcomed by some Sunnis who thought IS represented a Sunni revolution that would deliver them from the country's Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad. \n Under former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, many of Iraq's Sunnis began to view the country's security forces as an occupying force. Police and military units often swept through Sunni communities detaining all military-aged males in an attempt to quell dissent, filling the country's prisons with men arrested on trumped-up terrorism charges. \n Baghdad has not yet presented a comprehensive plan for the governance of Nineveh province once the fight for Mosul is concluded and plans for an Iraqi \"national guard\" that would give greater control of local security to regional leaders have languished in Parliament. \n The United Nations reports more than 800,000 civilians have returned to Anbar province after much of that territory was retaken from IS last year, but rebuilding there is mostly being financed with private money as Iraq is still battling an economic crisis sparked in part by the worldwide drop in oil prices. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Civilian casualty toll could complicate Iraqi reconciliation"}

{"date": "April 30, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., spoke to reporters during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday. \n WASHINGTON >> Erasing the threat of a disruptive government shutdown, the White House and Congress endorsed a $1.1 trillion spending bill today to carry the nation through September, an agreement underscoring that Democrats retain considerable clout in Donald Trump's turbulent presidency. \n Negotiators released the 1,665-page bill after Republicans dropped numerous demands on the environment, Obama-era financial regulations and abortion in marathon sessions over the weekend. The bill is slated for a House vote on Wednesday, with a Senate vote ahead of a Friday midnight deadline. \n \"We thought we had the upper hand because a government shutdown would be on their shoulders, and we made that clear,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in an interview. \"We knew that if we didn't push things too far we could get a good deal that could make us happy and that's what happened.\" \n Trump and the White House had made concessions last week when the president relented on his demand that the measure include a $1.4 billion down payment for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump repeatedly insisted during the election campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall, a claim Mexican officials have vigorously rejected. \n Congressional Republicans and Democrats ignored Trump's proposal to cut billions of dollars from domestic programs, agreeing instead to provide funds for Planned Parenthood and the National Institutes of Health. \n Democrats boasted of money for foreign assistance and cash-strapped Puerto Rico while winning funding for favored programs like transit projects and grants for first responders. They also defied Trump on a bid to punish \"sanctuary cities\" and on immigration enforcement. \n The White House and some top GOP allies declared victory anyway, citing billions of dollars more for the military. Trump won a $15 billion down payment on his request to strengthen the military, though that also fell short of what he requested. \n Vice President Mike Pence said the administration \"couldn't be more pleased\" and called the agreement it a \"budget deal that's a bipartisan win for the American people.\" \n House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., praised the bill as well, saying it \"acts on President Trump's commitment to rebuild our military for the 21st century and bolster our nation's border security to protect our homeland.\" \n Longstanding conservative resistance to robust government spending typically requires the party to seek Democratic votes to pass spending bills despite the Republican majorities both houses of Congress. That made the party out of power a major player in the negotiations. The talks were also spurred by a strong Republican desire to complete unfinished business well into the fiscal year and move on to health care repeal and tax overhaul. \n Ryan's office peppered reporters' inboxes with news releases cheerleading for the bill and GOP-won provisions such as extending a private school vouchers program for students in Washington, D.C.'s troubled school system through 2019. \n Democrats had sought additional spending for nondefense accounts to match Pentagon increases above spending caps set by a 2015 budget pact negotiated with former President Barack Obama. They were forced to settle for far less with domestic increases in the 1 percent range. \n The measure funds the remainder of the 2017 budget year, through Sept. 30. Capitol Hill Republicans joined Democrats in supporting increases for popular domestic programs such as medical research at the National Institutes of Health, with Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., for instance, using his powerful post on the Appropriations panel to take the lead on a 40 percent boost in research on Alzheimer's disease. \n Democrats stressed their efforts to protect the Environmental Protection Agency, infrastructure grants and foreign aid. Sen. Joe Manchin, R-W.Va., led the fight for a $1.3 billion provision to preserve health benefits for more than 22,000 retired coal miners and their families, while top House Democrat Nancy Pelosi provided the muscle behind a hard-won effort to give the cash-strapped government of Puerto Rico $295 million to ease its Medicaid burden. \n Some Republican conservatives remain wary. \n \"I think you're going to see conservatives have some real concerns with this legislation,\" Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said on CNN's \"New Day,\" citing domestic spending obtained by Democrats and other issues. \"Our job is to do what we told the voters we were going to do.\" \n White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney had said the administration wanted priorities such as the Mexico border wall, cuts to domestic programs and new flexibility to punish \"sanctuary cities\" as part of the measure. Each was rejected, however, with Trump signaling last month that the wall issue could be addressed in the next round of spending bills. \n Trump, however, obtained $1.5 billion for border security measures such as 5,000 additional detention beds, an upgrade in border infrastructure and technologies such as surveillance. \n While the measure would peacefully end a battle over the current budget year, the upcoming 2018 budget cycle promises to be even more difficult. Mulvaney's plans to slash domestic agency budgets could grind this summer's round of spending bills to a halt. \n GOP leaders decided against trying to use the must-do spending bill to \"defund\" Planned Parenthood and dropped a House provision to \"zero out\" Title X family planning funds. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "No shutdown: $1.1 trillion agreement shows Democrats' clout"}

{"date": "April 30, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Radford Commonwealth Attorney Chris Rehak, left, talks with Chris Hurst, right, during a Radford City Democratic Committee meeting in Radford, Va. \n BLACKSBURG, Va. >> The tipping point for Chris Hurst came last fall while reporting on a shooting at a rail car factory. When the camera turned off, he wept. \n Just more than a year earlier, the 29-year-old's reporter girlfriend was gunned down while conducting an interview on live TV. Now, Hurst was using the same truck that Alison Parker had used the last day of her life to report live from the scene of another shooting. \n Hurst realized he needed a drastic life change. \n The former TV anchor is now running for political office, challenging a National Rifle Association-backed candidate for a competitive Virginia state House seat in a firearm friendly part of the state. Hurst sees it as a way to honor the memory of the woman he thought he'd marry and to give back to the community that helped him through his darkest days. \n \"When we understand that life is fragile, does that mean we give up and say life ain't worth it? No,\" Hurst said at a local Democratic committee meeting in March. \"That's when we say it is worth it, and we do what we can when we're here to try to help another person.\" \n Hurst was living with Parker when she and cameraman Adam Ward were fatally shot while reporting for WDBJ-TV in August 2015. The gunman, Vester Flanagan, posted video of the attack online and killed himself hours later. \n After the shooting, Hurst became the public face of the grieving Roanoke station, bringing him national attention and a large social media following. That helped him become one of the top House candidate fundraisers last reporting period. \n The Pennsylvania native, who quit his TV job and moved from Roanoke to Blacksburg to run in the 12th District, has been labeled a carpetbagger by Republicans looking to protect Del. Joseph Yost, a well-liked moderate. The district is among the few competitive House seats in southwest Virginia, a rural Republican stronghold. \n Hurst is one of several young Democrats new to politics running for a Virginia House seat this year. President Donald Trump's election has fueled a new interest in state and local politics, party leaders say, and Democrats hope they can put a dent in Republicans' sizeable House majority. \n Hurst is no fan of Trump but says his reasons for running are more personal. \n While at the station, he faced constant reminders of Parker. He struggled with walking past the place where he was told she was dead, and with covering stories about violence and death, he said. \n \"I knew that I could get myself up and pull myself together and do it, but I think it was at the price of my humanity,\" Hurst said. \n Now, he says, his grief is lessening because he feels like what is doing has purpose. \n \"It has given him determination,\" said Alison's father, Andy Parker. \"We both had to seek a way to make sense out of all of this.\" \n Republicans are playing up their candidate's deep local roots and trying to paint Hurst as an outsider seeking political advancement. Yost, 30, has earned a reputation in Richmond as a humble, hard worker and champion for better mental health services. \n \"There's a difference between being on air and covering news as opposed to me, being in my district for the last 30 years,\" Yost said. \"I think there's just a lot of questions and concern among the community about somebody who's moving in to challenge me.\" \n While Parker's death drove Hurst into action, he treads lightly on the issue of gun control in these communities, where the gun culture runs deep. \n Hurst, a gun owner, says that among other things he'd like to empower law enforcement to petition courts to have guns taken away from dangerous people. But he insists firearms aren't his top priority. He says he's focused on issues such as education and economic development. \n Andy Parker, whose gun-control advocacy has made him a self-described \"lightning rod,\" said he expects Republicans will try to link Hurst to him and call Hurst a \"gun grabber.\" \n \"We're joined at the hip because of her and our love for her,\" Parker said. \"He's not going to run away from it.\" \n Mae Midkiff, Giles County Republican Committee chairwoman, said she doesn't think Republicans will make guns an issue in the race. \n But Midkiff said if Hurst thinks he has an easy road to Richmond, he's mistaken. \n \"It would've just thrilled us to death to see Mr. Hurst stay in Roanoke and do the news,\" Midkiff said. \"But if he comes into our territory, I'm going to have to tell you, he's going to have a battle,\" she said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Girlfriend's on-air killing drives Virginia anchorman into politics"}

{"date": "April 30, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Lead defense attorney Jose Baez delivers his opening statement to the jury on the first day of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez's double-murder trial at Suffolk Superior Court in Boston. Baez won an acquittal for Hernandez, and for Casey Anthony in 2011 in the death of her toddler. \n BOSTON >> During Aaron Hernandez's double murder trial, the former NFL star's lawyer wanted to drive home his point that the prosecution's star witness was a \"three-legged pony\" whose testimony could not be believed. So he galloped like a horse in front of the jury. \n It was vintage Jose Baez: flashy, theatrical and willing to do anything for his clients. \n With Hernandez's acquittal, Baez burnished his status as one of the most recognized defense attorneys in the U.S., six years after his high-profile gig successfully defending Casey Anthony, the Florida mother accused of killing her toddler because she didn't want the responsibility of raising a child. \n His no-holds-barred style has won him both praise and scorn. \n Prosecutors who have gone up against Baez say there is nothing he won't do to win, while defense attorneys who have worked with call him a brilliant strategist who rips open holes in the prosecution's case. \n \"If you were ever in trouble, you would want Jose Baez by your side,\" said Linda Kenney Baden, who represented music producer Phil Spector in his 2007 murder trial and has worked with Baez on three cases, including the Anthony and Hernandez trials. \n The Anthony and Hernandez cases initially seemed like slam dunks for prosecutors. \n Anthony had repeatedly lied to the police, and witnesses said they smelled a dead body in her car trunk. But Baez hammered at a hole in the prosecution's case \u2014 uncertainty about how the little girl died \u2014 and raised doubt among jurors. \n In the Hernandez case, he relentlessly attacked the credibility of the prosecution's star witness, an admitted drug dealer who was with Hernandez the night two men were killed in a drive-by shooting in Boston. Baez told the jury the man had identified Hernandez as the triggerman to get immunity and save his own skin. \n Baez, 48, based in Florida, was relatively inexperienced and unknown before the Anthony trial. \n While in law school, he had a one-day stint in the Miami-Dade County prosecutor's office but said it \"didn't feel right\" to him, so he walked across the street to the public defender's office and offered to work there instead. \n \"I absolutely fell in love with it,\" he said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \"I got to deal with real people and help them with real problems.\" \n During the Anthony trial, Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera popularized the nickname \"Juanie Cochran\" for Baez, comparing him to the late Johnnie Cochran, the flamboyant lawyer who helped win acquittal for O.J. Simpson. \n Celebrity was something Baez never expected. He dropped out of high school and married his girlfriend after she became pregnant, and later earned his GED while in the Navy. \n After getting his law degree at Florida's St. Thomas University, the state bar association prevented him from practicing law for eight years, citing his failure to keep up with child support payments and other debts. \n He was admitted to practice law in 2005, and just three years later took on the Anthony case. The trial fascinated the nation, with every twist and turn live-streamed and followed obsessively on social media and in the tabloids. \n Jeff Ashton, one of the prosecutors in the Anthony case, derides Baez as a \"wonderful salesman.\" \n \"He's not terribly professional in his demeanor,\" Ashton said. \"He just sort of does whatever he thinks he should do to sell the case without a whole lot of regard to whether it's, in fact, ethically or legally the proper thing to do.\" \n Baez also represented Nilton Diaz, acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter in the death of the 2-year-old granddaughter of World Boxing Champion Wilfredo Vazquez. He also defended a 12-year-old girl charged with aggravated stalking in connection with the suicide of another girl. The charges were dropped. \n Baez said he has never lost a first- or second-degree murder case out of 11 that have gone to trial. He attributes his success to his ability to relate to jurors from all walks of life. \n \"I was raised to treat the janitor with as much respect as you treat the CEO. The reason for that is simple,\" he said. \"My mother WAS the janitor, she WAS the maid. She had a 6th-grade education, came here from Puerto Rico and supported four children on her own, without any help from anyone.\" \n Baez's brash approach has sometimes angered prosecutors. In the Hernandez trial, the defense suggested that the victims may have been involved in drugs and gangs, and that the real killer's motive was a failed drug deal. A medical examiner testified that there were drugs in the system of one of the victims. \n After the acquittal, prosecutor Daniel Conley said portraying the victims that way was unnecessary. \n Baez's work didn't result in freedom for Hernandez, who was already in prison for an earlier murder; Baez didn't represent him in that trial. Five days after he was acquitted, Hernandez was dead of an apparent suicide in his prison cell. \n Baez's work for his client didn't end there. \n The next day, he claimed the state medical examiner was illegally withholding Hernandez's brain, preventing his family from donating it to research. State officials denied Baez's claim and said they held onto Hernandez's brain only during an autopsy. \n \"I believe in redemption, I believe in having compassion,\" Baez said. \"Sometimes the system treats those accused and those who are downtrodden very harshly.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Jose Baez: Hernandez acquittal burnishes lawyer's reputation"}

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, the first Cuban-American elected to Congress, is retiring at the end of her term next year, saying it's time to move on after 38 years in office. \n The 64-year-old Republican was elected last November to Florida's redrawn 27th district, a stretch of southeast Miami-Dade County that is heavily Democratic. Hillary Clinton won it over Donald Trump by 20 percentage points, and Ros-Lehtinen was able to win it by 10 percentage points. \n Her unexpected retirement will give Democrats an opportunity to pick up a South Florida congressional seat in 2018. \n The Miami Herald first reported the retirement Sunday. The congresswoman's spokesman Keith Fernandez confirmed the announcement with The Associated Press. \n In Congress, Ros-Lehtinen staked her ground as a foreign-policy hawk, becoming the first woman to chair a standing congressional committee: the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. She currently chairs the subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, and sits on the intelligence committee. \n House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., called her a \"trailblazer.\" \n \"She's been a relentless advocate for human rights, and a powerful voice on the need to address the dangerous Iranian regime, defend allies like Israel, and so much more,\" he wrote. \"Ileana's retirement is well-deserved, but I'm glad we are not losing her yet. We've got important work to do for the American people over the next year and a half, and I know Ileana will continue to play a leading role.\" \n Born in Havana, she is well-known for being a fierce critic of Cuban politics. The late Fidel Castro nicknamed her \"la loba feroz\" or \"the big bad she-wolf.\" \n For years, Ros-Lehtinen represented the Florida Keys, including gay-friendly Key West, and advocated for LGBTQ rights. Eventually, her transgender son, Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, made his way into the public spotlight. Last year, he and his parents recorded a bilingual public-service TV campaign to urge Hispanics to support transgender youth. \n In her remaining 20 months in Congress, Ros-Lehtinen said she will keep pushing for one of her long-running goals for Germany to offer restitution to Holocaust victims. \n \"And I will continue to stand up to tyrants and dictators all over the world,\" she told The Miami Herald. \"I take that as a badge of honor, when they blast me and don't let me in their countries.\" \n News of her retirement swept through Florida political circles. \n \"Not only is RosLehtinen a tireless advocate for freedom & human rights \u2013 she is my friend. Florida will miss her,\" tweeted U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who worked as an intern in her office 26 years ago. \n Gov. Rick Scott wrote on Twitter: \"Congresswoman RosLehtinen has fought hard for FL families throughout her service in D.C. Her strong leadership will be greatly missed!\" \n The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used her announcement to criticize her party. \"It's been clear for years that the Republican party was out of step with the values of Miami families, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen's retirement announcement is testament to the fact she recognized how wide that gap had grown.\" \n Ros-Lehtinen is scheduled to have a news conference Monday, her spokesman said. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Rep.

More than a thousand residents of Damascus suburbs demonstrated against anti-government rebel infighting, activists said, only to be met at one demonstration by rebels who tried to disperse the protest with gunfire. Seven protesters were wounded, according to the activist-run Ghouta Media Center. \n BEIRUT >> Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday his country may take further action against Kurdish militants in Iraq and Syria, as U.S.-backed forces in Syria closed in on the last neighborhoods of a former stronghold of the Islamic State group. \n The U.S. views the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces as the most effective partner to counter the Islamic State group in northern Syria, an assessment bolstered by the SDF's steady advances against the jihadists. But it has complicated relations with Turkey, which views the group's Kurdish component as an extension of a terror group operating inside its own borders. \n In Istanbul, Erdogan insisted that U.S. support for such groups \"must come to an end,\" and said he would bring up the matter at a meeting with President Donald Trump next month. \n The SDF, which include Arab fighters, seized six neighborhoods from IS militants in Tabqa on Sunday, according to the affiliated Hawar news agency. \n Tabqa is 25 miles southeast of the Islamic State group's de facto capital Raqqa and an important stronghold for the militants. It lies next to the Tabqa Dam, one of several controlling the flow of the Euphrates River. \n The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said the SDF's control of Tabqa was \"practically total.\" \n A U.S. air lift of artillery and special forces advisers to place them behind IS lines in March was a turning point in the Tabqa offensive and underscored the closeness between Washington and the SDF. \n Turkey, however, has remained hostile to the Kurdish People's Protection Units, known by their Kurdish acronym the YPG, which form the backbone of the SDF. The YPG are close to the Kurdish PKK insurgent group in Turkey, which is designated as a terror organization by NATO and the U.S. \n Last week, Turkey struck at YPG positions inside Syria, killing 20 fighters and media activists, according to the group, prompting Kurdish parties to call for a U.S.-enforced no-fly-zone over northern Syria. \n U.S. troops were seen Saturday in armored vehicles in Syria in Kurdish areas in a show of force apparently intended to dissuade Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces from attacking one another. Kurdish officials describe the U.S. troop movement as \"buffer\" between them and Turkey. \n Video from northern Syria showed the U.S. patrols parked alongside Kurdish units flying the YPG flag. \n \"We will be forced to continue (our offensives),\" Erdogan said. \"We won't provide a date and time for when we'll come. But they will know that the Turkish military can come.\" \n Erdogan is due in Washington on May 16 for his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. \n The YPG is distrusted by Turkish-backed anti-government forces in Syria, who say the group is an ally of President Bashar Assad's government. The YPG and Syrian government forces have largely avoided confrontation over the course of the country's six-year-long civil war. \n Other Kurdish parties accuse the YPG's political arm, the PYD, of squelching dissent and embracing authoritarianism. \n In other developments, more than a thousand residents of Damascus suburbs demonstrated against anti-government rebel infighting, activists said, only to be met at one demonstration by rebels who tried to disperse the protest with gunfire. \n Videos from the Arbin suburb showed demonstrators scrambling for cover after gunmen dressed in military fatigues lined up in front of the march and fired, largely into the air. \n Seven protesters were wounded, according to the activist-run Ghouta Media Center, which posted the video. The Observatory said 12 people were wounded. \n Demonstrators blamed the powerful Army of Islam group for trying to suppress the march. \n The infighting pits the Army of Islam against the al-Rahman Corps and al-Qaida-linked group the Levant Liberation Committee, or Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. Each side blames the other for triggering the fighting in the power struggle over control of eastern Ghouta. \n The area, which includes Arbin, has been held under siege by government forces for more than three years. Residents depend on smuggling and local farming for food. \n \"My friend, the mujahid. You are responsible for our struggle. You are not a mercenary. Do not point your gun at your people,\" one of the signs held by demonstrators announced. \"The struggle is the path to heaven. Beware of the path to hell.\" \n In 48 hours of fighting, the Observatory said at least 87 insurgents from the warring sides were killed.

Lawmakers will continue negotiating this week on a $1 trillion package financing the government through Sept. 30, the end of the 2017 fiscal year. \n Despite a renewed White House effort push, the House did not vote last week on a revised bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Health Care Act. \n After the original effort failed to win enough support from conservatives and moderates, Republicans recast the bill. The latest version would let states escape a requirement under Obama's 2010 law that insurers charge healthy and seriously ill customers the same rates. The overall legislation would cut the Medicaid program for the poor, eliminate fines for people who don't buy insurance and provide generally skimpier subsidies. Critics have said the approach could reduce protections for people with pre-existing conditions. \n But during an interview with \"Face the Nation\" on CBS aired Sunday, Trump said the measure has a \"clause that guarantees\" that people with pre-existing conditions will be covered. \n Trump said: \"Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, 'Pre-existing is not covered.' Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, 'Has to be.'\" \n Trump said during the interview that if he's unable to renegotiate a long-standing free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, then he'll terminate the pact. \n He also spoke about tensions with North Korea. Asked about the failure of several North Korean missile tests recently, Trump said he'd \"rather not discuss it. But perhaps they're just not very good missiles. But eventually, he'll have good missiles.\" \n Trump also said he is willing to use the trade issue as leverage to get China's help with North Korea. \"Trade is very important. But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed? That, as we would say, trumps trade.\" \n And he acknowledged the presidency is \"a tough job. But I've had a lot of tough jobs. I've had things that were tougher, although I'll let you know that better at the end of eight years. Perhaps eight years. Hopefully, eight years.\" \n Also this week, the president will welcome Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to the White House. And he'll head to New York City on Thursday where he'll visit the USS Intrepid to mark the 75th anniversary of a World War II naval battle. \n On Sunday morning, Trump headed to Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. The White House did not immediately clarify whether he was holding meetings or golfing. \n Trump marked his 100th day in office Saturday with a rally in Harrisburg, where he continued to pledge to cut taxes and get tough on trade deals. \n \"We are not going to let other countries take advantage of us anymore,\" he said Saturday in Harrisburg at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex and Expo Center. \"From now on it's going to be America first.\" \n Trump's rally Saturday night in Harrisburg offered a familiar recapitulation of what he and aides have argued for days are administration successes, including the successful confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, his Cabinet choices and the approval of construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Beyond 100 days, Trump faces more legislative challenges"}

The program's repeated failures over the past few years have given rise to suspicions of U.S. sabotage. \n In the CBS interview, the president was asked why the North's rockets keep blowing up. \n \"I'd rather not discuss it,\" he said. \"But perhaps they're just not very good missiles. But eventually, he'll have good missiles.\" \n He added: \"And if that happens, we can't allow it to happen.\" \n Trump also called North Korea's leader \"a pretty smart cookie\" for being able to hold onto power after taking over at a young age. \"People are saying, 'Is he sane?' I have no idea,\" the president said. \n North Korean ballistic missile tests are banned by the United Nations because they are seen as part of the North's push for a nuclear-tipped weapon that can hit the U.S. mainland. \n McMaster said that Trump \"has made clear that he is going to resolve this issue one way or the other,\" but that the president's preference is to work with China and others to resolve it without military action. \n That means, McMaster said, working to enforce current U.N. sanctions and perhaps ratcheting them up. \"And it also means being prepared for military operations if necessary,\" he said. \n Trump said he believes China's president, Xi Jinping, has been putting pressure on North Korea over its missile and nuclear weapons programs. \n The launch comes at a point of particularly high tension in the region. Trump has sent a nuclear-powered submarine and an aircraft carrier to Korean waters. \n The U.S. and South Korea also started installing a missile defense system that is supposed to be partially operational within days. \n Residents in the village of Seongj, where the missile defense system is being installed, scuffled with police on Sunday. About 300 protesters faced off against 800 police and succeeded in blocking two U.S. Army oil trucks from entering the site, local media reported. A few residents were injured or fainted from the scuffle and were taken to a hospital. \n The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, is controversial in South Korea, and presidential front-runner Moon Jae-in has vowed to reconsider the deployment if he wins the May 9 election. \n He has said that the security benefits of THAAD would be offset by worsened relations with China, which is the country's biggest trading partner and is opposed to its deployment. \n Trump raised eyebrows in South Korea last week when he said would make Seoul pay $1 billion for the missile defense system. McMaster said Sunday that the matter is subject to negotiation. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Trump warns North Korea's missiles will get better"}

Brian Horton said during a news conference late today that \"a number of fatalities\" were reported, but that it wasn't yet clear how many, after powerful storms swept through the community earlier in the evening. \n The storms left behind a trail of overturned vehicles, mangled trees and damaged homes in and around Canton, which is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Dallas. \n ETMC Regional Heathcare Systems hospitals in the region received at least 54 patients following the storm, including one person in critical condition, spokeswoman Rebecca Berkley said. She said the other patients suffered injuries that weren't life-threatening. \n Horton asked that people who didn't need to be in the area to stay out, \"so that our teams can do what they need to do to take care of these people who are in need.\" He noted that a triage center was set up at the local high school. \n The extent of the damage in the area wasn't immediately clear. But video from local television stations showed uprooted trees and overturned cars along rural, wet roadways, along with at least two flattened homes. The tornado flipped pickup trucks at a Dodge dealership in Canton and tore through the business. \n At least one tornado has been confirmed so far as having touched down in Canton, though several tornadoes were reported in the area, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Mark Fox. \n Local resident Ernestine Cook told WFAA-TV that she rushed to a storm center just in time. \n \"It hit so hard, so fast.
