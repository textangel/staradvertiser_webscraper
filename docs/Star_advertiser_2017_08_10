{"date": "August 10, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Pope Francis arrives for his weekly general audience, in St.Peter's Square, at the Vatican. \n LONDON >> Pope Francis has ordered a Belgian Catholic charity to stop offering euthanasia in its psychiatric hospitals. \n In May, the Brothers of Charity group announced it would allow doctors to perform euthanasia at its 15 psychiatric hospitals in Belgium, one of only two countries \u2014 along with the Netherlands \u2014 where doctors are legally allowed to kill people with mental health problems, at their request. \n To qualify, people must be in a state of \"unbearable suffering\" and at least three doctors, including one psychiatrist, must be consulted. \n The charity said in a statement that euthanasia would only be performed if there were \"no reasonable treatment alternatives\" and that such requests would be considered with \"the greatest caution.\" \n \"We respect the freedom of doctors to carry out euthanasia or not,\" the group said, noting that this freedom was \"guaranteed by law.\" \n The Vatican press office said this week that the pope had asked the Belgians not to perform euthanasia. \n The Catholic Church opposes euthanasia and the Holy See has begun investigating the decision to allow the procedure, which was made by the group's lay board of directors. \n The Belgian charity's administrative headquarters in Rome issued a statement in May, arguing that allowing euthanasia \"goes against the basic principles\" of the Catholic Church. \n \"This is the very first time a Christian organization states that euthanasia is an ordinary medical practice that falls under the physician's therapeutic freedom,\" wrote the charity's superior general, Rene Stockman, who delivered the request from Pope Francis via two letters. \n \"This is disloyal, outrageous and unacceptable.\" \n Mattias De Vriendt, a spokesman for the Belgium charity, said it had received the Vatican's request but had not yet responded. \n \"We will take our time in the next few weeks to evaluate these letters,\" de Vriendt said. He said the charity's hospitals had received requests from patients seeking euthanasia recently but could not say whether any procedures had been performed. \n The vast majority of patients seeking euthanasia in Belgium have a fatal illness like cancer or a degenerative disease. While the number of people euthanized for psychiatric reasons accounts for only about 3 percent of Belgium's yearly 4,000 euthanasia deaths, there has been a threefold increase in the past decade. \n Critics have previously raised concerns about Belgium's liberal approach to euthanasia while advocates say that people with mental health illnesses should be granted the same autonomy as those with physical diseases. \n The American Psychiatric Association says that doctors should not prescribe any methods to people who are not terminally ill to help them die. \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Pope Francis to Belgian Catholics: Stop offering euthanasia"}

He said there was a \"serious attempt to try to either doctor or alter the final results.\" \n Odinga, a former prime minister who has run unsuccessfully for president three times before, said hackers infiltrated the commission's computer system and manipulated results against him. \n Commission chairman Wafula Chebukati said a hacking attempt was made but it failed. Election officials are painstakingly trying to confirm their provisional results showing Kenyatta in the lead with checks of documents from polling stations nationwide. The election commission has until Aug. 15 to release the final tally. \n \"The long wait is leading to tension,\" said political analyst Hezron Mogambi. \"We are supposed by now to have had results, but the delay has been caused by the fact that the opposition had complaints about the system of transmitting results.\" \n Clashes between police and opposition supporters erupted in a Nairobi slum. Police fired on rioters in Kawangware, a poor area of the capital, according to an Associated Press photographer. One wounded man was carried away by protesters who said police shot him. Demonstrators also burned tires in Kibera, another Nairobi slum. \n Violence also broke out in Garissa county, where opposition supporters demonstrated against the announcement of a ruling party candidate as the winner of a gubernatorial race. Police tried to restore calm after part of the town's market was burned by arsonists, said a regional official, Mohamud Saleh. \n On Wednesday, at least three people were shot and killed in confrontations between security forces and opposition supporters in several areas of Kenya. \n The U.S. State Department urged Kenyans to refrain from violence and patiently await the election commission's announcement of the final results. \n International observers said they have not noted any signs of interference with the vote and also urged calm. \n \"We affirm the conviction that the judicial process, the judicial system of Kenya, and the election laws themselves make full and adequate provision for accountability in this election. The streets do not,\" said former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, an election observer for The Carter Center, an international democracy promotion group led by former President Jimmy Carter. \n Added Marietje Schaake, the Dutch head of the European Union mission observing the vote: \"Elections should never be an issue of life or death.\" \n She said Odinga's hacking allegations \"should be seriously looked at\" as part of the process of verifying the final tallies. \n John Mahama, chief election observer for the Commonwealth and former president of Ghana, said the voting and counting system appeared \"credible, transparent and inclusive.\" \n There was no immediate comment on the latest developments from Kenyatta, 55, whose father was Kenya's first president after independence from British colonial rule. \n Angry crowds jeered police patrolling in Kawangware, an opposition stronghold. \n \"People are demonstrating because of their rights,\" said Edwin Onyango, a supporter of the 72-year-old Odinga. \n Odinga lost in a 2007 election that was followed by violence fueled by ethnic tensions that killed more than 1,000 people. He also lost the 2013 vote to Kenyatta and took allegations of vote-tampering to the Supreme Court, which rejected his case. \n Some Nairobi residents said he should acknowledge another lost campaign. \n \"He has done a lot for this country,\" said James Maina Bajirane. \"And at this particular time, at his age, he should concede defeat and the country goes on.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Kenya election dispute intensifies with conflicting claims"}

{"date": "August 10, 2017", "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS \n Northumbria Police Chief Constable Steve Ashman during a press conference in Newcastle. \n LONDON >> Britain is wrestling with a volatile nexus of crime, race and religion, after 18 people were convicted of sexually abusing women and girls as young as 15. \n One woman and 17 men were convicted of, or admitted, to charges including rape, supplying drugs and inciting prostitution in a series of trials that ended this week at Newcastle Crown Court in northeast England. \n The crimes follow a pattern that has become grimly familiar from cases across Britain in the last few years. The convicted men mostly come from South Asian Muslim backgrounds. Their victims \u2014 who were plied with drugs and alcohol before being abused at parties, in taxis or in back rooms \u2014 are mostly white. \n The prosecution of child-grooming gangs in Rochdale, Rotherham, Oxford and now Newcastle has raised uncomfortable questions. Some allege that the crimes were long ignored by authorities afraid they would be branded racist or fearful the allegations might inflame ethnic tensions. \n Sarah Champion, a British lawmaker from Rochdale, said today that the causes of abuse weren't being tackled \"because people are more afraid to be called a racist than they are afraid to be wrong about calling out child abuse.\" \n Ken Macdonald, Britain's former chief prosecutor, said some of the blame lay with particular communities who regarded \"vulnerable and disordered young girls (as) just opportunities for sexual abuse.\" \n \"It is a disease of racism and sexism that will not abate until it is confronted culturally in homes, schools and places of worship as a question of dignity, respect and equal rights,\" he said. \n The recent high-profile cases aren't typical of all child sexual abuse. Most abused children are victimized online, at home or in institutions such as schools, and most of the perpetrators are white men. Police say that in the year to October 2015, 12 percent of offenders in child sexual exploitation cases were from South Asian backgrounds, and 59 percent were white. \n But former prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who brought the Rochdale abuse gang to trial, says Pakistani men are disproportionately involved in the sort of \"street grooming\" seen in Newcastle. \n He says factors may include sexist attitudes to women and other \"cultural baggage,\" and the large number of South Asian men working in the nocturnal economy. \n \"These young girls are invariably looking for warmth, for transport, for food, for mind-numbing substances,\" he said. \"The predators are hiding among the takeaway workers and taxi drivers.\" \n Some experts say the focus on South Asian perpetrators masks how widespread child sexual abuse is, and overlooks the fact that victims are often ignored by authorities because of their youth and troubled backgrounds. \n Helen Beckett, an expert on child sexual exploitation from the University of Bedfordshire, said focusing on one ethnic group risked missing other patterns of abuse. \n \"The emphasis that we've had on (abuse) being perpetrated by Asian males means that that is often what we are looking for, and therefore are more likely to find,\" she said. \n \"We know child sexual exploitation takes so many different forms. \" \n Since the Rochdale case shocked the nation in 2012, police and lawyers have worked hard to prosecute grooming gangs \u2014 though some police tactics have drawn criticism. A child welfare group expressed alarm at a police decision in Newcastle to pay a convicted child rapist to act as an informant. \n Steve Ashman, head of the Northumbria Police force, acknowledged that paying a convicted pedophile \"may appear repugnant,\" but said his information had been crucial to convicting the gang. \n He said police had \"thrown the kitchen sink\" at the crime of child sex abuse, deploying 50 officers for more than three years in an operation that has netted 93 convictions, including the ones this week. \n Afzal said there had been progress, but that much more needs to be done. \n \"You turn over a stone and you will find this kind of behavior pretty much everywhere in this country,\" he said. \"The demography might change but the behavior remains the same. Where there are available and vulnerable young girls, and boys, there are predators. \n \"There is no community where women and girls are safe. None.\" \n ", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Child sex convictions spark UK debate about race and abuse"}
